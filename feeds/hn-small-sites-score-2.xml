                <div>
                    <p>The short answer is yes. Let me explain.</p><p>I’ve been working with developers and designers my entire life. </p><p>I’ve built a couple of products, worked at a young startup, and I’m now at Zepel helping development teams build better software.</p><p>I’ve spoken to 1000+ development teams while at Zepel alone. <strong>And it's evident that the way we build products is broken.</strong></p><p>There’s so much disconnect between how you and I talk about building products and how our teams actually build them.</p><p>For all the talk of scrum and agile and getting feedback quickly, there’s so much that’s broken in how we act on the feedback and build the feature.</p><p>Teams spend so much time and effort getting a deeper understanding of customers’ needs. And yet distil everything down to a simple two-line ticket and a couple of lines of markdown description.</p><p>This is hurting your developers. And it’s hurting your business.</p><blockquote>Nothing is more frustrating than having to understand what an entire feature should or shouldn’t do from a two-line ticket filled with ten bullet points of acceptance criteria.</blockquote><p><em>*Here are five prioritized tickets for the upcoming sprint. We have to ship them on time!*</em></p><p>On the other hand, you have teams who are able to build top quality software. They’re the ones who can concentrate on the fine implementation details without losing focus on the broader purpose of the feature as a whole.</p><p>Everyone wants to get to that level. But instead, teams do the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>Teams think in issues and tickets, instead of the feature as a system.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="development-teams-are-not-ticket-movers-">Development teams are not ticket movers!</h2><p>Today, everything is about moving a ticket from “Todo” to “Done” as quick as possible. And watching burndown charts. And customizing the tool to the extent that the developer only views a single ticket.</p><p><em>*“What’s the velocity of our team?” is simply another way of asking how quickly can my team move an issue from “Todo” to “Done”.*</em></p><p>Pieces of that stuff are important for productivity and shipping on time.</p><p>But seriously, how is your team supposed to ship anything of value if you narrow their focus down to the smallest unit of work without any context of why it’s needed or how it connects to the whole feature?!</p><p>Overall, we’ve lost our way. Product development today has become more about checking items off a list as quickly as possible. </p><p><strong>It isn’t enough to write multiple user stories and share a Figma link if you want to ship quality software.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-software-product-teams-really-build-software-together">How software product teams really build software together</h2><p>Development teams build better software together when they have the complete context of what and why something is being built.</p><p>To achieve this, the foundational elements need to change.</p><p>And it starts with getting the right abstractions and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>The names you choose determine the perception and the quality of conversations you have. </strong>It’s why top developers spend time obsessing over names for classes, functions, and variables.</p><p>When you open up a VS Code and see a function called <code>send_signup_email</code>, you have a certain sense of what’s going to be inside and why that’s there.</p><p>The right abstractions can drive the team towards asking the right questions. And this is critical.</p><p><strong>Because when you’re tracking issues and tickets in isolation you have no choice but to measure only outputs.</strong></p><p>And teams today don’t want to measure only the outputs. They want to measure <em>outcomes</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-s-the-right-abstraction">What’s the right abstraction?</h2><p>The right abstraction is the one that prioritizes people over processes and tools. It's the one you and I use every day — it's Features.</p><p>When a squad creates a Feature and opens it, they’ll get to look at the entire feature as a unit. A user story inside it might describe a specific functionality. But the difference is, now each developer and designer know how it connects to the larger scheme of things for the entire feature.</p><blockquote>A feature forces inept managers to stop focussing on output-oriented questions like “how can we work faster”. <p>And shifts the focus on outcome-oriented questions like “why should we prioritize this feature” and “how does this feature tie to the OKR”.</p></blockquote><p>Miscellaneous tasks and incoming bugs can be tracked on a separate “List”, so high-priority bugs don't get missed out. And of course, when it comes to tracking them, they can all be tracked on a Sprint or on a Kanban Board.</p><p><strong>Feature as an abstraction is the right middle ground that lets you focus on the output as well as the outcome.</strong> It lets you zoom in and track what's happening today. It also allows you to zoom out and track a feature's progress across multiple disciplines. And it enables you to see how a feature moves from a feature request all the way to prioritization and development.</p><p>Simple issue trackers and project management tools have shoehorned teams into ticket-movers and have made them think in outputs. Metrics get feigned to show productivity. Thinking in outcomes has become ridiculously hard. And it's hurting businesses.</p><p>It's time for tools to reflect the reality of product development. It's time to remove the disconnect between development teams and what your customers really want. </p><p>It's time to stop thinking in isolated tickets and start thinking in features as a system!</p><hr><p>If you liked what you read, I think you’ll love what we have in store for you.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>June 30, 2020<!-- --> <!-- -->•<!-- --> <span>programming</span></p></header><section><p>I picked up <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring, by Martin Fowler</a>, and I am learning a lot. The book is written like a catalogue that you can refer back to later. And, for those who are seeking, <strong>the book is an excellent chance to get your code reviewed by Martin Fowler!!</strong> 😮</p>
<p>Martin starts the book with an example that he goes on to refactor in the first chapter. Sensing an insane opportunity, I stopped right away and copied this original code in Ruby. I then went ahead, wrote down my thoughts and refactored the code like I would if it was an actual thing I was working on. Once I was done, I went back to the book and compared Martin’s notes against mine, and learnt from his thought process and code. I think this is the best way to read this chapter.</p>
<p>If you are someone who enjoys this, I highly recommend you give this a try too. And if not the book, use this blog to power your review.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Psssst… You can find the full original code here: <a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/tree/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original">Github</a>)</em></strong></p>
<p>We have a Theatre Company that perform plays in events. They charge customers based on the type of the play, and also provide a “Volume Credit” for future discounts. The Company stores data about their plays (<a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/blob/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original/plays.json">plays.json</a>) and bills (<a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/blob/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original/invoices.json">invoices.json</a>) in JSON files.</p>
<p>The simple code below is used to print a bill from an invoice. This is the code we will attempt to refactor. Assume that this code is part of a much larger system and we are refactoring while adding a feature to print bills in HTML. Moreover, the Company has plans to perform more types of plays in the future.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Psssst… You can find the refactored code here: <a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/tree/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/ketanbhatt">Github</a>)</em></strong></p>
<p>Reading through the code, this is what stood out for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>statement</code> method returns a formatted text right now. I would like it to return a structured statement that I can format later as I wish, for example: for sending Slack notifications, emails. Additionally, it simplifies writing tests for this and the formatter methods.</li>
<li>The code that adds extra <code>volume_credits</code> for <code>comedy</code> plays, the comment states that we add extra credit for every “10” attendees, but the code adds a credit for every “5” attendees. Either this comment has gone stale, or there is a bug in the code. Either way, we can make the code more readable and remove the comment. (Aside: I like <a href="http://antirez.com/news/124">antirez’s blog about writing comments</a> a lot.)</li>
<li>Overall, it is difficult to understand what is going on in the code. I think we can make it more readable easily.</li>
<li>The method is doing too much, calculating <code>volume_credit</code> and <code>amount</code> for each type of play, and creating the text. It would be better if I can hand over this calculation to a different class that would do the needful, and my method just creates the text.</li>
<li>Because of this “doing too much”, the code has become messy. It will become still messier if the calculation was different for each Play too (and not same for Plays of the same type).</li>
<li>Also, looks like that the calculation is in cents and is being converted to dollars in the text. The code should make this explicit. Maybe I could rename the variable to be <code>amount_in_cents</code>?</li>
<li>The code right now assumes <code>audience</code> to be present and to be a number. Maybe we should put in validations that <code>asserts</code> for this truth? Although it seems out of scope for our current exercise.</li>
</ol>

<p>I moved the code for calculating amount and volume credits to a different class and file. I also separated the calculation for the two types of plays.</p>
<p>In the future, adding new play types will just need a new class to be added.</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code>

<span>class</span> <span>PlayTypeBaseStatementCalculator</span>
  <span>def</span> <span><span>initialize</span></span><span>(</span>play_id<span>:</span><span>,</span> audience<span>:</span><span>)</span>

  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span><span>amount</span></span>

  <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>
<br>
I also implemented the calculation in a more verbose manner. I think this improves the readability of the code.

I will call the refactoring done at this point.
<div><p>Although, I can’t seem to shake off this feeling that there is something more that can be done. I don’t think I am completely happy with the changes 😕 Let’s see what Sir Martin has to say.
</p></div>
<center>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/vA4EnqvJxDv2g/giphy.gif" alt="Excited Anticipation GIF"></p>
</center>

<p>The process that Martin followed for refactoring the original code, in his words, was:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Decomposing the original function into a set of nested functions</li>
<li>Separate calculating and printing code, the two phases.</li>
<li>Introducing a polymorphic calculator for the calculation logic.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I have learnt in this chapter, in the <strong>hypothetical scenario</strong> in which Martin Fowler does a code review of my changes, this is what he would have to say:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>“I like that you are using an intermediate structure to pass the calculation …</em></li></ol></section></article></div>

      <p>A fascinating pattern has started to emerge while growing UserLeap. </p><p>When I meet with a winning company and show them our product? Their eyes light up and they immediately get it.</p><p>The company is almost always a category leader, or quickly on its way. Often, their app is on my phone home screen. The press constantly writes about them. Customers rave about their product. Awards are the norm. Everyone knows who they are. I’m giddy just speaking with them. </p><p>But there’s no selling necessary. Budget is rarely an issue. I meet with them for 30 minutes and they move right into a trial. </p><p>The struggling companies? Their startup isn’t taking off. Growth has plateaued. The stock price is declining. Competitors are stealing customers.</p><p>When I meet with these companies it’s always a challenging conversation. They say there are other priorities. I realize it’ll be a long sales cycle. They rarely move forward. </p><p>Those winners? They’re winning because they understand their customer — and better than anyone else. Customer motivations. Inner fears. Challenges. Habits.</p><p>Their top priority is their customer. It was from day one. It's why they became successful. It’s why they’re winning today. It’s how they know they’ll continue to win—every day. UserLeap is the ideal solution that puts their customer first and drives customer-informed decision making across their company.</p><p>The struggling companies? Their customers are a priority tomorrow. Or next quarter. Or next year. Right now, something else is more important. Internal politics. A logo redesign. A press write up. An internal promotion. The next Forbes list. Our product offers little value to them. They say the budget is full. </p><p>I may never figure out how to sell to struggling companies. And that maybe that’s ok.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve been wanting to do a Show HN for my robotics developer tool <a href="https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2/">Yoga Studio</a> for a while.
But given that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it’s for programming robots</li>
  <li>you probably don’t have a compatible robot</li>
</ul>

<p>it wasn’t something you could immediately play with.</p>

<p><img src="https://yoga.dev/images/greppy1tlb_300px.jpg" width="150" height="317"></p>

<p>Now, you have <strong>remote access to a robot</strong> you can program with it! The 2-wheeled balancing robot (“Greppy”) is sitting in
our California warehouse ready to run your code. You’ll need to download and build
Yoga Studio to control it – see full instructions below.</p>

<p>When you check out the code, it includes an <code>examples/greppy</code> directory with some code to
make the robot balance and drive around. When you start the app and click “Run Live”, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connects to the robot through a port in our firewall.</li>
  <li>Acquires a lock (only one user at a time. Don’t bogart the robot!)</li>
  <li>Uploads <strong>your code</strong> to the robot (start with the example code, but you can hack it up later.)</li>
  <li>The robot compiles and runs your code</li>
  <li>The robot <strong>streams live traces</strong> of all the sensors and computations done by the code, and also a video from a camera looking at the robot.</li>
  <li>You can <strong>drive the robot</strong> with WASD.</li>
  <li>The bottom pane shows the code running, along with <strong>current values for every expression</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the code pane, numerical parameters are overlaid with gui sliders. <strong>You can drag them around and they’re immediately updated on the robot</strong>.</li>
  <li>When you’re done, hit Escape and it’ll download the high-res traces to your machine.</li>
  <li>While viewing a saved trace, you can adjust parameters and it’ll overlay a counterfactual graph of <strong>what the code would have done</strong> with the new parameters.</li>
  <li>The Yoga language is fully <strong>differentiable WRT its parameters</strong> so you can click on an output variable
 (like motor speed) and it’ll tell you what parameters you should change in which direction to affect it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>This is part of a project to make programming robots faster. My experience is that tuning the parameters of
robot control code takes 10x longer than getting the structure of the code right, so I designed a
language + IDE with a single-minded focus on solving the parameter problem. The language is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Differentiable with respect to its parameters</li>
  <li>Fast (statically typed and compiled)</li>
  <li>Purely functional (no side effects)</li>
  <li>Close enough to C for your editor’s syntax highlighting to work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The compiler extracts anything marked as a parameter into a separate data structure, with a link to the location
in the source code they came from. When the IDE renders the Yoga code, it shows the parameters as sliders.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td> Code Editor </td>
      <td> Yoga Studio </td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="https://yoga.dev/images/paramdemo_raw.png" width="331" height="123" alt="Parameters as text">
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="https://yoga.dev/images/paramdemo_yoga.gif" width="316" height="122" alt="Parameters in Yoga Studio">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Here’s what Yoga Studio looks like when controlling Greppy:</p>

<p><img src="https://yoga.dev/images/ScreenshotAnno@2x.png" width="740" height="485"></p>

<p>Feel free to hack on the code in <a href="https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2/-/tree/master/examples/greppy">examples/greppy</a>. See if you can make the robot do something cool!</p>

<p>Read more in the <a href="https://yoga.dev/yoga/">Reference Manual</a>.</p>



<p>It should work on either Mac or Linux (Recently tested on Catalina and Ubuntu 19.10 &amp; 20.04).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone <span>--recurse-submodules</span> https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2.git
<span>cd </span>yoga2
git config submodule.recurse <span>true
</span>make install.deps <span># On Mac, uses Brew. On Linux, apt-get.</span>
make <span>-j8</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now fire up the Greppy example code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bin/yogastudio examples/greppy/main.yoga
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Click “Run live on on robot greppy1”.</p>

<p>It’ll then open up the real-time scope, showing live-scrolling graphs of several variables over time. And the video will show the robot starting to balance.</p>

<p>The greppy example code lets you drive the robot from your keyboard with WASD.</p>

<p>Try going to the <code>balance.yoga</code> file, and adjusting the first 2 parameters in the RHS of the assignment to <code>accel</code>. Those are roughly the P and D parameters of the main balance feedback loop. Start with
small adjustments and work up to large ones! The robot is attached to the ceiling with a rope, so you can’t do too much damage.</p>

<p>Hit Esc to end the live session, and switch to the recorded traces it just captured.</p>

<p>You can scroll back and forth in the recorded traces by scrolling left-right with your mouse. You can add or remove traces from the graph with the checkboxes on the left.</p>

<p>While looking at recorded traces, you can still drag parameters, but now rather than updating on the live robot, they <strong>redo the entire run</strong>, overlaying the counterfactual graphs. That is, it shows what the code would have done with the new parameters given the same inputs from the hardware.</p>

<p>To start another run on the hardware, hit Cmd-L (Ctl-L on Linux).</p>

<p>When you’re happy with the parameters, click “Save params” to write them back to the source code. If you’re following the example, that’ll be in the checked out directory under examples/greppy/</p>

They also argue that widespread testing, isolating infected people, and a community lockdown effectively stopped the outbreak in its tracks.</p><p>The town of Vò, with a population of nearly 3,200 people, experienced Italy’s first COVID-19 death on 21 February 2020. The town was put into immediate quarantine for 14 days. During this time, researchers tested most of the population for infection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, both at the start of the lockdown (86 percent tested) and after two weeks (72 percent tested).</p><p>The testing revealed that at the start of the lockdown, 2.6 percent of the population (73 people) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while after a couple of weeks only 1.2 percent (29 people) were positive. At both times, around 40 percent of the positive cases showed no symptoms (asymptomatic). The results also show it took on average 9.3 days (range of 8-14 days) for the virus to be cleared from someone’s body.</p><p>None of the children under ten years old in the study tested positive for COVID-19, despite several living with infected family members. This is in contrast to adults living with infected people, who were very likely to test positive.</p><p>As a result of the mass testing any positive cases, symptomatic or not, were quarantined, slowing the spread of the disease and effectively suppressing it in only a few short weeks.</p><p>Co-lead researcher Professor Andrea Crisanti, from the Department of Molecular Medicine of the University of Padua and the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said: “Our research shows that testing of all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, provides a way to manage the spread of disease and prevent outbreaks getting out of hand. Despite ‘silent’ and widespread transmission, the disease can be controlled.”</p><p>The results of the mass testing programme in Vò informed policy in the wider Veneto Region, where all contacts of positive cases were offered testing. “This testing and tracing approach has had a tremendous impact on the course of the epidemic in Veneto compared to other Italian regions, and serves as a model for suppressing transmission and limiting the virus’ substantial public health, economic and societal burden,” added Professor Crisanti.</p><p>As well as identifying the proportion of asymptomatic cases, the team also found that asymptomatic people had a similar 'viral load’ - the total amount of virus a person has inside them - as symptomatic patients.</p><p>Viral load also appeared to decrease in people who had no symptoms to begin with but later developed symptoms, suggesting that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission could contribute significantly to the spread of disease, making testing and isolating even more important in controlling outbreaks.</p><p>Co-lead researcher Dr Ilaria Dorigatti, from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Jameel Institute (J-IDEA), at Imperial College London, said: “The Vò study demonstrates that the early identification of infection clusters and the timely isolation of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infections can suppress transmission and curb an epidemic in its early phase. This is particularly relevant today, given the current risk of new infection clusters and of a second wave of transmission.</p><p>"There are still many open questions about the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as the role of children and the contribution of asymptomatic carriers to transmission. Finding answers to these questions is crucial to identifying targeted and sustainable control strategies to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy and around the world.”</p><p>Professor Enrico Lavezzo, from the Department of Molecular Medicine at the University of Padua said: “The result concerning asymptomatic carriers is key. We took a picture of the Vò population and found that about half of the population testing positive had no symptoms at the time of testing and some of them developed symptoms in the following days. This tells us that if we find a certain number of symptomatic people testing positive, we expect the same number of asymptomatic carriers that are much more difficult to identify and isolate.</p><p>"The fact that the viral load is comparable between symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers means even asymptomatic infections have the potential to contribute to transmission, as some of the reconstructed chain of transmission obtained from the detailed contact tracing conducted in Vò confirmed.</p><p>"On the one hand, it is likely that a symptomatic infection transmits large quantities of virus, for example via coughing, but it is also reasonable to think that symptoms may induce a person with a symptomatic infection to stay at home, limiting the number of contacts and hence the transmission potential. On the other hand, someone with an asymptomatic infection is entirely unconscious of carrying the virus and, according to their lifestyle and occupation, could meet a large number of people without modifying their behaviour.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurekalert.org%2Fpub_releases%2F2020-06%2Ficl-wsr063020.php&amp;t=M2M1NjU2MjRkZjIyNmIzNTU0N2JhZTlhY2IxNDY1MzEzODllZDk4MCx2QUpQNjFOdw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F622389960556806144%2Fcovid19-asymptomatic-cases-study&amp;m=0">Imperial College London</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Suppression of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the Italian municipality of Vo’”, <i>Nature</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs41586-020-2488-1&amp;t=YjJhODJjNGNiOTM0ODVhM2FjMTE4MTBhYzAyYmMyYjYxYTNjM2I1MCx2QUpQNjFOdw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F622389960556806144%2Fcovid19-asymptomatic-cases-study&amp;m=0">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2488-1</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/615500611887235072/social-distancing-2022">New study: Social distancing could be needed until 2022</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The launch of the Hey email platform was one of the largest application launches in 2020.  It was reported that they had over 150k users signed up, so I thought it would be interesting to see what we could find about the tech stack.  Luckily <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">dhh</a> shared some good information.</p>
<h2>The HEY Stack</h2>
<p>One interesting piece of information was that someone did some investigation and <em>haystack</em> was the codename for the project and <a href="https://basecamp.com/">basecamp</a> had registered <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1231253948415135746">haystack.com</a> also.</p>
<p>It’s no suprise that this is a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> app since dhh is the creator of rails.  They are using <a href="https://stimulusjs.org/">Stimulus</a> as the javascript framework, <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">turbolinks</a> to speed up page loads, <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/trix">trix</a> for the editor and as yet unspecified <strong>NEW MAGIC</strong> on the front end.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> for the database, plus <a href="https://vitess.io/">Vitess</a> for DB sharding.  <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> for caching and short lived data. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">ElasticSearch</a> for searching and all on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> running on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>.  He doesn’t specify if they are running their own kubernetes cluster or using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">EKS</a></p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_20.58.01.png" alt="Hey"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.18.05.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>The overall architecture uses what he calls the <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/">Majestic Monolith</a> pattern, which is the opposite of the micro services oriented architecture.</p>
<p>After reading several of his tweets it seems to me that the architecture is really more of a <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-can-become-the-citadel/">Citadel</a>, which is also something he labeled.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.28.51.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>They use <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> for source control and code review, but <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> for issue tracking and documentation.  This is no suprise since the Rails community was an early adopter of github.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.20.52.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>His comments on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">GCP</a> were very interesting, obviously a bad experience but doesn’t give more details around when this happened.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.21.45.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>For email processing it’s just standard <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> so nothing special there, but that’s the theme stick with battle tested technology.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.24.03.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>Why MySQL over Postgresql?  He made another comment, I didn’t capture that he is just used to MySQL.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.24.32.png" alt="Hey"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.20.31.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>They practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Dry</a> principles and extract out common code.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.26.47.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>After the battle they got in trying to release the update to their iPhone app, not being a fan of Big Tech is to be expected.  They want to bring things on prem in the future, but was happy to have the cloud scaling during the launch.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.27.13.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>The On-Prem costs he calculates are much smaller than the cloud.  This is a huge point of contention and is debated in many circles, for small companies it may be easy to calculate on-prim costs but for large companies there are so many hidden costs it’s hard to say.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.15.43.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>He’s a big fan of Kubernetes, and I agree with him! Kubernetes is one of the few pieces of infrastructure code I’ve ran that lives up to the hype.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.29.22.png" alt="Hey"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hiredboss_bucket/blog/hey/CleanShot_2020-06-25_at_21.27.37.png" alt="Hey"></p><p>The trend towards <a href="https://twitter.com/sstephenson/status/1272608117604397063">HTML over the wire</a> instead of JSON apis is something to watch over the next couple of years.  With <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">Phoenix Liveview</a> and <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Laravel Livewire</a> gaining in popularity, I would not be suprised if the secret sauce is some type of DOM diffing on the server for Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/XBN5MO">Fathom Analytics</a> to track users on every website and landing page I build.</p>
<p>Unlike Google Analytics, it's not free. I also get far less data from Fathom.</p>
<p>I happily pay $14/month for less data.</p>
<p>Fathom Analytics is far more simple. I don't get distracted by going down rabbit holes looking for "insights" or vanity metrics. I also don't invade my readers' privacy with cross-site tracking or cookies.</p>
<p>The interface itself can be understood in a single glance. Once I look at my metrics, I move on with my day to create more content. Knowing where my users came from and how long they stayed is more than enough data to understand my audience. </p>
<p>Data overload isn't valuable. It's overwhelming and distracting.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple interface</li>
<li>Beautiful design</li>
<li>Easy to setup</li>
<li>Simple goal tracking</li>
<li>Privacy focused</li>
<li>No cookie popups required</li>
<li>Multiple sites on one account/subscription</li>
<li><a href="https://usefathom.com/blog/google-analytics-seo">Doesn't mess with SEO</a></li>

I recently came across Andrew Kensler's fascinating <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/">Business Card Raytracer</a>. His code, in just 1337 bytes, generates a full raytraced image complete with depth of field, reflections, a sky gradient, and a textured floor. In a similar vein, I set out to create a full neural network that could fit on the back of a business card. The code below is the result, creating a 3-layer fully-connected neural network with leaky-relu activations and training it to generate a small image of my name.

You can view the output here by clicking the play button. (I hate to admit it's not actually running the code in the browser :P, but you'll see the same or similar output if you run the code yourself).
</p>



<p>
The code is only 878 characters, and (as mentioned previously) creates and trains a small neural network. I'm sure it's possible to make it shorter still, but I was happy enough to get this far! I think making it any shorter would make it impossible to reason about, now at least new layers can be added or removed easily and the forward/back propagation is pretty neat! (I'm not biased I swear).
</p>

<p>
Here's a small breakdown of how it works.

Define simple imports and typedefs. The two floats define constants used for the 'leak' of leaky relu, (I.e. the \(K\) in \(f(x) = max(Kx, x)\)), and the learning rate.

Start of the layer struct <code>L</code>. The constructor takes the input and output sizes, and initializes a weights matrix in an approximation of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/weight-initialization-in-neural-networks-a-journey-from-the-basics-to-kaiming-954fb9b47c79">Xavier Initilization</a>. Ideally, the random variable would be normally distributed, but linearly seems to work decently too!

Two functions for the layer struct. <code>F</code> performs forward propagation, taking the input vector and returning the output. Some values are cached for later. <code>B</code> performs backward propagation, taking the derivative of the output, updating the weights matrix, and returning the derivative of the input. Both are using leaky relu.

Start of main, create a 3 layer network. The network takes 40 values for input, and has two hidden layers with 50 nodes each, and returns single value at the end. The input is based on the x,y coordinate currently predicted, and the output is a single value for whether this pixel should be a space or '#'. At the end we open the training loop, which runs for 500336 iterations, which is a multiple of the output size; 243.

From the output of the network, <code>y</code>, calculate \(\frac{dE}{dy}\). We use mean squared error, so the derivative is just \(2(y-\hat{y})\), where \(\hat{y}\) is the target value and is encoded in a string. When written with non-ascii characters this is a lot shorter.

Output: Choose different chars based on how high/low the value predicted is. Then print special characters if we're at the end of a line (<code>i%27==0</code>) or we've done a full epoch (<code>i%243==0</code>). Finally, when we're finished, <code>i==0</code> and we print the end text.

Thanks for reading! I'd love to hear suggestions on how to make it shorter, or any other ideas.

		<p>We started Repl.it to break down what we thought of as needless barriers to start coding. Naturally, our first product was the repl -- a simple editor and console for evaluating code. Turns out that’s all our users needed to learn enough coding to make meaningful programs. From there, Repl.it started to grow incredibly fast among students, developers, and educators. As we watched what our most active users did with the platform, a pattern emerged around coding in the classroom: teachers would prepare a doc or a PDF with instructions and a base repl for their students to fork. Students then would open the PDF side-by-side with the repl and start coding. When finished, they would copy the link and email it back to their teachers. Finally, teachers would block off an afternoon to evaluate and give feedback on their students’ code. The process, while better than using a local IDE and passing around files, seemed tedious and we wanted to solve it -- that’s how <a href="https://repl.it/classroom">Repl.it Classroom</a> emerged.</p>
<p>Repl.it Classroom digitized and streamlined the workflow teachers already had in the classroom. However, although teachers loved the experience and Classroom began to grow a slight tension emerged: Classroom used a custom environment which was hard to evolve in tandem with the repl environment. Right now repls are so far ahead in terms of IDE and runtime features that it makes more sense to consolidate and build our education platform on top of repls. Especially with the introduction of Multiplayer, we’ve seen teachers use both -- Classroom for small assignments and repls for projects. This works okay but the experience feels disjointed and hard to manage. That’s why today we’re excited to introduce Repl.it Teams, specifically Repl.it Teams for education which is jam-packed with features that will make teaching and collaborating on Repl.it nothing short of a seamless and amazing experience. </p>
<p><em>We believe that by propelling coding out of the old world of IDE setup and emailing code files, Repl.it Teams will be seen as the most significant innovation in CS and programming education.</em></p>
<p>In this post, we’ll go over what upgrading to Teams for education will get you, some details on pricing, and release timeline and roadmap.</p>
<h2 id="multiplayer-by-default">Multiplayer by default</h2>
<p>Multiplayer is the fastest growing feature on Replit. Teachers and students who already use Google Docs will instantly see how game-changing this is for coding. Especially now, with the rise of distance learning, it’s more important than ever to have a real-time collaboration system. </p>
<p>Where this gets really interesting with Teams is that repls created in the team are multiplayer by default, which means teachers can “drop-in” into the student repl and see what student(s) are working on and provide direction in real-time. Imagine teachers walking around the class looking at students coding and providing feedback behind their shoulders, but all virtually. We even took it a step further so that teachers have access to their students’ entire codebase and have the ability to run their code or fork it if they need to.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.repl.it/assets/typing.gif" alt="multiplayer"></p>
<p>Upgrading to Teams will give you a sense of presence over your classroom and will make collaboration a breeze. </p>

<p>Right now in Classroom assignments are a flat list which gives very little in the way of organizing your course into units. With Teams, you’ll be able to create as many folders in your shared Team as you need to. You can also easily create your own private folders and repls and move repls into the shared team folder as needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/folders.png" alt="folders"></p>
<h2 id="conversations-around-code">Conversations around code</h2>
<p>One of the coolest things that Repl.it classrooms introduced to the teacher workflow is the assignment-submission workflow along with the notifications you get when your students submit an assignment. </p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So glad I made the jump to <a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@replit</a> for Higher computing. Young folk seem engaged, and I'm getting far too excited every time an assignment notification comes in 😄</p>— Fraser McKay (@mrmckaycomp) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmckaycomp/status/1271426729358381057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>We’re looking to go even further with Teams. We want to build a new way to have conversations around code. Comments on code should not be disembodied (like they are in the classroom). They should be contextual, and you should be able to easily mention your student, TA, or collaborator. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/mention.png" alt="mentions"></p>
<p>This is still in early development, but once it lands, upgrading to Team will give you the ability to give contextual feedback on code. </p>
<h2 id="code-centered-discussion-boards">Code-centered discussion boards</h2>
<p><a href="https://repl.it/talk">Repl Talk</a>, our code-centered forum, started out when we noticed our users wanted to help each other by answering questions, sharing programs, and finding mentors and collaborators. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/qa.png" alt="qa"></p>
<p>Teams will ship with its own discussion board instance private for you and your students for Q&amp;A, sharing, and discussion. </p>
<h2 id="expanded-language-support">Expanded language support</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that Classroom includes only a subset of the <a href="https://repl.it/languages">languages</a> that we support, and that’s because it takes a lot of effort to integrate a language into a bespoke environment. However, the Repl.it IDE is generic enough that languages are much easier to add. And even if we don’t support your favorite language, you’ll likely be able to get it working on our base bash repl--many of our users have done before. </p>
<p>Additionally, the repl text editor is based on VSCode’s Monaco which ships a lot of useful editing shortcuts, better syntax highlighting support, and, for some selection of languages, advanced <a href="https://blog.repl.it/intel">code intellisense</a>. </p>
<p>On top of that, you'll get access to the ever-increasing selection of <a href="https://repl.it/templates">starter templates</a> -- from frameworks like Rails and Django to personal blogs and bots.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.repl.it/assets/templates.png" alt="languages"></p>
<p>In short, upgrading to Repl.it Teams will net you a 2x+ increase in language &amp; template selection and a much smoother editing experience.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-support">Mobile support</h2>
<p>When the pandemic hit and students around the world were forced to stay in and learn from home, we were saddened to hear that many students lost access to desktop computers. Luckily they had access to smartphones, and while mobile support wasn’t the best on Repl.it we worked really hard to improve it. It’s now so easy to code from your phone that you can code and spin up a website all from your phone’s web browser. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.repl.it/mobile"><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/mobile/preview.png" alt="mobile"></a></p>
<p>This is only the start. We’ll continue to invest in mobile coding because making programming more accessible is a core part of our mission. Upgrading to Teams will allow your students to code on the go, and, for those less fortunate who don’t have a computer at home, they will be able to continue learning uninterrupted.</p>
<h2 id="native-graphics">Native Graphics</h2>
<p>As coding moves to the cloud, we risk losing some of what makes programming special. As much as we like web programming, it’s not always the easiest to teach or learn. Graphics and game frameworks like <a href="https://repl.it/languages/pygame">PyGame</a> or <a href="https://repl.it/languages/love2d">LOVE2D</a> make making games a joy. That’s why Repl.it not only supports popular game frameworks but also anything that would want to render to native graphics drivers like Python’s <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/python-plots">matplotlib</a>.</p>

<p>Once you upgrade to Teams we bet it would be a lot of fun to build games with your students, teach them plotting, and overall engage in some of the most fun aspects of programming.</p>
<h2 id="team-profile">Team profile</h2>
<p>It's always cool to show off that you belong to one team or another, that's why you'll get to have a Team Profile complete with an avatar and "pinned" repls. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/profile.png" alt="qa"></p>
<p>Teachers and students under the team will also get a nice profile icon that shows affiliation with the team!</p>
<h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>
<p>GitHub being the world’s largest code repository hosting, we made it so that you can bring in any repo, configure it, and run it in under a minute without leaving your browser.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2fZ_B6juNc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p> Not only does Repl.it integrates with Github very well, but we also partnered with the fine folks at GitHub education to make learning to code a breeze with Repl.it + GitHub Classroom. Read more <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-26-code-in-the-browser-with-github-classroom/">about it here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/github-classroom/demo.gif" alt="GitHub Integration with Repl.it"></p>
<p>In addition to code-hosting, <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a> provides auto-grading functionality (similar to Repl.it Classroom) and makes it easy to manage your classroom and assignments.</p>

<p>So now that we’ve walked you through some of the benefits of Teams, let’s talk about what this means for the Classroom product. <strong>First, if you currently depend on the Classroom, don’t worry, we’d never take it away or deprecate before a) giving you ample time to move off, and b) making it easy to upgrade to Teams</strong>. We are, though, building Teams to be a superior experience and a superset of what Classroom currently provides.</p>
<p>If you’re new to Repl.it, or about to introduce it for the first time to your classroom then we suggest you start out with the Teams product, and where it’s lacking -- the biggest thing would be auto-grading and learning management -- supplement it with a combination of <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a>, or your own LMS like Google Classroom. </p>

<p>It’s our goal to get Repl.it into the hands of every code learner in the world. We really believe there’s not a better tool for teaching or learning to code. </p>
<p>First, if you currently depend on the Classroom, don’t worry, we’ll never take it away or deprecate it before a) giving you ample time to move off, and b) making it easy to upgrade to Teams. So if you're an existing Repl.it Classroom subscriber (free or paid), this doesn't change anything for you. Any new customers will have to subscribe to teams in order to get access to Classroom.</p>
<p>So that all said, in order to make it easy and so you don’t have to worry about how many students will be in your class from semester to semester, we’ve simplified our pricing for educational institutions with an affordable flat rate. And it's cheaper!</p>
<p><strong>Pricing tiers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Single-classroom teachers (up to 50 students): <strong>$20/month</strong></li>
<li>College professors (up to 250 students): <strong>$50/month</strong></li>
<li>Schools and departments (unlimited students): <strong>$100/month</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And if you’re used to having to get annual budget approval or pausing your edtech subscriptions over the summer, we’ll give you two months off for an annual plan.</p>
<ul>

								<p>It’s been over a year since I first started building my car computer with the Raspberry Pi. In the time since, it’s traveled over 15000km through four Australian states. The majority of the distance has been on dirt roads and tracks, pushing the hardware to its limits.</p>
<p>As a whole the car computer has performed great, but after time on the road. There are some changes and fixes that I would make if I was starting again. Along with a rough road map for planned future functionality.</p>
<div id="attachment_1342"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1342" src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mt_number_3.jpg" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mt_number_3.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mt_number_3-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1342">The Raspberry Pi Car Computer has suffered a lot of torment getting shaken violently on rough tracks around the country.</p></div>
<p><strong>A New Screen</strong></p>
<p>Before we even set off on the trip, I managed to damage the touchscreen! Eventually the computer is going to be mounted permanently in the center console of the car but for ease of patching,testing and development etc it has just been tied up to the grab bar on the passenger side.</p>
<p>Early one morning, when putting it back into the car I, didn’t realise the computer was in a bag that I handled a little roughly and some of the glass on the side of the touchscreen got broken off (pic).</p>
<p>Financial and time limitations before our departure date meant that the screen could not be replaced. In its defense, it still worked for the most part.</p>
<p>Overtime, the touch functionality started to stop working in the lower half of the screen though.<br>
<img src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/broken_screen.jpg" width="500" height="357" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/broken_screen.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/broken_screen-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><br>
The plan was to live with it and replace the screen when I finally mounted it in the car for good. But, as more time passed, the slightest vibration would have the cursor randomly moving around clicking things.</p>
<p>The random playing, stopping and starting of songs was starting to get to me! The system was becoming unusable so I paid the money and got a brand new Raspberry Pi touchscreen delivered.<br>
<img src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_screen.jpg" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_screen.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_screen-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><br>
The original display was purchased a few days after release, so it had the v1.0 display controller. The new unit has a v1.1 controller board, so the backlight brightness can be controlled from the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Even using “night mode” having the display backlight at full power causes a lot of glare in the cabin at night. So functionality to control the screen brightness will be added to the Car Computer settings pages as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Power Connections</strong></p>
<p>The power coming into the computer travels from a connector to a voltage converter, which then provides power to the USB hub and the Pi. The wire connections are a source of pain, dirt roads in the outback are commonly heavily corrugated from water. Driving across them literally shakes your car apart. Terminal connectors holding the wiring together need periodic tightening, otherwise the car computer randomly turns off and on as the wires gets shaken around.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be an issue for a car that never leaves tar roads. But if any off road travel is planned, crimp or soldering the wires together as best as you can or the vibration will play havoc with the system.</p>
<p><strong>Hard Drive </strong></p>
<p>Setting out, I thought car vibration may cause issues with a normal 3.5 inch notebook hard drive. But due to the cost of larger solid state hard drives I decided to risk it anyhow.</p>
<p>So I am glad to say, the hard drive has up till this point, no issues whatsoever. If money was no object, I would choose an SSD, given the lower power consumption. But the notebook drive has performed well enough and given the 1TB storage size offers, a huge amount of storage for little cost.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p>
<p>Originally a Huawei K3715 3G Dongle was used for Internet connectivity on the road. But in the days of 4G mobile networks it was slow, reception was never great and seemed to also draw a lot of power.</p>
<p>So I purchased a <a href="https://www.development-cycle.com/2017/04/zte-mf832-inside/">Telstra Branded ZTE MF823 4G LTE dongle</a> for $39 from an Australia Post outlet. It has sockets for two external antennas allowing me to use an Axis CLR8 7-9db external 4G antenna mounted on the bull bar for improved network reception.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4g_aerial.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4g_aerial.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4g_aerial-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Another added benefit from the upgrade was system simplification. Originally I was using the sakis3g script to control the mobile network connection. The <a href="https://www.development-cycle.com/2017/04/zte-mf823-inside/">ZTE MF823 has a different architecture though</a>, rather than being a standard mobile dongle. It also houses a small embedded Linux system that appears on the host system as a standard ethernet adapter. The embedded system manages the connection so the sakis3g script is no longer needed.</p>
<p><strong>UI Design</strong></p>
<p>The layout of a user interface hugely important to the usability application but for the most part it’s not something that most of us think that much about. Most of the changes to the system while on the road have been changes to the layout of the application to try and minimise the amount of input required from the user.</p>
<p>A perfect example is <a href="https://github.com/anthony-mills/raspberrypi-carputer/commit/87002930938cabfa8a60f673bb1c1535360d8d69">commit 8700293</a>, automatically starting the playback of a play list when loaded, if music is not already playing. Before this change, a user would have to select the play list they wanted, navigate back to the homepage and then select the “Play Queue” option from the main menu. It’s only two more taps, which may not seem like a great deal but when off road the car is jumping around on an unstable and unpredictable surface, so aiming and landing a tap in the right area of the screen can be an extremely frustrating pain in the arse.</p>
<p>So the new approach to the code base is going to be ‘interaction minimisation’. Anything music related that can be handled with less input from the user, is going to simplified as far as it can. Most of the time in the car you just want some music; it’s not something I want to get frustrated at, because I cannot get something working while bouncing around.</p>
<p><strong>Future Direction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The trip meter and trip mapping functions still suck. This functionality in theory should be easy:&nbsp; collect some data points, calculate the distance between then and plot the data on to a map. In the real world, it’s not so cut and dry though. Extensive road testing has at least given me more trip data and I am to use this to sort out the bugs that seem to keep popping up in this part of the application.</li>
<li>Backlight brightness control: as mentioned earlier in the post, the official 7inch Raspberry Pi touchscreen v1.1 and above allows the user to control the display brightness. This will be controllable from the settings screen and will help reduce glare in the cab at night.</li>
<li>A down loadable image file, building the system from scratch is all well and good but its time consuming. Over the next couple of months, I am going to try to create a small (few gigabytes tops) image file that can be written on to a SD Card, and the put into a Raspberry Pi to get a user up and running as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Longer term, the application has been built using Ionic Framework 1.x which has now been deprecated. So I need to investigate the work required to bring the application up to date with the latest releases.</li>

<p><span><em>This is an ongoing development series about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/chaotic-era">CHAOTIC ERA</a>, an interstellar strategy game. <strong><a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/subscribe">Join the beta waitlist here</a></strong> or&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/chaotic_era" aria-describedby="a11y-external-message"><strong>follow us on Twitter</strong></a>&nbsp;for the latest updates.</em></span></p>
<p><span>It’s often said that the meaning of a piece of art comes after it’s been made—the audience assigns their own ideas and emotions to it; they see trends and patterns that not even the original artist was aware of.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Just as in painting or sculpture or songwriting, the same principles apply to the art form of game design. Whatever a developer has in their head when they’re creating a game is only half the equation. The art direction, the gameplay, the end goal they have in mind… while these are important factors, ultimately there will also be inspiration beneath the surface, deep within their subconscious, that find their way into a game whether they’re aware of it or not.</span></p>
<p><span>This has definitely been the case for <a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/chaotic-era">Chaotic Era</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>When we first started work on the game years ago, we had a vague notion of what the final product should look like. We wanted to build a strategy game on an epic scale; one that would take place across an entire universe.</span></p>
<p><span>We wanted to capture the mystique and vastness and excitement of games like No Man’s Sky and Elite Dangerous while working in ideas from our favourite sci-fi classics.</span></p>
<p><span>And in our first phase of development, where we mostly focused on navigation UI and worldbuilding, those influences couldn’t be more clear.</span></p>
<p><span>Our minimal FUI design combined our love for the retrofuture of Blade Runner and Alien, with the modern interfaces of fighter jets and helicopters. The AI-worshipping interstellar universe dominated by shadowy corporations drew from a wide range of sources like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Battletech, and Dune.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0110/1938/6902/files/spinners-ENVIRON-CTR_1024x1024.gif?v=1593361746"></span></p>
<p><span><em>Image via <a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/">www.scifiinterfaces.com</a></em><br></span></p>
<p><span>But once we started getting into the nuts and bolts of the game—the actual gameplay and game rules—we started making our way down a rabbit hole with little idea of where we might end up.</span></p>
<p><span>Each exploration started to take on a life of its own as we began adding components that felt like they made sense.</span></p>
<p><span>How would you build new ships? Well, I guess we need worker units. Where do worker units come from? Well, I guess we need building units that house workers. And those workers require population and energy to produce. And energy comes from reservoirs you discover, and harvest with those same workers.</span></p>
<p><span>And so on it went, until we came to our current point in time: with a fleshed out game experience whose influences surprised us.</span></p>
<p><span>Once we were able to look back on what we built, we quickly began to retrospectively see patterns that we weren’t even aware of.</span></p>
<p><span>Our isometric grid, world planning, and disasters? We realized those were pulled out of ninth grade memories spent beating Sim City 2000 in computer labs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Worker units created by factories, sent to harvest resources, and used to construct new buildings? Hours sank into Starcraft were surfacing in unexpected ways.</span></p>
<p><span>Without even realizing, but thankfully so, we were building a strategy game that was subconsciously heavily influenced by some of our favourite RTS trailblazers: Sim City 2000, Starcraft, Command &amp; Conquer, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0110/1938/6902/files/71104_screenhi_930x524_en_US_01___2014-04-01-11-01-16_088f82de4701f05aa0a16904261a1f3be30ae43b_grande.jpg?v=1593361854"></span></p>
<p><span>Each planet in Chaotic Era is like its own Sim City or Starcraft match; the main difference being here that as you expand your empire, you’ll find yourself balancing many matches at once. And those matches will suddenly have complex interdependencies and domino effects based on the decisions you make, or don’t make.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The interesting thing is that I feel like if we had intentionally set out to create a game that emulates these classics of the genre, then we would’ve ended up with an end product much flatter and less exciting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By chasing a notion of what we wanted to build—looking at the world and feelings we were trying to evoke—we let our minds pull together these influences without even realizing, ultimately creating something that we’re incredibly proud of (and constantly surprised by). We weren’t forcing building blocks together, instead we were chipping away at marble and uncovering the hidden forms underneath the surface.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, it’s been a while since our last progress update, so I wanted to cover a few things along the lines of how early real time strategy games have been driving our recent game design.</span></p>
<h2><b>Changes in visual direction for planets</b></h2>
<p><span>At lower levels of elevation, the camera aligns to an isometric, 45º point of view, allowing the player to see a different level of detail than when zoomed out. As well, a subtle "ground" texture has been added to suggest terrain, populated by perlin noise.</span></p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><span>A dust effect was explored as well, inspired by the ground conditions of a comet captured by a European probe:</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b026c4244e490af668e696bf39a125d5dc5e2120/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e6d6f732e636d732e66757475726563646e2e6e65742f765668414d536d38774d715a345a4c716978767368432d313032342d38302e676966" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80933480-e9c50900-8d91-11ea-8157-2b1f59fa1251.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>Outline shaders were explored but ultimately dropped due to difficulty required to achieve a certain level of quality, but also additional visual noise that would be introduced. The shader will be re-examined when there's an opportunity to display models in higher levels of detail (ie. a "unit details" view)</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80932750-e3815d80-8d8e-11ea-9e25-8029bd3a9bf2.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<h2><b>Garage tiles</b></h2>
<p><span>Introduces a finite grid to the garage which consists of tiles that are owned by the player, not owned but purchasable, not purchasable and not owned, and unknown. The majority of the "board" consists of unknown tiles, acting as a fog of war mechanic. Tiles that are unowned but purchasable are represented by a single dot and when tapped, are purchased for a fixed price immediately.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80932925-8cc85380-8d8f-11ea-8c33-5c44c285691c.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The previous set of rules dictating validity of a unit's position have been adjusted too, now discriminating against a few more rules than before, such as whether or not a tile is unowned, non-purchasable, or of an unknown state.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80933612-7ff92f00-8d92-11ea-8525-028ca760aeb7.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<h2><b>Workers</b></h2>
<p><span>A new Unit class and mechanic has been introduced, </span><span>TileUnit</span><span> and </span><span>Tile</span><span> respectively. </span><span>TileUnits</span><span> can be purchased in the same way </span><span>ShipUnits</span><span> can be purchased, and placed in the garage in the same way too. The only difference is </span><span>TileUnits</span><span> can produce </span><span>Workers</span><span> which are required for performing various functions, starting with terraforming the surface of a single body so additional units can be placed. This is all in the vein of making energy and population generation/consumption more transparent, where there will eventually be a unit for generating energy and population, and population will be literally countable by the number of worker units in a single garage.</span></p>
<p><span>This work began with exploring how to subdivide a 2D cell into n subdivisions, and creating connected pathways across the lengths of the cell for workers to travel across.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935377-11d7cb80-a787-11ea-8830-a29d29d24d51.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The step after this was investigating how to fill available space around the paths with as large shapes as possible in order to fill them with decorative elements such as tents and satellites.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935379-18fed980-a787-11ea-9da6-7db9d2276ff8.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>From here, it was a matter of figuring out a way to place assets in these available spaces.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935407-55323a00-a787-11ea-8a1e-f210ca71be6f.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>Work was then done to ensure entrances were calculated by neighbouring entrances to ensure seamlessness of interlocking tiles.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935428-8448ab80-a787-11ea-8215-a56dcb77b5d7.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The final result was actually inserting worker units and their assets and having them follow these paths towards assigned targets.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935451-b0642c80-a787-11ea-9d9c-3a2618e3fb11.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>This involved a new Job-Worker design which now gets encoded to save files. The user creates jobs by performing an action like clicking an available cell, and a new </span><span>Foreman</span><span> class takes inventory of "idle" workers, dynamically assigning workers closest to the job location, or reassigning assigned workers by pulling them off a job they are already stationed at.</span></p>
<p><span>This design will need to continue evolving over the next few months to fill in functionality gaps, such as the ability to move and perform work while the game is closed. This and many more aspects will be refined as unknowns are uncovered.</span></p>

	<p>How have you spent your time in lockdown? Well, if you're anything like me, you've been drowning yourself in work and side projects to get through the long lockdown months. It's been glorious, I work in the morning, then geek out on side projects all afternoon. I'm at peak productivity, and have completed so many <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects" target="_blank">projects</a> whilst the world has been falling apart.</p>

	<p>Last week though, things started to go very wrong.</p>

	<p>Monday rolled around, and I was excited for a new week of building things. However, by the end of the day, I'd managed to tick only half of the items off my to-do list. The next day my productivity plummeted even more. My focus had gone, and my work output was tiny.</p>
	
	<p>So, on Wednesday, after a work call in the morning, I headed off to the beach for a relaxing day off. I knew I'd come back feeling refreshed and super productive the day after.</p>

	<p>It didn't work though, Thursday was even worse. I sat at my laptop all day and probably achieved 1 hour of useful output. Worse, I was beating myself up because my day off had done nothing.</p>

	<p>I had reached what I now call <b>lockdown burnout</b>. Maybe you've experienced this too. After 3 months of creating, building and coding during lockdown, something inside me had broken. I felt absolutely fine, I wanted to build, but I simply could work no more.</p>

	<p>A single day off was not going to fix lockdown burnout. Instead, I took 3 days of pure rest: BBQ's, video games, reading, and even some camping. Not a single line of code was written.</p>

	<p>Monday once again arrived, but this time things were different: I ended up having one of the most productive days of my life. One hour of work probably had the same productive output as 5 hours of "work" before my lockdown burnout. I'd gained superpowers.</p>

	<p>Lockdown is a creator's dream. Its the ultimate excuse to stay indoors and build things all day. On the flip side, it can be really hard to know when to stop building when there's no end in sight. Programmers are hardwired to build and problem solve. We literally keep going at something until its done, even when you're not actually "doing" much.</p>

	<p>Taking a break to get more done can seem so counterintuitive, but it really works. I'm not talking about the odd day off, but several long, uninterrupted days of deep rest to fully recharge.</p>

	<p>If you've forgotten to stop the past few months, take a break.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/lawn-chair-curbside-sign.png"></p><p>As states have introduced restrictions in response to the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, most restaurant and retail organizations have worked quickly to shift operations to phone/online ordering and curbside pickup. While curbside pickup has reduced the number of in-person interactions required, each companys' implementation and success has been wildly different. Restaurants built on years of takeout/delivery experience are thriving while some sit-down restaurants and retail stores are struggling to adapt.</p> <p>Let's talk, with a smattering of snark and candor, about some of the curbside pickup experiences I've seen in the wild, where they fall short, and how they can be better.</p> <h2 id="what-do-customers-want"><a href="#what-do-customers-want">#</a> What do customers want?</h2> <p>I want to arrive, let you know I'm here, and get my order. That's it. No muss, no fuss.</p> <p>This is surprisingly difficult to find. Let's dive into some of the major pain points.</p> <h3 id="don-t-force-me-to-go-inside-your-establishment"><a href="#don-t-force-me-to-go-inside-your-establishment">#</a> Don't force me to go inside your establishment</h3> <p>We aren't all wearing holsters strapped with lysol cans looking for germs to spray. If you aren't enforcing <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social distancing guidelines</a> and promoting customer/employee safety in public, I don't have high confidence you're doing so behind closed doors.</p> <blockquote><p>Customers are unlikely to return if they feel required to sanitize all goods purchased from your business.</p></blockquote> <p>We know your top priority is keeping your staff healthy and your building clean so it can stay open. In addition to the impact on sick employees and their families, you're facing a quarantine, deep cleaning, and sanitization. This is a huge expenditure and loss of revenue that lasts beyond reopening day. No one is champing at the bit to patronize a business immediately after a reported COVID-19 outbreak.</p> <p>Even if your state is re-opening, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported cases</a> continue to rise. This isn't going away anytime soon.</p> <p>Limit exposure to limit business risk.</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of forcing me to go inside, make me wait outside of the building, in my car, or outdoors. I don't need to be breathing on you or another customer's food.</p> <h3 id="don-t-make-me-install-an-app"><a href="#don-t-make-me-install-an-app">#</a> Don't make me install an app</h3> <p>I know, I know. You've got an app. You want to send me push notifications with the latest deals. Bump those engagement metrics, I get it.</p> <blockquote><p>Not all customers want to be part of your loyalty program.</p></blockquote> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/office-depot-curbside-sign.png" width="55%"></p><p>The app might be a worthwhile experience once I have it, but think about how this plays out for those who don't. We’re expecting a quick interaction and pickup and this isn’t it.</p> <p>I pull into the parking lot to pick up my order of Sriracha, Lucky Charms, and toilet paper. Before I can get my order I have to wait to download your app, accept permissions, and sign up for an account. Do I already have an account? What is my password? I have to do all of this just to let you know that I’m here to pick up my order. Too many hoops that take too long.</p> <p>What is the market penetration for your app amongst your customer base? What percentage of those customers without the app will purchase for curbside pickup? These are all of the customers that are negatively impacted by this process.</p> <blockquote><p>"I should receive my order and leave in less time than it takes me to download your app."</p></blockquote>  <p>Consumer of goods and services</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of an app, why not a website? I don't have to download it and it's accessible by every smartphone on the planet. Make it available via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QR code</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFC tag</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short url</a>. Heck, include it in my receipt. Viewing a website and providing my information is infinitely (math checks out) faster than installing an app.</p> <h3 id="do-not-make-me-wait-on-hold"><a href="#do-not-make-me-wait-on-hold">#</a> Do not make me wait on hold</h3> <p>You only have one phone line that you're using for curbside pickup calls and taking new orders. Not great.</p> <p>Einstein wrote a paper in 1905 positing that <code>flavor = time * salt / moisture ^ 2</code>. Once it enters that clamshell, takeout food has a shelf life of around four seconds. The longer I have to wait to notify you that I'm waiting decreases the quality of the food exponentially. Soggy burger buns make me question returning to your restaurant and humanity in general.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/red-robin-curbside-sign.png" width="30%"></p><blockquote><p>Help me help you.</p></blockquote> <p>Don't make me block your phone line from taking new orders while I tell you that I'm in parking spot #4 driving a Pontiac Fiero and would like extra ketchup. How many potential customers call back a restaurant to make an order if the line is busy? How many potential food orders are <em>you</em> losing?</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of waiting on hold, I'd rather do <strong>anything</strong> else. Do you have a business line with multiple numbers? Use a different one to separate orders and pickups. Use different phone extensions. Use anything other than the phone for pickups if it's going to be in contention!</p> <h3 id="don-t-ask-for-redundant-information"><a href="#don-t-ask-for-redundant-information">#</a> Don't ask for redundant information</h3> <p>Why do you need my name <em>and</em> order ID? Why aren't your order IDs unique? A description of my car? I just gave you the reserved pickup parking spot number I'm in.</p> <p>I'm wearing a hat. Does that help?</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/restaurant-touch-app.png" width="35%"></p><p>I made a curbside pickup at a big box electronics company recently. I filled out the required online check in form upon arrival. A worker came to my car, asked me if I had filled out the form and then proceeded to ask me for the <em>same exact information</em> that I had already provided.</p> <blockquote><p>Don't ask for three pieces of information when one will suffice and sure as heck don’t ask twice!</p></blockquote> <p>Dr. Seuss</p> <p>Ambassador of curbside pickup, Whoville.</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of asking for more, change your workflow to ask for less. To complete a curbside pickup, you only need information for the following:</p> <ul><li>Uniquely identify an order</li> <li>Identify my current physical location</li></ul> <p>Leverage technology for this.</p> <p>Provide customers unique order identifiers in their email receipts that can be easily referenced. Identify your reserved curbside pickup spaces with separate phone extensions or unique QR codes. Customers notifying you that they are waiting will automatically have location context provided. Are they in parking spot #3? Are they at the side door? That's another piece of information you don't have to ask for and they don't have to think about.</p>  <p>With all that said, I am biased. I have a <s>dog</s> soggy bun in this fight. I built <a href="https://routegy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Routegy</a> to create wonderful customer experiences within physical spaces and since the COVID-19 pandemic, people have started leveraging it to improve their own curbside pickup experiences.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/orenji-curbside-sign.png" width="50%"></p><p>With <a href="https://routegy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Routegy</a>, you can create signage outside of your establishment with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QR codes</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFC tags</a> that customers can interact with directly from their phones. Customers are asked for <strong>only</strong> the information you need to identify their order and Routegy will gather the rest. That's it. <strong>No app required!</strong></p> <p>With Routegy’s integrations, employees inside are instantly notified when customers arrive and have relevant order information at their fingertips. Once an order is delivered to the customer, it can simply be marked as done.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/trello-curbside-waitlist.png"></p><h3 id="want-to-learn-more"><a href="#want-to-learn-more">#</a> Want to learn more?</h3> <p>Routegy is helping a number of local businesses in the Washington area with contactless curbside pickup. Take a look at <a href="https://blog.routegy.com/2020/06/18/orenji-streamline-curbside-pickup-routegy/">our case study for Orenji Sushi &amp; Noodles</a>, our <a href="https://docs.routegy.com/tutorial/streamline-curbside.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contactless curbside pickup tutorial</a>, or contact us at <a href="mailto:connect@routegy.com">connect@routegy.com</a>.</p> <h3 id="don-t-want-to-use-routegy"><a href="#don-t-want-to-use-routegy">#</a> Don't want to use Routegy?</h3> <p>Hey, that's fine too. I hope after reading this that you've discovered some ways to improve your own curbside experience to build loyal customers and fans.</p> <p>Using different tools/technology? Looking for an integration with your PoS system? Want to discuss problems you're experiencing with curbside pickup? I'd love to hear about them in our <a href="https://community.routegy.com/t/an-examination-of-the-curbside-pickup-experience/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comments section</a> for this post.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="frontend-stack">Frontend Stack</h2>
<p>Until somewhat recently, I think that hosting was probably a more important concern for creating a personal site than the frontend stack. But with options like <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the hosting part of the equation has become a whole lot easier. Nowadays a personal site is all about what you build it with. I think it's fair to say most people looking to build a personal site are, in equal parts, wanting to get a professional foothold on the web and also just have fun building something new. And when building something new, there is a whole lot of new out there. So much so, that many people cannot even bring themselves to begin because they're afraid of picking the wrong stack.</p>
<h3 id="picking-a-framework">Picking A Framework</h3>
<p>A good question to ask yourself when picking a framework is which of the two following focuses is most important to you.</p>
<h4 id="1-javascript">1) Javascript</h4>
<p>Javascript, the necessary evil turned eternal turf war, is probably at top of mind for most people looking to build a personal site in order to "play with new tech". This is also a great splitter of options if you do know what javascript framework you want to work in. If you still cannot decide on a framework, then you probably have more this vs that javascript framework articles to read.</p>
<h5 id="react">React</h5>
<p>If you must work with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsbyjs</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Nextjs</a> are very popular and capable options. Gatsbyjs takes a more holistic approach between the frontend and the backend whereas Nextjs is mostly concerned with creating a static and ssr environment for React apps.</p>
<h5 id="vuejs">VueJs</h5>
<p>If you must work with Vuejs (my personal favorite), <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxtjs</a> (what <a href="https://formcake.com/">formcake.com</a> is build on), <a href="https://gridsome.org/">Gridsome</a>, and <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">VuePress</a> are all great options. As is often the case in the world of Vue, it is often easiest to compare Vue based project's with their React equivalents. Gridsome is like Gatsbyjs and Nuxtjs is like Nextjs. VuePress is much more targeted to those who want to create a site for blogging.</p>
<h5 id="angular">Angular</h5>
<p>I cannot really imagine someone making a personal site in Angular unless they really want to force themselves to learn Angular for a job of some kind but there is an interesting <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> static site generator project called <a href="https://github.com/scullyio/scully">Scully</a> that I have been meaning to try. If anyone reading this has played with Scully, send me your thoughts to <a href="mailto:david@formcake.com">david@formcake.com</a>.</p>
<h5 id="x-cool-kid-framework">X Cool Kid Framework</h5>
<p>You are on your own.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are more concerned with creating a blog and how a framework's authoring experience works than what technology powers the rendering of html. X JS forward frameworks tend to require a lot more configuration than those made specifically for creating a simple site. If this is your situation, you are in luck. There are tons of options and they are all fantastic for this purpose. I will go more in depth on some of these options since they are more tailored for a small perosnal site.</p>
<h5 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h5>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is the one of the oldest static site generators that made authoring a top concern with its use of Markdown. Built in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Jekyll was part of the Rails era of web development where developer productivity was considered paramount to everything else. Jekyll is still very popular but is a bit of a non starter for many because it is built in Ruby. Still a great choice for a developer blog but you will have to use RubyGems instead of NPM.</p>
<h5 id="hugo">Hugo</h5>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is a more modren framework than Jekyll. It tries to solve more problems out of the box than Jekyll, is more flexible, and considers the speed at which it creates pages to be a top concern. Part of Hugo's popularity comes from the fact that it is written in Go. This contributes to its speed but also contributes to some of the annoying aspects about it. Go is an interesting language but most of us don't have the opportunity to use it in our work. It is therefore best for those who love Go and don't mind using Go's templating libraries. You will also have to give up NPM if you choose Hugo.</p>
<h5 id="eleventy">Eleventy</h5>
<p>One of the newest kids on the block, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> is somewhere inbetween Hugo and Jekyll. It's focus is on flexibility and speed. It is super modular so it does take a little bit more time to get setup but for those looking for flexiblity, Eleventy has it in spades. It supports 11 templating language and best of all, it is a node library so you can use NPM for your entire project. This may be my personal choice if I were creating a new blog.</p>
<h2 id="other-concerns">Other Concerns</h2>
<h4 id="3-static">3) Static????</h4>
<p>Yes. In 2020 there is no reason to choose a framework that does not support static generation of pages for a small personal website. Every framework listed above supports static generation. If you need to be convinced of the power of static websites, checkout <a href="https://jamstack.org/">jamstack.org</a> which does a good job of going into all the benifits.</p>
<h4 id="4-hosting">4) Hosting</h4>
<p>As long as we have made the decision to use static generation, hosting is quite easy. There are still a lot of options however. Here are some of the top options and some of the thinking for when to use them.</p>
<h5 id="netlify">Netlify</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is the hosting platform behind the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> movement. Founded in 2014, Netlify has grown rather quickly and has become the defacto hosting platform for static sites. With Netlify you can host static sites, deploy lambdas, and create git based workflows with extreme ease. I would recommend Netlify above all other options for a personal site.</p>
<h5 id="vercel-previously-zeit">Vercel (Previously Zeit)</h5>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> is a very similar hosting platform as Netlify. Founded in 2015, Vercel boasts a fully featured platform for hosting static sites including git workflows and lambdas. I have used Vercel for years and I can recommend it. Vercel is a solid choice but I would recommend Netlify above Vercel for a fully featured static hosting platform.</p>
<h5 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h5>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> is quite an old option in the space of static website hosting. Launched in 2008 Github pages originally only supported Jekyll and static files but now supports other frameworks through some configuration. Github pages was once unique in that it automatically was integreted into your github account but this is now a common feature with the likes of Netlify and Vercel. Github pages is underpowered at this point but will always be free. If you want to host something simple and never think about it again, Github pages may be just the right choice.</p>
<h5 id="firebase">Firebase</h5>
<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> is a platform as a service hosting provider that has some seriously robust features and is backed by Google. Firebase is not a static website hosting provider and aims to solve much more complicated issues around creating and hosting a sophisticated web application. The only reason you would want to choose Firebase is if you wanted authentication for some reason. Firebase allows for simple authentication and storage via it's flagship features <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/auth">Firebase Authentication</a> and Firebase <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database">Realtime Database</a>. Firebase may also be a good option if you want to play with server tech but don't want to go too deep into the subject.</p>
<h5 id="heroku">Heroku</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> lit the world of application hosting on fire in 2007 when it made hosting a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application as simple as a couple of key strokes using the Heroku CLI. Like Firebase, Heroku aims to solve much more complex problems than a simple static website but is a great system for those who like to tinker with their backend. Heroku is for those who need to solve more complicated problems like storage or authentication, but want to do it with open source software instead of google invented technologies. If you are building a personal site to learn server tech, Heroku is a great option.</p>
<h4 id="5-apis">5) APIs</h4>
<p>Assuming you went with one of the hosting platforms specifically designed for simple static websites, you may be wondering "But what if I need a server for X". You are in luck, there is a great resource created by <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyer</a>, of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> fame, that lists services that are great for static websites without a server, <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major">https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major</a>. <a href="http://formcake.com/">Formcake</a> also perfectly solves the problem of how to create a contact form on a static website. Formcake is committed to always having a useful free tier for developers with small projects. Consider checking it out the next time you tackle building your personal site.</p>

Here's part of their conversation.</p>  <p><strong>Is there any doubt about the outcome of this referendum?</strong></p>  <p>There is no doubt. Putin is 100-per-cent&nbsp;risk-averse. He only does things in advance, when he knows the outcome.</p>  <p>That outcome is that the presidency will be effectively extended into perpetuity for him. It may not say that exactly on the documents, but that's the intention.</p>  <p>And then when he runs for president — which will also be a predetermined outcome — he'll then be re-elected and will serve as president for life.</p>    <p><strong>And yet this government is so desperate to secure a high voter turnout in order to lend more legitimacy to this referendum. Why is that so important to Putin, if he's got it all sewn up anyway?</strong></p>  <p>Well, what does he have sewn up? He can cheat —&nbsp;change the numbers if he wants. He controls the television stations. He can put pressure on people.</p>  <p>But people do have to vote in a referendum, and if the outcome is so dramatically different — or if people think that the outcome is so dramatically different — than what they intended to do, people could rise up.</p>  <p>That's his fear. He doesn't fear courts or parliaments or media, but he fears 142 million Russian people who — you know, all you need is a million people rising up and then he's going to hightail it to some friendly state that will give him asylum.</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>He doesn't fear courts or parliaments or media, but he fears 142 million Russian people.<svg focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="23px" height="22px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g display="none"><g display="inline"><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg></span><cite>- Bill Browder</cite></span></blockquote>    <p><strong>If he stepped down or if he lost power, what do you think his fate would be?</strong></p>  <p>Well, it's clear&nbsp;he's committed so many crimes —&nbsp;he's stolen so much money — that if he were not in power he'd be arrested by his successor, put in jail, stripped of all of his money, and possibly worse.</p>  <p><strong>This is happening as there are indications that Vladimir Putin is more unpopular inside Russia than he's ever been.</strong></p>  <p><strong>The coronavirus is hitting the country hard, the economy is tanking.

He has stolen unbelievable, unimaginable amounts of money from the Russian government and from the Russian people for his own personal benefit.</p>  <p>As a result of all that stolen money, the average Russian person is destitute. So when you have a health crisis like COVID-19, there's not enough ambulances, hospital beds, ventilators.</p>  <p>A small number of people have taken everything from the country and everyone else lives in destitute poverty. It's a terrible, terrible blight and he wants to keep it that way.</p>  <p><strong>You have lots of Russian friends and contacts.&nbsp;And you&nbsp;said that this was a tragedy.</strong></p>  <p><strong>But is there not also an element of farce to the fact that there is this referendum with the inevitable outcome that will end with Putin being president for life?</strong></p>  <p>It's totally farcical. And I'm sure we'll find all sorts of abuses and crimes committed and ballot boxes stuffed, and all sorts of stuff like that.</p>  <p>But they don't really care about that in Russia.

arguments in their heads, the pieces of supporting and disproving evidence, and can collapse this system

the points of view, and making sense of the discussion. Problem is: we don’t actually want to apply this

<p>Have you heard of <code>async</code> in Rust? Ever wondered why the core team opted into a completely new syntax for this feature? Let’s dive in and find out! Here is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640">#57640</a> with 512 comments, kindly asking everyone to check <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50547">#50547</a> (with just 308 comments) before expressing their point of view. Following this discussion must have been exhausting. I don’t know how it would be possible to navigate it without the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640#issuecomment-456624074">summary</a> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640#issuecomment-456625030">comments</a>.</p>

<p>Another example is the loop syntax in WebGPU. Issue <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/569">#569</a> has only 70 comments, with multiple attempts to <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/569#issuecomment-610041440">summarize</a> the discussion in the middle. It would probably take a few hours at the minimum to get a gist of the group reasoning for somebody from the outside. And that doesn’t include the call transcripts.</p>

<p>Github has emojis which allow certain comments to show more support. Unfortunately, our nature is such that comments are getting liked when we agree with them, not when they advance the discussion in a constructive way. They are all over the place and don’t really help.</p>

<p>What would help though is having a non-linear structure for the discussion. Trees! They make following HN and Reddit threads much easier, but they too have problems. Sometimes, a really important comment is buried deep in one of the branches. Plus, trees don’t work well for a dialog, when there is some back-and-forth between people.</p>

<p>That brings us to the point: most technical discussions are <em>terrible</em>. Not in a sense that people can’t make good points and progress through it, but rather that there is no structure to a discussion, and it’s too hard to follow. What I see in reality is a lot of focus from a very few dedicated people, and delegation by the other ones to those focused. Many views get misrepresented, and many perspectives never heard, because the flow of comments quickly filters out most potential participants.</p>

<h2 id="structured-discussion">Structured discussion</h2>

<p>My first stop in the search of a solution was on <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>. It is successfully used by many communities, including <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/">Rust users</a>. Unfortunately, it still has linear structure, and doesn’t bring a lot to the table on top of Github. Try following <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-2020-growth/34956">this discussion
</a> about Rust in 2020 for example.</p>

<p>Then I looked at platforms designed specifically for a structured argumentation. One of the most popular today is <a href="https://www.kialo.com/">Kialo</a>. I haven’t done a good evaluation on it, but it seemed that Kialo isn’t targeted at engineers, and it’s a platform that we’d have to register in for use. Wishing to use Markdown with a system like that, I stumbled upon <a href="https://argdown.org/">Argdown</a>, and realized that it concluded my search.</p>

<p>Argdown introduces a syntax for defining the structure of an argument in text. Statements, arguments, propositions, conclusions - it has it all, written simply in your text editor (especially if its VSCode, for which there is a plugin), or in the <a href="https://argdown.org/sandbox/html">playground</a>. It has command-line tools to produce all sorts of derivatives, like dot graphs, web components, JSON, you name it, from an <code>.argdown</code> file. Naturally, formatting with Markdown in it is also supported.</p>

<p>That discovery led me to two questions. (1) - what would an <em>existing</em> debate look like in such a system? And (2) - how could we shift the workflow towards using one?</p>

<p>So I picked the most contentious topic in WebGPU discussions and tried to reconstruct it. Topic was about choosing the shading language, and why SPIR-V wasn’t accepted. It was discussed by the W3C group over the course of 2+ years, and it’s evident that there is <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/847#issuecomment-642497578">some</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23089745">misunderstanding</a> of why the decision was made to go with WGSL, taking Google’s Tint proposal as a starting point.</p>

<p>I attempted to reconstruct the debate in https://github.com/kvark/webgpu-debate, building the <a href="https://github.com/kvark/webgpu-debate/blob/b28252ea99aef8989858ece09f74dc0758e3d46c/arguments/SPIR-V.argdown">SPIR-V.argdown</a> with the first version of the argumentation graph, solving (1). The repository accepts pull requests that are checked by CI for syntax correctness, inviting everyone to collaborate, solving (2). Moreover, the artifacts are automatically uploaded to Github-pages, rendering the <a href="https://kvark.github.io/webgpu-debate/SPIR-V.component.html">discussion</a> in a way that is easy to explore.</p>

<h2 id="way-forward">Way forward</h2>

<p>I’m excited to have this new way of preserving and growing the structure of a technical debate. We can keep using the code hosting platforms, and arguing on the issues and PR, while solidifying the core points in these <code>.argdown</code> files. I hope to see it applied more widely to the workflows of technical working groups.</p>

June 30, 2020 | https://www.encode.io/articles/python-async-frameworks-beyond-developer-tribalism | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.encode.io/articles/python-async-frameworks-beyond-developer-tribalism">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
    <p><br>
I’ve been thinking about writing this article for a bit, but have been most prompted by a post grandly titled “<a href="http://calpaterson.com/async-python-is-not-faster.html">Async Python is not faster</a>”. The post was rooted with some good motivations and observations, but also fell somewhat into a polarising mode of discussion that I’d like to see our communities try to move beyond.</p>

<p>Async concurrency necessarily brings with it an element of ecosystem split, and this can mean that it’s a bit of a divisive area to try to have conversations within.</p>

<p>However I think we could probably benefit from a bit more recognition of where there is shared ground. And in areas where there’s less clarity, to be able to have constructive conversations around the relative merits in differing approaches.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="-why-you-shouldnt-care-about-performance">★ Why you shouldn’t care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>If you’re starting a new project, and choosing a python async framework vs a python sync framework, then any “performance” metrics around the frameworks <em>almost certainly don’t actually matter</em>, and are almost always a nonsense point of debate.</p>

<p>What is <em>actually</em> critical to your business is the development experience and strength of the surrounding ecosystem. What is your time to market going to be? How will the maintenance overhead be? How robust and evolvable is your codebase?</p>

<h3 id="-why-you-might-care-about-performance">★ Why you might care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Having said that, there <em>are</em> a small portion of cases where the performance characteristics are a valid consideration. Particularly if your web framework makes lots of outgoing HTTP requests or other networking and I/O.</p>

<p>It’s important for the Python ecosystem that it ought to compare favourably to other dynamic languages in domains where async is beneficial. We don’t want to be in a position where “we’re using JavaScript because we believe it’ll scale up better” is a valid market blocker vs. choosing Python.</p>

<h3 id="-what-were-talking-about-when-we-talk-about-performance">★ What we’re talking about when we talk about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Like-for-like a single async function call in isolation will be marginally slower than a plain function call. That’s not contentious.</p>

<p>What we’re actually interested in is how <em>efficiently</em> we can interleave multiple concurrent tasks. In I/O bound systems co-operative concurrency (async) performs more efficiently under high concurrency than threaded concurrency (sync). Again, not contentious.</p>

<p>Again - Async Python is not faster. It <em>is</em> more efficient. Which will <em>tend</em> to mean that on I/O bound systems, the latency will <em>continue</em> to remain low even as the level of concurrency increases.</p>

<h3 id="-there-are-no-good-benchmarks">★ There are no good benchmarks.</h3>

<p>JSON “hello world” benchmarks are junk. Almost all cases of “I’ve created this benchmark myself” are likely to be junk. The prevalence of new frameworks overly focusing on nebulous benchmarking claims is generally junk. An obsession on benchmarking numbers can also sometimes result in poor overall design choices, such as obfuscated or unnecessarily coupled bits of codebase, because some not-very-meaningful metric is being prioritised over the code design itself. None of this should be contentious.</p>

<p>It’s not <em>always</em> true, for example, when Sanic was introduced there was a genuine step forward which was worth talking about, so I can understand why there was a focus there. But there’s still a ridiculous hype-cycle attached as a result, and we need to be really careful about trying to step beyond that.</p>

<p>It’s also reasonable if benchmarking is discussed in a sensible context and placement. For example, to the extent that Uvicorn and Starlette have discussed performance it has only ever been with a view to making a solid case that having a <em>properly specified</em> server/framework boundary API isn’t a negative performance consideration. Prior to the introduction of ASGI, Python’s async web ecosystem had generally bundled together both the low-level HTTP handling and the high level framework, and there was a notion that needed dispelling that introducing a properly specified separation of concerns wasn’t a good approach because <em>“something something performance something”</em>.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> going to look at web framework benchmarks for some very rough first-pass ideas about relative efficiency then the TechEmpower benchmarks should almost certainly be your baseline, since they’re at least independent, and have a decent range of test cases. If you’re going to diverge from them have some good argument for doing so.</p>

<p>The “Async Python is not faster” benchmarking is a reasonable example here, since it had clearly applied a decent degree of thoughtfulness. Even so there were still problems with the methodology, as <a href="https://twitter.com/llanga/status/1271719778324025349">Łukasz Langa did a good job of unpicking</a>.</p>

<p>Having said that, the TechEmpower benchmarks only show throughput, and don’t include any <em>meaningful</em> latency information. There’s actually a good reason for that, since
comparing latencies is really difficult. You can’t arrive at a single “95% latency” figure, because the figure you’ll arrive at <em>also depends on what throughput load you’re putting the system under</em> at the time of measuring the latency.</p>

<p>As a result measuring latency is only ever really meaningful if you’re looking at <em>graphs of how the latencies vary over a range of different throughputs</em>. Amber Brown’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxP1I-tm_2c">DjangoCon 2019 keynote talk does a fantastic job of showing some examples here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-asgi-is-a-really-positive-step-for-the-async-ecosystem">★ ASGI is a really positive step for the async ecosystem.</h3>

<p>Having a decently specified server/framework interface is a <em>really good thing</em>. Andrew Godwin’s design for ASGI fills this gap with a WSGI-like approach. That has a set of trade-offs, but it’s a pretty pragmatic and well rounded choice.</p>

<p>This should not really be contentious.</p>

<h3 id="-its-about-functionality">★ It’s about functionality.</h3>

<p>Async isn’t just about achieving higher levels of concurrency-per-server, it also makes it a bunch of new functionality more feasible, including…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handling long-lived network connections like Websockets.</li>
  <li>Long-lived HTTP connections and server sent events.</li>
  <li>Dealing with background tasks without necessarily needing a full blown task queue subcomponent.</li>
  <li>Parallelizing outgoing HTTP requests or other high latency I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-not-everything-is-perfect">★ Not everything is perfect.</h3>

<p>The async ecosystem is far more immature than the existing thread synchronous. There are different challenges there, such as ensuring that <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/1/1/async-pressure/">backpressure is handled consistently throughout the various async APIs</a>, or in <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">applying the lessons of structured concurrency</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is the “stdlib asyncio isn’t perfect” line a good argument either against asyncio specifically, or against async/await in general.</p>

<p>It’s okay that there’s still work to do in places. We know.  Let’s get that work done.</p>

<h3 id="-async-is-harder">★ Async is harder.</h3>

<p>Having to <em>think</em> about if a function does or doesn’t make I/O or could otherwise block <em>is unarguably more complex than not having to think about it</em>. It’s also more precise - you’re having to think about that for a reason, and done properly it’s presenting you with more information as a result. Being able to reason more clearly about which parts of your framework stack do or don’t perform I/O has a cost but also brings benefits.</p>

<p>There’s an analogy to make there in that writing Python using explicitly enforced typing is likely to be a harder than writing Python in an untyped style. It’s harder because you’re <em>also being more precise</em>. That’s not necessarily either good or bad, but it is definitively <em>different</em>.</p>

<p>This also gets to the point about why the “<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">What colour is your function</a>” argument isn’t actually a good case against async code, even if it seems to make clear sense on first pass. We’re coloring our functions because we’re <em>enforcing the exposure of some important information all the way throughout the stack</em>. That’s not an inherently bad thing to do.</p>

<hr>



<p>If those are areas where I think we ought to be able to reach consensus on, then there’s also a few areas where I think that the possible outcomes are less clear…</p>

<h3 id="-you-take-the-high-road-and-ill-take-the-low-road">★ You take the high road, and I’ll take the low road.</h3>

<p>There’s a few different tacks we might take onto introducing async into the Python web framework ecosystem…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Promoting mostly staying with threaded web frameworks. There’s actually a perfectly decent case to make that Python <em>on the whole</em> should eschew a <em>wide move towards async</em>. That the drawbacks of moving large swathes of the ecosystem towards an async model outweigh the advantages. (Pros: Simpler for the end developer. Huge existing ecosystem.)</li>
  <li>Working towards blended approaches. This is being championed within the Django community which is incrementally adding async support, largely off the back of some Herculean work by Andrew Godwin and others. This approach can either be in the form of adding support for async at the server level, while keeping the framework level strictly thread-synchronous. Or it can gradually start to expose optional async capabilities all the way through the stack. (Pros: Brings along the existing ecosystem, while adding async capabilities when they’re needed.)</li>
  <li>Working towards async-native frameworks. (Pros: Lower overall complexity of the stack then blended approach. More efficient since there’s less overhead in marshalling between two style all the way through the stack. If we’re having to write large amounts of new code then it’s not a bad inflection point at which to also rethink and finesse other aspects of how we’re putting together new frameworks.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We can’t really say which of these will yield the best dividends. Personally I <em>happen</em> to be working in the last of those three slices, simply because I can see a bunch of areas where I can contribute meaningfully towards the ecosystem there.</p>

<h3 id="-positioning-asyncio-and-trio">★ Positioning asyncio and Trio</h3>

<p>There another big question mark over the relative positioning of asyncio and Trio in the ecosystem. Trio is a newer approach to a Python async framework, that’s meticulously designed, and based on the principles of structured concurrency, that have been outlined by it’s author, Nathaniel Smith.</p>

<p>The difficulty this brings is that Trio is necessarily incompatible with asyncio, and introduces an ecosystem-split within an ecosystem-split.</p>

<p>There’s a few different …</p></div></div>

			<p><em>“David, this one, tell me about it …”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yellowstone-roughriders-3.jpg"><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yellowstone-roughriders-3-300x220.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yellowstone-roughriders-3-300x220.jpg 300w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yellowstone-roughriders-3-725x532.jpg 725w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/yellowstone-roughriders-3.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>He’d let me look at his domain name portfolio. Not names he owned and parked, but domains he owned &amp; developed. This was another early project of his – a job board solely focused on the ranching industry. All aspects – cattle, outfitters, dude/guest, hunting, and even associated businesses like horseback riding. He’d launched it in 1998, and done an admirable job developing the brand and building an audience. But other projects had hijacked his attention, and the site had become a bit stale. Its revenue had evaporated.</p>
<p>I knew David from a partnership between DudeRanch.com (mine, at the time) &amp; GuestRanches.com (his). We had grouped them together to sell advertising. A handshake deal. Stronger together, we assumed. And we were right. Over the years, we were able to (more than) double revenue by leveraging the authority of our sites as one entity, versus two.</p>
<p>The more we worked together, the more we shared business opportunities with one another. At one point he shared his portfolio with me, <em>and that’s when I discovered <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RanchWork.com</a></em> .</p>
<p>At that time, I’d been poking around for a second project to develop, and came up empty after a year or so of searching. My usual avenue for acquisition, the <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/build-a-side-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expiring domain name market</a>, hadn’t yielded anything of value, so my wandering mind lead me to David.</p>
<p>When I uncovered RanchWork, it reminded me of a friend – <a href="http://shanepike.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shane Pike</a> – who’d built, developed, and successfully sold a nursing job board several years before. And from what I remember, he did it solo. The straightforward nature of job boards was attractive – direct, simple, &amp; sans-fluff.</p>
<p>The niche was compelling, so after I slept on it, I pinged David. To see if he’d let me test a project on it. I was already deeply entrenched in the dude ranching industry, so it seemed like a natural extension. The rough idea was this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Point the RanchWork.com nameservers to me, and I’ll cover the costs of re-development, plus oversight &amp; maintenance.</li>
<li>Once developed, I’d allow <em>free</em> job listings for ranchers to encourage a regular stream of postings. </li>
<li>I’d also allow <em>paid</em> listings (which would post at a faster clip, and remain active for a longer period. </li>
<li>To ensure simplicity, I’d avoid any type of login or account creation. If a rancher was hiring, they’d simply fill out a form, enter credit card info (if needed), and submit. Done deal.</li>
<li>David would receive 25% of all job board revenue the site collected; the remaining 75% would fall into my pocket. Ad publisher revenue was also under my wing.</li>
<li>David would continue to own the domain, 100%, outright.</li>
</ol>
<p>What makes it easy (&amp; fun) to work with David is his ‘<em>screw it, let’s do it</em>‘ attitude. I very much admire that about him, as I tend to follow the same outlook on life. And he brought that spirit into this project as well.</p>
<p>So he agreed. And I got to work.</p>

<p><em>Now, sure, from the outset, I could have viewed this idea from a defeatist attitude, that being, “What? I’m gonna try to compete with Indeed, SimplyHired, Monster, and the like? They’re VC backed heavyweights… I have no chance.”</em></p>
<p>I rarely approach projects from this mindset. I tend to approach them from the perspective, “what do I have to lose”. And usually, the answer is  “not much”. And then that thought morphs into “let’s see what kinda shit I can stir up”.</p>
<p>So to start, I purchased a $60 job board theme, and took a full week to properly architect the site for mobile devices and seo. I researched competitors. $25 seemed like the average rate for paid job postings, so that became my base price. Another close friend, <a href="https://www.workinsports.com/blog.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Clapp</a>, suggested I add a ‘Job Wanted’ listing for folks searching for ranch employment. I was skeptical that need existed, but added it anyway. And then I happily overpaid for the fastest, most reliable WordPress host I could find. </p>
<p>Essentially, the site changed from this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2000s-ranchwork-com-website-min.jpg" alt="early RanchWork.com website" width="764" height="887" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2000s-ranchwork-com-website-min.jpg 764w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2000s-ranchwork-com-website-min-258x300.jpg 258w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2000s-ranchwork-com-website-min-603x700.jpg 603w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px"></p>
<p>to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-2014-relaunch-min-768x756-1.jpg" alt="RanchWork.com 2014" width="768" height="756" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-2014-relaunch-min-768x756-1.jpg 768w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-2014-relaunch-min-768x756-1-300x295.jpg 300w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-2014-relaunch-min-768x756-1-700x689.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p>
<p>An improvement, I thought. Not perfect, but better. Simpler in a way. </p>
<p>I re-launched the site in October of 2013.</p>
<p>At first, I seeded all the jobs myself. Then ranchers started submitting their own. Then I shifted into curation &amp; verification. </p>
<p>Then, over the next 7 years, site traffic did this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats.png" alt="" width="700" height="158" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats.png 700w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats-300x68.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>From virtually zero traffic, the site ramped up to roughly 40k-50k visitors a month. Typically 200,000 pageviews every 30 days. I had to start managing overage fees with my hosting provider.</p>
<p>Jobs of all types started pouring in. </p>
<p>As the sole curator, I made sure they followed the singular track I defined. And overall, they did.</p>
<p>Jobs like this, where you <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/packers-trail-guides-maintenance-crew-needed-at-grand-canyon-az/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had to ride a mule to &amp; from your work location</a> at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Or this one, for a <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/mountain-permit-rider-needed-at-wyoming-cattle-ranch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mountain Permit Rider</a>, responsible for all for all aspects of yearling cattle care &amp; management in private ranch pastures and mountain forest grazing allotments near Cody, Wyoming. </p>
<p>Or this Job Wanted from 2017, an <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/position-wanted-ranch-hand-91817/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">individual looking for work in the Cave Creek / Scottsdale, Arizona area</a>.</p>
<p>Job posting pictures were equally as endearing. All user submitted. Pics like this:</p>

<p>The more jobs (and job wanted) postings we listed, the more positive feedback we’d receive. That we were a great help for a remote ranch with limited hiring resources. That they were in financial straits, and our Free offering allowed them to hire the right Manager to turn their operation around. <em>And the avenue I was most skeptical about</em> – Job Wanted postings – wound up assisting individuals who craved an escape from the city into life on a working ranch (as well as contributing 30% of our overall revenue). &gt;&gt; <em>gracias, Mr. Clapp</em></p>
<p>The feeling was familiar. It felt like my <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vidalia</a> project. That I was making a positive impact. Satisfying a unique pain point, subtly, as a solo operator.</p>
<p>This project – originally a passing glance – became my mini workhorse. And such a proud production that I wound up buying the whole project from David in 2017. I doubled down in 2019 by investing $10k into a fancier backend and refreshed design. The site deserved that – a proper identity.</p>

<p>I tend to approach online businesses this way. Not intentionally – I just found myself on this path. Find a good domain name; build a product/service; see if it solves a problem &amp; makes people happy; <strong>*and only then*</strong> attempt to make it profitable. Purpose always comes first. As does contentment. Revenue always comes second. Sure, this approach has bitten me in the ass before, but I don’t care. When it’s worked, the results are wondrous. And this project checked those boxes.</p>
<p>And while RanchWork.com isn’t a flashy VC funded endeavor, or even some high flying 6-figure revenue generator, it’s not that I don’t care. The <em>site</em> doesn’t care. Cause it’s too busy. Working. Quietly. </p>
<p>My Twitter friend <a href="https://ian.is/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ian Nuttall</a> identifies these types of projects aptly; as nice, <em>humble</em> internet businesses. </p>
<p>I like humble internet businesses … </p>
<p>… and I’m quite proud to be this job board’s proprietor.</p>

<hr>
<h2>post script</h2>
<p>I knew I was in a pickle. </p>
<p>While I owned and operated RanchWork.com, I didn’t own the .com name of this niche industry. That being <em>RanchJobs.com</em>. It was owned by a 3rd party, and undeveloped.</p>
<p>That didn’t sit well with me.</p>
<p>So in 2018, I reached out to the owner. I got lucky, in that – – he responded. We had mutual friends, so that helped. The email:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1.png" alt="" width="700" height="445" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1.png 700w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>He was aware of my RanchWork project, and the price point reflected that. And he wouldn’t go lower. I couldn’t wrap my head around the price, so I shelved it. </p>
<p>Until 2020, two years later. When COVID-19 hit. The financial world went sideways. I was a bit frazzled as well. This domain name bubbled up into my brain, though. That this might be an opportunity.</p>
<p>So I leveraged a 3rd party domain marketplace platform where I could remain somewhat anonymous. I submitted an offer of $2,500.</p>
<p>They countered at $9,999. </p>
<p>I didn’t respond.</p>
<p>A broker from the marketplace called. Nice guy. He probed like a domain broker should do. He asked if they got down to $5k, if it’d be a range we’d consider. I wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>They brought the $5k offer to the table. </p>
<p>I understood I was in a halo of time where this price could disappear as quickly as it appeared, so I went ahead &amp; accepted it.</p>
<p>I wanted that chess piece off the board, essentially. Another barrier to entry. </p>
<p>It’s fun to see how many times this domain is typed into a browser, though (238 times per month, tracked via re-direct). If I look at it from an advertising perspective, &amp; apply a $0.50 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-click" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CPC</a> to each visit, this domain should pay for itself by 2023. 🤠</p>
<p>I’m so fortunate the internet exists.</p>

                        <h2 id="you-are-100-responsible-for-everything-i-mean-everything-"><strong>You are 100% responsible for everything. I mean everything.</strong></h2><p>At least that's how you should live your life.</p><p>You're at work, and something happens–a colleague didn't do what they were supposed to one time. Your jerk boss decides last minute to blame you for something that you raised concerns about a month ago. Your spouse is oblivious to what you've been doing around the house and yells at you for not doing the dishes. <em>Again</em>. And yes, I know, you did them all last night.</p><p>But you are responsible.</p><p>I've always struggled with this. It seems unfair, almost unjust. Why should I take responsibility for something that is clearly, utterly, and completely is beyond my control? Why should "they" get away with it? If I take responsibility, aren't I enabling and reinforcing that bad behavior?</p><p>Actually, no.</p><p>The book, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,</em> finally helped me understand. Responsibility and fault ARE NOT the same. It's not your fault that the deadline was missed but you ARE responsible for what you're going to do about it.</p><p>And hell, maybe you do nothing. Maybe that's the best choice. But you are <strong>responsible</strong>.</p><blockquote>See, things happen. Whether it's people, nature, or God, shit happens. This is a universal truth and we cannot escape it. Some of the things that happen are good, some are bad. Some are preventable or in our control. Others aren't. And frankly, none of that matters.</blockquote><p>Things happen and then it's up to you to decide how you want to respond. Responsibility is not about taking the blame, it's about taking control. If you realize that you are responsible, then you can act. And when we act, we can be authors of our own fate. Or at least try.</p><p>Too often we blame others. So much breath is wasted blaming, arguing about who's right, who's wrong, and what "they" should do.</p><p>But you can't control them, you can only control you. So respond. Take action to make whatever outcome you want to happen, happen. Or at least a more likely outcome.</p><p>Take control over your feelings. Yes, those things that try to control us and come out of nowhere.</p><blockquote>Impossible? No. Difficult? Yes.</blockquote><p>Be responsible for how you feel. Be responsible for how you act. Your reaction is up to you. "Re" and "act" meaning, your action that happens in response to a stimulus.</p><p>Because you got angry when someone cut you off does not mean that you have to speed up and flick them off. You will have impulses, and that's fine. But your "re-action" is under your control.</p><p>The blood flowing to your limbic system, reducing your ability to think clear does not make you a monkey. You can still think. You can still breath. Talk yourself off the emotional, reactive ledge, and think.</p><p>That magical tool of cognition that humanity &nbsp;has developed. Thinking. Think about what your reaction is going to be. Be responsible for your action.</p><p>Responsibility is painful. It's shitty, frustrating, and requires extra effort. But as you realize that you're in more control than you think, other things begin to happen as well. You are no longer controlled by others.</p><p>Or at least less so. You may be fired. It might not be your fault. And bitching about it for a month is justifiable. And it would feel oh sooooo good.</p><p>But, your response is your choice. You can respond with bitching, or you can respond with gritting your teeth and looking for new jobs.</p><p>Either way, the choice is yours.</p>

      <h2>All about Modelica</h2>
      <p>
	by <b>Marco Bonvini</b> on Monday June 29, 2020
      </p>
    <p>Early in my career, when ML and AI weren’t as cool, I fell in love with modeling and simulations.
As Joel Spolsky recently <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2020/06/18/hash-a-free-online-platform-for-modeling-the-world/">put it</a>,
sometimes you’re working on something that’s just too complicated to reason about with simple math, you can’t even begin to guess
how the inputs affect the outputs. In such cases, simulation models will help you understand better complex problems.<!--more--></p>

<p>While working with modeling and simulations, I discovered Modelica, a language for developing simulation models.
I worked <a href="https://marcobonvini.com/research">extensively</a> with Modelica, both during my Ph.D. as well as
in my first job at <a href="https://eta.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>.
Modelica is a great tool for modeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system">cyber-physical systems</a>,
for example to study the fuel efficiency of an hybrid vehicle, or to evaluate the interactions between renewable energy sources
and the electrical grid.</p>

<p>In this post I will provide a general overview on Modelica, and I’ll showcase some of its main features.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-modelica">What is Modelica?</h4>

<p>Modelica, as the name suggests, is a modeling language.
Which type of models? Mathematical models.
Modelica does not focus on a particular application domain, and gives you the freedom
to model a variety of problems ranging from electro-mechanical systems for automotive
or aerospace applications, to financial models for banks.</p>

<p>You can use the language to create mathematical models using any combination of the
following formalisms</p>

<ul>
  <li>differential equations</li>
  <li>algebraic equations</li>
  <li>difference equations</li>
  <li>discrete event systems</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can imagine, this kind of flexibility makes it easier to tackle lots of
different and interesting engineering problems, including cyber-physical systems.
Typical examples of such systems are cars. Cars are characterized by mechanical components that interact
with electronics and hydraulic systems, all under the supervision of multiple control systems.
So if you want to know how a car is actually going to behave, you need to simulate the whole shebang.</p>

<p>Ignoring the interaction between components – a rookie mistake in the world of simulations –
would lead to a poor understanding of the system.</p>

<figure>
   <img src="https://marcobonvini.com/images/posts/hybrid-car-scheme.png" alt="A car, typical example of cyber-physical system.">
   <figcaption>
      A car, typical example of cyber-physical systems.
   </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It’s not hard to find other examples of cyber-phyisical systems, they’re everywhere you look:</p>

<ul>
  <li>every private or public transportation vehicle – from airplanes to e-bikes</li>
  <li>the electrical grid that powers our houses</li>
  <li>data centers that process our data, etc.</li>
  <li>our homes, thanks to the increasing adoption of PV panels, batteries, EV cars, and IoT devices</li>
</ul>

<p>So, at this point you should be convinced that cyber-physical systems are a big part of
everyday life. Modelica allows engineers and scientists to model these systems accurately,
giving us a chance to improve their performance. <strong>This is why Modelica matters</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="modeling-the-real-world">Modeling the real world</h4>

<p>Ask any engineer, and they’ll tell you - “It’s tough to model the real world!”
Engineers perform a balancing act when they create models of complex
physical systems, building detailed simulations while at the same time struggling
against overwhelming complexity or irrelevant detail.</p>

<p>The Modelica modeling language has several features that make it the right choice for
modeling complex engineering systems. Modelica is not some abstract academic toy
disregarded by the modern industry.
In fact, in the last few years Modelica has been adopted by some of the world’s biggest
automotive companies – Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, Toyota, and VW. These companies
use Modelica to design energy efficient vehicles, improve air conditioning systems.
They Ferrari F1 team uses Modelica too for designing their racing cars!
And the automotive sector is just one of many that find this language effective.
The aerospace and energy industry are increasingly adopting Modelica, and the US Department
of Energy has been steadily investing in this technology for <a href="https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings">modeling buildings</a>
and improving their energy efficiency.</p>

<h4 id="modelica---a-first-example">Modelica - A first example</h4>

<p>As described on the <a href="https://www.modelica.org/">Modelica association</a> website,
<em>Modelica is a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation based language to conveniently model
complex physical systems including a variety of different aspects, including mechanical,
electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.</em></p>

<p>The following diagram shows the big picture behind any Modelica model</p>

<p><img src="https://marcobonvini.com/images/posts/modelica_toolchain.png" width="100%">
</p>


<p>The steps are the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>an engineer/scientist writes a Modelica model that represents an idea as a series of equations,</li>
  <li>a Modelica tool analyzes the model and verifies its correctness – Does the model have the same number
 of variables and equations? Are there typos?</li>
  <li>the tool compiles the model and generates an executable</li>
  <li>run the executable to simulate the system and produce data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Before diving into some of Modelica’s core concepts let’s start with an example,
a kind of <strong>HelloWorld</strong> of differential equations. We’ll use the simplest
differential equation you can imagine</p>

<p>
$$ \frac{d \, x(t)}{dt} = -2 \, x(t) $$
</p>
<p>with initial condition \( x(t_0) = 5 \)</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="modelica"><span></span><span> 1 </span><span>model</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>  <span>"The simplest differential equation ever"</span>
<span> 2 </span>  <span>// Define variables and parameters here...</span>

<span> 4 </span>    <span>"The unknown variable"</span><span>;</span>
<span> 5 </span>  <span>constant</span> <span>Real</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>2.0</span>
<span> 6 </span>    <span>"Constant that characterizes the model"</span><span>;</span>
<span> 7 </span>  <span>parameter</span> <span>Real</span> <span>x_start</span> <span>=</span> <span>5.0</span>
<span> 8 </span>    <span>"Initial value of the variable x"</span><span>;</span>
<span> 9 </span><span>initial</span> <span>equation</span>
<span>10 </span>  <span>// Define initial conditions here...</span>

<span>14 </span>  <span>der</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>15 </span><span>end</span> <span>HelloWorld</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>The keyword <code>model</code> defines the beginning of a model named <strong>HelloWorld</strong>.
The model is divided in three sections: declarations, initializations and equations.
The model starts by declaring variables, constants and parameters. <strong>Variables</strong> represent
quantities that are expected to change over time. <strong>Constants</strong>, meanwhile, are fixed
quantities that will never change. And finally <strong>parameters</strong> are quantities
that do not change over time but may change between simulations.
In this case parameter <code>x_start</code>, constant <code>a</code> and variable <code>x</code> have the same type,
<code>Real</code> type meaning a floating point number.</p>

<p>The keywords <code>initial equation</code> introduce the second part of our model.
Here we define the initial conditions of the system, for example the value of <code>x</code> at
the beginning of our model’s simulation time.</p>

<p>The keyword <code>equation</code> introduces the third and final part of our program,
where we finally get down to writing the equations of the system.
In this case there is one variable <code>x</code> and one differential equation <code>der(x) = a*x</code>.</p>

<p>One important thing to note is the <code>der(...)</code> operator that indicates the
time derivative of the expression inside the brackets.
The ability to express derivatives in such a clean and concise way is very helpful
when dealing with mathematical models.</p>

<h3 id="modelicas-key-principles">Modelica’s key principles</h3>

<p>So we’ve completed a simple example to get familiar with Modelica. Now, let’s look at
some of its most interesting features. As I mentioned at the beginning of the post,
Modelica is an object-oriented equation-based modeling language.
What exactly do those words mean? Let’s have a look, keeping in the context of
mathematical modeling.</p>

<h4 id="equation-based-modeling">Equation-based modeling</h4>

<p>Computer programs are nothing but clever set of instructions to let a computer solve a particular
problem for us (If this sounds familiar, bear with me. I’m going to make a distinction between
assignments and equations that you might not be familiar with).
Let’s consider the following problem: <em>given two numbers compute their sum</em>.
The following code snippet shows a solution to the problem implemented in C</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span></span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>){</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
  <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
  <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
  <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>What happens here when the program is executed is that the value 4 is inserted in the memory space
associated to variable <code>a</code>, the value 3 is inserted in the memory space
associated to variable <code>b</code> and then their sum is assigned to the memory space associated to variable <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>Given the initial problem, this program implements a particular solution to it. And, most of the
time when we write algorithms we are writing specific solutions to certain problems.
In this case the problem and its algorithmic solution were pretty straightforward!</p>

<p>Now here’s the kicker: when dealing with mathematical modeling the situation is quite different.
You typically start with a set of equations that describe the general understanding of the system
you want to model.</p>

<p>Then, you can collected data about that system, and feed it into those equations to start
generating some interesting answers to your questions. Often there are  multiple questions to answer,
so the model should be as general as possible so that it can be be easily manipulated to
answer all the questions.</p>

<p>Let’s get back to our problem: <em>given two numbers compute their sum</em>. The following
is an example of a Modelica model that solves it</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="modelica"><span></span><span>1 </span><span>model</span> <span>Sum</span>
<span>2 </span>   <span>Integer</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
<span>3 </span><span>equation</span>
<span>4 </span>   <span>c</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>5 </span>   <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
<span>6 </span>   <span>b</span> <span>-</span> <span>3</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>7 </span><span>end</span> <span>Sum</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>The content of line 4 is the essence of equation-based modeling. It all boils
down to two concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>c - (a + b) = 0</code> is an equation and <strong>equations are not assignment</strong> like the ones we’re used to
 write in C, Java, Python, etc.</li>
  <li><code>a = 4</code> and <code>b - 3 = 0</code> are located on lines 5 and 6. Both lines come after
 the first equation, and because <strong>equations are not assignment, their order does not matter</strong>.
 The only thing that matters is that the model has the same number of variables and equations.</li>
</ul>

<p>So it turns out that equation-based modeling is all about writing equations with code. The Modelica tool
of choice will know how to symbolically analyze the model, extract equations, substitute variables
in equations, sort them and apply the proper numerical methods to find the solution.</p>

<h4 id="working-with-causality">Working with Causality</h4>

<p>The equation-based paradigm opens the door to an interesting concept called a-causality.</p>

<p>Before focusing on the meaning and implications of a-causality let’s have a look at an example …</p></div></div></div>

June 30, 2020 | https://www.modernretail.co/startups/how-stitch-fix-built-a-culture-of-silence-among-stylists/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.modernretail.co/startups/how-stitch-fix-built-a-culture-of-silence-among-stylists/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>Two weeks after styling service Stitch Fix announced that it was laying off its 1,400 California stylists between now and the fall, morale was low in The Thread, the company’s internal messaging system. Stylists were discussing challenges they were facing in finding the right items to send to clients for their orders, internally called “fixes.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s SO disappointing when I really am trying my hardest and doing the absolute best I can for my clients, even when it’s semi-impossible due to lack of inventory,” wrote one stylist in a message viewed by Modern Retail. “Combined with the fresh feelings from losing this job, the pandemic, and everything else going on in the world…it’s just a lot to take.”&nbsp;</span></p><div id="piano-cta">
<p><span>A second stylist lamented how “it’s so hard when we aren’t given the tools to do our job, and we get criticism from both sides,” referring to customers, as well as managers, internally called leads. “What frustrates me the most is when we get vague communication like, ‘we know this will affect your metrics and we understand,’ yet we still get pressured when things go into the red,” she added.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>A styling supervisor jumped in telling stylists that “Covid has created some unique challenges with inventory vendors that are out of our control,” but that, “I can speak for all of us when I say that we want you to be supported and care so much about how this is making you feel.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“They are going to do what’s best by their shareholders,” said one Pittsburgh stylist, when asked by Modern Retail for her reaction to the message. “I do not feel supported.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Modern Retail spoke with eleven</span> <span>current and former stylists, more than half of whom joined the company before Stitch Fix’s 2017 IPO. All spoke on condition of anonymity, as Stitch Fix — like many tech companies — has a very broad <a href="https://investors.stitchfix.com/static-files/8715b2d9-c3e9-49e3-8e3a-b7f26f937b8b">definition</a> of what is considered confidential information that stylists aren’t supposed to disclose. Stitch Fix has all of its employees, including stylists, sign confidentiality agreements. </span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>Stitch Fix has long maintained that its business model is a blend of art and computer engineering. “We’re experts at both data science and human empathy,” its former CMO Deirdre Findlay <a href="https://www.adweek.com/inside-the-brand/women-trailblazers/how-stitch-fix-cmo-deirdre-blends-art-and-science-for-career-success/">told Adweek last year</a>, about its stylists. Stitch Fix has developed proprietary algorithms that are supposed to help better predict what clothes customers are interested in over time. Yet similar to other so-called tech platforms — like Uber — that rely on a growing fleet of part-time workers, this precarious workforce makes up the service’s real front lines.</span></p>
<p><span>But some stylists said they feel like the artistic side of the company has increasingly been devalued. Since launching in 2011, Stitch Fix has transitioned from a scrappy startup to a profitable publicly-traded company. The vast majority of stylists are part-time, don’t get access to health insurance and are given limited benefits, like one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours work. (</span><span>They are not, however, independent contractors like Uber driver.) </span></p>
<p><span>Stylists typically have to work between 15 and 29 hours per week, and depending on the region, start out at around $14 to $16 an hour. After a year with the company, they are promoted to “senior stylists,” and are given around a $1 raise to their hourly rate. Going forward from there, they are given raises if Stitch Fix has determined the cost of labor has risen in their particular zip code. One stylist said in nearly three years, her pay has risen just five cents per hour.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Some stylists also said that Stitch Fix has — in explicit and implicit ways — increasingly discouraged stylists from voicing negative feedback about internal changes and processes. Leads will turn off comments on threads announcing big internal changes, like the impending layoffs of California stylists. Stylists are instructed to post “kind” and “solution-based” messages in the Thread, which makes it hard for them to commiserate with coworkers, according to the current and former stylists Modern Retail spoke with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Because Stitch Fix’s stylists are remote, some of them feel like they don’t have many options to escalate feedback to the rest of the company, beyond speaking directly with their manager. During the pandemic, the current stylists that Modern Retail spoke with said they felt like they’ve received conflicting messaging from Stitch Fix about the company’s priorities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In response to a list of questions sent by Modern Retail, Stitch Fix provided the following comment: “</span><span>Our stylists are instrumental in building relationships with clients and creating the highly personalized experience Stitch Fix is known for. Their feedback, in partnership with our talented team of merchandisers and data scientists, helps us to continually improve the personalized recommendations of items and outfits we send to our clients.”</span></p>
<p><span>The statement went on: “All of our Stylists care deeply about their clients’ experiences and we encourage them to share feedback, ask questions and discuss learnings. We are committed to providing an open forum where this can take place in a safe and constructive way.”</span></p>
<p><span>The California stylists who are being laid off accounted for 1,400 of Stitch Fix’s roughly 5,100 stylists. Stitch Fix’s other styling hubs are in cheaper locations for the company to operate: Austin, Dallas, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis. So, Stitch Fix is instead hiring 2,000 part-time stylists in its other hubs between now and the end of next year, and offering laid off California stylists the option to apply to relocate to another styling hub. Stylists who do decide to relocate will get money to move, the company said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Multiple stylists told Modern Retail that these consolation moves were not enough.“[Stitch Fix] has a very toxically positive environment that I really bought into,” said one former California stylist. “I liked it, but in hindsight after being laid off, I now see that as not sincere and not authentic.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Running afoul of Threadiquette<br>
</b><span>When Stitch Fix went public in 2017, it had 2.3 million active clients. Today, that number is up to 3.4 million. The company lost $33.1 million in the most recent quarter due to challenges from the coronavirus. But up until this point, Stitch Fix has consistently reported a profit. In fiscal 2019, Stitch Fix reported a net income of $36.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span>The way that Stitch Fix’s model works is that customers pay $20 for a “fix,” in which stylists send customers five items of clothing and/or accessories they think a customer will like, based on what data the stylist has on that customer’s style. That $20 gets credited towards anything from their fix that they decide to buy. Over time, the company’s algorithms are supposed to be able to better predict what clothes a particular customer will like, and make it easier for the stylist to select clothes for that client.</span></p>
<p><span>Stitch Fix has long referred to its stylists as the “heartbeat” of the company. “It’s more than just an hourly job,” CEO Katrina Lake <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-tech/is-stitch-fix-the-goldilocks-of-fashion">told Business of Fashion in 2016</a>. Despite being on the front lines, some stylists feel they have few ways to air their grievances.</span></p>
<p><span>Stylists are judged on a variety of metrics, such as how many items their clients end up keeping. In the fall, Stitch Fix raised the number of fixes stylists are expected to complete per hour from 4.25 to 4.6, according to six current and former stylists, adding another new challenge.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The current and former stylists Modern Retail spoke with said they felt their ability to challenge or get answers on why some changes were made to their jobs were also hampered by Stitch Fix’s communication processes.</span></p>
<p><span>On the Thread, conversation is broken up by different business-related topics. Oftentimes, conversation will turn to laments about inventory, or stylists talking about if they are struggling with a particular fix. The stylists said that leads have sometimes jumped into discussions critical of the company and instructed stylists to take concerns directly to them via email. </span><span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re not in a typical company where you can go and stand by the water cooler and voice your frustrations to a coworker — not necessarily complaining about the company, but just…feeling like you are not alone,” said a second former California stylist. “It just seemed like you weren’t even allowed to do that because you were looked upon as being negative.”</span></p>
<p><span>There are rules governing use of the Thread — internally called ‘Threadiquette.’ “Thoughts and feedback are what drive change, but how those messages are delivered is important,” read one message viewed by Modern Retail instructing stylists on Threadiquette. Stylists are told to frame critiques with <a href="https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2020/05/12/how-people-drive-success-at-stitch-fix/">Stitch Fix’s OS</a> in mind; they’re instructed to be bright, kind and motivated by challenge.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, Stitch Fix defines “motivated by challenge” as being, in part, “someone who thrives in ambiguity and is resilient. Someone who operates with hunger, #StitchFixGrit, and perseverance.” The current and former stylists said that they sometimes feel Stitch Fix uses terms like grittiness and perseverance as an excuse to not make changes that stylists are pushing for, like to inventory or to the algorithms that they use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In an exchange viewed by Modern Retail, one stylist, for example, asked her lead for more specifics when Stitch Fix told stylists in 2019 that, going forward, it would be giving raises only if the cost of labor rose based on the zip code each individual stylists worked in. This was a change to the previous model — one that likely resulted in the stylist getting a pay cut. She expressed some disappointment to her lead about the change. The stylist’s lead changed the conversation away from compensation details and pointed her to Stitch Fix’s core values, including being “motivated by challenge,” asking if that clause resonated with her. The stylist interpreted her lead’s email as insinuating that she was not representing Stitch Fix’s core values by questioning company changes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This follows a trend; some stylists said leads …</span></p></div></div>

                    <h2 id="hardware-design"><em>Hardware Design</em></h2><p>When we left off in <a href="https://blog.sentienhq.com/the-story-of-sentien-part-ii/">Part II</a>, I had just come to the conclusion that, in order to make a truly seamless interface, I would have to design and build my own hardware. It was the only way to get an audio interface free of KO parameters like a short battery life, blocked ears, non-configurability, and an uncomfortable fit. </p><p>What did I know about hardware design before I got started? </p><p>Absolutely nothing.</p><p>Having tested a variety of headphones, headsets, and earbuds already, I knew that bone conduction tech was the best bet for getting an all-day experience. The other route was using directional speakers, but I wouldn’t have the option of tuning out of my surroundings by plugging my ears. This was essential because blocking outside noise improves concentration.</p><p>In the spirit of J. C. R. Licklider, my main premise was to augment humans in the most natural and efficient way. A way that helps us achieve our goals and be more conscious. An audio interface, as we established in Part II, was the best possible augmentation.</p><h2 id="designing-from-first-principles">Designing from first principles</h2><p>We’ll talk about hardware in a lot more detail in a separate blog post. For now, here’s an overview of my personal experience as a complete beginner.</p><p>I speculated that when building new hardware, I should start from first principles. How do you set up communication between a human and a computer? The fundamentals for a seamless interface are input, output, and ergonomics.</p><p>The goal is to maximise the bandwidth of information exchange and make sure this “relationship” benefits us. On one hand there is a computer, on the other hand there is us. What are the options?</p><h3 id="-us-">|Us|</h3><p><strong>Input:</strong> The base layer is the brain, but seamless BCI interfaces are not yet possible (as <a href="https://blog.sentienhq.com/the-story-of-sentien-part-ii/">we discussed in Part II</a>). I moved one layer up to our five senses: Sight, Hearing, Smell, Taste, Touch.</p><p>For <em>Sight</em>, AR glasses are too far off to be usable.</p><p><em>Smell </em>and <em>Taste </em>are…well, impractical. They’re rather low bandwidth for information, and the technology to support them will not fit in a wearable (as of now).</p><p><em>Touch </em>is interesting. Subtle nudges or taps can indicate a notification, a change of state. The information is mainly binary unless you are using morse code. However, the bandwidth on any complex information is low.</p><p><em>Hearing</em><strong>: </strong>spoken word is high in terms of bandwidth, and a natural way to receive information.</p><p><strong>Output:</strong> Well, one can imagine countless ways that we express ourselves and relay information. Speech, facial expressions, posture, gesturing, manipulating our environment…or lifting your eyebrows. Remember <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/25/snappables-snapchat-games/">the weightlifting snapchat filter game</a>?</p><p>In terms of human-computer interface, I focused on hand movements and speech. We learn to type fast. An interface made for rapid typing is not wearable—and not always accessible to you seamlessly. Some companies have tried creating wearable keyboards that looked similar to gloves, but people don’t use them. Plus they’re still too large.</p><h3 id="-computers-">|Computers|</h3><p><strong>Input: </strong>Any change in current can be considered an input for computers.</p><p><strong>Output: </strong>Computers combined with specific hardware can generate sound waves or light pixels, move physical things, print on paper…the only limit is our imagination (and technological advancements).</p><p>I filtered through the options and looked at possible output for wearables. Speakers, or bone conduction transducers, to transmit sound. Smart glasses to transmit light via pixels, or LED to indicate state. A touch pad on a headset for haptic taps.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Umg9Qr61GOAz7PmRP78XkcdFERP_Mw2NS6py3GXSz48GzkC1wW_x7P-oaeaStK1ykIVEs55RRYLh-12s9OFtLHsS2ia70cnvKWnQSbz3sDR_OXhWBejbcTe3EIjj_ltnzRJoEttQ" alt=""><figcaption>Haptic vibrating electronic parts. I wanted to test them to use for feedback as human input:</figcaption></figure><p>There has to be a way for the person to talk to the computer (output), and a way for the computer to talk to the person (input).</p><p>There were too many all-nighters and brainstorm sessions spent imagining the best interface. Crazy and impossible ideas making the best use of today’s tech. It was all worthwhile, but out of the scope of this blog.</p><p>Tl;dr—I had to make the interface disappear.</p><h3 id="-interface-">|Interface|</h3><p><strong>Output:</strong> <em>Speech (captured by microphones):</em> Microphones can pick up vibrations from the air, or from the body (Bone conduction microphones. The most common placements are on the throat or in the ear canal. I tested throat microphones and the quality was awful. They’re bulky and uncomfortable. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/B5_eI9ungGE?t=228">this video</a> if you want more info.) </p><p>In-ear microphones have been used in products such as Bragi Dash to improve sound quality.</p><p><em>Hand movements (captured by touch surfaces):</em> Buttons provide physical certainty that the action was performed. However, the pressure on one’s head is uncomfortable and the button mechanisms take up a lot of space on the wearable.</p><p>Touch surfaces felt more natural for interaction. The haptic response has to be built in to provide feedback for the user that the gesture was successful.</p><p><strong>Input</strong>: I really started from square one for input. How do we hear? Through our ears. What parts of the ear are involved for air conducted versus bone conducted sound? The sound travels through bone, so where on the skull should the transducer go? Forehead? Jaw? Near the ear?</p><p>I ordered various types of bone conduction transducers, got in touch with both high-end and low-end transducer manufacturers, and requested samples. Then I tested every possible location on my skull to see which position gave me the best sound quality and clarity.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/bone-conduction-transducer-samples.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/bone-conduction-transducer-samples.png 600w, https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/bone-conduction-transducer-samples.png 940w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bone conduction transducer samples</figcaption></figure><p>While figuring this out, I continued wearing various types of bone conduction headsets every day to help me understand what’s essential, what’s wrong with their design decisions, and how my day changed with this new technology.</p><p>I was able to stay connected throughout the day to both my surroundings and my phone. Because of bone conduction, I always had a choice between the two. I could easily block out a noisy environment in order to focus, just by putting in ear plugs.</p><p>Podcasts and music worked well. Calls and AI assistants were not usable due to poor microphone quality.</p><p>This was happening in wintertime, from 2016 to 2017, when I was finishing my degree and working in the design/art studio. I discovered that the back loop of the headset was not compatible with winter clothes. </p><p>It caught on jacket and coat hoods, scarves, and hats. The transducers would be pulled out of place, interrupting the audio.</p><p>I was also experimenting with various 3D-printed frames for the new design. Putting the transducers in the right place, applying the right pressure, and making sure the microphones were close to the source of sound.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/IMG_2241.JPG" alt="" srcset="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/IMG_2241.JPG 600w, https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/IMG_2241.JPG 1000w, https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/IMG_2241.JPG 1600w, https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/IMG_2241.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A prototype, one-ear headset</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-fit">The Fit</h2><p>Back to first principles again, I was designing the headset from scratch.

The discomfort was due to the headset getting in the way when I moved my head.</p><p>So I 3D scanned my head in all extreme positions (eg: looking up and right) and determined the place on the head that has the lowest delta in length between the two transducers in all of the extreme positions.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/3D-scans-of-imrichs-head--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/3D-scans-of-imrichs-head--1-.png 600w, https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/3D-scans-of-imrichs-head--1-.png 940w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>3D scans of my head</figcaption></figure><p>(And then later on I managed to get data on about 3,000 3D-scanned human heads from an anthropometry project, and determined the exact difference in lengths among the population.

            <p><span>Abstract.</span> Papers on leaderless consensus protocols such as EPaxos and Atlas describe the protocols from the ground up. This approach helps a reader without prior knowledge to understand how they work, but at the same time it makes it hard for an expert to grok them because they need to trace and check all the assumptions from scratch rather than rely on already proved protocols. This may explain why the leaderless consensus protocols didn't get traction in the industry despite being known since 2013.</p>

            <p>In this post I present a leaderless consensus protocol built in a modular way on top of known consensus protocol. Its modularity helps in understanding and retrofitting into existing solutions.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div><div>
            <p>From an engineering perspective a consensus protocol is a replication protocol. Usually it is used to replicate a state of an application (a state machine) to increase its availability. The key difference between consensus and primary-backup replication is an ability to tolerate node and network failures without losing integrity of the data.</p>

            <p>One may think of consensus replication as a strongly consistent variant of master-master replication where any replica (a proposer) can initiate a change. Althrouth consistency is never compromised in practice the concurrent processes may abort each other and stall the performance. In literature this situation is known as dueling proposers.</p>

            <blockquote>"It’s easy to construct a scenario in which two proposers each keep issuing a sequence of proposals with increasing numbers, none of which are ever chosen", Paxos Made Simple</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"The presence of two concurrent leaders can prevent the commitment of any consensus decision and hence prevent progress", Deconstructing Paxos</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"if multiple processes detect that there is no leaser and all attempt to become leader an the same time, then none of the process is likely to succeed (again dueling proposers)", Google SRE book</blockquote>

            <p>The can't be dismissed as a fluke, take latency of CASPaxos when all requests to change the <span>same object</span> land the same replica and latency of CASPaxos when the requests are uniformly distributed across all five replicas.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/dueling.png"></p><p>We see that when there are 20 clients then the dueling reduces throughput 2.85 times from 4513 ops/s to 1581 op/s and increases p99 latency 10.37 times from 4467 microseconds to 46 milliseconds.</p>

            <p>The absolute numbers and the degradation ratio depend on the hardware. For this and all the follow up experiments I simulated <code>5+c</code> nodes cluster (where <code>c</code> is the number of the clients) with around 178 us RTT between any nodes, 655 bytes/us network throughput, 2 ms fsync disk latency and 1132 bytes/us disk throughput, although I haven't pushed the system to the limit of the bandwidth so the throughput numbers for disk and network don't really matter.</p>

            <p>The shape of the charts surprised me. Usually when a system reaches saturation the latency looks linear while throughput reaches plateau and stops growing. But in this case the shapes are inverted which implies that the system is far from saturation and that we can keep adding clients increasing throughput without affecting latency. It happens because CASPaxos replicates state instead of the commands so a proposer can apply multiple commands in chain to the stored state and replicate only the final version (batching on steroids) reducing the load on the network.</p>

            <p>Leslie Lamport suggested using a leader election abstraction to select a leader (a distinguished proposer) which is the only one capable of processing requests. It's worth noting that the idea of a leader is used to reduce contention and not to enforce consistency. Meaning the leader election may be weak and may not prevent the case where several replicas become leaders for the same period of time. It allows the use of a large class of protocols for leader election including randomised timeouts &amp; heartbeats, consistent hashing routering or external arbiter.</p>

            <p>But the idea of leader election has its flaws:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>hardware issues may degrade performance of a leader and affect the whole system</li>
                <li>after a leader fails and until a new leader is elected, a consensus based system becomes unavailable</li>
                <li>randomised leader election under unstable network creates non-trivial failure modes which may delay election of a new leader</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I built a leadered version of consensus replication and used fault injection to demonstrate the issues. The stable leadership is compared with ad hoc leadership which is known to suffer from dueling proposers under normal circumstances. The leaderd system uses 4ms election timeout while the fault injector isolates a random replica for 12ms.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leader.adhoc.unrest.png"></p><p>For 20 clients the fault injections cause the stable leadership to have 2.46 times lower throughput (709 ops/s vs. 1750 ops/s) and 1.5 times higher p99 latency (60ms vs. 40ms) than an ad hoc leadership approach.</p>

            <p>It looks like we have to choose between scylla and charybdis: either to have 6.36 times lower than optimal throughput (4513 ops/s vs 709 ops/s) during unavoidable transient issues under strong leadership or to have throughput profile independent of failures (1581 ops/s and 1750 ops/s) but both 2.85 times less than optimal under ad hoc leadership.</p>

            <p>The question is if there is a compromise between being fast without failures and being fast on a rainy day. The family of leaderless consensus protocols fills that niche.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/epaxos.png"></p><p>EPaxos solves the contention problem and provides excellent fault tolerance. But despite being around for seven years it hasn't generated enough traction and I don't know any product in the industry which is using it. The lack of interest is especially noticeable if we compare EPaxos to Raft protocol which was discovered around the same time.</p>

            

            <p>The lack of popularity may be attributed to the complexity. I've found several reports on implementing EPaxos: <a href="https://medium.com/princeton-systems-course/reproducing-epaxos-by-ang-li-and-robin-qiu-b5a8fc5262a2">Reproducing EPaxos</a> by Robin Qiu and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6246">EPaxos</a> by Blake Eggleston, and both of them mention the complexity of EPaxos:</p>

            <blockquote>One major drawback of the algorithm is its complexity. From our understanding, EPaxos is more like a two-dimensional Paxos on top of an eventual-consistency-like layer.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>We only implemented the basic EPaxos, and it is already much more complicated than Raft. We believe the fully optimized EPaxos will be even more complicated. In practice, complicated algorithms are hard to design, optimize, and maintain, making them less likely to be adopted in production.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>It’s still pretty rough, I just wanted to get it to a point where we could get a feel for the performance advantages and decide if the additional complexity was worth it</blockquote>

            <p>Funny enough the complexity of the protocol <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10917.pdf">manifested</a> in the official reference implementation of the EPaxos and TLA+ proof having a bug which leads replicas to diverge and break the linearizability of the replicated service.</p>

            <p>This post is an attempt to design a leaderless consensus protocol but keep it simple via the modular approach by reusing already proved components.</p>

        </div></div>

        
          
        <div><div>
            <p>The core idea of the pacified consensus is to order client requests and to let replicas to co-execute the same request in parallel. The preordering reduces contention and parallel execution increases fault tolerance. Even when one replica gets isolated or goes offline another finishes its request without a delay because it is already working on it in parallel.</p>

            <p>The parallel execution doesn't affect correctness because the effects of the parallel execution can be explained by the selective duplication of messages and Paxos tolerates this kind of intrusion</p>

            <blockquote>"Messages can take arbitrarily long to be delivered, can be duplicated, and can be lost, but they are not corrupted", Paxos Made Simple</blockquote>

            <p>The task of ordering client requests in a fault tolerant way and replicating it to the replicas sounds like a consensus problem. It is natural to suggest that running two consensus replication processes can't be faster than running just one but actually it is.</p>

            <p>The trick is that a major part of the latency comes from the disk IO. Even when we use NVM but target high throughput we should make small delays to accumulate writes (4 ms) and write them in batches.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/nvm.png"></p><p>4 ms is 20 times higher than intra datacenter RTT, so in-memory consensus in front of on-disk consensus doesn't contribute much to the overall end to end latency but completely eliminates contention.</p>

            <p>This idea isn't just wild speculations, I've built it and measured the performance. And the leaderless consensus performs on par with leadered when there are no faults, latency is just 23% worse but throughput is 36% better.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leaderless.leader.png">

            The leaderless consensus with faults performs a bit worse than leaderless consensus without faults.

            <img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leaderless.unrest.png"></p><p>Without context 67% increase in P99 latency (9267us vs 5535us) and 12% decrease in throughput (6154 ops/s vs 5392 ops/s) doesn't look good but when we compare it with other solutions it's almost an order of magnitude better.</p>

  </span></p><p>Recently on my Twitter I’ve been seeing some buzz about a new email app called <a href="https://hey.com/features/">HEY</a>. It seems to improve some ergonomics with traditional approaches to email, like moving receipt emails to a “paper trail” area, better screening of new contacts, and some other things.</p>

<p>Fundamentally though, it’s still email under the covers. This made me wonder what an evolution of what email actually <em>is</em> would look like.</p>

<p>Maybe it would help to consider where email is already evolving. Email began as exchanging plain text electronic letters between humans but now it is used for so much more.</p>

<p>For example, every time you place an online order you immediately get an order receipt, sent from a machine. When your order ships you get an update with a tracking number. As your shipment proceeds towards your house, you get tracking updates until the item arrives. This isn’t traditional correspondence between humans any more, this is <strong>data exchange</strong>.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="data-schemas">Data schemas</h2>

<p>Google had in fact already recognized this evolution and introduced <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/reference">special markup</a> that annotates the unstructured text and image format of email into structured data. When a sender includes this structured data in an email, Google’s email service Gmail recognizes the type and can display display special <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/actions/actions-overview">“actions”</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/highlights">“highlights”</a>.</p>

<p>This structured data vocabulary is the same approach that Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">advises web developers to use</a> to help its crawlers accurately understand content across the Web by the way. For example, an online store annotating a product’s page with an <a href="https://schema.org/Offer">Offer</a> may give you a snippet like this in Google search results:</p>

    <em>Searching Google for a specific product may return <a href="https://econsultancy.com/what-are-rich-search-results-and-how-can-you-get-them/">rich results</a> like this</em>
  </p>

<p>Applying data schemas to mail messages is a rich vein that hasn’t been fully explored yet, and I think could enable new types of data to be stored that don’t fit in the mail-like mold. I’ll give some examples further down.</p>

<h2 id="public-writable-log">Public-writable log</h2>

<p>When I think of email as a data structure, I think of it as a public-writable <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">log</a>. Anybody who has my address is allowed to append to my log, given they pass some basic filtering (e.g. spam, size of message).</p>

<p>
    <em><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">Log</a> data structure</em>
  </p>

<p>I think this is the <strong>key insight</strong> of email and definitely worth keeping in the next evolution.</p>

<h2 id="data-sharing">Data sharing</h2>

<p>What email <em>doesn’t</em> currently have is a way to share access to your data with others.</p>

<p>What I think would be interesting is to be able to scope queries to certain pieces of data, and give read access to third parties for this data.</p>

<p>Let me give an example.</p>

<p>Right now, when I’ve placed online orders on various websites, I get a wide mix of different email notifications. Almost all of them email me a receipt for the order immediately. Most of them email me when the order ships. Some of them email me updates every time the status of the parcel changes.</p>

<p>Just to cover my bases, I’m also signed up for USPS Informed Delivery®, UPS My Choice®, and FedEx Delivery Manager®, so that I get notified whenever a package is scheduled to arrive at my address regardless of who it’s from (I don’t like surprises!).</p>

<p>It’s all very scattershot, and to keep track of what’s coming and going I’m usually jumping between emails, comparing tracking numbers here to order information over there.</p>

<p>What would be nice is if I had some personal dashboards, say one for Orders and one for Postal Mail that showed me the status of all my orders across all vendors, and all the postal mail that would be arriving soon (with hyperlinks between Orders and Postal Mail even). This could be either something I build myself, or a third party service that I allow keyhole access to just my orders and shipments from my personal log.</p>

<div>
  <p><img integrity="sha256-u+yZ6ECALFVEg+O85km7k4l57flfPL1Xs1cfwEBhtzg=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://abevoelker.com/assets/emails-successor/orders-example-bbec99e840802c554483e3bce649bb938979edf95f3cbd57b3571fc04061b738.png">
  </p>
</div>
<p>
    <em>What if you had an Orders dashboard like Amazon's, but for <strong>all</strong> your online orders?</em>
  </p>

<p>This may not sound that appealing if 99% of your orders come from Amazon. But when you order from a wide array of online shops, it could be useful. In the current climate of gun buying for example, I’ve had to use spreadsheets to keep track of what’s arriving from all the various vendors that I order from!</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I unironically love that gun-related shopping was spared the consolidation of Amazon et al and you still commonly buy gear from Geocities-esque sites like it's 2003 <a href="https://t.co/HWvZpXQAuK">https://t.co/HWvZpXQAuK</a> <a href="https://t.co/Drez8WkbTQ">pic.twitter.com/Drez8WkbTQ</a></p>— Abe Voelker (@abevoelker) <a href="https://twitter.com/abevoelker/status/1184218082144854017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>I’ll give more examples in the following sections.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-data-scope">Expanding data scope</h2>

<p>Right now there is a lot of personal data that doesn’t fit into email or a mail-like messaging system that would be a good fit for a personal log / database.<sup id="fnref:log-database"><a href="#fn:log-database">2</a></sup></p>

<p>For example, I’ve moved addresses several times over the last decade. Every other year or so I’ve seen a new optometrist, and I always opt to get those laser retina scans done. But I’m certain that every time I’ve switched to a new optometrist, there is no history carried forward from the previous optometrist - I have a bunch of retina scan records scattered across multiple offices.</p>

<p>What would be nice is if there was a “medical” section of my personal log, and my optometrist could (with permission) append my latest retina scan to my log, and (with permission) pull previous scans out for comparison. This way I’m the primary hub, and owner, of my own medical data.</p>

<div>
  <p><img integrity="sha256-YBEeSWj621eIWzlSa7Zt3jdqFen6wh2eH9MSyLpBOwY=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://abevoelker.com/assets/emails-successor/optomap-60111e4968fadb57885b39526bb66dde376a15e9fac21d9e1fd312c8ba413b06.jpg">
  </p>
</div>


<p>Obviously the above scenario could also apply to doctor and dentist visits.</p>

<h2 id="example---changing-mailing-address">Example - changing mailing address</h2>

<p>On the topic of changing addresses, if you’ve ever moved I’m sure you’re familiar with having to update all the various services you use with your new mailing address, and how you’ll almost certainly miss some.</p>

<p>Imagine if you could annotate your personal log with your current mailing address. When you move, you simply update this annotation, and authorized third parties are able to pull the new data (imagine something similar to a webhook).</p>

<p>Put another way, you could think of it as a rudimentary “home address DNS”:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i've often wanted home address DNS.</p>— Petulant Fig Nemesis (Mark 11:12-14) (@mwotton) <a href="https://twitter.com/mwotton/status/869696220347981824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2017</a></blockquote>

<h2 id="example---bank-accounts-and-financials">Example - bank accounts and financials</h2>

<p>Money is another fundamentally personal bit of data that would be interesting to include in the personal log.</p>

<p>What if your bank account and credit card ledgers were synchronized to your personal log? Instead of getting an email with a PDF or CSV statement at the end of the month, each individual credit or debit was immediately replicated to your log?</p>

<p>At the very least, I’d be grateful to have the full history of my bank account(s) in my log, because for some reason the banks I use seem to not show transactions past about a year.</p>

<p>And if my employer could attach my W-2 to my personal log (or schools attaching 1098-T, etc.), couldn’t filing taxes be as simple as running a rollup query against my (and/or my spouse’s) data? At least as a first approximation.</p>

<h2 id="open-question---other-data">Open question - other data?</h2>

<p>I’m curious what other type of data could fit in the personal log. On some occasions I’ve had to find my vehicle’s license plate number and VIN; previously I’ve had to search my email for PDF scans of insurance quotes I’ve gotten, but could this data live in the log as a first-class citizen?</p>

<p>Can the personal log be adapted to fit generalized notes, like people used to (still?) use Evernote? Or would that be too much sprawl? Could one build a structured data personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">knowledge graph</a> with it?</p>

<p>How about the people who do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">“quantified self”</a> tracking and measurements of their own bodies - seems like the personal log would be a good place to store that instead of some proprietary database. If your doctor could pull up your Apple Watch’s heart rate history and correlate that with the physician-kept medical records it seems like they could <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2019/11/through-apple-heart-study--stanford-medicine-researchers-show-we.html">do some cool things</a>.</p>

<p>What about all the pictures and video I take (particularly of my family); wouldn’t that be a good data stream to add to the personal log? Would it be easy to share data streams with say my wife or other family members?</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>There are plenty of difficulties to be addressed in building a system like the above.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">“Worse is better”</a> is an obvious consideration. Adding schemas to data opens up new possibilities, but the sheer simplicity of plain text remains empowering. The fact that Unix commands are still primarily strung together with plain text after half a century should be a testament to that.<sup id="fnref:shells"><a href="#fn:shells">3</a></sup> For this reason untyped data would still need to be supported in the personal log.</p>

<p>Security is another consideration. Like email, having an account stolen or forgetting credentials would be a very bad thing to happen. But when you’re adding fine-grained medical and financial data the stakes are much higher.</p>

<p>Further, deciding on schemas to use for the data could be a bit tricky. <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> does a good job with certain properties, although it’s not the only ontology in town.</p>

<p>Looking at medical data in particular, there would certainly be difficulties syncing up the different formats of electronic medical records (EMR), although in the US, the National Library of Medicine has created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Medical_Language_System">Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)</a> which does unify some of it.</p>

<p>Bank account ledgers would also have all kinds of different formats between banks and across international boundaries.</p>

<p>Yet, it would be interesting to see if the need for such a system would create incentives to unify some of this data that before seemed unlikely to ever be unified. If the Web can do it, why can’t this?</p>

    <article>

        

        <section>
            <p>I'm one of those people surprised at the success of the Go programming language. Here is a language that prides itself in offering less than languages designed decades ago, unabashedly not OOP, and without a decent dependency management system (at least initially), but still wildly successful, with a number of significant open source projects written in it (e.g. Docker, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform">Terraform</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>). Another intriguing thing is that people who use Go as their primary language rarely complain about it (maybe a <em>generics would be nice</em> here and there), while those who come into initial contact with it can't stop swearing, at least initially (<em>mea culpa</em>). I used this gap in affinity as a chance to understand the intricacies of Go by diving into the platform, and writing down what I think is necessary knowledge for newcomers to become productive on it. The target reader group would be developers already proficient in one language and platform; as the text is already quite long, I didn't want to explain common programming terminology. Unavoidably, my perspective is skewed by the technologies I'm acquainted with, especially Python, with which I frequently compare Go, but it should be useful for all newcomers, even those without too much programming experience. I hope that those already working in Go can also find a useful tip here and there.</p>

<p>And now to the "Why" in the title. The design of Go is a bit curious, in that it leaves out most features of other popular programming languages, going for simplicity rather than recommending itself with more features. My aim was to make a proper attempt at understanding the context for this choice, by following the path from expectations from a language, to design principles, to language features, and finally to the embodiment of the language in terms of compiler, runtime and tooling. This process is never perfect for any technical product, as there are incidental turns taken at every step, but I think the knowledge of how different aspects of a language came to be the way they are, while depending on each other and the context, is very important and useful. I therefore attempted to start with an overview of the "intellectual" history of Go, connecting following discussions of features to this history.</p>

<p>This first part in what I intend to be a two-part series will concentrate on the Go toolchain, that is, the set of tools for writing, verifying, compiling and maintaning Go applications. As we will see, Go tooling has come a long way, and offers a first-class development environment for writing correct and performant applications. The second installment will deal with the most important features of the language, also in the light of Go design decisions. I would like both parts to stay as up-to-date and relevant as possible, so if you have any comments on improving, do leave a comment, and I will make sure to address it.</p>

<h3 id="whyisgothewayitis">Why is Go the way it is?</h3>

<p>In order to appreciate the design decisions that went into the Go language, it's important to understand where the language designers started from, and what problems they expected their language to solve. As Rob Pike explains in detail in <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article">this article</a> from 2012, Go was not designed to experiment with PLT concepts. The languages and technologies it intended to replace were those in daily use at Google (C++, Java and Python); Go was designed to solve the problems these platforms presented at Google scale. A rough three-part categorization of the problems Go is intended to address can be done as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Build issues</strong>: The problems that C and C++ model of compilation presents are well-known. As explained in the linked article, compiling a moderately large C++ codebase can lead to gigabytes of IO. Go avoids this and similar issues by making unused imports an error, and replacing header files and includes with an inverted dependency model of compilation. Circular imports are also not allowed. One interesting side effect of this stress on dependency hygiene is that copy-paste is preferred to importing large packages:</p>

  <p>Dependency hygiene trumps code reuse. One example of this in practice is that the (low-level) net package has its own integer-to-decimal conversion routine to avoid depending on the bigger and dependency-heavy formatted I/O package. Another is that the string conversion package strconv has a private implementation of the definition of 'printable' characters rather than pull in the large Unicode character class tables; that strconv honors the Unicode standard is verified by the package's tests.</p>

<p><strong>Developer ergonomics</strong>: Go is a minimalist language that tries to do away with features of languages used at Google, such as C++, Java and Python, which are not coincidentally also quite popular in the rest of the dev community. In fact, as <a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html">this candid blog post</a> explains, the initial drive to develop Go came from unpleasant experiences developing concurrent code in C++, and the intention of the standards committee to make the language even more complex. While differentiating itself from popular languages, Go cannot stray too far away from them, as it is intended to be used in production at a company the size of Google. As such, it has to be easy to learn, and familiar to junior developers. This simplicity is at the service of solving modern programming challengs, foremost being concurrency. Concurrency in Go is provided through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">communicating sequential processes (CSP)</a>, the advantage of which is that it is easy to integrate into a procedural language. Another modern feature that now meets a C-like language in Go is garbage collection. Due to the type system and memory allocation features of Go, however, garbage collection is different from the way it works in languages like Java or Python; we will discuss this in the follow-up post.</p>

<p><strong>Google-scale</strong>: The design of Go is optimized for disambiguity and parsability. The underlying reasons are the ease of writing external tools and avoiding discord in large developer teams. As an example, Pike <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_4.">mentions</a> that having languages that are whitespace-sensitive, such as Python, is not an issue in itself, but Python embedded in SWIG declarations turns out to be a huge problem. In order to preclude such nuisances, Go has curly braces and clear formatting rules. Another example is the now famous auto-formatting tool that provides a standard through implementation. This, and similar tools like <code>gofix</code> which we will discuss later, are possible because the language is easy to parse and unambiguous (in comparison to e.g. C++, which can have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse">statements that can be parsed multiple ways</a>). These tools enable standards to be set within large groups, and also systematic changes such as API changes to be made on large code bases. Generally, it can also be said that the rest of the design concerns gathered in the previous categories also contribute to scaling Go, especially those concerning concurrency primitives and strong standard library support. Another aspect of scale is the number of people working on a project. As Pike correctly observes, developers tend to stick to a subset they understand of a complex language with many features. As Go has a rather limited set of features, there is no subset to agree on.</p>

<p>Obviously, not all the design choices that went into Go can be explained through these points. There are quite a number of things that are put to good use in other languages, but are explicitly shunned in Go, such as OOP, exceptions and generics. In my opinion, there is one general thread that connects the dots, which is that in Go, things that are a pain in the large are not allowed in the small, either. Or in <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_7.">Rob Pike's words</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As with many of the design decisions in Go, it forces the programmer to think earlier about a larger-scale issue … that if left until later may never be addressed satisfactorily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another important aspect you need to keep in mind when reading Go documentation, and wondering at how <em>basic</em> it is, is that priorities in keeping the implementation simple and feasible in certain areas led the designers to simply omit what one takes for granted in other languages, but leads to hidden complexity in the implementation. As stated in the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_doesnt_Go_have_feature_X">official FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go was designed with an eye on felicity of programming, speed of compilation, orthogonality of concepts, and the need to support features such as concurrency and garbage collection. Your favorite feature may be missing because it doesn't fit, because it affects compilation speed or clarity of design, or because it would make the fundamental system model too difficult.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="thegotoolchain">The Go toolchain</h3>

<p>The core of the Go toolchain is the <code>go</code> command line tool that bundles the most important components, including the compiler. In the rest of this text, Go refers to the language and ecosystem, whereas go (with lowercase g) refers to the command line tool. Go adheres to the recent pattern of delivering development tools where the entry point is one single command which accepts a first argument as an action (other examples could be git and kubectl). In daily work, when building Go code, one rarely has to deal directly with the actual compiler or linker, which are hidden somewhere in the Go distribution. The Go compiler is in fact written in Go itself, and thanks to this fact and the snappy compile times, boostrapping the Go toolchain is one of the simplest ways to get an up-to-date version on your computer. You will first need to get the out-of-date but still useful version of go from system repositories, as in <code>apt install golang</code>. Afterwards, download the latest source package …</p></section></article></div></div>

If so, you're not alone&nbsp;— and there is Canadian science to back you up.</p>  <p>As political and business leaders push to reopen the economy hoping to get restaurants, retailers and factories making money again, there may be good economic reasons for putting at least some of the work-from-home crowd back into the office as fast as it's safe to do so.</p>  <p>Canadian research on "computer-mediated communication," begun long before the current lockdown, shows video chat is an inadequate substitute for real-life interaction. The real thing, dependant&nbsp;on non-verbal cues, is extraordinarily more effective in creating rapport and getting ideas across.</p>  <p>Not only that, but the familiarity and trust we currently feel with coworkers during the lockdown's remote calls rests on connections remembered from back when we sat at a nearby desk or met for lunch.</p>  <h2>Bad for business</h2>  <p>As the lockdown stretches out and the mix of colleagues changes, it may be almost impossible to establish healthy trusting working relationships using remote video chat tools alone.</p>  <p>That's bad for business, said&nbsp;organizational behaviour specialist Mahdi Roghanizad from Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Business. The reason:&nbsp;getting a good reading on your fellow workers has been repeatedly shown to be essential for business efficiency, reaching common goals&nbsp;and establishing trust.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | 'Zoom fatigue' is real and it's setting in:&nbsp;</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Many people are feeling drained because of an increase in video conferencing and psychologists have started describing it as “Zoom fatigue.”<!-- --> <!-- -->2:06</span></span></span></p>  <p>It is why teams <u><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/employment-remote-work-1.5269792" target="_blank">that worked remotely</a></u> even before the pandemic lockdown always met periodically in person. The latest research shows human-to-human bonding is like a kind of intuitive magic.</p>  <p>"Say you are seeing a person for the first time," explained Roghanizad. "After two&nbsp;to five&nbsp;minutes of interaction, you will have a better chance of a more accurate prediction about their cooperativeness or generosity. This is how our brain evolved."</p>  <p>The crucial point is that merely "seeing" the person is not enough.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This ability goes away when the same interaction happens in video-to-video communication as is happening today through Zoom or Google Meet or Skype," explained Roghanizad, who started his career as an electrical engineer and has since used the tools of hard science to investigate the failures of computerized communication.</p>    <p>The scientist's interest began more than decade ago with&nbsp;research quoted in the Harvard Business Review that showed face-to-face communication was <u><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-face-to-face-request-is-34-times-more-successful-than-an-email" target="_blank">34 per cent more effective</a></u> than email in persuading people to donate to a good cause.</p>  <p>To those of us today with loaded electronic in-boxes, the results of that research may not be surprising. At the time, however,&nbsp;it was considered revolutionary because people in the study expected outcomes for email and personal contact to be about the same.</p>  <p>The results inspired Roghanizad and others to look into the reasons why person-to-person contact increased bonding and established a sense of trustworthiness.</p>  <h2>The smell of success</h2>  <p>Candidates included pheromones — the subtle fragrances we give off — plus a series of muted hand and body gestures such as crossing your arms and leaning back that in various combinations researchers have shown inspire confidence and "are predictive of economic behaviour," according to one <u><a href="http://robotic.media.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/01/Desteno-etal-PS-12.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a>.</u></p>  <p>Roghanizad's most recent research is helping to prove is that without real-life contact, those non-verbal cues simply don't register in a key interactive part of the human brain responsible for what scientists call "<u><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2695977050" target="_blank">theory of mind</a></u>" —that creation of understanding between people working in groups.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A dog looks at Brussels Grand Place square as restaurants and bars reopen after the COVID-19 lockdown earlier this month.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                    <p>Secure, easy to use, cheap: Pick three</p><p>I recently installed Ubuntu Wacky Whatever, the latest version, and I’m very excited about it shipping with SSH 8.2, which means that I can finally use hardware USB keys for secure, easy to use authentication.
If securing your devices has been something you’ve wanted to easily do yourself, read on, because it’s finally happening.</p>
<h2>FIDO2</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting security-related developments recently has been the development of <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a> and FIDO2, which are basically euphemisms for “nice security stuff”.
In summary, WebAuthn and FIDO2 aim to make it really easy to use security devices with stuff by standardizing the way the two talk to each other, and using better terms than “stuff”.</p>
<p>This is great news for us, because now we can have dirt-cheap USB keys that can be used to secure all our authentication very easily, without requiring any special security knowledge.
All you need to know to be completely immune to phishing, password theft, and a whole host of other ways of losing Bitcoin is to just plug your USB key in, press the little button/type your PIN/enter your fingerprint, and you’re logged in.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with SSH?
Very little, but<!-- break --> I like rambling, it is known.</p>
<h3>Using FIDO2 with SSH</h3>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/shoulder-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/OLzlXZm_mOw" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/OLzlXZm_mOw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>Deanna had heard of phishing, and was extremely suspicious of the sound of rubber boots.</span></p></div><p>As you may have suspected from the two seemingly unrelated points above, and the dead giveaway title of this section, it would be tremendous if we could use FIDO2 keys to authenticate over SSH, and the OpenSSH developers made it happen.
OpenSSH now supports FIDO (U2F) and FIDO2 for authentication, with FIDO2 with resident keys having a nicer UX.</p>
<p>At a high level, the USB device (FIDO2 devices don’t have to be USB, but they usually will be) will generate a <span data-expounder="secret-key">secret key</span>.
<span data-expounded="secret-key">
The device can then use this secret key to prove that you have the device in your possession, without the key ever leaving the device.
That means that, by extension, you can use the device to prove you are who you say you are to any server who asks.
</span>
The key is either stored on the device (called “resident key”), which requires the device to support storage, or it isn’t, and <span data-expounder="storage">you need to store the data somewhere else</span>.</p>
<p><span data-expounded="storage">
The way this works, in my understanding (which I’m not certain about and please correct me if I’m wrong), is the following:
Each device comes from the factory with one key pair/seed built in, but it can accept an additional seed to derive more pairs from, by combining its current seed with the one given.
This allows devices to generate keys without having any storage space, but it does require you to be giving them the seed every time.
Devices with “resident key” capabilities can store the whole seed on their memory, and don’t need you to do anything else.
</span></p>
<p>The benefit of using a device like this including eliminating phishing, password theft, authentication replay, and lots of other attacks.
Since the device authenticates to a specfic realm (server address/URL/etc), an attacker can’t reuse one site’s authentication on another site, which makes phishing impossible.
Nobody can steal your password or private key either, since it’s on the device itself and extracting it is impossible.
The only plausible attack is physical theft with the device, which is mitigated by making the device ask for a PIN or fingerprint and wiping itself after a few wrong attempts.</p>
<p>Another benefit with having this built into SSH is that you don’t specifically need a Yubikey, or to mess with extra software like Yubikey agent, PIV mode or anything else.
You just plug any FIDO2-compatible key in, and you can use it with SSH.
I tried the following on both my Yubikey 5C, Yubikey FIDO2 and Yubikey NEO, they worked like a charm on all of them, but “resident key” mode only works on the 5C and later versions of the FIDO2 key.</p>
<h2>Actual usage</h2>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/padlocks-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/bBavss4ZQcA" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/bBavss4ZQcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>With twelve padlocks, the city of Indianapolis was sure it had put a stop to miscreants stealing its favorite fence.</span></p></div><p>After all the needless detail about how devices work, we’re ready to actually use one for SSH.
Setting that up is really simple, basically one or two commands (depending on the method) with no extra software to install, though you will need to be running OpenSSH 8.2 on both client and server.</p>
<p>I will split the instructions into two parts, one for if your key supports (and you want to use) the resident key mode, and one for if it doesn’t.
There’s no harm in using either method, so if you don’t know if your device supports resident key mode, just try the first method and continue to the second one if it fails.</p>
<h3>Resident key mode</h3>
<p>Use the following command to generate a key and store it on the device:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>SSH will ask you to enter your PIN and touch your device, and then save the key pair where you told it.
If that command complains about ed25519 not being available, try this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -O resident -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>OpenSSH will save two files, one called <code>id_mykey_sk</code>, and one called <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code>.
You only really need the latter, it’s your public key, and you can now add it to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file of any server that runs OpenSSH 8.2 and above.</p>
<p>To add your private key to the SSH agent, you can either copy <code>id_mykey_sk</code> to your <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory, or (if you’re at a new computer and don’t have the key with you), run</p>

<p>with your device plugged in.
This will add the key to the SSH agent, and you will be able to connect to servers immediately.</p>
<h3>Non-resident key mode</h3>
<p>The non-resident key mode is the same as the previous mode, except you can’t load your key with <code>ssh-add -K</code> directly from the device.
As before, run:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>SSH will ask you to enter your PIN and touch your device, and then save the key pair where you told it.
If that command complains about ed25519 not being available, try this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>OpenSSH will save two files, one called <code>id_mykey_sk</code>, and one called <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code>.
You need both of these files, store <code>id_mykey_sk</code> in your <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory (where it got generated) and add the <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code> file to any server you want to log in to.</p>
<p>That’s it, when you try to log in, OpenSSH will ask you for your PIN and to touch the device.</p>
<h2>Security considerations</h2>
<p>You can pass the <code>no-touch-required</code> option to <code>ssh-keygen</code> to tell it that you don’t want it to require touching the device every time, but I haven’t had great results with enabling that.
If you try it, let me know how well it works in the comments, but it’s probably better for security if you leave it disabled.</p>
<p>Storing your key on the device means that nobody will be able to steal it (hopefully your device has a PIN or other authentication method set), but untrusted computers might still be able to send commands over the SSH session after you connect.
Don’t SSH from computers you don’t trust, and be extra careful when using SSH forwarding (the <code>-A</code> option), as the server can then ask your computer to authenticate to other servers on your behalf.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I’m very excited about FIDO2 in general, and for SSH authentication specifically, because we finally have a way to secure authentication that my parents can easily use, with a much smaller attack surface.
I’m particularly interested in seeing how WebAuthn takes off for authenticating on the web without usernames and passwords (see my <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/django-webauthin">django-webauthin</a> library for a demo), and hope it becomes widespread.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="banner"> <div> <div> <div>  <h4>29 Jun 2020</h4> <p> <i></i> Reading time ~14 minutes </p><!-- /.entry-reading-time --> </div> <p>In 2005, the .NET Framework had its 1.1 SP1 release and was relatively stable. Visual Studio .NET 2003 was a solid release. C# was being widely adopted throughout the industry. Selecting it for a project cost me my job, and nearly sunk my career as a software developer.</p> <!--more-->  <p>This was almost two decades ago, so I feel comfortable discussing it now. I was working as a software developer at Hewlett-Packard in Nashua, New Hampshire, USA. HP had recently merged with Compaq, and absorbed the office buildings and personnel that were once Compaq, and Digital Equipment Corp. before that. Our project was called ActiveAnswers, a Content Management System (CMS) that existed before the term was coined.</p> <p>When I joined Compaq in 2000, ActiveAnswers was a set of HTML templates and text files that were converted into a massive static web site every night. During the day, content editors would make changes by editing the text files. The site used dozens of Perl scripts to combine the content from the text files with the HTML templates.</p> <p>Over the next couple of years, my team of five people had completely rewritten the application into a mostly WYSIWYG UI that permitted our content editors to make changes directly in a web browser, seeing the results almost immediately. All of the content was stored in a SQL Server database. The front end code was written in VB 6, and was starting to feel a little overweight.</p> <p>We had adopted many of the practices of the newly-released eXtreme Programming methodology. The project had automated unit tests and daily (if not continuous) builds. We even built a pair-programming lab. I wish I still had pictures, because doing that in 1999 was a sight to behold. We had taken over a former QA lab. It was about 16 x 24 feet, with windows on the long walls, and it had a locking door. We set up stations around the perimeter of the room, each consisting of a laptop docking station, a 21” monitor, keyboard, mouse, and two chairs. Each station had plenty of room for two without crowding the adjacent station. In the center of the room was a conference table with room for all of us.</p>  <p>Not long after, Hewlett-Packard decided that they needed to be bigger than Dell. So instead of competing with Dell head-to-head, they decided to get bigger the new-fashioned way: they bought another company. The new company was indeed larger than Dell – for about six months.</p> <p>As soon as the deal closed, the new HP (NYSE: HPQ) was the #1 computer maker in the world. Within six months, however, Dell had regained its #1 position and dropped HP to a solid #2. HP was suddenly in trouble, being dragged down by a bloated Compaq organization. That was their story, at least.</p> <p>It was time to cut away some of the bloat. HP announced a 10% “reduction in workforce.” I suppose they call it that because it sounds better than a “lay off.” It also sounds better than “you’re fired!”</p> <p>Amazingly, most of the people with whom I worked did not seem to care. In fact, many were excited by the prospect of getting a great “layoff package.” In case you are not familiar with these, a layoff package is money given to the suddenly out-of-a-job employee. In my case, only having been an employee for two years, I was only eligible for six weeks of pay.</p>  <p>After the merger, the team and project experienced some significant growing pains. Executives at HP had seen ActiveAnswers and wanted to expand its reach. They wanted to ensure the team could handle the additional workload.</p> <p>All of the contractors on the team were made a similar offer: accept a full-time job with HP at a reduced pay rate, or be replaced. A few of us chose to remain. One colleague in particular, who was instrumental in designing and building the application’s UI, chose to leave. He was unceremoniously replaced with two junior contractors who combined were far less effective than he had been. Although we had more work to do, morale was low for those who remained.</p>  <p>Over the next few years, our team of five grew to 20. Four times the size does not equate to four times the productivity. In many ways, we seemed to be much less effective. We struggled to keep up with the ever-expanding business requirements. Feature after feature was requested. New users and new content were added, putting a strain on an architecture that had been built for fewer than a dozen users. Training demands increased. The venerable VB6 was showing its age. It was time for something new.</p> <p>The company provided all of its developers with an MSDN Subscription, and a few us were excited by the release of Visual Studio 2003. Windows XP was still fresh, and the two seemed to work flawlessly together. We decided to start experimenting with .NET and C# to see whether we could provide the users with the features and the performance they needed.</p>  <p>At first, the idea of switching to a newer technology was met with mild curiosity. The leadership authorized a proof of concept. “Go do something and then show the rest of the team.”</p> <p>We decided to hire a contractor with proven experience in .NET, though the fact that it was only a couple of years old made this difficult. We found a local consultant who had been using it since its introduction.</p> <p>One of the tasks we assigned to him was to review our new .NET code and let us know where and how it could be improved.</p> <h2 id="trycatch-as-flow-control">Try/Catch as Flow Control</h2> <p>One of the first things he uncovered was large blocks of nested try/catch statements used to implement complex flow control. One instance he found was a single function with six or seven nested try/catch blocks. When asked about it, the developer who had implemented the function said he had heard that if/then was inefficient, so he used try/catch instead. No amount of persuasion could convince him that he had it backwards.</p> <h2 id="for-every-rule-there-is-an-exception">For Every Rule There is an Exception</h2> <p>Speaking of try/catch, every time an exception was caught, it was swallowed, and a new exception was thrown in its place. The pattern in .NET is to catch only those exceptions you can handle. The rest should bubble up naturally to higher levels of your application. It is acceptable to catch and rethrow, but there are only a few specific ways to do that. Throwing a brand new exception is not usually one of them. Trying to explain that to the other developers resulted in repeated explanations that it was the consultant who did not understand. My favorite line from those meetings was, “Let me say it again so you’ll understand.”</p> <h2 id="isup">IsUp</h2> <p>One of the improvements that had been made was the implementation of a set of web services. Our consultant discovered that every web service call was preceded by a separate call to an endpoint called “IsUp” to ensure the web server was listening, before making the actual call.</p> <p>In 2005, bandwidth was not quite what it is in 2020, and each call was relatively expensive. Not only was this wasteful, it also did not accomplish its goal. On more than one occasion, IsUp would return true, and the next call would fail anyway due to the service being down.</p> <p>Upon learning about this revelation, our management decided it would probably not hurt anything to leave it in place.</p> <h2 id="everyone-into-the-pool">Everyone Into the Pool</h2> <p>One of the benefits .NET offered was robust database connection pooling. The pattern Microsoft suggested was to create an ADO.NET connection object every time you needed one, and release it immediately when you have finished using it. The system would maintain a pool of connections behind the scenes for you.</p> <p>Rather than using ADO.NET, however, one of our contractors decided that it would make more sense to roll his own connection pooling system. When our new consultant pointed this out, he was accused of not understanding the subtle advantages our own pooling system had over Microsoft’s.</p>  <p>After a few weeks of this, our new consultant was beyond frustrated. We sat down and had a heart-to-heart talk. He felt he was adding no value to the project or the team. His suggestions were ignored or belittled. In fact, my manager essentially told him that his services were no longer required, and that his contract would not be renewed. I asked him whether he would stick around until it ended. His reply was amusing. He said that although he could stay and continue to “turn the money crank,” he felt that doing so would compromise his professional integrity. Six weeks after he started, our consultant left.</p>  <p>Right about the time our .NET consultant left, the word came down from management that our .NET experiment was a failure, and that we were to go back to VB 6 for all new code.</p> <p>A few short weeks later, we were having a particularly difficult problem with one of our application components. VB simply did not have the language facilities to deal with this particular issue without massive brute-force coding. C#, on the other hand, had a very straightforward way to solve the problem.</p> <p>I finally made the decision to implement that particular component in C#. My plan was to show management that .NET was still a viable option for our project, and this small enhancement would be the proof. The solution was everything I had hoped it would be: short, elegant, and easy to understand.</p> <p>At this point in the story, I wish I still had the source code that I could share. However, <a href="https://walkingriver.com/perjury">I learned the hard way not to keep source code when leaving a company</a>.</p>  <p>We had a policy on our team that each new feature would be revealed on a team-wide NetMeeting conference, attended by anyone interested. The primary developer on the feature would explain it, show the passing unit tests, demonstrate the feature, and then answer questions from the rest of the team. We had these meetings a few times per week, as I recall.</p> <p>This call was my time to shine, or so I imagined. I went through all of the normal steps, and all was going well. There were four critical things about this particular call that will soon become apparent:</p> <ol> <li>Most of the team was on the call, about 25 in total.</li> <li>My manager was in attendance.</li> <li>HP’s enterprise …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

      <p><em>This is Part 4 in a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/">series on tacit knowledge</a>. Read <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/three-kinds-of-tacit-knowledge/">Part 3</a> here.</em></p><p>We can’t really talk about tacit knowledge today without talking about YouTube.</p><p>A couple months ago, Samo Burja wrote an essay on Medium titled <a href="https://medium.com/@samo.burja/the-youtube-revolution-in-knowledge-transfer-cb701f82096a">The Youtube Revolution in Knowledge Transfer</a>, a piece that I loved and linked to in <a href="https://us17.campaign-archive.com/?u=843adfbaa3230c81aa0738b53&amp;id=0ced4f1a2c">issue 50</a> of the Commonplace newsletter. Burja observed the following things:</p><ul><li>First, YouTube is now a <em>thing</em>.</li><li>Second, quality digital cameras have become cheap enough for mass use. This in turn means that everyone can start producing YouTube-worthy content, and have those videos be discoverable, because — hey! — YouTube is now a thing.</li><li>Three, this <em>also</em> means that people with expertise is <em>thing X</em> can now film themselves doing <em>thing X</em>, and clued-in practitioners can watch these experts do <em>thing X</em> and become <em>really good themselves.</em></li><li>Burja then posits that we’ll see an explosion of tacit skill transfer over the next decade, correlated with the rise of YouTube use, because certain kinds of human expertise may only really be taught through emulation, not through instruction alone.</li></ul><p>Burja’s whole essay is great, and I urge you to read it in <a href="https://medium.com/@samo.burja/the-youtube-revolution-in-knowledge-transfer-cb701f82096a">full</a>.</p><p>But there’s a twist here. I linked to Burja’s piece in Issue #50 of my newsletter, which went out on the 24th of September 2019. Burja’s piece was published on the 18th of September. And I’m writing this on the 29th of June the next year. So it’s basically taken me more than nine months before I realised that Burja’s observations may be <em>generalisable</em> — that is, once you realise that YouTube is a great place to learn tacit things, this fact applies to skills <em>far beyond</em> the set of skills Burja talks about in his essay.</p><p>In this piece, we’re going to walk through a number of ways you may use YouTube for tacit knowledge acquisition, on a domain-by-domain basis. I’m afraid the anecdotes here are necessarily domain-specific, but the purpose of this piece is to give you certain patterns that you may adapt to whatever skillset you want to acquire in whatever domain you’re interested in.</p><h2 id="youtube-use-in-judo">YouTube use in Judo</h2><p>Let’s start with Judo.</p><p>I'm biased here because I played Judo competitively as a teenager. But Judo is interesting for our purposes because it isn’t a particularly popular sport. In Malaysia, where I’m from, the number of people who play Judo can probably fit into a small football stadium. And the active players — the ones who do Judo regularly — can probably fit into half that. Contrast this population with a sport like badminton, say, or football, or tennis.</p><p>What this means is that it is difficult to get good as a judoka in most countries around the world. This fact isn’t limited to Malaysia; in the US, for instance, pretty much every Olympic Judo champion comes from a tiny family-run club called Pedro’s Judo Centre in Wakefield, Massachusetts. Judo isn’t particularly popular outside the club, either. If you find yourself anywhere else in the country: tough luck.</p><p>During the worst of the COVID-19 lockdowns earlier this year, Malaysian Judo coach Oon Yeoh began interviewing international Judo players from all over the world, in a series he named <em>Judo In The Time of COVID-19</em>. He <a href="https://kljudo.com/judo-concepts-lesson-22-how-to-analyze-a-video-clip/">wrote</a>, of that experience:</p><blockquote>One thing I noticed after interviewing many judo players is that those from very strong judo nations tend not to watch so many judo videos whereas those who come from countries where judo is not so strong, tend to watch a lot of judo videos.<p>The reason is obvious. If you're from a strong judo nation, there's a lot of institutional support and good coaching, as well as sufficient training partners, training opportunities and competitions. All these combined give you everything you need to develop your skills in judo. <strong>But if you live in a place where there's very little judo, you're pretty much left to your own devices. In such circumstances, video is the best resource for you to learn things. </strong><em>(emphasis mine)</em></p></blockquote><p>Oon first learnt Judo in the US, and was exposed to video-based training from the beginning of his career. (To my knowledge, he remains — to this day — the only Malaysian to have fought in the World Championships). When he says ‘video is the best resource for you to learn things’, we have to be very clear what he means by this.</p><p>If you go to YouTube right now and enter a Judo technique, for instance, ‘uchimata’ — you’ll get a results page like so:</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-29-at-8.17.46-PM-1.png"></figure><p>The top result is an instructional by US Judo coach Shintaro Higashi:</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnMoNfZ2WiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Higashi’s video on uchimata is particularly good, and instructionals are probably what you’re thinking of when you hear ‘YouTube’ and ‘learning’. But instructionals <em>aren’t</em> the only thing that Oon is talking about.</p><p>What Oon is more interested in is <em>analysis of competition footage</em>. I asked him to explain how he used video for this purpose, and he <a href="https://kljudo.com/judo-concepts-lesson-22-how-to-analyze-a-video-clip/">did</a>:</p><blockquote>Let's say you want to learn how a particular player does a particular technique. Here are some best practices:<p>a) Don't just watch just one or two examples of that player doing that technique. Watch multiple examples and try to identify trends or things that that player does in setting up the throw. Take for example, Takato's unique style of ouchi-gari. If you watch enough of them, you'll notice he only does this technique under very specific circumstances (against left-handers who are trying to push his head down). If you notice that, try to understand the reason why.</p><p>b) Pay particular attention to grips. How does he grip whenever he wants to do this technique. You will notice a familiar pattern to the gripping. Again, try to understand why.</p><p>c) There will be times when the technique fails. Watch those as well and try to understand what went wrong. What was different about this attempt that caused it to fail? Doing this will allow you to isolate the key success factors.</p><p>d) Try to look out for variations. Sometimes those differences are very subtle but they are significant. Understanding the variations (when they are used and why the variation are necessary) will give you a better grasp of the technique.</p><p>e) It is usually helpful to watch the technique in slow motion. If there is no slow motion replay of the clip available, you may have to download the clip and slow-mo it yourself using a simple video editing program. When I was a student there was no digital videos yet, only VHS cassettes, and I had to use two VCR machines to make slow motion loops of Koga's throws just so I could study them properly!</p></blockquote><p>In a separate interview with US Olympic silver medallist Travis Stevens, Oon asks about video, and Stevens <a href="http://kljudotraining.blogspot.com/2020/04/judo-in-time-of-covid-19-travis-stevens.html">answers</a>:</p><blockquote>There is a lot the cadets can do at home to prepare them for future success. Like <strong>learning how to break down a fight when watching videos, taking notes on training sessions</strong> <em>(emphasis mine)</em>, journaling, etc. Winning at judo isn’t just about hard work. There’s a lot more that goes into it than that, like analysis, mental training and so on.</blockquote><p>Why study competition footage, and not just instructionals? The answer falls out of everything we’ve explored in our previous posts on tacit knowledge. Expertise is difficult to explicate, and embodied knowledge can only loosely be captured through language. There usually isn't much of an overlap between the greatest practitioners and the greatest teachers in any given domain.</p><p>Plus: ask any serious Judo player, and they will tell you that there is <em>also</em> a gap between what is taught in the dojo, and what is used in competition. The charitable explanation here is that the best players can’t explain what they’re doing, because their somatic responses are tied to cues in implicit memory, which makes it impossible for them to notice. The slightly less charitable explanation is that there is a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/">metagame</a> that’s going on at the highest levels of Judo, and the shift in the current meta is kept opaque and available only to those who know how to watch out for it. The completely uncharitable explanation is that Judo is a sport with bad pedagogy, and most people don’t know how to teach it.</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/bdf1b3347d045db83a9c988fb87c8629.jpg"><figcaption>Notice how world champion Maruyama Joshiro is using his leg to lift his opponent's.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-30-at-5.35.29-PM.png"><figcaption>And compare that to Higashi's instructional, which uses the hip to lift.</figcaption></figure><p>(I’m perhaps being a little extreme in that last assessment; but — well, let’s talk about uchimata, shall we? There’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZJcx2ppyB4">particularly good video</a> by YouTube user Judo Mat Lab that points out that the throw taught by Higashi, in its form above, is rarely seen in competition. Many top level athletes do something far simpler (they lift the opponent's leg and tilt, not lift their opponent with their hip) — in fact, the tilting form is what is most commonly seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd10gC4P310">MMA</a> and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb-HW-6isyI">BJJ</a> as well. The funny thing is that when these judokas are asked to demonstrate uchimata, they execute <em>the classical, lifting version first.</em> This is an example of a piece of tacit knowledge that was successfully explicated into a wonderful, comprehensive explanation — but it took a talented YouTuber to do it, and in 2015, 133 years after Judo was first created.)</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZJcx2ppyB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>So the solution here is to do what Oon figured out all those years ago: <em>don’t</em> wait for someone to come along and explain what’s going on. Don’t rely on instructionals alone. <em>Look at actual experts doing the actual thing.</em> In the context of Judo, this means developing the meta-skill of watching competition video yourself, in order to break a competitor’s technique down into its constituent parts. You try to figure out why it’s so effective; later, in the dojo, you attempt to replicate it by copying.</p><p>In fact, as we’ll soon see: this principle is generalisable. When you want to learn a skill on YouTube, you should spend a little bit of time watching instructionals, but then spend the rest of it <em>watching experts doing the actual thing</em>. The former is by definition explicit; the latter allows you to capture what is tacit.</p><h2 id="programming">Programming</h2><p>Let’s move on to programming, which is probably more relevant to the topic of careers.</p><p>When I started programming in university in 2009, there was already a fair amount of programming content on the web. This period coincided with the rise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MO…</a></p></section></div>

Log storage for a whole year would yield roughly 1TB of log data. Consider that also archiving can bring down the required disk space by a factor of  100.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>What is your story? How did you start writing your blog? Was it something that you decided to try since the start of covid? Over the months I’ve started to post some of the learning and technology I’ve came across at work. Over the months of writing, I found myself gaining so much more than what I started out to do. Everything starts with a single step. Before we take our first step, we often have a vision of how that finishing line may look like. We may also have some perspective of how the journey itself may look like. What do you know? As you take a step forward, and then another. You decide to take a pause and look back. You find your perspective of the world has changed just so much!</p>

<p>Today, I will be talking about two key parts of my journey:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>How did this whole venture start?</li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone starts their journey with a goal in mind. Simple and straight forward objectives to achieve! (:</p>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>What have i’ve I learnt thus far?</li>
</ol>

<p>Beyond the initial objectives, I found myself learning just so much as I share my learnings online. Not only does it help me to understand different topics better, it actually help me to change my perspective towards problems and better position me for my growth as a software engineer.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#1. How did this whole venture start?</h2>

<p>It started with just 3 simply purposes:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Being more detail oriented</li>
</ol>

<p>I wanted to delve deeper into each of the topics and technology i am learning at work. So much to cover, but never really understanding each of it. The last thing you want to do is to get the job done without properly learning the best practices and finding that growth in you.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a pause, and look a little closer</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>Hone my technical skills</li>
</ol>

<p>This platform was intended for me to explore the different web development tools and understand the nuts and bolts behind the delivery of a good website. You are worth the value you give. And if you want to create value for people, you got to put in the work to hone that technical skill and deliver that tip top quality work</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no free meals in the world, if you want to create value, you got to earn the craft</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Improve on my writing</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve always been a thrash writer. I even started out writing my posts in point forms as I was never able to articulate my thoughts coherently. But I realized the ability to articulate your point in a succinct and concise form is an art that needs to be developed. Over the months and numerous articles, I’ve started to learn how to put my thoughts into words and organize my thoughts for a meaningful sharing.</p>

<p>Here’s a reference to my first blog post to understand the drastic difference haha! <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-01-26-first-post-of-2020/">Joshua’s first post back in January 2020</a></p>

<p>What i’ve gotten from this pet project didn’t just stop here. Rather, I have taken away so much more than what i intended to learn from the start. As i reflect back, I realized i’ve learnt way more than what I’ve intended to when i first start out. I believe many readers can resonate with that as well.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#2. What have i’ve I learnt thus far?</h2>

<p>I’ve learnt so many lessons from my writing adventure thus far! In this list, we will go through the top 5 of them. Do leave a comment below if you can resonate with any of them.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Community is king</h3>

<p>To consistently be able to gather feedback on whatever you’ve written helps to create some discussions via the net. Especially if you know you’re touching an interesting topic that people has been talking about.</p>

<p>It is never to find the most glamorous topics to talk about just so you can be ‘part of the gang’. That sounds more like a FOMO to me. Don’t be a FOMO.</p>

<p>Find out because you genuinely want to learn. There isn’t time to be someone else, chasing other people’s attention.</p>

<p>In the space of technology, there has been so many topics and conversations about open-source. What is open-source?</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Open-source&nbsp;software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which&nbsp;source&nbsp;code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any&nbsp;purpose. - wiki</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open-source have its benefits that interestingly seems to contrary to common business thinking.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to start my own solution, and I have to open source it for the world to see and replicate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open sources have many benefits, of the many, i’ll list out a few:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Ability to start small</li>
<li>Solid information security</li>
<li>Attract better talent</li>
<li>The power of crowd</li>
<li>better security</li>
<li>Faster to market</li>
</ul>

<p>References for open source advantages:</p>

<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://opensource.com/article/17/8/enterprise-open-source-advantages">enterprise open source advantages</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>2. Writing leaves a story to be told a thousand times</h3>

<p>It sounds no-brainer but as I was part of the process, i came to see how informative articles allows you share your understanding of a topic multiple times without having to repeat yourself. Have you encountered situations where you have shared your story with your group of friends, and suddenly another friend of yours joined the conversation and realized he has missed out on the entire story, asking you to repeat again. But the efforts to repeat seems futile and you don’t seem to be able to recall the story as well as the<br>
first time around? Frustrating and hair-pulling</p>

<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/955a6f2e7099ef24a2da8aba67b0bb8b/tenor.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>This is the situation writing helps to avoid. Write once, and the story lives on. Even for yourself. Sometimes we need a little self reminder of our own learning and sharing.</p>

<p>Even in the technology space, you find the need to do documentation. Technical documentation&nbsp;helps an intended audience&nbsp;use&nbsp;your product, understand your processes, and get unstuck. This audience can be end-users, administrators, colleagues or technicians. Whoever they are, documentation is intended to be clear, searchable and helpful for these people to understand and use your product or services as its intended for. A feature that is hidden and not shared with the audience is no feature at all (Unless it is intended to be hidden away of course).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing solidifies the conversation</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3>3. Train of thought is coming through</h3>

<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/d977e88507428b258d89e27202450058/tenor.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Tackling a new topic can be overwhelming when you first start out. You will find yourself bombarded with a ton of new technological terms. There is need for you to organize your thoughts, make sense and piece them together like a puzzle.</p>

<p>Have you done a jigsaw puzzle before? You don’t just tackle the pieces in the middle outta no where. You tackle the easiest parts, the sides. You try to find the ‘starting’ point of the information you are reading about, and that usually starts with a <strong>“what”</strong> question. “What is Cache?”, “what is WebRTC”.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you dealing with? Find out with the <strong>“what”</strong> question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have a good understanding of the tool you are learning about - which is the ‘what’ question. The next thing you want to learn is “how”.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How does cache work? - it generally works by storing in data in a fast access hardware such as RAM</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an article about how does cache work by <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/caching/#:~:text=How%20does%20Caching%20work%3F,the%20underlying%20slower%20storage%20layer.">Amazon</a></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How does WebRTC work? You can understand that by reading articles. One of which is written by me! Really bite size with good youtube video to solidify the learning. <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/">How to make video call application</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>How does a car work? How does a tool work? Find out the mechanics of the tool using the <strong>“how”</strong> question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People usually just stop here. In technology, often times, by this point you are already swam with a ton of new terminologies and mental models that you can no longer follow the documentation. You will also start to feel your body heating up and a little uncomfortable sweating in your seat. (Speaking from experience from Singapore)</p>

<p>The next question you should strive to ask before you properly take a break is the <strong>“when”</strong> question. When do we use this tool?</p>

<p>When do we use cache? You use this tool when you have frequent database access, or high read requests such as a news article site. Fetch once, store at the front of the store, so people can accessible access it when information is requested.</p>
<br>
<div><p>When do we use WebRTC? When you want to utilize browser’s technology for media exchange which includes video and audio call use cases.</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Find out when you will need to use a tool? Ask the <strong>“when do you…”</strong> question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Until this point you have probably figured out these 3 questions “What”, “How”, “When”, have 2 remaining buddies - “Who”, “Where”.</p>

<p>Given the examples and the train of thought, give it a try on the <strong>who</strong> and <strong>where</strong> questions! The end goal is to find the purpose of the tool, and when to use it. Following a simple guideline as such can aid you as you navigate around challenging or foreign technology that crosses your path.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Finding your own voice</h3>

<p>I have to admit my writing was pretty thrashy when i first started out. I was writing posts in point form because i wasn’t able to find the coherence needed to put my thoughts into words. Over the months, this ability starts to develop, and i find myself to be able to express different technical ideas as I understand them to be. I managed to find the words to string together to form the idea and flow I wish to convey to my readers.</p>

<p>Beyond the writing style, writing my articles has always been about sharing knowledge. Knowledge is one asset that is given to another and there are collectively more knowledge in the pool. It has always been sharing knowledge in ways that are comprehensive, bite size and relevant to the intended audience of your posts. I enjoy and find myself learning a ton more when I am required to present these information to the public. I wouldn’t want to mess up presenting inaccurate information. That would make me a fake new spreader. And that is the last thing I ever want to do.</p>

<p>All in all, such an initiative helps me to find the voice that feels “the most me”.</p>

<br>
<h3>5. Share because you never know who could learn from you</h3>

<p>You never know who might find your information useful! If it is organized and coherent, you will find that your knowledge could be the very information that someone else in the world is googling and trying to …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>You probably heard of Vim, the almighty text-editor that is everywhere and
a place where <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-the-vim-editor">people get trapped from time to time</a>.
If you are hearing from your local DevOps engineer how Vim is excellent and
fast, you probably thought about giving it a try. But how did it come
to this? How did Vim-craze take over the world at some point?</p>
<p>If we look at the
<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-popular-development-environments">StackOverflow survey for 2019</a>
about the most popular development environments, Vim is still there on the 5th
place, with around 25% of Web Developers using it. Fifth place is pretty neat
considering the first Vim release happened almost 30 years ago (yeah, you read
that right, Vim got first released in 1991).</p>
<p>To better understand why and how Vim got (and is) so popular, it is best to
look into the roots of how it all started. Before <code>vim</code>, there was <code>vi</code>, before
<code>vi</code> there was <code>ed</code>. What are all these two or three letter words, and
what is the story behind it? Let us dive in and figure out.</p>
<h2 id="punch-cards-and-line-editors"><a href="#punch-cards-and-line-editors" aria-label="punch cards and line editors permalink"></a>Punch cards and line editors</h2>
<p>It might be apparent today why we have text editors and fully-fledged IDE
(Integrated Development Environment), but what did we have before that?
As you may know, early forms of programming involved putting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">papers with
holes (punch cards)</a> inside a
computer. The order in which you placed these in was very essential. For example, this
is a picture of 4.5 megabytes data, stacked in 62500 punch cards. Imagine
dropping that and having to sort it again.</p>

<p>
  OK, mom, I'll come down, just need to re-stack my new blog post
</p>
<p>Punch cards proved a bit inefficient as computer power and storage grew, and
programming evolved. Eventually, people moved away from punch cards, and then
there came the era of “line editors.” One great example of this is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)"><code>ed</code> editor</a>. Let’s not forget to
mention <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qedman.html">QED editor</a>,
<code>ed</code>’s predecessor.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-line-editor"><a href="#using-a-line-editor" aria-label="using a line editor permalink"></a>Using a line editor</h2>
<p>If you are on Linux or Mac OS, open your terminal and type <code>ed</code>. You
will get a simple line editor, which will greet you with silence.
If you are amazed by this finding (as I was), you can try playing with it for a while. To write
a file, start typing <code>a</code> and press enter, then write your text. Typing <code>.</code>
following an enter will exit the append (insert) mode. Then, to write a file, you can
type <code>w myfile.txt</code> and press enter and lastly write <code>q</code> and enter to exit.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code># ed
a
Hey there!
I am using ed right now, how cool.
OK, that's enough.
.
w myfile.txt
64
q</code></pre></div>
<p>As you may notice, there are similarities between working with <code>ed</code> and with
today’s <code>vim</code>. If you use Vim, you can say you would get the hang of <code>ed</code> pretty
quickly.</p>
<h2 id="vims-dad---the-vi"><a href="#vims-dad---the-vi" aria-label="vims dad   the vi permalink"></a>Vim’s dad - The Vi</h2>
<p>After <code>ed</code>, then came the <code>em</code> - <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gc/history/">the “editor for mortals”</a>.
It could do similar things as <code>ed</code>, but it is ‘less cryptic’ and built for
regular people. Based on <code>em</code>’s code, Bill Joy developed <code>ex</code>, which
stands for “extended ed”! It was significant because <code>ex</code> had, besides the previous
modes, the <code>visual</code> mode, which will show the whole file on your screen. You
must be thinking - duh, how didn’t they <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qed.html">think of that earlier</a>?
Having that thing show up on computers in those days was pretty tricky,
and some considered it a resource hog. But, at that point, the benefits had
outweighed objections, and having a file opened on your screen as you edit it
became today’s standard.</p>

  <img alt="Vi editor" title="Vi editor" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/dd4157ecc91779d4e893edf95e85f3f5/fcda8/vi.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/dd4157ecc91779d4e893edf95e85f3f5/12f09/vi.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>And like that, the <strong>vi</strong>sual mode was born. Later, the executable <code>vi</code> got
introduced in operating systems, but you can still access <code>ex</code> commands by
typing <code>:</code> in <code>vi</code>/<code>vim</code>. The <code>ex</code> got released in 1976, and the <code>vi</code>
executable got released in 1979. 40-something years ago! But, how did <code>vim</code> came to life?</p>
<h2 id="the-imitation-game"><a href="#the-imitation-game" aria-label="the imitation game permalink"></a>The Imitation Game</h2>
<p>A couple of years later, many <code>vi</code> clones emerged (my favorite one is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_(text_editor)">Elvis</a>). One of them was “Vi
Improved” which was created by Bram Moolenaar - the name you now see when you
try to open <code>vim</code> in your terminal. In the large pool of different <code>vi</code> clones,
<code>vim</code> managed to stand out. Bram used a clone of <code>vi</code> called <code>STEVIE</code> (nice
name, BTW), and noticed that it lacks many of <code>vi</code>’s commands. He added
some new features and made it compatible with <code>vi</code> and released it under
the name “Vi Imitation” (this later changed to “Vi Improved”). The name <code>vim</code> came in version 2.0 in 1993 and
stayed like that until the present day. But how did <code>vim</code> achieve fame? It had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Features_and_improvements_over_vi">bunch of excellent features</a>
at that time, and it was compatible with <code>vi</code>. Features and compatibility attracted a lot of folks to use it.</p>
<h2 id="half-a-century-of-contributions"><a href="#half-a-century-of-contributions" aria-label="half a century of contributions permalink"></a>Half a century of contributions</h2>
<p>If you take a look at the essential commands to move around in Vim: <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>,
<code>k</code>, and <code>l</code>, these all pull roots from the old <code>vi</code> days. Bill Joy’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A">keyboard at that time</a>
didn’t have cursors to move around. Also, the <code>ESC</code> key was in the place
of today’s <code>TAB</code> key. Take a look at how it was back in the day:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

<p>Commands to replace text like <code>:%s/text_to_replace/text_to_replace_it_with/</code> is
also something from that era. Having to type <code>:</code> to perform a command
was an answer to <code>ed</code>’s complete silence when you first enter the editor.</p>
<p>What I am trying to say that <code>vim</code> is an effort of over half a century of
good idea accumulation, putting lots of effort into being backward compatible.
Yes, useful features probably made Vim famous. But what kept Vim in the loop is
the compatibility with almost everything you can think about. Wherever you SSH
today, you can start the Vim session, or at least Vi session. That is a strong
(if not the strongest) point to learn it nowadays.</p>
<p>If you’re not someone who jumps from server to server and navigates files on
there, the point of having Vim everywhere doesn’t bother you. But
still, there are a couple of reasons why it might be valuable to you. I am forming
a new blog post explaining why you should learn Vim in 2020. If you are interested

<h2 id="final-thoughts"><a href="#final-thoughts" aria-label="final thoughts permalink"></a>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading this far, I appreciate it. I hope this blog post shed some
light on how Vim became what it is today. I also hope the post inspired you to
try it out. You never know when you might need it, or you like it so much that
you decide to switch to using Vim fully.</p>
<p>Maybe you get a Vim mode inside your IDE or VSCode, who knows. I am not saying
that Vim should replace what you are using now, but trying to learn and
configure it will improve your skills and abilities. On the other hand, it doesn’t really
matter what editor you use, it is what you do with it!</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s the matter of finding the proper editor
(tool) that makes you do what you do even better.</p>

    <p>Single hose air conditioners (AC) should be banned. By design, they are
inefficient; they can blast cold air at a person sitting directly in front,
but will never be able to cool the rest of the room. Single hose ACs are bad
news for the environment, energy bills and your heatwave comfort!</p>

<p>The problem for UK residents is that single hose ACs are the only type of
portable model available to buy. Dual hose models or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning#Window_unit_and_packaged_terminal">window
units</a>
are not available, despite their drastically better cooling performance. But
what makes single hose ACs so bad?</p>

<h2 id="background-air-conditioners-are-just-refrigerators-with-fans">Background: Air conditioners are just refrigerators with fans</h2>
<p>Most air conditioning systems work by exchanging heat from the inside air to
the outside air, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor-compression_refrigeration">vapor-compression
refrigeration</a>.
All efficient designs (anything that’s not a single hose) do this without ever
mixing the separate air masses or causing any pressure differential between the
outside and inside. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a split AC unit in a
commercial property, the AC in your car, or your kitchen refrigerator, they
follow this operating model:</p>

<div>
<figure><img src="https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/convert-ac-from-single-hose-to-dual-hose/air-conditioning-system-type-split.svg" alt="Diagram showing operation of split type air conditioning system."><figcaption>Split inside/outside unit air conditioning system</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>Dual hose portable air conditioners follow the same principle, but incorporate
the outside unit into a single inside unit; instead using ducting hoses to draw
outside air over the condenser coils and back to the outside again. They are
more convenient as no permanent installation is required, but are marginally
less efficient due to heat loss through the hoses and the additional heat
generated from the compressor which is now inside the room that needs to be
cooled.</p>

<div>
<figure><img src="https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/convert-ac-from-single-hose-to-dual-hose/air-conditioning-system-type-portable-dual-hose.svg" alt="Diagram showing operation of portable dual hose type air conditioning system."><figcaption>Portable dual hose air conditioning system</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<h2 id="what-makes-single-hose-acs-so-bad">What makes single hose ACs so bad?</h2>
<p>Single hose models are the only type that violate this principle, which is why
they are so inefficient. Instead of using two hoses to keep the air masses
separate and drawing outside air to pass over the condenser coils, they ditch the
intake hose and just draw the <em>inside</em> air instead. Why? Probably because they’re
cheaper to manufacture and easier for customers to install.</p>

<div>
<figure><img src="https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/convert-ac-from-single-hose-to-dual-hose/air-conditioning-system-type-portable-single-hose.svg" alt="Diagram showing operation of portable single hose type air conditioning system."><figcaption>Portable single hose air conditioning system</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>But this design has a huge performance cost. With the inside air now being
forced to the outside through the exhaust hose, the inside is now always at a
lower pressure.  No room is perfectly sealed, so to equalise the pressure, hot
air from outside is continuously drawn through door frames and a multitude of
other tiny gaps in the room. This is why single hose units will never cool an
entire room, they are constantly fighting against hot air rushing back into the
room due to the negative pressure.</p>

<p>Don’t believe me? Turn the AC on in a small room, use a good seal between the
exhaust hose and the window, then close all doors and feel around the gaps
between the door and the frame. You’ll be able to feel the air rushing in to
the equalise the negative pressure in the room you’re trying to cool.</p>

<h2 id="solution-convert-the-single-hose-ac-to-dual-hose">Solution: Convert the single hose AC to dual hose</h2>
<p>Thankfully, many single hose ACs can easily be converted to dual hose systems.
Single hose systems are often designed with two separate intake ports just like
dual hose units, despite only needing one; presumably to reduce design and
manufacturing costs. By fashioning an adapter to duct the condenser intake port
so that it draws from the outside air, it will perform with the same efficiency
as a dual hose unit.</p>

<p>There are two requirements that a single hose air conditioning unit must meet
to make conversion possible:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>There must be two separate air intake ports for the evaporator and
condenser sides</strong>.
    <ol>
      <li>The unit likely meets this requirement if it has three separate air
grilles in addition to the exhaust hose.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>There must be an internal separation between the evaporator and condenser
side air flows</strong>. There are two ways to find this out:
    <ol>
      <li>Find photos or designs from others that have explored the internals of
your model.</li>
      <li>Open the unit up and investigate yourself. Do not do this unless you are
confident about electrical and refridgerant safety and are prepared to
invalidate the warranty of your machine.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To convert the unit from single host to dual hose:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Source an additional air conditioning hose or equivalent.</li>
  <li>Identify which air grille on the unit is the condenser (hot coil) air
intake.</li>
  <li>Create an adapter to duct this air grille into the additional air
conditioning hose, so that it can be made to draw air from the outside.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-conversion-example">My conversion example</h2>
<p>I purchased a “Challenge 5K Air Conditioning Unit” in 2019 for £289.99 from
Argos. Despite only being 5000 BTU, after conversion to dual hose it was able
to cool a medium sized room from 34 C outside temperatures down to 22 C in only
a couple of hours.</p>

<p>The conversion was performed in minutes, using items easily purchased at a
hardware shop or found around the house:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A tumble drier hose.</li>
  <li>Discarded polystyrene packaging foam and cardboard.</li>
  <li>Spare foam strips that came along with the air conditioner to provide a
better seal between the polystyrene and the unit.</li>
  <li>Plenty of duck tape.</li>
</ol>

<p>This isn’t an ideal set of materials, but works well enough to tide over for
the summer.</p>

<p>On the Challenge unit, the condenser air intake is the lower grille underneath
the exhaust hose port. After ducting this grille into the tumble drier hose,
this is the result. Not aesthetically pleasing, but very effective for the
three days of summer that the UK gets every year:</p>



<h2 id="further-tips-for-optimum-efficiency">Further tips for optimum efficiency</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Purchase a window sealing unit designed for your type of window.</li>
  <li>Keep the intake and exhaust hoses away from each other when outside of the
window. Having them close to each other increases the change that the intake
hose is drawing in freshly exhausted hot air. If stacking vertically, I like
to keep the intake hose below the exhaust hose for this reason too, as hot
air rises slightly.</li>
  <li>Keep the length of the hoses short, to minimise losses back into the room.
Move the unit as close to the window as possible.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Imagine this: You have a large multi-module ClojureScript project, and you are planning to make a new deployment in the
production.
Your project is using CLJS Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations mode.
Everything seems to be working smoothly. You are performing some last E2E tests before making a release.<br>
Then, a faulty module loads.<br>
<strong>BAM!</strong> You are slapped in the face with an error something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Uncaught Error: No protocol method IMultiFn.-add-method defined for type function: function XR() { [native code] }
    at Nb ((index):964)
    at yh ((index):443)
    at (index):236
(index):143 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'j' of undefined
    at NU ((index):143)
    at login-a5a67c0fffdfa158b7220c8c2553253b645e4e2e.js:169
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You did not expect this. There were no significant new changes since the last build, and the unit tests were all
hunky-dory.<br>
Additionally, everything worked fine when using Firefox, but now the compiled code crashes on Google Chrome. 
What is going on? The release deadline is looming and you have to fix this ASAP.</p>

<em>Holy Stack Trace, Batman!</em></p>

<p>When you build your code with the CLJS compiler, it emits JavaScript code that is compatible with the 
advanced_optimizations level of the Google Closure compiler. Then, if <code>":optimizations :advanced"</code> compiler option is
enabled, the CLJS compiler will minify the result with Closure Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations.</p>

<p>Closure Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations mode can cause some errors in your build that can be uncomfortable to
track down if you are new to Closure Compiler.
On top of that, help might be hard to find if you are trying to search the web with the error message because the function
names are all mangled up.</p>

<p>It is better to avoid these errors by keeping the Advanced Compilation mode in mind from the start of the project. 
I’ll describe some common methods to help you to avoid and resolve advanced compilation issues, and 
show how to resolve the more uncommon issue that was described in the beginning and what is the reason behind it.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-issues-with-advanced-compilation">Avoiding issues with Advanced Compilation</h2>

<p>It is recommended to use <code>":optimizations :advanced"</code> CLJS compiler option for your production builds.
You will greatly reduce your final build size by using more aggressive advanced transformations such as dead code 
removal and aggressive renaming.<br>
Read more about the advanced transformations at here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/compilation_levels#advanced_optimizations">Closure Compiler compilation levels</a></p>

<p>Different build tools such as lein-cljsbuild and shadow-cljs might pass different default options to Closure Compiler.
I won’t cover the differences in this blog post, but instead, I will provide some general guidelines on how to avoid
issues with advanced compilation in your project.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-externs-in-a-good-shape">Keep your externs in a good shape</h3>
<p><a href="https://clojurescript.org/guides/externs">Extern</a> is a mechanism for declaring names that should not be munged (renamed) by Closure Compiler.
When you are using external libraries, make sure that they come <a href="http://cljsjs.github.io/">bundled</a>
with externs if you are using a build tool like lein-cljsbuild. Or, provide externs files of your own if needed. 
Otherwise, Closure Compiler will munge references to externally defined symbols unintentionally during advanced 
compilation causing errors found only later when running the compiled code.</p>

<p>To add externs of your own, use a compiler option for example: <code>":externs ["externs.js"]"</code> and provide an
externs.js file in your working directory.</p>

<p>Also, It is good to use <code>":infer-externs true"</code> compiler option. This option will enable generating externs automatically
for JavaScript interop calls.</p>

<p>It is worth to know, that Closure Compiler includes externs for stable JavaScript APIs, but newer features that have an
experimental status might not be included yet. The experimental APIs change very quickly, so it makes no sense to include
them in the Closure Compiler tool. So, if you are planning to use some experimental features, make sure 
you add them to your own externs file.</p>

<p>Read more about using external JavaScript libraries from <a href="http://lukevanderhart.com/2011/09/30/using-javascript-and-clojurescript.html">here</a></p>

<h3 id="splitting-code-might-cause-name-collisions">Splitting code might cause name collisions</h3>
<p>If you are <a href="https://clojurescript.org/guides/code-splitting">splitting</a> your CLJS code into <code>:modules</code>, you might want
to use <code>:rename-prefix "..."</code> compiler option.<br>
Split modules are running in the global JavaScript scope, so they might interfere with other code loaded on the same page 
(e.g. Google Analytics) and cause unpredictable errors if name collisions occur.
When using <code>":rename-prefix"</code>, it is best to use a very short string as a prefix, for example: <code>:rename-prefix "r_"</code></p>

<p>This will increase the final (gzipped) build size slightly because now each munged global variable will be prefixed with “r_”.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-cljs-output-to-prevent-global-scope-pollution">Wrap CLJS output to prevent global scope pollution</h3>
<p>Closure Compiler will generate a lot of global variables during advanced compilation that can cause name collisions
with other code running on the same page.
If you are loading other code on the same page, and you are not splitting code into multiple modules you can utilize
 the <code>":output-wrapper true"</code> compiler option. The compiler will wrap the outputted JavaScript code with the default 
<code>"(function(){…​};)()"</code>. This will prevent polluting the global JavaScript scope and thus will prevent conflicts
with other external code.</p>

<p>However, if you have multiple modules in your project you must add a compiler option <code>:rename-prefix-namespace "..."</code>.
This enables each module to access the variables defined in the other modules it depends on.
This works similarly to the <code>":rename-prefix"</code> option. The difference is that every global variable will be now
scoped under one global variable instead of many. For example, if you use a prefix-namespace like this:
<code>:rename-prefix-namespace "P"</code>, the compiled code will refer to variable <code>"foo"</code> like <code>"p.foo"</code>. 
This option will also increase the final build size like the <code>":rename-prefix"</code> option, so think before using it.</p>

<p>There are other interesting compiler options not directly related to advanced optimizations, such as <code>":fn-invoke-direct"</code> 
which can be useful for optimizing performance-critical code. You can read more about them in CLJS 
<a href="https://clojurescript.org/reference/compiler-options">documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-advanced-compilation-bugs">Debugging Advanced Compilation bugs</h2>

<p>If you suspect you might have a problem with advanced compilation, often hinted by errors in the browser 
console that might make no sense, it is best to approach the problem in the following way.</p>

<p>Add two additional compiler options <code>":pseudo-names true"</code> and <code>":pretty-print true"</code> for your Advanced Compilation build.
Your error will now show a readable name that corresponds to the name in the source code. 
This will help you to deduce if an extern definition is missing.</p>

<p>Additionally, if your error goes away after enabling the above-mentioned compiler options, it gives you a hint
of a possible name collision problem. When there is a problem with a munged variable name colliding with an external 
variable name, the problem disappears when the munged variable name changes, like what happens when enabling the :pseudo-names option.<br>
Often, if not fixed properly, the name collision issues can arise and then be magically “fixed” when one adds new 
changes, which in turn causes changes in munged variable names in the build output. It is best to eliminate these problems for good.</p>

<h3 id="sometimes-something-funky-can-happen">Sometimes, something funky can happen</h3>
<p>In some rare cases, there might be some advanced compilation issues that are not so easy to avoid.
Let’s go back to the beginning. 
We had an error when running our built web app in Chrome. Firefox had no issues.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Uncaught Error: No protocol method IMultiFn.-add-method defined 
                for type function: function XR() { [native code] }
    at Nb ((index):964)
    at yh ((index):443)
    at (index):236
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Stack Trace was pointing to a certain multimethod in the CLJS source code. 
At the first glance, the error might make no sense. The compiled code is trying to invoke -add-method IMultiFn protocol method 
for a function named XR. When searching for the munged <code>XR</code> in the build output, everything seems to be fine.
<code>XR</code> looks good and should work, right?
The key thing to notice in the error message is the <code>"[native code]"</code> part of <code>"function XR() { [native code] }"</code>.
This tells us, that the compiled code is trying to invoke a native browser function <code>XR</code> instead of our munged <code>XR</code>. 
By chance, the Closure Compiler named our multimethod to <code>XR</code> which happens to collide with the browser provided
<code>XR</code> function.</p>

<p>Occasionally you can encounter errors like this when using an older version of Closure Compiler.
Developers add new features to web browsers all the time. When a user upgrades his/her web browser there is a chance 
a new reserved word was added that collides with a munged variable.</p>

<p>It turns out, XR is a reserved word added by the WebXR platform API. When the error occurred “XR” was added in the newest 
version of Google Chrome, but not yet in Firefox. Newer Closure Compiler versions take this into account by providing
an extern for it. It is not always easy to upgrade the ClojureScript version and thus the Closure Compiler used in a project.<br>
In that case, you can fix the problem fast by adding a custom extern of your own:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// externs.js</span>

<span>var</span> <span>XR</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Many times, Advanced Compilation issues with CLJS are easy to avoid with proper preparation. On rare occasions, some
stranger errors can happen. Thus, test your builds with the current browser versions and learn to debug advanced 
compilation issues swiftly to prevent wasting precious time.</p>

  dispatch of the <code><a data-link-type="event" href="#eventdef-window-portalactivate" id="ref-for-eventdef-window-portalactivate②">portalactivate</a></code> event.</p>
    <p>The <dfn data-dfn-for="portal" data-dfn-type="element-attr" data-export="" id="element-attrdef-portal-src"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute gives the <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url" id="ref-for-concept-url">URL</a> of a

    <p role="note"> A <code><a data-link-type="element" href="#elementdef-portal" id="ref-for-elementdef-portal⑤">portal</a></code> is similar to an <code><a data-link-type="element" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#the-iframe-element" id="ref-for-the-iframe-element">iframe</a></code>, in that it allows another

            <p>“Our results indicate that public immunity to COVID-19 is probably significantly higher than antibody tests have suggested,” says Professor <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/hanlju">Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren</a> at the Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, and co-senior author. “If this is the case, it is of course very good news from a public health perspective.”</p>

<p>T-cell analyses are more complicated to perform than antibody tests and at present are therefore only done in specialised laboratories, such as that at the Center for Infectious Medicine at Karolinska Institutet.</p>

<p>“Larger and more longitudinal studies must now be done on both T cells and antibodies to understand how long-lasting the immunity is and how these different components of COVID-19 immunity are related,” says Marcus Buggert.</p>

<p>The results are so new that they have not yet undergone peer review ahead of publication in a scientific journal. Pending such review, the article has been published on a preprint server, bioRxiv (see box).</p>

<p>The study was financed by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Nordstjernan AB, the Swedish Research Council, Karolinska Institutet, the Swedish Society for Medical Research, the Jeansson Foundations, the Åke Wiberg Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Magnus Bergvall Foundation, the Hedlund Foundation, the Lars Hierta Foundation, the Swedish Physicians against AIDS foundation, the Jonas Söderquist Foundation, the Clas Groschinsky Memorial Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust.&nbsp;The authors report no conflicts of interest or patents associated with the results of the study.</p>

June 30, 2020 | https://skibinsky.com/godel-incompleteness-for-startups/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://skibinsky.com/godel-incompleteness-for-startups/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Every year a few thousand startups are incubated in Silicon Valley. Few of them will succeed; the rest will decay or outright fail. Yet there always seems to be room for one more billion-dollar company. Besides appearing seemingly out of nowhere, the most radically successful startups are also the most unpredictable ones. What force seems to create these massive sources of wealth that initially look like “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bad ideas</a>”&nbsp;to everybody beside their founders?</p>
<p>You may be tempted to say “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Swan</a>,” and you would be correct; however, beside simple acceptance of extraordinarily rare random events, there is deeper mathematical influence over a process that constantly spawns new opportunities. Understanding that influence will help any startup founder or investor to improve his business insights. To understand these concepts better we will make a long journey that will touch upon very foundations of logic and mathematics .</p>

<p>I usually find time to look at about two hundred startups every year. Referrals arrive from other investors, startup founders I mentor or via the massive firehose of demo days at YCombinator &amp; 500 Startups. As you can imagine, this creates an overwhelming supply of startups and innovative ideas to look into. Every startup presents the ultimate question: Is it worth it to invest your time and money? Or is it a waste of both? There is never enough time to dig deep enough into any single startup to understand it fully. Making an investment is not an easy or obvious decision. Yet, over the years, I started to notice certain meta-patterns common to all startups, the patterns that give a tantalizing premonitions on their chances of success or failure. The specifics of an industry or investment cycle might change, yet these patterns remain the same in every decade. I see them as two big groups of patterns: <strong><em>human</em></strong> patterns and <strong><em>mathematical</em></strong> patterns.</p>
<p><img src="http://dgn0b0vubo9qr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math.png" alt="" width="150" srcset="https://skibinsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math.png 263w, https://skibinsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px">Human patterns emerge from our personal traits. Weather a startup will overcome its human-related challenge is determined by what a person or a team can succeed or fail at. The telltale sign is when the outcome will be determined by quality or quantity of personal efforts. What you typically read in Silicon Valley startup blogs would be all about such human patterns. It will be hundreds of topics covering which software language to use, how to pick founders, how to operate the company, how to build a product, how to build software, what is company culture etc. It’s all good content, yet it only addresses patterns driven by human traits, and thus is only half of the equation.</p>
<p>What you rarely hear about is “mathematical” patterns. These patterns emerge from objective nature of the reality where a startup must operate. The market dynamics, the ecosystem of industries they find themselves in, the governing trends of technological progress. As soon as a startup starts operating in the real world, the vast majority of factors will be outside of a startup direct control or even influence, while having absolutely dominating impact on that startup eventual outcome. Beside now legendary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Swan</a><a href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup>1</sup></a> making big waves since 2006, there is almost no information on the mathematical fundamentals of startup formation and investing. Usually all you get is a non-actionable statement like “<i>90% of all startups fail</i>” after which the author promptly moves back to human factors, which are much easier to understand and analyze.</p>
<p>To help develop our mathematical intuition we will turn to one of the most profound mathematical results, provided by the legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a>: <b>The First Incompleteness Theorem</b>. To most it is a seemingly dry statement on the <i>completeness</i> and <i>consistency</i> of <i>formal systems</i>. On a deeper level, however, there is an interesting commonality between the mathematics of incompleteness and startup disruption. It’s critical to understanding the dynamics how startups get born, get big or fail, and finally how the few survivors become legacy companies. Showing this deep connection between mathematics of incompleteness of formal systems and startups will be the purpose of this essay.</p>

<blockquote><p>“[My] own work no longer means much, I came to the Institute merely…to have the privilege of walking home with Gödel.”</p>
<p><em>Albert Einstein</em></p>
</blockquote>
<div id="attachment_839"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-839" src="http://dgn0b0vubo9qr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gande-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></p><p id="caption-attachment-839">Albert Einstein and Kurt Godel taking a walk.</p></div>
<p>It is surprising that Gödel’s famous theorem is all but unknown in the startup world. Thinking&nbsp; of all the mathematical knowledge that has direct impact on computer science, software and startups I would be hard pressed to come up with anything more powerful than Gödel’s <i>Incompleteness Theorem</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Y Combinator</a> is famously named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Y Combinator</a>, one of the best-known fixed-point combinators used to construct certain recursive functions. Yet who was the first to define and use a recursive functions? Gödel. Further, the proof that fixed points exist at all is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_lemma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">side effect</a> implicit of his work. Y Combinator is direct descendant<a href="#footnote-2" id="refmark-2"><sup>2</sup></a> of Gödel’s proof.</p>
<p><img src="http://dgn0b0vubo9qr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/turing-150x150.png" width="150" height="150"></p>
<p>Consider another cornerstone of computer science, such as Alan Turing’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halting Problem</a>. He created that theorem when working at Princeton, right at the time when discussions about Gödel recent results dominated the institute mathematical debates. Turing’s proof is a continuation of Gödel’s work<a href="#footnote-3" id="refmark-3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Kleene, Turing and Shannon were all standing on the shoulders of the giant – gnome sized Gödel – when they were following his groundbreaking proof and inventing modern computer science. We will review Halting Problem in more details later in this essay.</p>
<p>When you truly grasp the implications of what Gödel actually proved, it will be like opening a Pandora’s box&nbsp; of wonderful insights. The implications of the theorem go far beyond just logic and math. Answers to the most sought after questions such as: <em>Why can everything be made better? Why are so many startups possible and will always be possible? Why things we build tend to get more complex over time? Why does civilization always has room to improve?</em></p>
<p>To answers these questions, and &nbsp;see how all these things are connected mathematically you need to understand Gödel incompleteness.</p>
<h2>A taste of things to come</h2>
<p>Naturally, there is a reason why Gödel theorem is still relatively unknown outside of mathematical circles. There are few big problems. First of all, <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf#page=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gödel’s proof</a> is <b>hard</b>. Not “<i>learn new computer language</i>” hard, not “<i>make an iPhone game</i>” hard, really, really, <b>really hard</b>. Gödel did not make the task of understanding his theorems easy. Being famously introverted, he preferred the logic of his proofs to do all his speaking for him. Even mathematical education is not much help here. For example, Gödel offers the following preview, a “sketch proof”, what he called an “<i>an intuition</i>” for the real proof to follow.</p>
<blockquote><p>We will define a class <b>K</b> of natural numbers as follows: <b>K</b> = { <i>n</i> ∈ IN | ¬ <i>provable(R<b><sub>n</sub></b>(n)) </i>}&nbsp;(where <i>provable(x)</i> means x is a provable formula). K is the set of numbers <i>n</i> where the formula <i>R<b><sub>n</sub></b>(n) </i>that you get when you insert <i>n</i> into its own formula <i>R<b><sub>n</sub></b></i> is improvable. Since all the concepts used for this definition are themselves definable in PM, so is the compound concept <b>K</b>, i.e. there is a class-sign S such that the formula S(n) states that n∈<b>K</b>. As a class-sign, S is identical with a specific <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b></i>, i.e. we have S ⇔ <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b></i>&nbsp;for a specific natural number <strong>q</strong>. We will now prove that the theorem <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> is undecidable within PM. We can understand this by simply plugging in the&nbsp;definitions:&nbsp;<i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> ⇔ <i>S(q)</i> ⇔q ∈ K⇔<b> ¬</b><i>(R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q))</i>, in other words, <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> states “<i>I am improvable.</i>“</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless you are an active mathematician, reading and intuitively understanding his proof would be next to impossible. Just in case here is the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proof again</a> in case you enjoy sharpening your mathematical teeth against this amazing whetstone of logic<a href="#footnote-4" id="refmark-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The second, even bigger problem is that understanding the proof will not help you much. Gödel’s logic is so alien, so strange that even understanding the formal deductions won’t help you understand all the implications of that phenomenon. Gödel’s proof is like a map with “<i>X marks the spot</i>”, yet on that map every border connecting it with our reality is torn away. You have no idea what particular area that map refers to. X is there, treasure is certainly there, but how the heck do you <b>practically </b>use it? In ironic self-referential self-validation Gödel’s formal proof cannot be understood formally. It requires an intuition leap that will unlock its secrets. And after you make that leap your perspective on everything related to startups and innovations will change. That is the insight we will try to develop<a href="#footnote-5" id="refmark-5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<h2>The Theorem</h2>
<blockquote><p>Gödel’s theorem is rapidly becoming accepted as being the fundamental contribution to the foundation of&nbsp; mathematics – probably the <b>most fundamental</b> ever to be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Penrose</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly has Gödel proving? In modern language, simplified statement will be the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any … <strong><em>formal system</em></strong> capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both <strong><em>consistent</em></strong> and <strong><em>complete</em></strong>. In particular, for any consistent, … formal system that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is <strong><em>true, but not provable</em></strong> in theory</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s work our way through that, since most of the concepts here are actually fairly easy to understand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Formal systems</em></strong> are simple things. They are just collections of <b>axioms</b> and <b>rules</b> on how to manipulate them. For example, lets make a few axioms about numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number 0 exists</li>
<li>Each number has a successor that is a number. One follows zero, two follows one, etc.</li>
<li>Two different numbers can not have the same successor</li>
<li>… more axioms if you wish …</li>
</ul>

<p>If we continue writing down such “self evident” axioms, we can arrive at certain set of axioms, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peano axioms</a>. These axioms and few rules of manipulations would constitute the simple arithmetic you learned in kindergarten if not earlier.</p>
<p>Axioms and rules about how axioms can be manipulated to produce derived statements is what constitute a <i>formal system</i>. Systems can be very different from each other. You …</p></div></div>

June 30, 2020 | https://www.gustekdev.com/post/async-vs-sync-communication/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gustekdev.com/post/async-vs-sync-communication/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
  <div>
    <div>
      <article role="main">
        <p>We can divide communication into two channels:<br>
<strong>Synchronous</strong> (Sync) - all parties are actively taking part in the conversation right now. For example, physical meetings or a video call<br>
<strong>Asynchronous</strong> (Async) - one party writes or records a message and has to wait for responses for an indefinite amount of time. For example, sending an email or posting on a discussion board.<br>
Conversations on sync channels are usually recorded only in the heads of the participants where async channels are a more permanent medium.<br>
Chat applications are a bit of a grey area; they allow for synchronous communication, but often you have to wait for a response. Because of the inherently fleeting nature of real-time chats, I consider them to be synchronous.</p>
<p>In the workplace, often conversations will revolve around making a decision - for instance, choosing between various options. These conversations, ideally, can be divided into three stages.<br>
Each stage will involve the usage of both synchronous and asynchronous channels. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialisation</li>
<li>Discussion</li>
<li>Decision</li>
</ol>

<p>This stage starts with someone writing down a proposal, an introduction to the subject, and it may also include some initial research done by the person writing it. It can be a detailed post, or it can be simply an email invitation with a short description of the subject. Follow up with brainstorming to gather opinions; it’s not a time for decisions yet - we are just stimulating the conversation and collecting ideas. After a brainstorming session, one person writes a follow-up post summarising what you have discussed and all the ideas mentioned, including rejected ideas as well for completeness. Someone good at taking notes will be very helpful here.<br>
We have here both synchronous and asynchronous communication.</p>

<p>Now people have been familiarised with the subject. It is time to digest it. I’m sure everyone has experienced clarity after a night of sleep - that is why this stage may take a few days or even weeks, assuming there is no particular time pressure. At this stage, people should mostly use async channels to communicate with the whole group. Sync channels should be seen as supplementary to be used when you want to avoid spamming the async channel with the back and forth of short questions and answers. I recommend adding a summary of such conversations in the async channel later.<br>
Again, we employed both synchronous and asynchronous channels.</p>

<p>When enough time has passed - maybe because there is a deadline, or the discussion is slowing down, or agreement seems to have been reached - we head back to a meeting room to make the decision. Ideally, there should be no more new ideas introduced at this point. In terms of how you pick the winning idea that is another subject. It could be a democratic vote, a manager/leader decision, or dice roll. After the meeting, you write a summary.<br>
Once more, both synchronous and asynchronous communication is involved here.</p>

<p>Writing and speaking with clarity can both be difficult, but they are vital skills and need to be worked on, no excuses here. But if you are bad at either and finding it hard to improve by yourself, then try to find someone good at it and work together.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>If you are bad at writing, find someone who does it well. Write a draft with what you want to say, and ask them to review it, improve it based on their feedback. Rinse, repeat until it is ready to be shown to a broader audience.</p>
<h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>
<p>If you are bad at speaking, then try to write down all the points you want to say first - remember it is ok to read notes in the meetings. You can practice speaking by finding someone who likes to have small debates and discuss opinions with them in a one-on-one setting, so you don’t stress because of group pressure.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>For me, the writing was always my weaker point of the two. In school and university, I always struggled with reaching the required word count. Today I know that they taught me writing the wrong way. It is not about the word count. If you know what you want to say the words will come by themselves. Write a draft first as if you were talking, then review and improve it. There are a lot of books, blogs, and courses that share tips on how to improve your writing. One point they all agree on is this: write something, anything, and improve later.<br>
My speaking skills improved thanks to a volunteering organisation I was involved with in high school. During my university years, I had a job in customer service that helped a lot as well. When I started working as a software engineer, my problem was lack of confidence and impostor syndrome. I was questioning myself in my mind all the time, which made it hard to take part in conversations. That one is hard to solve, and I don’t have any suggestions here. I overcame it at least partially thanks to my team members at <a href="https://twitter.com/fr_devs">Football Radar</a> showing recognition for my skills.</p>

<p>It is not a case of async versus sync communication. As with many things, it is not one or the other. Each approach has its use cases, and they complement each other. Use them together at the right time to derive the most benefit.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>So I have spent my last 3 months building&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pipfeed.com/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">PipFeed.com</a>. PipFeed is an A.I. powered curated reading app. Think of it as when Pocket met Medium. I am an ex-AWS engineer and my main language of choice is JAVA but I can code in PHP, python, js etc.</p><p>The backend for PipFeed is in JAVA with a few services in python, node.js &amp; PHP. In January 2020 I learned Flutter and built the mobile app for PipFeed using it. This is my first experience building a mobile app and here are some of the learnings that I would like to share with you all.</p><h2>1) Have a CI/CD</h2><p>For mobile apps, it is extremely important to have a CI/CD. We use <a href="http://codemagic.io/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">codemagic</a>, it ties up nicely with our Flutter ecosystem. Mobile apps need a lot more work to release like signing, bundle, etc etc.</p><p>P.S. I still don’t have a CI/CD for my backends and I deploy my AWS backend from my laptop using Cloudformation templates.</p><h2>2) Mobile apps crash a lot</h2><p>As compared to websites, backend code, and stand-alone software, mobile apps fail and throw exceptions a lot more. There are all sorts of errors like network errors, some image fails to load etc.</p><p>To make the app stable, we had to add a lot of exception handling, null checks, and mostly retries in almost all network calls.</p><h2>3) Distributed logs</h2><p>We use <a href="https://sentry.io/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Sentry</a> &amp; Crashlytics to manage and catch all our exceptions &amp; logs. We really love the service and it has a nice pricing model. We have now integrated our backend in JAVA with Sentry.</p><h2>4) Analytics is everything</h2><p>We use a mix of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">firebase</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">mixpanel</a> &amp; AWS cloudwatch for our analytics. Analytics on mobile is a bit harder as everything you want to track requires a code change. Also, that would mean a lot of network calls for each event.</p><p>We found a way and moved the analytics to our backend system. So on an action like read, like, comment, etc when there is a database update, we trigger lambdas using AWS DDB stream and send metrics from there to other services. This helps us reduce the overall number of network requests and makes it easier to have the logic out of the mobile app.</p><h2>5) It’s so hard to A/B test</h2><p>As compared to any other software A/B testing is really hard on mobile. With websites you can have a version that people will see when they visit your URL with mobile your users will have a whole mix of versions, devices, screen-sizes and a lot more variables. So we are still figuring out how to do this.</p><p>Implementing A/B testing is harder in mobile as we need to create two separate code blocks and use firebase remote config or something similar to run once code block for some users and another for some other.</p><h2>6) Login/SignUp is the most important screen in your app</h2><p>The most important piece of code in your mobile app is your login/signup page. We learned this the hard way. We never paid much attention to our sigun/login page but when we analyzed the analytics we saw that from all the people who “installed” the app only 60% were actually signing up.</p><p>Hence we now do rigorous testing of our signup page. After so much work we still keep finding a lot of bugs/error in our login &amp; signup flow.</p><h2>7) Updates are harder because of backward compatibility</h2><p>With AWS, I am used to pushing to Production almost every other day. But with mobile, you need to take care of backward compatibility a lot more.</p><p>Like we have a bug in our app where a blog will show as being “unfollowed” even when the user is following it. This was caused by two bugs with one being in the mobile app and another in our backend. Now if I fix the backend bug the current mobile app will break. So what we do? We fixed the bug in the mobile app and after around 15 days or when 90% of users have updated to the latest app, we will push fix to the backend.</p><h2>8) Have a clear 2-way communication channel with users</h2><p>It is very important to have some way in which users can reach out to you. At first, we thought just asking our users to email us would be enough but I think around 5% of all users ever emailed us.

June 29, 2020 | https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Multiple vulnerabilities could allow running arbitrary code on an intranet server and gain root access on all the customers' routers</p>

<p>Telia is a Swedish multinational telecommunications company. It also operates in Lithuania and provides mobile service, FTTH internet, DSL internet and IPTV. Telia rents and sells custom routers and set-top tv boxes to customers which have limited or almost no administration access left to them.</p>

<p>Every Telia router or tv box has a backdoor or "management interface". It is an <code>SSH</code> server running on VLAN 5 and/or WAN. Usually, it is running on port <code>8022</code>. Older models, like <code>ADB</code>, have password login enabled. The recent newer models, like <code>Technicolor</code>, have password login disabled and only use ssh with public key authentication (spoiler: it is still vulnerable).</p>

<p>Savitarna (in Lithuanian "Self service") - is a web service <a href="https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso">https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso</a> that allows Telia customers to order and manage services, get invoices, pay bills etc. It uses password authentication or external authority logins such as Facebook, Google, banking, digital signature etc. One of the new features: changing your router's wifi password. Sounds interesting, right? An internet web service that is able to change your local router's wifi password.</p>
<p>Login page:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-login.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna web login page"></p>
<p>Change wifi settings:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-wifi-settings.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna WiFi setting change feature"></p>

<p>How that works. When a user wants to change the password, the web service calls the backend to initiate an SSH connection to the user's associated router. Depending on the router it will be either password authentication or RSA public key. After a successful login a PHP script on the backend will issue some commands in the router's shell, parse the result and output some of the data to the user in the web UI, like wireless network name. <strong>Telia knows your WIFI password in plain text</strong>, keep it in mind and do not reuse this password anywhere. Overall scheme:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor-scheme.jpg" alt="Overall scheme of Telia backdoor"></p>

<p>Let's take a look at how the SSH connection is established. Network capture shows an SSH client banner and the remote IP that initiated the connection:</p>
<p><code>SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.4.2 PHP 10.0.98.251</code></p>
<p>What is important here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable <code>libssh2</code> version <code>1.4.2</code> <a href="https://www.libssh2.org/security.html">https://www.libssh2.org/security.html</a></li>
<li>Weak and deprecated key exchange <code>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</code></li>
<li>The client does not verify <code>remote SSH server public key</code> (see below)</li>
<li><code>PHP</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And, yes, it turns out that Telia's client does not attempt to verify the remote server's public key. We were able to start a custom SSH server on the same port 8022 and Savitarna successfully established a connection without even trying to verify for a man-in-the-middle. This means that we can see the password used and could try to create a malicious SSH server that exploits public vulnerabilities on Telia's side.</p>

<p>That was an easy task. As soon as Telia's client connected to our malicious SSH server we got the universal router credentials:</p>
<pre>User: tadmin
Password: hqMV8Wps
</pre>

<p>Do you still own an ADB router? Just go ahead and login over the web interface with this user. You are now an admin. You can do some restricted stuff now, great! But what about the root shell? We were able to connect with those credentials locally and got a limited shell. That's nice too. This gave us a lot of additional information that was hidden inside the router, many more vulnerabilities. Using one of them we were able to escalate to root and got full access over the device. The newer models like Technicolor require some additional exploits chained to gain full root access, but all are publicly available and so - easily doable.</p>

<p>In order to exploit RCE we needed to build a virtual test environment that fully copies Telia's PHP client. Step by step we have gone through the sequence of Telia's commands sent over the SSH. And finally we got a malicious SSH server and a test libssh2 client running in our test lab. With this server we could fully control the protocol and start fuzzing.</p>
<p>In the first few days of the fuzzing we got some crashes and partially confirmed that RCE may be exploited. Here is a sample GIF video that demonstrates two kinds of the issues the fuzzer found for us. Same php file was executed twice, but the malicious SSH server sent different payloads which caused:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segfault (stack corruption)</li>
<li>Infinite loop with high CPU</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-poc.gif" alt="GIF PoC video"></p>
<p>However, at the time of the report we couldn't find an easy way to exploit the stack corruption. It may require more time, longer and more sophisticated fuzzing and more knowledge about the server. As Lithuanian law prohibits exploit testing on the real server, we could only fingerprint the Windows OS, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The backend seems to run only 5 php processes, so it is fairly easy to perform DoS by keeping stalled ssh connections. When SSH connections stay active for too long filling all the 5 php processes (there seems to be no timeout reading the remote shell), the Savitarna will show a strange "Maintenance" message:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>An update is in progress
Too many of you are trying to access the new Telia webpage.
We are expanding the resources and will accept you all soon.
Apologies for any inconvenience
</pre>

<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-DoS.jpg" alt="Service unavailbale"></p>

<p>If we now get all together, an attacker could exploit RCE on the intranet server and use that server to move laterally (because <code>10.0.98.251</code> is whitelisted everywhere) across all the customer routers with the same credentials creating the most powerful, persistent and undetectable botnet of Lithuania. Who knows, maybe someone already exploited that? (spoiler: see bonus section)</p>

<p>The report was responsibly disclosed to Telia and a copy sent to <code>CERT LT</code> (<a href="https://www.nksc.lt/">NKSC</a>). What happened next was a little bit of a surprise to the team. There were rumours previously about Telia's poor tech level, but we have experienced this in a real case.</p>
<p>First, Telia did not have a PGP key and did not know how to use it, so instead they asked us to ZIP the report with password and send the password over a separate email (private GMail). I hope Telia's engineers will be reading this article, so I would like to explain why the report should be encrypted. This is to protect you as the affected vendor. If there is a man in the middle who can intercept all the researcher's traffic, it will be very easy to get the ZIP file in the first email and then the password in the second email. Instead, PKI like PGP only allows to decrypt the report by the private key owner, ensuring that nobody else can intercept the report and exploit the vulnerabilities before you fix them all. </p>
<p>Second, Telia tried to threaten the reporter for the vulnerability discovery:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information
Are you sure you did not violate the electronic data protection law?
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>
<pre>Dėkojame už informaciją.
Ar tikrai tyrimą atlikote ir neviešus elektroninius duomenis rinkote
nepažeidžiant galiojančių įstatymų?
</pre>

<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-csirt-response-1.jpg" alt="Telia CSIRT email response"></p>
<p>And then they once again mentioned that they will check if this report wasn't a hacking attempt and that they will persecute any reporter that discloses any information about Telia vulnerabilities:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information. We will continue to check whether you made your report
legally without violating any law. And we will ensure that no fake information will be
published that could do any harm to the company's reputation and to the critical part
of Lithuanian network infrastructure.
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>
<pre>Dėkojame Jums už pasidalintą informaciją, kurios surinkimo teisėtumo vertinimą toliau
atliekame ir tikimės, kad į viešumą nebus paskleista tikrovės neatitinkanti ar neteisėtai
gauta informacija, kuri darytų žalą bendrovės reputacijai ir tuo pačiu sėtų nepasitikėjimą
kritine Lietuvos ryšių infrastruktūros dalimi.

<p>We will not comment on this and let the IT community to judge. At the same time we will no longer provide any reports in any form to Telia company.</p>

<p>* Note: partial fix for KEX means the new KEX is not considered to be weak, however it is now possible to exploit libssh2 vulnerabilities after 1.8.0 with this particular KEX and a publicly known exploit for <a href="https://github.com/Semmle/SecurityExploits/blob/446048470633bf0f8da9570d008d056dbaa28ea9/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_kex_CVE-2019-13115/server/home/diff.txt">KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256</a></p>

<p>After getting the root access and analyzing the Telia's routers' firmwares, we found several more users, like <code>ladmin</code> and <code>technician</code>. We will not disclose those passwords (yet), as it is not clear yet how both are used. But we were surprised that Telia's passwords appeared to be leaked many years ago. You can try to search for the tadmin password's hash on the web and you will be surprised - there was an attempt to crack the hash back in 2014!</p>

<p>And finally, we found that the hash was cracked and was available in the old "weakpass" database. You can search for the "old" weakpass database (sometimes named "First version of weakpass") and grep it - password is there. This means that most probably we are not the first who were able to penetrate Telia.</p>

<pre>2019-10-22 - tried to get in touch with Telia and asked for PGP key
2019-10-23 - password protected ZIP sent to Telia as they asked
2019-10-24 - Telia confirmed that report had been received
2019-11-21 - disclosure reminder sent to Telia
2019-11-23 - Telia tried to threaten the reporter
2019-11-27 - Telia confirmed that everything was safe, vulnerabilities were "always fixed"
2020-06-29 - full disclosure

								<p>On April 28, 2020, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published two final rules that will eliminate the license exception for civil end users (CIV) in the People’s Republic of China, Russia, and Venezuela and expand military end use and end user restrictions on these countries. These rules confront the national security risks presented by the increasing integration of civilian and military technology development, particularly in China, by requiring U.S. Government review of a broader range of exports including electronics and telecommunications items only controlled for antiterrorism (AT) reasons (with licenses subject to a presumption of denial) when shipped for military end uses or to military end users. These final rules will go into effect on June 29, 2020.</p>
<p>BIS also published a proposed rule that would modify License Exception Additional Permissive Reexports (APR) by restricting the destinations that will be eligible for the license exception. Comments on the proposed rule are also due June 29, 2020.<span id="more-1180"></span></p>
<p><strong>Expansion of Controls Related to Military End Use or Military End Users in China, Russia, or Venezuela</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-28/pdf/2020-07241.pdf">first final rule</a> expands license requirements for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items intended for military end uses and military end users in China, Russia, and Venezuela, pursuant to § 744.21 of the EAR. Effective June 29, 2020, the final rule:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imposes a restriction on exports to <u>military end users</u> in China, similar to current requirements for Venezuela and Russia.</strong> Currently, for specified items, EAR Section 744.21 requires a license where the exporter has knowledge that (i) an item destined for China, Russia, or Venezuela will be used for a <u>military end use</u>, or (ii) an item destined for Russia or Venezuela (but not China) will be for a <u>military end user</u>.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The term “military end user,” includes not only “the national armed services (army, navy, marine, air force, or coast guard), as well as the national guard and national police, government intelligence or reconnaissance organizations,” but also “<u>any person or entity whose actions or functions are intended to support ‘military end uses</u>.’”</li>
<li>Many large commercial manufacturers and other companies, particularly in China (as well as Russia and to a lesser extent Venezuela) may conduct some activities in support of a military end use. Under the new rule, it appears that a license may be required to export the covered categories of items (e.g., 3A991 integrated circuits) to such companies, even if the item itself will be used exclusively in connection with commercial applications. If interpreted in this way, the rule could have a broad impact; it will be important to monitor further guidance from BIS. Under any interpretation, exporters will need to focus their due diligence on whether any aspect of their counterparties’ business supports military end uses particularly in China, given what BIS refers to in the rule as “China’s widespread civil-military integration.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Significantly expands the list of items subject to the military end use and end user license requirements in Supplement No. 2 to Part 744 of the EAR</strong> for exports to China, Russia, and Venezuela. The list will now also include certain materials processing, electronics, telecommunications, mass market encryption items, sensors and lasers, propulsion, electronics, maritime equipment, and aircraft items on the Commerce Control List (CCL). For example, sending a 3A991 chip, a 5A992 iPhone, or a copy of 5D992 Microsoft Windows to a military end user in China would be subject to this restriction.</li>
<li><strong>Broadens the “military end use” definition. </strong> “Military end use” currently is defined as:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Incorporation into a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML);</li>
<li>Incorporation into a military item described on the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement Web site at <a href="http://www.wassenaar.org/">http://www.wassenaar.org</a>);</li>
<li>Incorporation into items classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs; or</li>
<li>For the “use,” “development,” or “production” of military items described above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Use” normally has a conjunctive definition with six elements – meaning all the elements need to be satisfied to constitute “use.” In this case, the final rule expands the “military end use” definition to also include<u> any item that supports or contributes to any one of the elements of “use,” i.e., the operation, installation, maintenance, repair, overhaul, refurbishing, “development,” <strong>or</strong> “production,” of military items.</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adopts a policy of presumption of denial of licenses </strong>for exports to China, Russia, and Venezuela for military end uses and end users, rather than the existing case-by-case license review standard. Accordingly, license applications pursuant to EAR § 744.21 will be denied in most cases.</li>
<li><strong>Expands Electronic Export Information (EEI) requirements for all items listed on the CCL that are destined for China, Russia, and Venezuela – independent of end use or value. </strong>Per the Foreign Trade Regulations, many less sensitive AT-controlled items generally do not require EEI reporting at all if their value is less than $2,500, and even if reported, the EEI would generally not need to specify an ECCN. The final rule requires EEI reporting to identify specific ECCNs for tangible exports of all items listed on the CCL to China, Russia, and Venezuela, with very few exceptions. As a result, even if a company does business with these countries entirely in the commercial realm, its export reporting obligations may change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Elimination of License Exception Civil End Users (CIV) </strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-28/pdf/2020-07240.pdf">second final rule</a> eliminates License Exception CIV. License Exception CIV currently authorizes the export of certain items that are controlled for national security (NS) reasons provided that the items are destined to civil end users for civil uses in Country Group D:1, which includes, among others, China, Russia, Venezuela, Ukraine, and Iraq. A number of items currently may be exported under License Exception CIV, including certain telecommunication equipment and computers. Accordingly, as of June 29, 2020 companies will no longer be able to utilize License Exception CIV.</p>
<p><strong>Modification of License Exception Additional Permissive Reexports (APR)</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/28/2020-07239/modification-of-license-exception-additional-permissive-reexports-apr">third rule</a> is a proposed rule that would modify License Exception APR, which currently authorizes the reexport of certain items from Country Group A:1 or Hong Kong to destinations in Country Group B (so long as the destination is not also in Country Groups D:2, D:3, or D:4) and Country Group D:1. The rule proposes removing destinations in Country Group D:1, including China, as eligible recipients of national security-controlled items reexported under License Exception APR.</p>

For me, at work, that means every day at 5:30 p.m. ET there's an update on COVID-19 from public health officials in Alberta and at 6 p.m. ET the same thing happens in BC. Over the past few weeks, it's more like every other day, but you get my drift.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Because those are the provincial updates that fall on my watch, I've listened to more than a hundred of them and I'm pretty sure the inside voice in my head is now either Dr. Deena Hinshaw or Dr. Bonnie Henry. And it's always telling me to stay calm and be kind.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Which is why last Thursday, accustomed to my normal show routine, I was jolted to hear Dr. Henry in tears. She wasn't talking about COVID-19 though, at least not directly. She was talking about overdoses.</p>  <p><em><strong>Watch Dr. Henry's comments on the opioid fatalities:</strong></em><br> <span><span><span></span><span>B.C.'s provincial health officer teared up as she shared her condolences with the loved ones of overdose victims.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:47</span></span></span></p>  <p>Last month in B.C. a record number of people died from an overdose; 170. It's also more than the total number of deaths due to Coronavirus in the province; 167. More than 400 people in B.C. have died from overdosing during the three months COVID-19 measures have been in place.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Dr. Henry's emotion was raw as she talked about those numbers. They were moms, dads, sons and daughters. She also noted the increased toxicity of street supply.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"COVID-19 is not our only health crisis," she told reporters. "I cannot express how difficult this news has been to hear, my thoughts and condolences go to those who have lost their loved ones and I share your grief."</p>    <p>I can't imagine the impact of isolation on someone who suffers from addiction. The decision to reach out and ask for help, or to talk to a friend, must already be tough — but the inability to do so must be crushing. Outreach workers say physical distancing measures also mean less people can access addiction services. It is a devastating combination.&nbsp;</p>  <p>According to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/drug-overdoses-covid19-1.5605563"><u>a report by CBC's Health unit,</u></a> early data from Ontario shows a 25% increase in the number of overdose-related deaths from March to May over the same period last year.</p>  <p>In Alberta, the number of opioid-related calls to EMS went from 257 in March to 550 this May.</p>  <p>A report from Toronto's medical officers of health shows paramedics there responded to 25 suspected opioid overdose deaths in April, the highest number since September 2017.</p>    <p>In an interview last week, Vancouver mayor Kennedy Stewart was also visibly shaken by the increase in deaths in his province.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This keeps me up every night and it has, really, since I started campaigning for mayor," he told me.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Stewart stressed the importance of finding a safe drug supply — essentially a prescription alternative to street drugs — and lauded the federal government's efforts on that front during the pandemic. He hopes the measures aren't temporary.</p>  <p>"We've got to make it permanent … otherwise these numbers are just going to continue, not just here, but right across the country."</p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Outreach workers worry that easy access to CERB may be linked to a spike in opioid overdoses in Ontario and B.C.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:03</span></span></span></p>  <p>Public health officials in various parts of the country are pressing Ottawa for more funding for a safe supply of drugs in their provinces and cities. People I spoke to in the federal government say they expect to be able to provide a lot of that funding soon — but provinces have some jurisdiction here as well. On the question of whether to make safe supply funding permanent, everyone I spoke to said a decision hadn't been made, but the federal minister of health was open to the conversation.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Dr. Henry has gone a step further than making a call for a safe drug supply in the past; calling for decriminalization of all illicit drugs.&nbsp;</p>  <p>That's a controversial position and often a politically contentious one — we saw that in the last federal election. Unsurprisingly, the call to decriminalize was rejected by governments prior to COVID-19; but this pandemic has changed so much — given the heartbreaking volume of overdoses in the last three months I wonder if it will change that too.</p>  <hr>  <h2>Subscribe to the full newsletter</h2>  <p>This is just one part of the Minority Report newsletter.&nbsp; Read the latest on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic by&nbsp;<a href="http://newsletters.cbc.ca/q/119z4mlxXDye/wv" title="Read the full newsletter">clicking here</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/minorityreport" target="_blank">sign up for the newsletter here</a>&nbsp;and it will be delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-86cc504f0c3a34e020e4"><div><p><strong>Problem: </strong>Right now, investing in private equity funds is only open to accredited investors and qualified clients. However, on June 3rd “The U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees retirement plan rules, on June 3&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-03/private-equity-firms-get-trump-administration-s-nod-to-tap-401ks" title="Private Equity Gets a Big Win With U.S. Nod to Tap 401(k) Plans" target="_blank">issued guidance</a>&nbsp;that’s been taken as a green light to include PE funds in some plans. It doesn’t say that workers should suddenly get an option to pick one by themselves. Rather a PE fund might be included as part of the portfolio of another diversified fund.”</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>A private equity fund that is funded primarily through 401ks. As described by Bloomberg in their article <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-26/private-equity-is-coming-for-the-6-trillion-401-k-market">"Private Equity is Coming for The $6 Trillion 401k Market":</a></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-26/private-equity-is-coming-for-the-6-trillion-401-k-market">There’s roughly $5.6 trillion in such accounts (401ks),</a> and the prospect of capturing even a sliver of it has the industry abuzz. A more complicated question is whether ordinary investors will really want their money going into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-10-03/how-private-equity-works-and-took-over-everything" title="Everything Is Private Equity Now" target="_blank">buyout funds</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/private-equity" title="QuickTake: Private Equity" target="_blank">Private equity is a different beast</a>&nbsp;from the mutual funds retirement savers are familiar with. PE managers often buy companies whole, financing the purchase with debt that ends up on the books of the companies themselves. That adds to potential profits but also to risk and complexity. Funds tend to have long lockup periods, during which investors can’t get their money out, and charge high management fees as well as take a share of profits off the top.</p></blockquote><p>Since this new guidance was issued less than 30 days ago, the industry is ripe for disruption. Because it is so new, the business would be primarily focused on marketing the opportunity to prospective investors and educating them about the potential risks and rewards. Of course, since PE funds would be layered inside other funds, the business’ goal would be to become part of as many blended funds as possible: thus, another avenue of marketing would be to fund-makers to be included in their funds and receive 401k dollars.</p><p><strong>Monetization: </strong>Ultimately, the goal of the business would be to acquire as much capital as possible: <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/how-private-equity-firms-make-money">PE funds have a monetization</a> model of fees (about 2%) and carried interest (20%). This business would adopt that model.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>It’s crazy to think my startup is already over 6 months old. This post is some informal reflections on that period.</p>
<p>To set the context for people who are not me, this was my first foray into startups. The startup is pretty lean (it’s a saas security startup), only on the verge of profitability. Single digit customers.</p>
<p>A lot of this may sound complain-y, they’re definitely first world problems. But they are things I wish I had fully internalized.</p>
<h2 id="nobody-cares">Nobody cares</h2>
<p>It sounds very negative, and I don’t mean it in a bad way. But I think it applies to many aspects of building the startup.</p>
<p>People want a tool that solves the problem. No one cares about the effort involved in creating little features. No one cares about the story, no one cares how it works. They just want to be re-assured it will work, so they can focus on their 1000 other problems.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s just important to remember.</p>
<p>The fact that no one cares also has positive aspects! I was worried about my two hours of planned downtime when I was doing a large migration. Literally no one cared. I think my startup could have been down for a few days, and no one would of cared that much. Unfortunately or fortunately I focused a lot on reliability (which was kind of wasted effort now that I realize it).</p>
<h2 id="careful-with-free-trials">Careful with free trials</h2>
<p>I thought it would be cool if I had a free sandbox plan. Let people kick the tires. When they see the amazing value they’ll upgrade!</p>
<p>Not so much.</p>
<p>The free sandbox offering attracted over 1000 businesses. Super neat! The only problem was… no one upgraded to paying plans. So I’m supporting 1000 customers on my platform. Goodbye life savings (kidding, but it does cost non-trivial money).</p>
<p>I don’t want to dive into the specifics of content-security-policy report-uri, but having a sandbox account created weird dynamics/incentives. My startup focuses on making this specific security tool easier. And I charge based on “usage” of the feature. But by making this security tool easier, there was less need for usage. So every feature I included made the Sandbox account a better solution, no need to upgrade for more usage.</p>
<p>So I had 1000+ people using the platform, and they had no incentive to upgrade. And every feature I released solidified that SANDBOX was all your need. I could of limited key features, but I hate it when other companies do that, and it wasn’t obvious to me what features to limit. It also feels dis-honest. Instead I’d rather focus on making the best product. So instead I went with a free trial period and made the choice to discontinue SANDBOX accounts. (If you were a sandbox user of Csper, against I apologize, but it had to be done).</p>
<p>There’s way less usage, but now people pay for the service. And I’m not fronting the bill for &gt;1000 customers (which I can not do for long since i’m self bootstrapped).</p>
<h2 id="seo--pipeline--ads">SEO / Pipeline / Ads</h2>
<p>It sounds so obvious now, but wasn’t fully fully internalized when I started.</p>
<p>People aren’t just going to “stumble” onto your product.</p>
<p>When Csper was released, I made sure it could handle a lot of load. I was worried that it would spread like wildfire. So I made sure everything could scale. Autoscaling k8s, autoscaling database. I setup observability on everything to debug issues, tracing, logging, monitoring dashboards, etc.</p>
<p>Long story short, almost no one showed up.</p>
<p>SEO / Marketing are the name of the game. (not an endorsement), but getting setup with SEM rush to track my SEO (specifically content marketing).</p>
<h2 id="people-like-open-source-a-lot">People like “open source”… a lot</h2>
<p>I built a similar open source product about 5-6 years ago. It’s crazy how fast people will refer an open source product compared to a paid product.</p>
<p>It’s a huge marketing advantage I never really considered. The product today is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the 5-6 year old product, yet people still share links to my old defunct product.</p>
<p>“open source” seems to trump reliability. I’m probably the same way, so I can’t complain too much. Just interesting to watch it happen.</p>
<p>I was very tempted to shift to “open source” and then have a paid plan. But, never did.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-plus-working-for-yourself-is-amazing">On the plus, working for yourself is… amazing</h2>
<p>I loved all my previous jobs. For better or worse, work is usually the center of my life.</p>
<p>But, there’s something about waking up in the morning, making yourself some coffee, and pouring your heart into something you own. For awhile I would shoot out of bed at 6am (without an alarm) because I was so excited to get to work. I’d work for 12 hours, and then do it all again, and I was excited about it.</p>
<p>And it’s so nice knowing where everything is. At some point I had to do a decent sized migration across 125 files. Knowing how everything works and where it is makes every project nice and fun. No hidden side effects.</p>
<h2 id="delayed-reward">Delayed reward</h2>
<p>More of a psychological thing. But it’s hard to remove the feeling of working hard and getting a reward.</p>
<p>I did two large migrations on Csper. One was a re-write of “projects” and “organizations” to consolidate billing and other stuff. It was like 4500 lines of code over 125 files. Then doing all the data base migrations and testing… It was a lot of work to make sure it all worked correctly. And it was a bit stressful.</p>
<p>After the release went smoothly, it was a hurah! But, it’s not like I would instantly get any new customers.</p>
<p>After the migration is done, I’m still just staring at my computer, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Being generous, let’s say the different of consolidated billings increased conversions by 5%, I’d have to wait awhile to see that impact. I don’t think I even got a new customer that week.</p>
<p>It can be dis-heartening when you work super hard, but then nothing happens. It was a mental barrier to separate that.</p>
<h2 id="its-a-bit-of-a-rollercoaster">It’s a bit of a rollercoaster</h2>
<p>It seems like when things go bad, a lot of things go bad at once. A customer will leave, the firefox extension store will remove my addon, some feature will be acting up, and your competitors just signed a big deal.</p>
<p>That emotional buffer is important. I should have remembered to leave some room in my emotional tank to take hits. Wearing thin and then taking a couple of hits is not fun.</p>
<p>In the movies/books/interwebs every startup is successful. When you see people working hard, it’s like “no duh, the payoff and reward will be huge!” But in real life you have to face that most likely it will fail. When do you cut your losses? When you take a number of hits at once, those questions go to the front of your mind.</p>
<h2 id="lonely">Lonely</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest downside to this adventure so far is not working on a team. I miss is celebrating wins. Giving yourself a high five when a customer signs up is cool, but experiences are better shared with someone.</p>
<p>My girlfriend and I recently worked out a system where I get a twinkie when I get a new customer. Which is very nice. We celebrate the wins, but there’s something about a group working towards a goal and achieving that goal.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-are-meh">Bug Fixes are… meh</h2>
<p>Previously as an engineer I would hate publishing bugs in my code. Where’s the attention to craft!</p>
<p>But now being honest about my todo list, most bugs don’t matter <em>that</em> much. The chance of defering a customer from paying because of a bug here and there is pretty small. (I mean, it depends on the bug, and you should try super hard not to have bugs. It’s no excuse for being sloppy).</p>
<p>But, I have a bug tracker pretty full of little bugs here and there. But when I assign dollar values to them, SEO/marketing is almost always more important than fixing a bug.</p>
<p>If an article attracts two new customers, and a weird edge case defers one customer, by the numbers it’s better to focus on the article. When you’re a non-bootstrapped solo startup, you have to run towards the money. You also can’t make everyone happy.</p>
<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>Some things that I already knew, and thankful that I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staging/prod. Staging saved my butt a number of times. And made things way less stressful when doing big changes. Worth every penny.</li>
<li>k8s on gke was pretty nice. it took a day or two to get my infra setup, and then I never really thought about it. it just scales here and there.</li>
<li>Single command deploys, and lots of makefiles. Any command that could be useful later I store in a makefile. i never want to think about things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that were surprisingly frustrating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser extension review processes!
<ul>
<li>Chrome takes weeks and weeks to review extensions</li>
<li>Firefox is super picky about making sure that they can compile your code and it exactly matches what’s in the app store</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SaaS trails/charges. You rely on a number of services for your startup, and they start to add up. Some companies are also very sneaky about not emailing you before they charge your credit card. There was one company that charged me for 6 months without sending a single email.
<ul>
<li>I should of been reviewing my credit card statements, but when you’re already working long days, it’s near the bottom of the chopping block. At the end of the day, writing another article for SEO is more important than checking a hypothetical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kind of weird point, but I tried advertising on linkedin/google/facebook/twitter. I left with a very negative view of all the platforms and try very hard not to read from them anymore. Everyone knows that those platforms are about advertising, but it wasn’t until I was trying to shove my agenda down other peoples throats did I realize how disgusting it was. Now I see all the other businesses doing what I was doing, pushing their own agenda. I want no part of anyone else’s agenda. I was probably doing ads wrong, but I saw no drop in signups after I stopped them. I’m going to fully focus on SEO instead. I feel good about that, when people have a problem, they’ll google for it, and my company will be there.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, building Csper has been a interesting experience. Maybe …</p></div></div>

June 29, 2020 | http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/bits_and_bytes.asp | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/bits_and_bytes.asp">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>
	We sill start off by walking though the different parts of a GIF file.
	(The information on this page is primarily drawn from the
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt">W3C GIF89a specification</a>.)
	A GIF file is made up of a bunch of different "blocks" of data. The following diagram
	shows all of the different types of blocks and where they belong in the file. The file starts
	at the left and works it's way right. At each branch you may go one way or the other. The
	large "middle" section can be repeated as many times as needed. (Technically, it may
	also be omitted completely but i can't imagine what good a GIF file with no image data
	would be.)
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/gif_file_stream.gif" alt="GIF file stream diagram" width="700" height="220"></p>
	<p>
	I'll show you what these blocks looks like by walking through a sample
	GIF file. You can see the sample file and its corresponding bytes below.
	</p>
	

	<p>
	Note that not all blocks are represented in this sample file. I will provide samples of missing
	blocks where appropriate.
	The different types of blocks include:
		<a href="#header_block">header</a>,
		<a href="#logical_screen_descriptor_block">logical screen descriptor</a>,
		<a href="#global_color_table_block">global color table</a>,
		<a href="#graphics_control_extension_block">graphics control extension</a>,
		<a href="#image_descriptor_block">image descriptor</a>,
		<a href="#local_color_table_block">local color table</a>,
		<a href="#image_data_block">image data</a>,
		<a href="#plain_text_extension_block">plain text extension</a>,
		<a href="#application_extension_block">application extension</a>,
		<a href="#comment_extension_block">comment extension</a>,
		and <a href="#trailer_block">trailer</a>.
	Let's get started with the first block!
	</p>

	<h2><a name="header_block">Header Block</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: </p>
	<p>
	All GIF files must start with a header block. The header takes up the first
	six bytes of the file. These bytes should all correspond to
	<a href="http://www.ascii.cl/">ASCII character codes</a>. We actually have two pieces
	of information here. The first three bytes are called the <strong>signature</strong>.
	These should always be "GIF" (ie 47="G", 49="I", 46="F"). The next three specify the
	<strong>version</strong> of the specification that was used to encode the image. We'll only be working
	with "89a" (ie 38="8", 39="9", 61="a"). The only other recognized version string
	is "87a" but i doubt most people will run into those anymore.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/header_block.gif" alt="GIF header block layout"></p>

	<h2><a name="logical_screen_descriptor_block">Logical Screen Descriptor</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 91 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	The logical screen descriptor always immediately follows the header. This block
	tells the decoder how much room this image will take up. It is exactly
	seven bytes long. It starts with the <strong>canvas width</strong>. This value
	can be found in the first two bytes. It's saved in a format called the spec
	simply calls <em>unsigned</em>. Basically we're looking at a 16-bit, nonnegative
	integer (0-65,535). As with all the other multi-byte values in the GIF format, the least
	significant byte is stored first (little-endian format). This means where we would read
	<span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span>
	from the byte stream, we would normally write it as <span>000A</span> which is
	the same as 10. Thus the width of our sample image is 10 pixels. As a further example
	255 would be stored as <span> FF </span><span> 00 </span> but 256 would be <span> 00 </span><span> 01 </span>.
	As you might expect, the <strong>canvas height</strong> follows. Again, in this sample we
	can see this value is <span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span> which is 10.
	</p>
	<p>
	Next we have a <em>packed byte</em>. That means that this byte actually has multiple values
	stored in its bits. In this case, the byte <span> 91 </span> can be represented
	as the binary number <span>10010001</span>. (The built in Windows calculator
	is actually very useful when converting numbers into hexadecimal and binary formats. Be sure
	it's in "scientific" or "programmer" mode, depending on the version of
	windows you have.) The first (most-significant) bit is the <strong>global color
	table flag</strong>. If it's 0, then there is none. If it's 1, then a global color table will
	follow. In our sample image, we can see that we will have a global color table (as will usually
	be the case).  The next three bits represent the <strong>color resolution</strong>. The spec
	says this value " is the number of bits per primary color available to the original image,
	minus 1" and "...represents the size of the entire palette from which the colors in the
	graphic were selected." Because i don't much about what this one does, I'll point you to
	a more knowledgeable article on <a href="http://www.devx.com/projectcool/Article/19997/0/page/7">bit and color depth</a>.
	For now 1 seems to work. Note that <span>001</span> represents 2 bits/pixel;
	<span>111</span> would represent 8 bits/pixel.
	The next single bit is the <strong>sort flag</strong>. If the values is 1, then the
	colors in the global color table are sorted in order of "decreasing importance," which
	typically means "decreasing frequency" in the image. This can help the image decoder but
	is not required. Our value has been left at 0. The last three bits are the <strong>
	size of global color table</strong>. Well, that's a lie; it's not the actual size of the
	table. If this value is N, then the actual table size is 2^(N+1). From our sample
	file, we get the three bits <span>001</span> which is the binary version of 1.
	Our actual table size would be 2^(1+1) = 2^2 = 4. (We've mentioned the global color table
	several times with this byte, we will be talking about what it is in the next section.)
	</p>
	<p>
	The next byte gives us the <strong>background color index</strong>. This byte is only meaningful
	if the global color table flag is 1. It represents which color in the global color table
	(by specifying its index) should be used for pixels whose value is not specified in the
	image data. If, by some chance, there is no global color table, this byte should be 0.
	</p>
	<p>
	The last byte of the logical screen descriptor is the <strong>pixel aspect ratio</strong>.
	I'm not exactly sure what this value does. Most of the images I've seen have this value
	set to 0. The spec says that if there was a value specified in this byte, N, the actual
	ratio used would be (N + 15) / 64 for all N&lt;&gt;0.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/logical_screen_desc_block.gif" alt="GIF logical screen descriptor block layout"></p>





	<h2><a name="global_color_table_block">Global Color Table</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> FF </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	We've mentioned the <strong>global color table</strong> a few times already now lets talk
	about what it actually is. As you are probably already aware, each GIF has its own color
	palette. That is, it has a list of all the colors that can be in the image and cannot
	contain colors that are not in that list. The global color table is where that list
	of colors is stored. Each color is stored in three bytes. Each of the bytes represents
	an RGB color value. The first byte is the value for red (0-255), next green, then blue.
	The size of the global color table is determined by the value in the packed byte of the
	logical screen descriptor. As we mentioned before, if the value from that byte is N, then
	the actual number of colors stored is 2^(N+1). This means that the global color table will
	take up 3*2^(N+1) bytes in the stream.
	</p>

	<div>
	<table id="global_color_size">
	<tbody><tr><th>Size In Logical<br>Screen Desc</th><th>Number Of<br>Colors</th><th>Byte<br>Length</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>12</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>24</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td>16</td><td>48</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>32</td><td>96</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>64</td><td>192</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td>128</td><td>384</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td>256</td><td>768</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>
	</div>

	<p>
	Or sample file has a global color table size of 1. This means it holds 2^(1+1)=2^2=4 colors.
	We can see that it takes up 12, (3*4), bytes as expected. We read the bytes three at a time to get
	each of the colors. The first color is #FFFFFF (white). This value is given an index of 0.
	The second color is #FF0000 (red). The color with an index value of 2 is #0000FF (blue).
	The last color is #000000 (black). The index numbers will be important when we decode
	the actual image data.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note that this block is labeled as "optional." Not every GIF has to specify a global
	color table. However, if the global color table flag is set to 1 in the logical
	screen descriptor block, the color table is then required to immediately follow that
	block.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/global_color_table.gif" alt="GIF global color table block layout"></p>



	<h2><a name="graphics_control_extension_block">Graphics Control Extension</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 21 </span><span> F9 </span><span> 04 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	Graphic control extension blocks are used frequently to
	specify transparency settings and control animations. They are completely optional.
	Since transparency and animations are bit complicated, I will hold off on many of
	the details of this block until a later section
	(see <a href="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/animation_and_transparency.asp">Transparency and Animation</a>).
	In the interest of this page being complete, I will at least tell you what
	the bytes represent.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first byte is the <strong>extension introducer</strong>. All <em>extension</em>
	blocks begin with <span>21</span>. Next is the <strong>graphic
	control label</strong>, <span>F9</span>, which is the value that
	says this is a graphic control extension. Third up is the total <strong>block
	size</strong> in bytes. Next is a packed field. Bits 1-3 are reserved for future
	use. Bits 4-6 indicate <strong>disposal method</strong>. The penult bit is
	the <strong>user input flag</strong> and the last is the <strong>transparent color
	flag</strong>. The <strong>delay time</strong> value follows in the next two bytes
	stored in the unsigned format. After that we have the <strong>transparent color
	index</strong> byte. Finally we have the <strong>block terminator</strong> which
	is always <span>00</span>.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/graphic_control_ext.gif" alt="GIF graphic control extension block layout"></p>




	<h2><a name="image_descriptor_block">Image Descriptor</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 2C </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	A single GIF file may contain multiple images (useful when creating animated
	images). Each image begins with an image descriptor block. This block is exactly
	10 bytes long.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first byte is the <strong>image separator</strong>. Every image
	descriptor begins with the value <span>2C</span>. The next 8 bytes
	represent the location and size of the following image. An image in
	the stream may not necessarily take up the entire canvas size defined by
	the logical screen descriptor. Therefore, the image descriptor specifies
	the <strong>image left position</strong> and <strong>image top position</strong> of
	where the image should begin on the canvas. Next it specifies the
	<strong>image width</strong> and <strong>image height</strong>. Each of these
	values is in the two-byte, unsigned format. Our sample image indicates that
	the image starts at (0,0) and is 10 pixels wide by 10 pixels tall. (This image
	does take up the whole canvas size.)
	</p>
	<p>
	The last byte is another packed field. In our sample file this byte is 0 so
	all of the sub-values will be zero. The first (most significant) bit in
	the byte is the <strong>local color table flag</strong>. Setting this flag
	to 1 allows you to specify that the image data that follows uses a different
	color table than the global color table. (More information on the local
	color table follows.) The second bit is the <strong>interlace flag</strong>.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/image_descriptor_block.gif" alt="GIF image descriptor block layout"></p>





	<h2><a name="local_color_table_block">Local Color Table</a></h2>
	<p>
	The local color table looks identical to the global color table. The local
	color table would always immediately follow an image descriptor but will only
	be there if the local color table flag is set to 1. It is effective only for the
	block of image data that immediately follows it. If no local color table
	is specified, the global color table is …</p></div></div>

<p>We are back with another blog post on <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> vs. <a href="https://www.airsend.io/discover">AirSend</a>: Roles and Permissions Explained. We recently wrote about Discord vs. AirSend Design Edition, which you can read about by clicking <a href="https://www.airsend.io/blog/index.php/2020/05/18/discord-vs-airsend-design-edition/">here</a>. In this blog post, we will be discussing the user roles from each platform. User roles help make managing communities easier. The question then remains, what type of roles are needed to manage a community efficiently?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To answer this question we analyze how user roles are implemented in AirSend and Discord.</p>



<h2>AirSend’s Roles</h2>



<figure><img src="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-13.png" alt="" width="448" height="562" srcset="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-13.png 597w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-13-239x300.png 239w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px"></figure>



<p>Typically when creating a community,&nbsp; user roles are established to help run the channel. Airsend takes the approach of fixed user roles to manage a community. Fixed user roles allow simplicity and have the same meaning across channels and servers. We created various roles with this in mind. Beginning with the first role: viewer.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Viewer</h3>



<p>Viewers have the permissions to view the community and download files. These are for first-time visitors who haven’t joined the community and want to browse before joining. The next role on our list is a collaborator.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Collaborator</h3>



<p>Collaborators have access to posting messages and uploading files. However, collaborators cannot edit the wiki (the about section).&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-14.png" alt="" width="355" height="650" srcset="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-14.png 473w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-14-164x300.png 164w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></figure>



<p>Collaborators are the basis of your community. Ideally, collaborators are what ensure conversation happens. For a little more responsibility, there is the role of a full collaborator.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Full Collaborators</h3>



<p>A full collaborator can do everything a collaborator does. The only difference is that a full collaborator can edit the wiki. By allowing a full collaborator to help monitor the channel and edit the wiki, managers and admins can focus more on community building and outreach. After the full collaborator role is the manager and admin.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Manager/Admin</h3>



<p>Like the full collaborator roles, managers and admins also can edit the wiki, upload files, and post messages. However, the difference between the full collaborator and the manager/admin is that managers and admins can manage other users.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Now, don’t get confused. Managers and Admins are two different roles, but they mostly carry the same functionality. The difference between a manager and an admin is that the <strong>manager</strong> <strong>can add and remove other users from the channel. Admins have access to adding and removing users and changing the roles of other members. </strong>Having these two roles ensures that your community stays clean from self-promoters, rule breakers, inappropriate messages, etc.</p><p>In general, we believe that having fixed roles helps communities prosper. Fixed roles allow simplicity. For Discord, the central idea behind their roles is customization. Through their customization, complexities arise. </p></div>



<h2>Discord Roles</h2>



<figure><img src="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-15.png" alt="" width="679" height="343" srcset="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-15.png 1914w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-15-300x152.png 300w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-15-1024x518.png 1024w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-15-768x388.png 768w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-15-1536x777.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px"><figcaption>Member list seen on right panel</figcaption></figure>



<p>Discord takes the approach of dynamic user roles. It is good for communities that want customized user roles. The problem with having dynamic roles and customization is that it adds complexity. </p>



<p>For example, Server A has specified permissions for its members. Members have permission to: </p>



<ul><li>Post in channel</li><li>Share files</li><li><strong>Invite other members to the community</strong></li></ul>



<p>Now, let’s say we want to join another community, Server B. Because there is full-fledged customization, creators of the server can check off specified permissions for their roles that may be different from other servers. In Server B, members can have permission to:</p>



<ul><li>Post in Channel</li><li>Share files</li><li><strong>Add reactions</strong></li></ul>



<p>But they <strong>cannot</strong> invite other members to the community like Server A can. Members cannot view what permissions they have. Now, imagine this with higher roles. </p>



<p>Let’s say there are Moderators in Server A  and Server B. Server A has specific permissions to kick members out. In Server B, those same moderators from Server A do not have the permission to kick members out. This is not apparent to the moderators, thus confusion and complexities are formed. </p>



<h3>How to add a role to Discord</h3>



<p>To add roles, you will need to go to your servers’ settings at the top of the screen.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-16.png" alt="" width="226" height="485" srcset="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-16.png 301w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture-16-140x300.png 140w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px"></figure>



<p>Next, click on the roles button. This button will let you see and add all of your roles.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled.png" alt="" width="649" height="394" srcset="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled.png 1027w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-300x182.png 300w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-1024x621.png 1024w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Untitled-768x466.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px"><figcaption><em>The red circle is the button you click to get to the current image. The blue circle is where you add roles to your community.</em> The green circle is where you will see all the functions a role member can have. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Click on the plus icon. Doing so will allow you to create a new role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below the role color section, are all the functionalities a role member can have. Essentially, each role has specific access but carries a customized name. These names can range from Admins, Community Manager, Mods, Helpers, Servers Guide, etc. And these names come with specific functions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, specific access-only channels can be made for specific Discord roles as well. Servers can have a moderator-only chat, an admin-only chat, etc. Access-only channels are excellent use for privacy, carrying specific role meetings, organization, and maintaining order. Furthermore, bots are an excellent tool for role management. Servers can have bots for anything, but when it comes to managing servers, some bots take care of</p>



<ul><li>warning users that violate the rules</li><li>suspending users</li><li>putting users in a time out</li><li>automatically adding new users to the member roles and more.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In sum, Discord’s roles are good for communities who are looking for customized roles and bots. Bots ensure:</p>



<ul><li>The server runs smoothly with automated welcome messages to new members</li><li>Assign new users to the member role</li><li>Alert the community that the server creator put out new content</li><li>Ban or suspend members who do not follow the community rules, and much more.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Summation</h2>



<p>Both AirSend and Discord are great community platforms. Discord offers quite a bit for community building through dynamic user roles, bots, channel organizations, and more.  The downside to this approach is the complexities and confusion members will have with each community they join.  The common question will be asked, “What permissions do I have with this server that is different from another server?”</p>



<p>On the other hand, AirSend takes the approach of fixed user roles. Fixed user roles are easy to understand and avoid confusion. Fixed user roles have the same meaning across channels and makes it easy for the user onboarding. In the end, it all depends on what the user is comfortable with- having a simplistic role setting or a customized but complex setting. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>In 2008, Facebook was the hot new thing, and social media had <em>just</em> started rising. One of my high-school classes was about trying to understand that shift better.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> We read about past problems with mass media, and thought about how they might manifest in new media. To that end, we read a German novel called <em>The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum</em> by Heinrich Böll. In recent years, with social media-induced cancel culture becoming a hot issue, that novel has been on my mind frequently.</p> <p>A quick summary:</p> <blockquote> <div><p>Katharina is a 27-year old housekeeper. She’s frugal, earnest, and hard-working – a model citizen. One evening, she meets a man named Ludwig at a party, and sleeps with him. Next day, the police knocks on her door: he’s a known communist terrorist, and suspected for robbery and murder. Katharina is taken in for questioning, and released. </p><p>  This episode is observed by a reporter for the tabloid NEWS. The reporter inquires with neighbors, stretches any statements, and publishes a piece declaring Katharina to be a gold-digging communist criminal, the depraved bride of a murderous terrorist. Katharina is swiftly excluded from society and receives death threats. Under the onslaught of harassment, her hospitalized mother dies from stress. </p><p>  In the meantime, Ludwig is found to have committed no robbery or murder, but by then, the campaign against Katharina has become its own force. One sympathizer argues that the actual facts are good, and that other newspapers are reporting the facts, but – as Katharina points out through her sobs – it doesn’t matter, because <em>everyone</em> reads the NEWS. </p><p>  For no fault of her own, Katharina’s life is in shambles: her career is over, and her friends distance themselves for self-preservation. In desperation, she tries to meet with the reporter who has been hounding her. The reporter tries to extort her for sex, whereupon she shoots him. Remorseless, she turns herself in to the police for justice.</p></div> </blockquote> <p>The 70s were a heyday for tabloid newspapers. Printing any scandal, no matter how thin the facts, the tabloids were like the clickbait outrage mills of today. Their reach was wide and deep: the NEWS of the novel was a depiction in all but name of the leading tabloid in Germany, BILD, which printed six million copies every day, purchased by one in ten Germans. To be depicted unfavorably in BILD was social execution, and – as a paper dealing primarily in outrage and gossip – BILD executed plenty. Capricious and careless, their reporters had the power to ruin lives effectively at random.</p> <p>That sounds a lot like getting cancelled: for effectively no fault of your own, the outrage mob, whether online or offline, can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak#Vocabulary">unperson</a> you. While today’s media are global and more plentiful, it’s not clear that there’s been a net change in impact. Getting smeared by your local tabloid was just as radioactive as is getting smeared on Reddit, a career-ender all the same. Further, even though traditional, local media has a much smaller reach than global media, its local reach is what really matters to the person affected. Local media has a much deeper local reach, and a much greater capacity to “investigate” and report locally. While modern media operate at much greater scale, it also carries a dilutive effect. Net-net, people have always been getting disgraced, and I don’t think it’s much likelier now than it was in the past.</p> <p>In my view, cancel culture is an example of a pattern I like to call <em>there’s nothing new under the sun</em>: there are always scary changes between generations, but usually they are just new manifestations of issues as old as time. For example, many people today complain that the young spend less time on necessary schoolwork than the previous generation. But even Socrates said the exact same thing. In many domains, perceptions of progress have been pessimistic since antiquity – perhaps because memories of times past are always rose-colored by nostalgia – but reality works out.</p> <p>If today’s severity and randomness of cancel culture is not actually new, is it different in any important respects? Today’s cancel culture is one of escalating purity tests: born out of the more punitive contingents on the left, it’s not enough to not be a racist or a sexist, but one must take stronger, more condemnatory views, which function as powerful in-group signals.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Cancel culture is thus somewhat performative, and strongly ideologically motivated – some people are likening it to the witch hunts for communists in the 50s under Joseph McCarthy. The left is in a curious, self-damaging position, where lots of center-leaning moderates – who are genuine progressives – are not meeting the ideological standards of those further left, which functions to their exclusion, thereby weakening the left overall.</p> <p>Is that bad? Yes, probably. While I view the aims of social justice as largely correct and well-intentioned, cancel culture seems to produce unnecessary collateral damage that hurts its own cause. It both fragments the left – infighting over purity is a devastating waste in a time beset by serious problems requiring collective action – and it is unfair to the people it ultimately affects. But is any of this new? I don’t think it is. It’s the same old patterns and motivations under new cover. Thus, like everyone else, we acknowledge cancel culture as a trend, but unlike everyone else, we see it as a trend that is very <em>old</em> rather than <em>new</em>. In turn, the question we ask about is radically different: while everyone else asks “how has technology given rise to cancel culture”, we know that it hasn’t, and instead ask “how can we use technology to mitigate cancel culture?”</p> <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

    <p>This essay is a summary and exploration of Jimmy Song's <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-bitcoin/9781492031482/">Programming Bitcoin</a> in Clojure. The book's coding exercises are in Python, and as I am learning both Python and Clojure currently, I thought it would be fun to translate the exercises from Python to Clojure.</p><p>We start with finite fields. But why are they important to learning how to program Bitcoin? Well, Jimmy wants to teach us all the fundamentals so we know how Bitcoin's underlying components work. And guess what's at the heart of it all? That's right: finite fields.</p><p>Finite fields, along with elliptic curves (the topic covered in the next chapter), form the basis of the signing and verification algorithms that make Bitcoin transactions work, which are the atomic unit of value transfer of the network. So it's important to understand finite fields first before we learn the more advanced stuff built on top.</p><h2 id="finite-field-definition">Finite Field Definition</h2><p>A finite field is a set of finite numbers of length $$p$$ otherwise known as the order of the set, which satisfies the following properties:</p><p><strong>1. Closed property</strong></p><ul><li><p>If $$a$$ and $$b$$ are in the set then $$a * b$$ and $$a + b$$ are also in the set.</p></li><li><p>This means that we have to define addition and multiplication in a way that ensures the results stay within the set.</p></li><li><p>$${0, 1, 2}$$ is not closed under normal addition because $$1 + 2 = 3$$ and $$3$$ is not in the set.</p></li><li><p>$${-1, 0, 1}$$ is closed under normal addition and multiplication because no matter how you add or multiply the numbers, they will always be in the set.</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. Additive identity</strong></p><ul><li>$$0$$ exists and has the property that $$ a + 0 = a$$.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Multiplicative identity</strong></p><ul><li>$$1$$ exists and has the property that $$a * 1 = a$$. This is called the multiplicative identity.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Additive inverse</strong></p><ul><li>If $$a$$ is in the set then $$-a$$ is also in the set and is defined by the value that makes $$a + (-a) = 0$$.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Multiplicative inverse</strong></p><ul><li>If $$a$$ is in the set then $$a^{1}$$ is also in the set and is defined by the value that makes $$ a * a^{-1} = 1 $$.</li></ul><h2 id="defining-finite-sets">Defining Finite Sets</h2><p>Finite fields always have a prime order $$p$$ and the set will include integers between $$0$$ and $$p - 1$$, so:</p><p>$$F_p = {0, 1, 2, ... p-1}$$</p><p>And a finite field of prime order $$7$$ would look like this:</p><p>$$F_7 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$$</p><h2 id="constructing-a-finite-field-in-clojure">Constructing a Finite Field in Clojure</h2><p>We're interested in modelling finite field elements for later use with elliptic curves. So to do that in Clojure we will define a record called FieldElement. For those unfamiliar with Clojure records, they are like a map or Python dictionary or JavaScript object. While they look like a map, you define the fields upfront like so:</p><pre><code>(defrecord FieldElement [e p])
</code></pre><p>Here, <code>e</code> refers to the integer representing the field element and <code>p</code> is the prime order of the finite field for that element. But we need a way to construct a valid <code>FieldElement</code> such that the element is between <code>0</code> and <code>p - 1</code> and that the prime number supplied is, in fact, prime.</p><p>Checking if a number is within a certain interval is trivial, but checking if a number is prime is a bit more involved. While we could use trial and error to check if the prime shares any divisors other than 1, this method does not scale up as well as it could, since the size of the problem grows linearly as we keep testing the input iteratively.</p><p>Alternatively, we could use <em>Fermat's Primality Test</em>, which allows us to prove an integer as a composite with 100% accuracy or as a prime with a very high degree of accuracy. It is based on <em>Fermat's Little Theorem</em>, which will prove useful later as well. _Fermat's Little Theore_m gives us a known pattern that all primes and very few composites follow. It asserts that given some prime number $$p$$ and some other integer $$a$$:</p><p>$$a^{p} \mod p = a$$</p><p>It can also be written as:</p><p>$$a^{p-1} \mod p = 1$$</p><p>If you do $$a^{p} \mod p$$ and it returns anything other than $$a$$, you have what is called a composite witness—proof that the $$p$$ we chose cannot be prime. If you are not familiar with the modulo operator, we will be covering it soon, so don't worry. Anyways, the test works like this:</p><p>We take an integer $$p$$ whose primality we want to check as the input, then we generate a random integer $$a$$ in the range $$0 \leq a \leq p - 1$$. And then we can ask if $$a^p \mod p$$ returns $$a$$, if the answer is not $$a$$, then we know for sure it is a composite number and we can return that. If it does return $$a$$, we still do not know for sure that $$p$$ is prime. This is because of the fact that some composite numbers return $$a$$ for <em>Fermat's Primality Test</em>, and these are called Carmichael numbers, otherwise known as pseudoprimes. And the values for $$a$$ that show Carmichael numbers are primes are called fools because they fool us into thinking $$p$$ is prime when it is not.</p><p>To get over this hurdle, we can choose many different values for $$a$$, and this way we find many composite witnesses instead of values of $$a$$. It has been proven that the number of fools must divide the total size of the group we select from. What this means is that, at most, 50% of the elements in a finite field can be fools. And since $$a$$ is chosen randomly, the chance of finding a composite witness is at least 50%, and so after $$t$$ iterations, the probability no composite will be found with a composite number is at most $$\leq 1/2^t$$. So after $$50$$ iterations, the probability of mistakenly outputting a prime is $$1$$ in $$1125899906842624$$.</p><p>Fermat's test is much more efficient than simply checking greatest common divisors as the number of steps does not scale with the input. It is a logarithmic algorithm with a time complexity of $$O(log_2n)$$, meaning that the problem size splits in half each time the input size increases.</p><p>Here's how you would implement it in Clojure:</p><pre><code>(defn modpow [b e m] 
  (mod (reduce #(mod (* %1 %2) m) (repeat e b)) m))

(defn fermat-test
  "Integer -&gt; Boolean"
  [p]
  (let [a (inc (rand-int (dec p)))]
    (= (modpow a p p) a)))

(defn prime? 
  "Integer -&gt; Boolean"
  [p]
  (every? true? (take 50 (repeatedly #(fermat-test p)))))
  
(println (prime? 6))
(println (prime? 5))
</code></pre><p>We first define a modulo exponential function <code>modpow</code> to do modular exponentiation (we'll discuss this later), then the actual primality test <code>fermat-test</code>, and finally the <code>prime?</code> function, which runs <code>fermat-test</code> 50 times to be sure that our input is truly prime.</p><p>Now let's make a constructor function that creates a valid field element:</p><pre><code>(defn make-field-element 
  "Integer Integer -&gt; FieldElement"
  [e p]
  (if (and (&lt;= 0 e) (&lt; e p) (prime? p))
    (FieldElement. e p)
    (println "Invalid input")))

(println (make-field-element -1 19))
(println (make-field-element 3 18))
(println (make-field-element 12 19))
</code></pre><p>All we're doing here is making sure our element <code>e</code> is from <code>0</code> up to, but not including, <code>p</code> before creating the <code>FieldElement</code>, otherwise we notify our user that their input is invalid. Ideally, you'd want to raise errors with custom messages for each validation but we're going to keep it relatively simple in this demo.</p><h2 id="modulo-arithmetic">Modulo Arithmetic</h2><p>Modulo arithmetic is one of the tools to make finite field <strong>closed</strong> under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If you aren't familiar with the modulo operator, it just gives the remainder of a division:</p><p>$$27 \mod 7 = 6$$.</p><p>It can be useful to think of modulo as wrap-around mathematics or clock math. No matter how many hours you add to a time, the result will always be between 0h and 12h (inclusive). Similarly, the result of the modulo operation will always be between 0 and the divisor. Here are a couple exercises for you to try:</p><p><strong>a)</strong> What is 46 hours from 3 o clock?</p><p>$$(46 + 3) \mod 12$$</p><p><strong>b)</strong> What time was it 18 hours ago?</p><p>$$(9 - 18) \mod 12$$</p><p><strong>c)</strong> What time will it be 98 minutes from now?</p><p>$$(2 + 98) \mod 60$$</p><p>Modulo properties make it very useful for bringing very large numbers into a relatively small range. For example:</p><p>$$28634972342763428 \mod 18 = 8$$.</p><p>Modulo is used to define field arithmetic as most finite field operations use the modulo operator in some capacity. Now let's see how we use them to define new versions of addition and subtraction under a prime order.</p><h2 id="finite-field-addition-and-subtraction">Finite Field Addition and Subtraction</h2><p>To define finite field addition, we need to make sure that the result is still in the set—that it is <strong>closed</strong>. So we can use what we just learned, modulo arithmetic, to make addition closed:</p><p>$$a+_fb=(a+b) \mod p$$ where $$a, b \in F_p$$</p><p>We denote finite field operations like $$+_f$$ with $$_f$$ to avoid confusion with normal integer addition: $$+$$. And the symbol $$\in$$ just means "is an element of", so in this case the statement above is only valid when $$a$$ and $$b$$ are both in the field $$F$$ with a prime order of $$p$$.</p><p>By using modulo arithmetic, we guarantee that the result of this operation will always be in the field. So for $$F_19$$, we can define its addition operation as:</p><p>$$a+_fb=(a+b) \mod 19$$</p><p>And so, you can try these two examples:</p><p><strong>d)</strong> $$14+_f8=(14+8) \mod 19$$</p><p><strong>e)</strong> $$16+_f3=(16+3) \mod 19$$</p><p>If you did these exercises correctly, you could see that the results are both in the set, even though under normal addition, the results would be out of the bounds of the set. Now, with finite field addition, we can take any two numbers in the set, add them, and wrap around the end of the set to get the sum. We are creating our own addition operator so the results are do not submit easily to our intuitive sense of addition.</p><p>And if you remember the additive inverse, which we defined as $$a + (-a) = 0$$, because $$a \in F_p$$ implies that $$-_fa \in F_p$$, we can also define it as so:</p><p>$$-_fa = (-a) \mod p$$</p><p>And for $$F_{19}$$:</p><p>$$-_f9 = (-9) \mod 19 = 10$$</p><p>This means that:</p><p>$$9+_f10 = 0$$</p><p>Which turns out to be true.</p><p>So, similarly, we can define field subtraction, …</p></div></div>

<p>OWASP AppSec California is one of my favorite security conferences: the talks
are great, attendees are friendly, and it takes place right next to the beach in
Santa Monica. Not too shabby 😎</p>

<p>One problem I always have, though, is that there are some great talks on the
schedule that I end up missing.</p>

<p>So this year I decided to go back and watch <strong>all 44 talks</strong> from last
year’s con, AppSec Cali 2019, and <strong>write a detailed summary</strong> of their key points.</p>

<p>If I had realized how much time and effort this was going to be at the beginning
I probably wouldn’t have done it, but by the time I realized that this endeavor
would take hundreds of hours, I was already too deep into it to quit 😅</p>

<p><strong>Attending AppSec Cali 2020</strong><br>
If you’re attending AppSec Cali this year come say hi! I’m <a href="https://appseccalifornia2020.sched.com/event/XLvs/an-opinionated-guide-to-scaling-your-companys-security?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no">giving a talk</a> and would be happy to chat about all things security.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-this-post">What’s in this Post</h2>

<p>This post is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#stats">Stats</a>: Some high level stats and trends- which talk categories were most popular? Which companies gave the most talks?</li>
  <li><a href="#overview-of-talks">Overview of Talks</a>: A quick rundown of every talk in a few lines each, so you can quickly skim them and find the talks that are most directly relevant to you.</li>
  <li><em>Summaries</em>: detailed summaries of each talk, grouped by category.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the navigation bar on the left hand side, which will enable you to quickly
jump to any talk.</p>

<div><p><strong>Feedback Welcomed!</strong><br>
If you’re one of the speakers and I’ve left out something important, please let me know! I’m happy to update this. Also, feel free to let me know about any spelling or grammar errors or broken links.</p><p>
If you find DevSecOps / scaling really interesting, I’d love to chat about what
you do at your company / any tips and tricks you’ve found useful. Hit me up on
Twitter, LinkedIn, or email.</p></div>

<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>

<p>In total, AppSec Cali 2019 had <strong>44 talks</strong> that were a combined <strong>~31.5</strong> hours of video.</p>

<p>Here are the talks grouped by the category that I believed was most fitting:</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>
      Not too much of a surprise here: you’d expect defense (blue team) talks to be emphasized at an OWASP conference, as was web security.

    </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>We can also see that containers and Kubernetes were fairly popular topics
(3).</p>

<p>Some things I found surprising were how many talks there were on threat modeling
(4) and account security (4), and how there were only 3 primarily cloud
security-focused talks. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that there were 3 talks on securing
third-party code, with Slack discussing the steps they took to evaluate <a href="https://tldrsec.com/#slack-app-security-securing-your-workspaces-from-a-bot-uprising">Slack
bots</a> and
<a href="#securing-third-party-applications-at-scale">Salesforce</a> discussing the review
process on their AppExchange.</p>

</figure>

<p>Here we see Netflix crushing it: they had presence on a panel, gave one of the
keynotes, and collectively had 3 <em>other</em> talks. And of these 5 talks, 3 made my
top 10 list. Not too shabby 👍</p>

<p>In second place, we see Segment coming in strong!</p>

<p>Netflix, Segment, and Dropbox were on at least one panel, while the rest of the
companies listed had separate talks.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-talks">Overview of Talks</h2>

<p>For your ease of navigation, this section groups all of the talks by category, gives a high
description of what they’re about, and provides a link to jump right to their
summary.</p>

<p>Note: the talks in each category are listed in alphabetical order, not in my
order of preference.</p>

<h3 id="my-top-10-talks">My Top 10 Talks</h3>
<p>This section lists my top 10 favorite talks from AppSec Cali 2019 ❤️</p>

<p>It was
incredibly difficult narrowing it down to just 10, as there were so many good
talks. All of these talks were selected because they are information-dense with
detailed, actionable insights. I guarantee you’ll learn something useful from
them.</p>

    <h2>Learn how to focus your skills to become a master at front-end development</h2>
    
    
    <section>
        <figure>
            
            <img alt="Feature Image" src="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-06-29-how-to-master-the-front-end-development/featured_huab90dae8822c16d81bf6ceed19fd7ca3_155709_680x0_resize_q75_box.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>A few years back doing front-end work, especially on the web, was rather simple compared to the back-end where all the app logic used to reside. Nowadays, that changed. Front-end development has evolved thanks to powerful frameworks and libraries,  supported by the evolution of the browsers and their respective APIs. In a modern web application, the front-end plays a crucial role, where not only front-end developers are dealing with the presentation, but also with logic, and algorithms implementations.</p>
<p>With all these new challenges into the picture, how do we, as front-end developers, can stay up to date with the latest, and learn more in deep the languages and frameworks that we use to build amazing app experiences?</p>
<p>Let me walk you through 5  things you should be doing to master the front-end development</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="learn-a-bit-about-back-end">Learn a bit about back-end</h2>
<p>With the increased focus on user experience and usability, the importance of front-end has been increasing, and problems that traditionally were handled in the back-end are now being shifted to the front-end. It is also true that while front-end is reducing the complexity of the back-end in some areas, back-end is also evolving and specializing, introducing a new set of challenges for back-end developers.</p>
<p>As some of these problems are shifted to the front-end, having experience in how back-end deal with them, can be of great help when implementing solutions in our code. It is also true, that traditionally it was more important for the back-end to have more concepts from algorithms and data structures, while front-end was all about CSS+HTML, but now having that kind of knowledge is crucial for any front-end developer. So learn back-end, to be a better front-end developer.</p>
<p>But that’s not the only reason why learning back-end development is important, maybe even more important is to do it for the team. Teams can achieve greater collaboration when both sides sort of “speak the same language” and understand each other points of view. And you can even tackle some work from back-end to help out.</p>
<p>Front-end or Back-end, we are all developers, and we can help each other out as part of the same team.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="practice-practice-and-practice-some-more">Practice, practice and practice some more</h2>
<p>To master any skill you need practice. Period. And this is particularly true for development. It is indeed true that we can acquire knowledge through books or posts like this, but if you want to master the art of development, you will have to code a lot.</p>
<p>Is it all practice good? Maybe not, practice new things, do coding challenges, sign up to hacker rank and smash it! Work on open source projects, re-write all projects, see what you can do better, etc.</p>
<p>Practice also by reading other people’s code, check out that amazing open source project you like so much, see how they do things, play with their code, it can introduce you to new points of view, patterns, designs, etc.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="let-others-review-your-code">Let others review your code</h2>
<p>If you truly want to master front-end development (or development in general) you need to find people who will review your code. When we write code for ourselves, or when no one questions our code, sure, we can get better as we learn and practice more, but it will be a slow process. By having someone with more experience, or maybe just a different point of view review your code, you can learn from their experience as well.</p>
<p>But for this strategy to be effective, you have to trust whoever is doing the review, and you need to be able to admit when you are wrong. Sometimes it is hard as development can be very opinionated and there could be more than one solution to a problem, but if we want to learn from others, we need to accept when our solution wasn’t the best.
I’m not saying you should accept any change mentioned by your reviewer, but start a dialog with him/her, expose each other’s points, and then decide if you incorporate the feedback or not. Both sides, the reviewer and the reviewed can learn from this interaction.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="learn-about-design">Learn about design</h2>
<p>Design, user experience, and technology work together to deliver great products. Designers are amazing at building the best screens, and interactions, and animations, in their own tools. And it’s your work as a front-end developer to transform that into products. Having a good understanding of design can help you bring the two worlds together, and increase the collaboration between designers and developers.</p>
<p>The product will be as good as its design and how its implemented, thus the communication between designers and front-end developers is crucial so that the code can reproduce the designer’s vision for the app.</p>
<p>And if in your team you have no designers, maybe you should consider getting one, but if that’s out of the question, knowing basic design concepts can help you build much better apps for your users.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hang-out-with-awesome-people">Hang out with awesome people</h2>
<p>We are social creatures after all, and learning or practicing a new skill can be easier and more fun when you have somebody who’s awesome at something, and who can point you at the right things and in the right direction.</p>
<p>Do your networking, include other developers in your circle, but also designers, bloggers, architects, product owners, etc… There’s something you can learn from everybody.</p>
<p>And finally, you can be a model for others as well. For me, it was crucial when I started to always have someone who was there to support me. From people I hang out with, to strangers in amazing communities, to bloggers and YouTubers who produced content for people like me. It’s amazing how many people are willing to help. And for me… writing for this blog, and all I do is my way to continue building the community that made me the developer I’m today.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Mastering the front-end is not about knowing all the functions in a framework or language, nor about writing perfect code, but learning to listen to others, know how to look for solutions to the problems, and have a good amount of experience. Rely on your team, and other fellow developers to help you out.</p>
<p>Note to be made, I’m still mastering my front-end and back-end skills, it’s a never-ending game, but I enjoy it every day!</p>
<p>Is there any area I discussed that you like the most? Or perhaps you see another point I could have listed? Please let me know in the comments. I’d love to hear about it.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

      exploring maas 2.8
      <br>
      <small>
	<em>newest version of a product i work on</em><br>
      </small>
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <a href="http://stormrider.io/index.html">blog index</a><br>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Happy to report that <a href="https://discourse.maas.io/t/maas-2-8-released/1716">MAAS 2.8 dropped today</a>. It's a step up for <a href="https://maas.io/">Metal-as-a-Service (MAAS)</a>, since it allows MAAS to manage VM hosts created using <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/">LXD</a>. I like it because I prefer LXD to other container systems, but that's actually a personal choice.  Telling the truth is kind of a big deal at Canonical, which is part of the reason I work here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been working on MAAS since sometime in September last year, when I started getting interested in it.  Currently, I have a "kitchen-table datacenter" set up at home, which includes four laptops and a switch.  Here's a pic of part of my setup:
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src="http://stormrider.io/images/maas-ktdc.jpg">
    </center>
    <p>
      The front laptop is <code>wintermute</code>, my MAAS host, while the one behind is <code>neuromancer</code>, with a couple of the VMs loaded there running.  They're both 8GB RAM, 4 cores, so they can realiably run about 3-4 VMs each before they drown.  You can tell from the networking cables that, given my lack of space on this table, there are two other laptops to the right (<code>stormrider-yoga</code>) and left (<code>WA5149</code>, my SWL callsign -- the laptop that runs my shortwave listening station).  Yes, it's a mess of cables, but that's what you get when you're always shifting hardware around.
    </p>
    <h3>
      why i like this release
    </h3>
    <p>
      For me personally, the LXD-based VMs are nice because there's a much better API than the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/virtualization-libvirt">libvirt-based</a> KVMs we've been using.  We're still using KVMs, too, and for most people the choice will be moot (for right now, anyway). But I prefer the look and feel of LXD for most things, so I'm loading this update.
    </p>
    <p>
      Really, I should say "installing;" I don't ever get rid of old versions, so my only upgrades are done so that I can write about the process (I'm the doc guy, if you couldn't guess).  It's a pretty <a href="https://maas.io/docs/install-from-a-snap">straightforward installation</a> for an infrastructure product like this one.  For the last two releases, it's been installable by snap or debian package, and I prefer the snap.
    </p>
    <h3>loading up MAAS</h3>
    <p>
      My first mission is to find or create a new LXD container to run it in:
      </p><pre>stormrider@wintermute:~$ lxc list
      </pre>
      <img src="http://stormrider.io/images/lxc-list.jpg">
      <p>
	If you don't have lxc, you can <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/getting-started/">find it here</a>. But once you have it, it's just a matter of creating a new container, specifying the OS in the process:
      </p>
      <pre>stormrider@wintermute:~$ lxc launch ubuntu:18.04 maas-2-8-testcase
Creating maas-2-8-testcase
Starting maas-2-8-testcase
      </pre>
      <p>
	Then you'll find your new, running container ready to use:
      </p>
      <pre>stormrider@wintermute:~$ lxc list
      </pre>
      <img src="http://stormrider.io/images/testcase-running.jpg">
      <p>
	I need to enter the container to do the install, like this:
      </p>
      <pre>stormrider@wintermute:~$ lxc exec maas-2-8-testcase bash
root@maas-2-8-testcase:~# 
      </pre>
      Once I'm in, I can start the <a href="https://maas.io/docs/install-from-a-snap">install</a>:
    
    <img src="http://stormrider.io/images/maas-snap-install.jpg">
    <p>
      And once it's done, I can check my work like this:
    </p>
    <img src="http://stormrider.io/images/snap-list.jpg">
    <h3>
      configuring for production
    </h3>
    <p>
      This version of MAAS offers two configurations: one has a companion snap with a small database, for testing purposes; the other uses the PostgreSQL on localhost, so there's no scaling problems.  Since I have about 106 machines on four different computers scattered around the room, I'm going for production.  I won't repost every step of the procedure, since I've <a href="https://maas.io/docs/install-from-a-snap#heading--init-prod">already documented it</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one "gotcha" here (sort of) is when you have to enter:
      </p><pre>sudo maas init region+rack \
--database-uri \
"postgres://$MAAS_DBUSER:$MAAS_DBPASS@$HOSTNAME/$MAAS_DBNAME"
      </pre>
      because the $HOSTNAME really just needs to be "localhost" if you're installing everything on the same machine, like I am.  That part really isn't obvious.  Somebody ought to fix that.  Oh, wait, that's my job, sorry.
    
    <p>
      This step gives me a MAAS URL of:
      </p><pre>http://10.132.172.15:5240/MAAS
      </pre>
      which is the veth0 in my container.  I also sneaked in a bridge there (192.168.122.2/24) so I can communicate with VM hosts.  You'll forgive my sneaky workmanship, I'm sure.
    
    <p>
      Then I have to create a MAAS user, using <code>sudo maas createadmin</code>.  Actually, in the LXD container, I'm running as root, so the <code>sudo</code> is superfluous, but it's just good practice for me to keep it there all the time.  I'll call my MAAS user <code>admin</code>, with password <code>admin</code>, since that's what I put in the database call.  While I'm at it, I'm going to rename my LXD container to "maas-2-8" after wiping out the old one, because the "testcase" just makes it too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I'll run through the <a href="https://maas.io/docs/configuration-journey">configuration journey</a>, but again, not going to re-post what I've already documented elsewhere.  And I'll <a href="https://maas.io/docs/add-nodes#heading--add-a-node-manually">manually add a machine</a> for good measure.
    </p>
    <h3>
      firing it up
    </h3>
    <p>
      Okay, now I have a fresh MAAS 2.8 install on my laptop.  I'm running Ubuntu 20.04 on this laptop, but you can run MAAS on lots of different configurations.  Let me demonstrate a couple of simple steps, just to show that it works.  First, I'm going to <a href="https://maas.io/docs/commission-nodes">commission</a> my new machine, a process shown in the next few panels:
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      I can also <a href="https://maas.io/docs/deploy-nodes">deploy</a> the machine, once it's been commissioned (and aquired) -- which will lead me to have my own little running Ubuntu 18.04 console in a VM, like this:

    <p>
      It's not a giant datacenter yet, but this post is long enough.  Let me see what I can cook up for the next post.

As a result, the retina ages faster than other organs, with a 70% ATP reduction over life, causing a significant decline in photoreceptor function as they lack the energy to perform their normal role.</p><p>Researchers built on their previous findings in mice, bumblebees and fruit flies, which all found significant improvements in the function of the retina’s photoreceptors when their eyes were exposed to 670 nanometre (long wavelength) deep red light.</p><p>“Mitochondria have specific light absorbance characteristics influencing their performance: longer wavelengths spanning 650 to 1000nm are absorbed and improve mitochondrial performance to increase energy production,” said Professor Jeffery.</p><p>The retina’s photoreceptor population is formed of cones, which mediate colour vision and rods, which provide peripheral vision and adapt vision in low/dim light.</p><p>For the study, 24 people (12 male, 12 female), aged between 28 and 72, who had no ocular disease, were recruited. All participants’ eyes were tested for the sensitivity of their rods and cones at the start of the study. Rod sensitivity was measured in dark adapted eyes (with pupils dilated) by asking participants to detect dim light signals in the dark, and cone function was tested by subjects identifying coloured letters that had very low contrast and appeared increasingly blurred, a process called colour contrast.</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1080"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfa0f5629384ca65ba39a6989cc09429/beb4db66c671a561-60/s1280x1920/51debf645da77092b6af1dd5c931a63ffe6d3947.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="1080" width="1280" height="960"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;This is an example of hand held LED torch used in study.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-c00ea63a02869c0a6ec3"><div><p>To master the code interview for top companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple, you can select one of the best books on algorithms to be your companion — to teach you how to build, test, and optimize algorithms based on common algorithms. These skills are essential to passing a traditional whiteboard coding interview or simply to becoming a better programmer.</p><p>The best books on algorithms gives programmers a common language to talk and think about code. The best books on algorithms also teach us the most important algorithms to plug-and-play or understand algorithm design. With algorithms, we can measure what is effective or less-so. We can have metrics to optimize our code.</p><p>Why do code interviews test your knowledge of algorithms? It shows that you are a good programmer and a good thinker. As programmers, we are ultimately problem-solvers, and common algorithms give us the tools to design solutions to our coding problems.</p><p>As self-taught programmers or as programmers studying for a coding interview, books can help us reach our goals</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>What makes the best books on algorithms? Good algorithms books do several, but perhaps not all, of the following:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>They teach the most important algorithms.</p></li><li><p>They teach with precision and clarity.</p></li><li><p>They have good problems and questions for you to work on your own.</p></li><li><p>They allow you to not just think of algorithms as templates, but allow you to think of and design your own solution based on metrics such as clean code and code efficiency.</p></li><li><p>Friendly toward self-taught programmers. Not too heavy in mathematics. Does not have a high barrier to entry.</p></li><li><p>[Bonus] They have an engaging, conversational style and introduce novelty to keep you interested.</p></li></ul><p>If you know me and <a href="https://booksoncode.com/"><em>Books on Code</em></a>, I am a big advocate of bringing <em>joy</em> into the learning experience. With a heavy topic like algorithms, the texts themselves tend to be heavy and serious as well, easily clocking in at over 1000 pages of dense text. While texts that are dense and academic are in this list for their valuable content and breadth, I also include some titles to remind you that learning can also be fun.</p><h2>Best Books on Algorithms</h2><p>The following books are the best books on algorithms according to the criteria set out in the <em>Overview</em> section.</p><h3>Book 1: <em>Algorithms </em>by Robert Sedgewick</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592848121753_4728"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/032157351X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=032157351X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=ef103bc0f144bb443e11a6741f70ea04"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=032157351X&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=032157351X" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592849025353_14448"><div><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3eoKCs9" target="_blank"><em>Algorithms</em></a> is a book that delivers on exactly what you want from an <em>algorithms</em> book: clean, simple, straightforward explanations of the most important algorithms. With examples based in Java, the book is well-organized and thorough, reaching nearly 1000 pages.</p><p>For more information about what this book is about, look to the introduction of <em>Algorithms</em>:</p><blockquote><p>This book is intended to survey the most important computer algorithms to use today, and to teach fundamental techniques to the growing number of people in need of knowing them. […] Before developing our fundamental approach to studying algorithms, we develop data types for stacks, queues, and other low-level abstractions that we use throughout the book. Then we survey fundamental algorithms for sorting, searching, graphs, and strings. The last chapter is an overview placing the rest of the material in the book inn a larger context.</p></blockquote><p>I like this. Why? It puts you in the weeds <em>first</em> and saves the theory for later. This is how people learn best. Once we know how to use something, we become hungry for the ‘why,’ but if we get the ‘why’ first, it hardly sticks.</p><p>The book is divided into six of the following chapters:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Chapter 1 </strong>covers fundamentals such as primitive data types, loops, arrays, objects, APIs, linked lists, Tilde notation, and memory usage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 2</strong> covers sorting algorithms such as mergesort and quicksort.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 3</strong> covers searching algorithms and data types such as binary search and hash tables.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 4</strong> covers graph algorithms such as shortest-path algorithms and depth-first search.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 5</strong> covers algorithms related to streams such as string sort, tries, substring search, data compression, and regular expressions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter 6</strong> covers topics around context-reliant algorithms such as B-trees, reductions, suffix arrays, and event-driven simulation.</p></li></ul><p>As you may gather from the chapter outline, the book covers “classic methods that have been taught since the 1960s and new methods that have been invented in recent years.” The goal is to reach the widest audience possible with the most important algorithms. To reach that goal, the information is well organized and explained.</p><p>If you are a self-taught programmer, I recommend this book if you are serious about supplementing a traditional computer science course curriculum.</p><h3>Book 2: <em>Introduction to Algorithms </em>(The MIT Press)</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592848121753_7890"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0262033844&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=56f51123fd5297f06c27992df65f4f67"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=0262033844&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0262033844" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592849485204_5238"><div><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2YoYdtW" target="_blank"><em>Introduction to Algorithms</em></a> is not light for an ‘introduction’. It begins with basics, like defining what ‘pseudocode’ is, but it gets deep. It is not just an algorithm cookbook; it teaches “techniques of algorithm design and analysis so that you can develop algorithms on your own.” This skill is valuable for writing great code — and of course, it’s great for the coding interview. </p><p>The book asks good questions and truly sets the intention to help you have a good and correct philosophy about algorithms. </p><p>The book is divided into only seven of the following chapters:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Chapter 1 covers foundational concepts such as the role of algorithms and some basic algorithms and thoughts of algorithm development like insertion sort, notations, the divide-and-conquer method and randomized algorithms.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 2 covers sorting and order statistics such a Quicksort.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 3 covers data structures such as hash tables and trees.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 4 covers advanced design and analysis techniques such as dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 5 covers advanced data structures such as B-trees, Fibonacci heaps, and disjoint sets.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 6 covers graph algorithms such as Dijkstra’s algorithm.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 7 covers “selected topics” such as multithreaded algorithms, matrix operations, and linear programming.</p></li></ul><p>As you can see from the book’s outline, an ‘introduction’ does not quite cover what this book offers. It goes into ‘advanced’ topics by chapter 4 and it <em>just keeps going</em>. As someone who feels comfortable and confident in the ‘data structures &amp; algorithms’ taught in the classroom, this book helped me see how I can vastly improve as a programmer. This book is recommended not just for beginners but for anyone who is serious about improving in this dimension of programming.</p><h3>Book 3: <em>The Algorithm Design Manual</em></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593459344972_11917"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1848000693/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1848000693&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=dc0c8be3237901ef61cd98e19b06d37d"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=1848000693&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1848000693" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593459344972_13997"><div><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2BRBBJu" target="_blank"><em>The Algorithms Design Manual</em></a><em> </em>is branded as a reader-friendly guide, which is great for self-taught programmers. The book is designed to take the mystery out of designing algorithms so that you can analyze their efficiency.</p><p>This book is about algorithm <em>design</em>, as the title says. For example, the introduction of the book states that there are three desirable properties for a good algorithm: <em>correct</em>, <em>efficient</em>, and <em>easy to implement</em>. Memorize this for a programming interview right now.</p><p>A book that focuses on design specifically is extremely valuable for a coding interview, since you can’t just memorize important algorithms, but you need to think and reason around them.</p><p>This book is great for its conversational writing style. Other books that focus on algorithms design use mathematical formulas to explain this concept. This book is friendly to self-taught programmers.</p><p>What content is in this book? Quite a lot. The book is around 700 pages and 19 chapters. The first part of the book, titled “Practical Algorithm Design, covers the following:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Introduction to algorithm design, which covers how to reason about correctness and modeling the problem.</p></li><li><p>Algorithm analysis</p></li><li><p>Data structures</p></li><li><p>Sorting and searching</p></li><li><p>Graph traversal</p></li><li><p>Weighted graph algorithms</p></li><li><p>Combinatorial search and Heuristic methods</p></li><li><p>Dynamic programming</p></li><li><p>Intractable problems and approximation algorithms</p></li></ul><p>The rest of the book focuses on a series of problems, grouped into types such as linear equations and combinatorial problems such as sorting and searching.</p><p>This book is practical, with lots of problems. Even though the book is more reader friendly than other algorithm design books, the text is still heavy. Be prepared to work.</p><h3>Book 4: <em>Grokking Algorithms</em></h3></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592848121753_8864"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617292230/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1617292230&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booksoncode-20&amp;linkId=d398c85d5dc304028b0657b35d5730da"><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=1617292230&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=booksoncode-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=booksoncode-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1617292230" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592849025353_15491"><div><p>With charming graphics, <a href="https://amzn.to/2YWMxgZ" target="_blank"><em>Grokking Algorithms</em></a> illustrates common algorithms and data structures that we might learn in a data structures &amp; algorithms class.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>Tapping and swiping are a very intuitive means for interaction with electronic devices, and as such, have become a very popular mechanism for capturing user input in recent years. Extending touch sensing beyond the confines of a touchscreen means additional instrumentation is required. Whether electrical, optical, or acoustic sensing is employed, it calls for additional setup effort and cost.</p><p><span>A group based at The University of Auckland, New Zealand have developed a method they call </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3397309" rel="nofollow">ActualTouch</a><span> that enables touch gestures to be collected from a large number of unmodified, everyday surfaces. The device itself is a tiny inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor attached to a fingertip. Specifically, they redesigned a SparkFun MPU9250 IMU breakout board to achieve a smaller (7mm x 9mm) form factor.</span></p><p>The basic theory of operation resulted from the observation that a finger held in the air exhibits microvibrations, and these microvibrations stop when the finger rests on a surface. Similarly, when a finger is moving through the air, it has a tendency to jitter around a bit. When moving across a surface, the finger is more restricted and movement is noticeably smoother. The researchers initially eyeballed some IMU data to confirm that these phenomena were detectable and that the signals appeared to be distinct from one another.</p><p>With signals that appeared to be distinct, it seemed like a task that would be well suited to classification via machine learning. The authors collected data from the IMU sensor with an Arduino Due while performing various gestures. This data was used to train a customized variant of a LeNet convolutional neural network model.  Training took place on a dedicated workstation with two NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPUs.  Testing of the model yielded a very respectable true-positive and true-negative gesture detection rate of 98.6% and 98.5%, respectively.</p><p>Perhaps some of the more obvious applications for ActualTouch are in creating virtual touch surfaces for mixed reality and using any surface in the area to act as a mouse for your laptop. The authors also demonstrated some additional very interesting uses — in one case, they used the back of their smartphone to control a cursor with the hand they were holding it with. The other very interesting use demonstrated was an extension of a smartwatch input surface to the hand and arm around it.  Check out the video below to see ActualTouch in action.</p><figure><figcaption>Demonstration</figcaption></figure></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Throughout the duration of my career, I’ve noticed that you can divide engineers into two groups, <strong>primitive engineers</strong> and <strong>product engineers</strong>. The primitive engineers enjoy building primitives that are used within various systems. A primitive<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> is a building block<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> of software that can be used by other pieces of software to build a larger part of a system. Examples of these primitives could be anything from an internal database<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>, a rate limiting service, or even something such as a job queuing service. The other group, product engineers, then use these primitives while building out systems and products for their end-users. These engineers are the ones who work more closely with product managers and designers in order to build a product for users.</p>

<p>In my career, I’ve always leaned towards product engineering, because I enjoy being close to the user. When I worked on the Networking Products team at DigitalOcean and helped build the Cloud Firewalls and Virtual Private Cloud products, people often assume that I helped build the firewall and VPC daemons that live on the hypervisors. In reality, other engineers created the primitives that talked to the hypervisors and handled the networking rules. Then my team used these primitives in order to create a product for our users. Our systems had the responsibility of storing and updating the state of things such as firewall rules and making sure they were applied correctly on the hypervisor, while also ensuring that they were correctly being shown back to the user. It’s a joint collaboration between the primitive engineers and the product engineers, everybody has a part.</p>

<p>There is an intersection of product and primitive engineering (often in the cloud computing space), in which a primitive is so valuable internally that it is open-sourced and/or developed into a product for customers. This is how various software and products were released to the public, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/">Google Cloud Spanner</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a><sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>. What makes this intersection interesting is when a primitive is first created but then transforms into a full-fledged product offering, it indirectly causes the primitive engineer to assume a hybrid role as both a primitive and product engineer.</p>

<p>Expanding more on this thought of primitives as a product, a fair amount of SaaS<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> that is used within developer tooling can be thought of as a “primitive as a service”. When developing a product, you have the classic “build” vs. “buy” situation for a lot of functionality. Do you have the time to build your own transactional email service? Proably not. <a href="https://mailgun.com/">Mailgun</a>, <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a>, and <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> are primitives for sending transactional emails. Similarly, <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://braintree.com/">Braintree</a> are primitives for online payments and billing for products. Lastly, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/">Google Cloud Storage</a>, and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/">Azure Storage</a> are primitives for object storage. Additionally, a lot of these services have been battle-tested and are known to scale<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>, so it allows engineers to spend more time focusing on building out the actual system and product. Knowing these primitives exist and how to use them is invaluable to all engineers.</p>

<p>While a lot of the focus of this article has been back-end systems focused, this distinction also applies to the front-end as well. From a front-end engineering perspective, this distinction can also be seen, especially when thinking about <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/">design systems</a>. In various engineering organizations, there normally are entire teams dedicated to maintaining a design system for the user interfaces<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>. These front-end engineers responsible for building and maintaining the various components of a design system can be seen as primitive engineers. The front-end engineers who then use these components to build out the user interfaces for their products can be seen as product engineers. In some situations, an engineer may both build and maintain these design system components and build out products<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup>, thus becoming a hybrid, similar to what we discussed earlier.</p>

<p>As with a lot of things, product and primitive engineering are not mutually exclusive. A product engineer may build a new primitive for their system that does not yet exist, which can then be extracted and reused across an engineering organization. Or, like we discussed earlier, a primitive engineer may create something that evolves into a product. An engineer may be working on both products and primitives at the same time. In conclusion, while there are differences in what product and primitive engineers create, one is not smarter or better than the other. A healthy and successful engineering organization requires a mixture of both product and primitive engineers, who have a symbiotic relationship. What kind of engineer do you think you are: primitive or product?</p>

        <p><strong>You wouldn’t put together a band where all four musicians played the guitar. <em>Somebody</em> needs to drum and sing. Similarly, QA teams need specialists across a range of skill sets and experience. And that’s just one of the rock-and-roll lessons that creative teams can learn.</strong></p>
<p>Even if you’re a software developer or tester by trade, you might also play a mean guitar in your spare time. Certainly there is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265164952_A_History_of_Programming_and_Music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a long history of synergy between music-making and software</a>. What are the factors behind the synergies? How does one inform the other? And in particular: What can software teams learn from rock bands and other musical groups?</p>
<p>Veteran software pro Kevin Trowbridge played trumpet and guitar in a jazz band when he was in college. He sees connections among mathematics, software, and music. “Qualities shared by musicians and mathematicians are a love of abstraction, extreme attention to detail, and willingness to invest thousands of hours into learning very esoteric skills,” says Trowbridge, who worked on 15 different software teams in the San Francisco area before joining Qwoted as CTO.</p>
<p>Don Gregori, currently COO of First Factory, made similar observations during a company hackathon. “Late at night, I noticed a few developers taking a break, one playing the saxophone. Two others had brought guitars,” he says. “I was surprised at the number of co-workers who played instruments.”</p>
<p>“Music is mathematical with its time signatures, bar measures, scales, intervals and patterns,” Gregori adds. “Software is also mathematical with its reliance on fundamentals such as algorithms and computational science.”</p>
<p>Of course, parallels between musical and software creation hardly end there. Musicians and software pros work both collaboratively and independently. Musicians practice long hours on their own to perfect their craft; so do software developers and testers.</p>
<p>Plus, both musicians and software developers need to hold in their heads both the entire song and the individual notes that comprise it. That’s true of creating software – and the impact you have on the world. Sometimes, accomplishing that feat requires acknowledging contradictions.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When I walk out onstage I’ve got to feel like it’s the most important thing in the world. Also I’ve got to feel like, well, it’s only rock and roll. Somehow you’ve got to believe both these things.”<br>
<span>– Bruce Springsteen</span></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/software-qa-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/">Great teamwork matters</a>. One contributor might have an initial idea; then you work together to evolve it into something better. Developers, operations, and testers each bring knowledge to an endeavor – and see themselves as part of a single team.</p>
<p>“I call this the ‘Garcia effect,’” maintains Tom Mercaldo, president of Aquinas Consulting. “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj8Q3o2J4A4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Grateful Dead </a>had a unique style of developing music. One band member would say, ‘I am going to do this on the drums,’ and the next would say, ‘I am going to do this on the guitar,’ and then the next would say, ‘Why don’t you try this on the bass?’ And the music they were playing would evolve until it sounded nothing like where they started,” says Mercaldo.</p>
<p>Here are four lessons you can learn from musical groups that might help you manage and inspire a development team.</p>
<h3>1. Aim for more than one ‘axis of diversity’</h3>
<p>A band probably wouldn’t have just four musicians all playing guitars and singing at the same time, right? You wouldn’t put together a rock band of four flute players, four keyboardists, one drummer, and zero guitarists, either. Michael Fritzius, president of Arch DevOps, suggests that understanding of roles and skills is a lesson for managers of software teams.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to have nothing but Java programmers or nothing but people who know Microsoft.NET,” Fritzius elaborates. All developers do programming, and although many testers don’t code, some of them do.</p>
<p>Diversity in tech extends beyond race, ethnicity, or gender, Fritzius notes. You need to bring in different viewpoints. Counterbalance the eager recent college graduates with older folks who’ve been around the block a lot more times. Teams should also strive for a range of skill sets and experience across technologies, industry sectors, and development methodologies.</p>
<p>That even extends to personality types, Fritzius says, such as cheerleader, leader, and followers. “You want multiple ‘axes of diversity.’ That way, you’re enhancing your gene pool.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, diversity creates friction. That can be healthy – and even <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/2373792/four-non-obvious-things-pink-floyd-can-teach-your-team.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inspire team members to turn frustration into creativity</a>, as was the case for the members of Pink Floyd – as long as team members respect one another.</p>
<p>What if a project comes up requiring talent you lack? Hiring a consultant is a common approach. After all, bands bring in <a href="https://amzn.to/2YEhjLm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">session musicians</a> if a recording requires a phenomenal guitar lead, backup vocals, bongo drums, or a harmonica riff. Alternatively, you can forge partnerships with outside organizations. That’s sort of like what Aerosmith did when the band recruited hip-hop superstars Run-DMC to co-record a revamped version of <a href="about:blank">Walk This Way</a> – which became the first crossover rap/rock hit.</p>
<h3>2. Build a climate of respect</h3>
<p>Band members spend a considerable amount of time together; so do software teams. If rockers can’t figure out how to get along, you know what happens: They split up. <a href="https://www.nme.com/photos/30-mighty-bands-we-ve-lost-this-millennium-1432788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where did Oasis, The Verve</a>, and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLxpNiF0YKs%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> REM </a>go? How about Guns N Roses, The Clash, and Smashing Pumpkins? Even Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young quit after<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B_UYYPb-Gk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 50 years of playing together</a>.</p>
<p>To maintain harmony in the software workplace, team leaders should encourage respect for one and all, Gregori advises. <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-things-qa-testers-wish-programmers-understood/">Testers can sometimes get the proverbial short end of the stick</a> when it comes to respect, he acknowledges.</p>
<p>For example, says Gregori, development teams sometimes finish their rounds of scrums and sprints at the very last minute, suddenly delivering a project to testing. Developers need to keep in mind that testers have deadlines, too. As a result, Gregori makes sure that <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/in-search-of-the-full-stack-testing-team/">all developers spend some time working in QA</a>, so they can familiarize themselves with the role.</p>
<h3>3. Allow for individuality</h3>
<p>Collaboration does not suggest that team members are clones. Software organizations need to take risks for the company to move forward with innovation, Fritzius says.</p>
<p>That’s another parallel for math, music, and software development. “Within the mathematical framework, composers can be creative with the notes they use and with the instructions as to how those notes should be played; emphasizing a staccato rhythm is one example. Musicians will play the same notes differently, once again being able to offer their own interpretation,” Gregori illustrates.</p>
<p>Similarly, every programming language offers more than one way to express an intent. “This is the art of programming: the creativity to use science as a framework to build something,” Gregori points out. “And in parallel to how musicians collaborate to create a song, developers generally do not work in isolation. Rather, they work on a piece of the product, merging their code into a repository with submissions of other developers.</p>
<h3>4. Keep your cool</h3>
<p>Life in a rock band can get– well, rocky. Life in a software organization isn’t always smooth, although certainly, it usually isn’t nearly as wild and wooly.</p>
<p>“There are constant obstacles: paying for things, making tradeoffs, team members arriving and departing. If you let it become drama, it will become drama, so you have to be patient and mature and constantly deescalate. For a lighthearted example, think of the band in <em>This is Spinal Tap,</em>” Trowbridge says.</p>
<p>To find true success in either field, says Trowbridge, you need to keep perspective and to learn how to “switch off” occasionally for an escape.</p>
<p>Human beings <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/3-lessons-from-big-software-failures/">learn from both successes and failures</a>, a fact to which many a rock band can attest. After all, even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPon7i1-T1U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Beatles </a>had a tough time <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-beatles-succeeded-through-talent-ambition-and-a-lot-of-arrogance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">landing their first record contract</a> – and hey, it didn’t stop them.</p>
<blockquote><p>One element in playing music well – and creating quality software – is recognizing when <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/todays-testing-getting-past-the-hype-of-machine-learning/">a hyped technology helps or hinders</a> the team’s efforts. Our white paper helps you make sense of the real value of machine learning – and when its advantages are overblown.</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>A</span>s little as two centuries ago, the northern edge of the island of Borneo, home to Malaysiaâ€™s Sarawak state, was covered in a verdant canopy that stretched, uninterrupted, from shore to shore. It was a forest that had persisted for more than 100 million years, sheltering a dizzying abundance of plants, animals, and fungi that were found nowhere else on Earth. It survived the extinction of the dinosaurs and countless cycles of glaciation. It housed humans for 40,000 years while our species grew and grew around the world. 
  </p>

<p>Then, over the past few decades, the forests of Sarawak faced threats unlike any before. The canopy began to recoil, its edges assaulted by the expansion of hydroelectric power, logging, and, most impactful of all, palm oil plantations. To many people, these changes look like the necessary costs of progress. Development has consumed almost a third of the forest, but it has also lifted millions out of poverty. The first wave of palm oil plantations, from the 1970s to the 1990s, provided farmers with seven times the income of subsistence-food croppers in the same regions. Industry has brought paved roads, better schools, and modern information infrastructure. 
  </p>
<p>The oil palm (formally <em>Elaeis guineensis)</em> is a Shiva of the modern consumer economy, a great creator and a great destroyer. A startling amount of human happiness and wellbeing depends on our relationship with this one plant. Presently palm oil accounts for 60 percent of all cooking oil, more than 62 million tons in total. Itâ€™s found in half of supermarket goods, from instant noodles to ice cream, air fresheners to shampoos. You may not see it but you are eating it and washing your hair with it. Consumer-product manufacturers prefer palm oil because it blends well with other oils and is the ideal elixir to create various consistencies. Savvy food marketers love it because it contains low levels of artery-clogging trans fats. 
  </p>
<p>Youâ€™d have to look far and wide to find a major company that doesnâ€™t have palm oil on its hands. They include Walmart, Colgate-Palmolive, Kelloggâ€™s, Nestle, McDonalds, Ikea, Target, and Whole Foods. Palm oil is mixed into animal feed and <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/podcasts/base-pairs-episode-16-big-plans-for-a-tiny-plant/" target="_blank">biofuels</a>.
  </p>
<blockquote>The oil palm is a Shiva of the modern consumer economy, a great creator and a great destroyer.</blockquote>
<p>Malaysia accounts for 26 percent of the vast production of palm oil today, making it a great creator for the local economy as well. Almost half of oil palms in that country are grown by smallholders rather than large-scale agribusiness. The crop is so important that government insiders consider its development synonymous with the eradication of poverty in Malaysia. Between 1980 and 2010, palm oil cultivation doubled in Malaysia. Then, in just four years, it doubled again. 
  </p>
<p>Therein lies the seemingly intractable dilemma of humanityâ€™s intimate relationship with this tropical tree. Palm oil production is phenomenally important to local peoples and international economies. But it is also tremendously <a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-briefs/palm-oil-and-biodiversity">destructive to natural ecosystems</a> and to the global climate.</p>
<p>Tropical forests and peatlands are great storehouses of carbon dioxide, the main gas indicted in global warming. Malaysiaâ€™s forests are especially rich in carbon. They can hold up to 220 pounds of carbon per square mile. â€œThat's equivalent to the emissions from driving an average car from New York to San Francisco and back&nbsp;76 times,â€� the Union for Concerned Scientists tells us. Razing forests and peatlands unleashes carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in calamitous amounts. Deforestation for palm cultivation in Indonesia accounted for 2 to 9 percent of all tropical land use emissions from 2000 to 2010. Palm oil expansion is also robbing orangutans, tigers, rhinos, and elephants of their natural habitats. Global demand for palm oil is expected to increase from 76 million tons in 2019 to over 400 million tons in 2050.</p>

<p>Environmentalists are realists enough to know that&nbsp;palm oil is here to stay. Too much money and too many powerful government and community interests are tied up in its production. You donâ€™t overturn the world economy overnight. Plenty of nonprofits are pushing sustainable harvesting of palm oil and an international movement, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, is signing up companies to pledge to employ smart environmental practices. These grassroots efforts, though important, may amount to little more than a superficial solution, however.</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s most needed is way to reboot our relationship with the oil palm—to find a way to produce more oil on less land. Here is where plant scientists must step in. And they have. They have crafted a novel genetic technique to induce each palm oil tree to produce more fruit, containing more of the precious oil. Itâ€™s a way to keep the ice-cream makers happy while saving the rainforest, and it can be scaled up now.</p>
<p><span>R</span>ob Martienssen, a plant biologist at <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/" target="_blank">Cold Spring Harbor Lab</a>, has been one&nbsp;of the worldâ€™s key researchers into the puzzles of palm oil production: why scientific methods have gone wrong in the past, and how to right those wrongs today. Launching a project to grow more palm oil on less land was the easy part, he knew. Scientists locked in on that goal some decades ago and set out to clone a single â€œeliteâ€� palm, one that produced a bounty of oil, into 50,000 palms just like it. They even succeeded, up to a point. â€œThey thought this was going to solve all problems,â€� Martienssen says, but cloning the elite palm in the lab turned out to offend the plantâ€™s natural growth processes. Once planted, the identical trees were â€œmantledâ€�: Instead of yielding the promised bounty, the plants produced gnarled fruit that gave no oil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took an international collaboration between <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/rob-martienssen/#news" target="_blank">Martienssenâ€™s group</a> at Cold Spring Harbor Lab and their colleagues at the Malaysian Palm Oil Board nearly 20 years to unravel the mystery of the mantled fruit. They started by assembling and analyzing the whole genome sequence of the <em>Elaeis guineensis </em>oil palm. That enormous effort only made the problem more puzzling, however, because they found no genetic differences between normal and mantled clones.</p>
<p>Rather than give up, the researchers dove even deeper, beyond the DNA of the oil palm and into the layer of biology that regulates how DNA is read and translated: the epigenome. To their astonishment, <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/what-s-behind-million-dollar-crop-failures-in-oil-palm-would-you-believe-bad-karma/" target="_blank">they found</a> that the huge difference in the mantled clones was the result of a single, tiny epigenetic change. Palms that produce mangled fruit have an altered molecular switch that interferes with expression levels of genes relevant to healthy fruit production. Previously that miscreant switch had been identified in rice plants and was named â€œkarma.â€� The palm clones literally suffered from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4857894/" target="_blank">bad karma</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/cshl_e0b979cd9ee928ce965e9001019fee92.png" alt="palm_oil_sec_2_final_resized850_500"><figcaption><span>Getting rid of palm oil would come with its own drawbacks, so researchers are focusing on making it more benign. </span><br><span>Credit:  International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>â€œIn terms of individual palms, if you have bad karma, then it's going to literally get no oil,â€� Martienssen says. With the mechanism behind mantling unmasked, a third partner—Orion Genomics, a private startup founded by Martienssen—was able to develop a simple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9Dj-MKgBkc" target="_blank">DNA test</a> that predicts whether a designer seedling will bear robust or withered fruit. Then only the genuine, high-yield clones will make their way into the field.</p>
<p>That epigenetic test could be making a difference in the oil-palm plantations very soon. â€œIt's currently being commercialized jointly by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board and Orion Genomics,â€� Martienssen says. He projects that reliable clonal stocks could increase yields by 30 to 50 percent, drastically reducing the pressure for illegal forest clearing. And thatâ€™s just the start. Other scientists are working on dwarf varieties of the oil palm that are easier to harvest, that come to maturity faster, and that stay in production for longer. The epigenetic test can be applied to <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/nobelist-sir-richard-roberts-talks-gmos-at-cshl/" target="_blank">genetically modified</a> palm varieties for a synergistic effect, but—important for many consumers and environmentalists—it provides major benefits on the non-GMO clones as well.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, the government is finally acting to protect whatâ€™s left of Sarawakâ€™s ancient forest canopy. New policies limit the expansion of palm plantations to 6.5 million hectares, which leaves just 1 million more hectares of land for cultivation. These moves create strong incentives to enact a better, smarter relationship between humans and the plants they rely on. â€œFrom a world production point of view, palm oil is not going away,â€� Martienssen says. â€œReducing its footprint is the best thing we can do to help the rainforest.â€�

Mountaineering, at that level, entails the following things:</p><ul><li>Walking long distances in snow</li><li>Sleeping in a sleeping bag</li><li>Eating low amounts of food</li><li>Having difficulty breathing</li><li>Suffering frostbite</li></ul><p>Does this sound like fun?</p><p>Of course it doesn’t.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-0e74a9a2acebd70c05fe"><div><p>For the three years starting in April of 2017, I ran much of <a href="http://theprepared.org/newsletter" target="_blank">The Prepared’s</a> (and ultimately my family’s) income through Patreon. I started doing so as an experiment - one that by any measure has been a success. But while Patreon was instrumental in that process, I recommend that creators <strong>not</strong> structure their incomes and careers around Patreon. Here’s why.</p><p>Like many creators, I chose Patreon’s “pay by the creation” (rather than “pay by the month) mode. This directly incentivizes creators to continue doing the actual work, and keeps them accountable to the commitments they make. </p><p>But what Patreon doesn’t tell you is that fans can optionally set a monthly cap on their spending, and that cap can be arbitrarily low - even <strong>less than your per-creation commitment level.</strong> In other words, a reader of my weekly newsletter could pledge $5 per newsletter, but then set a $2 monthly cap. The worst part about this is that there’s literally nowhere in the Patreon backend that I can see this cap. I spoke to Patreon’s product team about this in late 2018, and they told me that the best thing I could do is to look at my creation-by-creation analytics at the end of the month and see which of my patrons paid for which creations; if a person doesn’t show up at the end of the month, then they must have set a cap.</p><p>This is a totally unscalable solution, and it makes the process of issuing patron rewards excruciatingly hard to manage. Creators need the ability to quickly and easily determine <strong>who</strong> is paying them for <strong>what</strong>; Patreon makes this impractically hard.</p><p>Further:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593267194369_49688"><div><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Patreon provides email alerts for when a new patron makes a pledge, but has <strong>no email or push notifications for when patrons delete pledges.</strong> </p></li><li><p>Patreon has no creator-side notification system for declined charges or charges that are flagged for fraud. Worse yet, their patron-side notification system appears to be totally ineffective; many long time patrons (and personal friends of mine) were genuinely shocked to hear, many months later, that their monthly charges had been declined - leading to their pledges being automatically canceled by Patreon. Even worse, Patreon’s “Declines” page, which shows the total declined amount on a month by month basis, has no way of showing which patrons’ pledges were declined - you instead need to go into the “Relationship Manager” and filter by “Declined” to see whose charges have gone through, and when.</p></li><li><p>If you, as a creator, go through all of the effort to find charges that<em> </em>have been declined or marked as fraud, it can then be really difficult to recoup that revenue. This is mostly a result of the fact that most Patreon creators charge a small amount of money (a couple dollars) per month. In theory you could email or message the patron when their charge doesn’t go through, but in practice it feels a bit weird to be hounding someone over (say) $4. If the pledge was billed on an annual basis, though, it might be a big enough sum to warrant the effort. </p></li><li><p>Patreon uses accounting terms with little regard for their generally accepted meaning. See the screenshot above, which is titled “Earnings Projections” but then actually lists <em>gross revenue.</em> In accounting, <em>earnings</em> is the same as <em>profit - </em>it’s what a company has left <strong>after every expense is paid, </strong>whereas <em>gross revenue</em> is the total amount that a company takes in and doesn’t take into account expenses at all. In other words, Patreon is suggesting that the numbers here are what will be deposited into my bank account - but once Patreon takes their platform fees, it’ll actually be significantly less. This kind of sloppy terminology is all over Patreon’s creator backend, and no matter how you slice it is either the result of gross incompetence or a deliberate desire to deceive creators.</p></li></ul><p>Between credit card processing fees (2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction) and Patreon’s cut (between 5% and a whopping 12%), your earnings will be <em>significantly</em> less than your top line pledged amount. In practice, I saw total fees of between 8-12%. (Note: I signed up for Patreon before they shifted to tiered pricing, and now have a “Founder” Pro plan at a 5% platform fee rate. If you signed up for a Pro or Premium account today, you’d pay Patreon 3% or 7% more than I do, respectively.)</p><p>If Patreon were actively bringing customers to me - if normal people were just out there browsing Patreon for awesome things to support - then that might make sense. <strong>But the reality is that success on Patreon is inextricably tied to having your own platform and community.</strong> All Patreon does is manage recurring payment processing - a commodity service that many companies do for a drastically lower fee structure. Sure, ostensibly you can also be having conversations with patrons, generating some kind of community there, etc - but every step you take to encourage users to interact with you on Patreon, the more you undermine your own platform. In other words, Patreon engages in rent seeking - but they ultimately do it on <strong>your</strong> platform, and don’t bring a built-in audience with which to raise you higher.</p><p>When I transitioned off of Patreon, I moved to a combination of Quickbooks Online ($645/year; note that <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free" target="_blank">Intuit is a terrible company</a>) and Squarespace’s ($480/year) recurring products feature. The result is that my processing fees dropped dramatically. At my peak Patreon earnings, I was spending almost $300/month ($3600/year) on Patreon’s platform fees. My current revenue is roughly 3x what it was then, but I’m paying 68% less than I used to be.<strong> My current payments, web hosting, and accounting software outlay is $1,125 a year; if I had remained on Patreon my annual fees would be about $10,000.</strong></p><p>Okay, you’re saying - so Patreon isn’t the perfect all-in-one platform that will allow me to bill, chat with, and build my audience. But maybe it’s a piece of a larger puzzle?</p><p>It’s a great idea, but unfortunately Patreon does a terrible job integrating with the other services that I use to run my business.</p><p>The first thing I’d want from Patreon is an easy way to automatically share my content (which most creators distribute elsewhere - for me, it’s Mailchimp) to Patreon. But while Patreon does have a public API, it’s poorly developed (there is no sandbox/testing area, and the most recent updates to <a href="https://github.com/Patreon/patreon-python" target="_blank">their API libraries</a> are from January of 2019) and only allows browsing/looking up data on Patreon; you cannot post content to your Patreon account via the API. This lack of functionality also exists in Zapier’s implementation of the Patreon API: You can use Patreon as a trigger, but not as an action.</p><p>What this means is that creators are inherently tied to Patreon’s terrible, horrible, clicky clicky GUI. You are completely tied to the limitations that are built into Patreon’s web product, and don’t have the ability to build automations that’ll speed up your content and customer management.</p><p>Patreon also fails to integrate well with accounting software - something that flies in the face of their promise to give creators “the stability you need to build an independent creative&nbsp;career.” Their API (and Zapier’s implementation of it) only provides <em>pledge</em> activity, and is therefore inaccurate (caps, declines, and fraud aren’t factored in - it’s a guesstimate at what you might make in the future) in all of the ways described above.</p><p>I really can’t stress this enough: <strong>If your intention is to build a meaningful income, there are much better options out there than Patreon. </strong>What Patreon <em>does</em> offer is a quick way to see whether people on the internet will pay you a little money for something that you’re already doing for free. </p><p>This is a nontrivial thing, but it’s something that you should really think through before you start a Patreon page. If it’s a success, then it’ll likely make a lot of sense for you to transition <em>off</em> of Patreon at some point in the foreseeable future. That might be fine - especially if you’re really early on and success feels like a longshot - but The Prepared’s transition off of Patreon required a lot of management on my part and resulted in roughly 1/3 of my patrons dropping their pledges. </p><p>To be clear: I’m deeply appreciative of all of the people and companies who supported me through Patreon, and it really is true that those first couple of dollars made a big impact in the path of my career. But Patreon as a platform did remarkably little to support me along that journey, even after I became a moderately successful creator and took quite a bit of time to explain my frustrations to both their customer service &amp; user research teams.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>PyCaret is a new ML framework. And since it is FOSS and has some potentials you can find it in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nocomplexity.com/foss-ml/" target="_blank">FOSS-ML Guide</a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Many machine learning products claim make using machine learning simple and easy. Recently the new <a href="https://pycaret.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PyCaret </a>machine learning hit our radar.  PyCaret is a promising product.  Attractive enough to  play a bit with this product. And to figure out whether this product really simplifies machine learning. </p>



<p>You can find my observations in this<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nocomplexity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SimplifyML_PyCaret.pdf" target="_blank"> simple overview</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Know you not that a good man does nothing for appearance sake, but for the sake of having done right?</p><cite>Epictetus</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bill Shannon passed away a few days ago after a long, valiant battle with cancer. The reality is Bill had a very long standing, selfless and profound impact on the entire Java ecosystem if not IT at large. It is also reality that far too few people understand this truth. In this blog post, I am going to attempt to do my part in closing this gap and honor a very good man that will be missed greatly.</p>



<p>Bill started his storied career with DEC and UNIX. He was the 11th employee of Sun Microsystems, alongside luminaries like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill Joy</a>. When J2EE was being formed, Bill was recruited to help lead the effort and remained in that role through the technology’s transition to Java EE and now Jakarta EE under the Eclipse Foundation. Bill is listed as lead or co-lead on all of Java EE platform releases. He played an instrumental role in the historic transfer of the technology from the JCP to the Eclipse Foundation. Bill was also the principal developer for Java Mail, now Jakarta Mail.</p>



<p>The following excerpt from his farewell note to his colleagues represents his accomplishments well:</p>



<blockquote><p>I started at Sun (as employee #11) by bringing SunOS to life. Just as wild success was within reach, we stretched a little too far and signed a deal with AT&amp;T. That set us back almost 5 years, but at least I have the “black edition” of Solaris signed by Eric Schmidt – “I’m Sorry”. Next it was time to move on to learn about window systems, desktop applications, and industry consortiums in the form of CDE. CDE was moving much too slowly and in 1996 a new opportunity presented itself – Java. We tried a Java machine, a JavaOS, and a Java desktop environment – Hotjava Views. None of that really panned out until Java found its home as an application server environment, first named J2EE and then named Java EE. I was recruited as leader of this new effort, which has subsequently been given a new name and new leadership – Jakarta EE at the Eclipse Foundation.</p></blockquote>



<p>His contributions to Java, Java EE and Jakarta EE truly cannot be overstated. He left his mark on the technology set in a way few other people have. His interactions with me, while anecdotal, perhaps is a good reflection of who he really was, what he did and why he will be missed.</p>



<p>I first encountered Bill when I began contributing to Java EE 5 as an independent consultant, on my own time. Bill made sure I felt welcome, behind the scenes gave me background technical information that I needed and encouraged me to be outspoken. He valued my contributions and understood they came at the cost of significant personal sacrifices. I believe he also implicitly understood the challenges of being an immigrant, a person of color, someone with obvious Islamic heritage, at heart a non-conformist and a non-vendor in a forum and industry that lacked diversity and still does. Without that early support from Bill, I am not sure I would have continued on with Java EE. I still vividly remember what he once told me:</p>



<blockquote><p>Don’t underestimate your impact. I appreciate your passion. You can make a difference in a way I don’t think you understand. There will be resistance, but don’t give up. </p></blockquote>



<p>Bill was equally welcoming and supportive when I joined Oracle as Java EE evangelist. He made sure my ideas were voiced, heard and considered, even if we did not always agree. He was happy to empower me to fulfill my community facing role even at JavaOne while shunning the limelight himself. I now also know how many good fights he tirelessly fought behind the scenes so that the effort we both cared about kept moving forward.</p>



<p>Beyond Oracle, Bill was always quietly supportive of community efforts like the <a href="https://jakartaee-ambassadors.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Java EE Guardians and the Jakarta EE Ambassadors</a> after it. He remained supportive until the end of his days – taking the time to help draft the <a href="https://jakartaee-ambassadors.io/getting-involved/guide-for-helping-deliver-jakarta-ee-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guide to Helping Deliver Jakarta EE 9</a>.</p>

<p>Bill passed at home with his family and close friends. He is succeeded by his wife and two daughters. Rest in peace Bill. Bill and his family were private people. With the blessings of his family, I hope to hold a virtual tribute event to honor Bill together publicly as a community. If this materializes, I will keep folks posted.</p>

<p>I believe the best way to truly honor Bill is to carry forward his life’s work embodied in Jakarta EE. I hope you will take a moment to consider the long service of this good man on all our behalf and also consider being a part of the <a href="https://jakarta.ee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jakarta EE</a> journey.</p>

<p>To build and test new functionality for your customers you can create a POC (Proof Of Concept) or develop a MVP (Minimum Viable Product). But creating a MVP from scratch is often not simple, since quality aspects such as security and privacy can rise severe realisation challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no general accepted definition of what exactly a POC or MVP is. Definitions are a bit context dependent, depending on your specific project, product and organisation. But in general sense it is good to clearly separate a POC from a MVP. </p>



<p>In short:</p>



<ul><li>A MVP is a product that is usable for customers in production and is maintained. So a MVP is implemented in your business processes and IT landscape and can be used for real production usages.</li><li>A POC is a way to examine a solution or an aspect of a solution to gather information. E.g collect evidence if the idea is viable to create. Most of the time you perform a POC to minimize risks before creating a MVP. Developing a POC is the quickest way to validate or invalidate assumptions about a concept or idea.</li></ul>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">POC</th><th data-align="left">MVP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left">Examine viability of an idea or concept.</td><td data-align="left">Create a product that delivers value in the simplest way possible. It just needs to work.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Used to determine development and implementation time and cost.</td><td data-align="left">Used to learn how customers will use and respond to a new product.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Needs a clear focus and goal.</td><td data-align="left">Goal is clear. A working product in production.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">No need to be tested in a production environment.</td><td data-align="left">Involves more time than a POC since basic quality criteria (security/privacy/reliability etc) must be met.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Minimal investment</td><td data-align="left">Enables learning by collecting data when your MVP is implemented in production.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Gives better understanding of problem or solution</td><td data-align="left">Can be used to evolve towards an even more valuable product in future.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Can be real simple.</td><td data-align="left">Create a product that has value as simple as possible.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The outcome of a POC can be used to speed up creation of a MVP. But improving a software prototype until it is ready for production, so evolving a POC towards a MVP, is not recommended. But reusing the generating knowledge of a POC to create a MVP simplifies the creation of a MVP.</p>

Here’s what the permission requests access for:</p><blockquote><p>Change your settings that control websites’ access to features such as cookies, JavaScript, plugins, geolocation, microphone, camera etc.</p></blockquote><p>When the extension auto-updates with the newly required permissions, Chrome disables the extension and prompts the user to approve these new permissions.</p><p>Because of this, my extension lost 50,000 users over a few days.

Or not, in this case.</p><p>I ended up deciding to revert this permission change and make it optional—asking only when needed in the right context. This causes a bit more friction for my app, but the needed permissions are just too much.</p><p>Sadly, because of review times, I had to incur further loss of users until Google approved of the changes 12 hours later (not that bad, relatively). In any case, it gave me time to reflect on not making such changes so hastily in the future… 🙃</p><figure><img src="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/images/extension/webstore-pending.png" alt="Yes, that’s correct.

And while the effects were of my own doing, there’s more that bothers me about this situation.</p><p>The change I needed to make to the extension was to allow all popups to be opened on a website. However, the permissions I asked for had to include geolocation, microphone, and camera access among other things. Why do these permissions need to be so broad?</p><p>When a Chrome Web Store developer asks for permissions in their extension, they’re required to write a reason for each (this was added somewhat recently).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/images/extension/webstore-permission-justification.png" alt="Chrome Web Store permission justifications listed for each API requested."></figure><p>It’d be great if these could also be displayed to the user when asked to allow an extension. Developers could always stretch the truth here, but it might be better than the permission description alone.</p><p>I suspect this particular case might not be as necessary in the future as the web <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permissions API</a> further develops (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/permissions/issues/210">please add popups to the list!</a> 🙇‍♂️).</p><p>In addition to my extension being on the Chrome Web Store, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/metastream-remote/">it’s also available as a Firefox Addon.</a></p><p>In the Firefox Addon store, it’s listed as part of their Recommended Addons program. This is a huge differentiator from the Chrome Web Store. It comes with benefits for both developers and end users.</p><p><em><strong>Real humans</strong></em> review addon updates and provide technical feedback when something isn’t quite right. Seeing firsthand the effort that goes into these reviews gives me much greater trust in their other recommended addons.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/images/extension/firefox-addon-review.png" alt="An excerpt from a past review by the Firefox Addon team."><figcaption><p>An excerpt from a past review by the Firefox Addon team.</p></figcaption></figure><p>For the permission issue I ran into, the update I made was only needed for Chrome. Firefox allows me to open two popups without one being blocked. Had that not been the case though, I suspect their review team could have had helpful feedback for me.</p><p>Ultimately, the takeaway here is that if you need to ask for more permissions in an extension, maybe think more carefully on whether it’s really needed or if you can get by with an optional prompt—even if the friction added to the user experience is painful.</p><p><em><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23679472" target="_blank">Discuss on Hacker News</a><br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/hi3tgf/i_lost_50000_chrome_extension_users_after_adding/" target="_blank">Discuss on Reddit</a><br><a href="https://github.com/samuelmaddock/blog.samuelmaddock.com/commits/master/content/posts/losing-50000-chrome-extension-users.md" target="_blank">View changelog</a></em></p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/tags/browser-extension">browser extension</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/tags/chrome-web-store">chrome web store</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/tags/firefox-addon">firefox addon</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/tags/metastream">metastream</a></li></ul></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://cdn.founderslist.com/assets/od/odrllkK38r8m8IagrsZk9FB8NFiyoQD2.png" data-filename="image.png" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-size="2123681" data-caption=""><br></p><p>Each year, June marks a special time for LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly in the US and across parts of Europe, as early summer Gay Pride parades and celebrations have become part of the annual calendars of most major cities.</p><p>But looking back just 50 years to the first Pride Parade in New York, or “Christopher Street Liberation Day” as it was then known, should cause us to reflect not only on how far we’ve come, but possibly also on how limited this progress may be, particularly for certain groups within, and without, the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>I used to have this small tradition of bringing a few LGBTQ+ founders and entrepreneurs together this time each year, generally in San Francisco or New York. But given the new reality of 2020, I found myself like everyone else, stuck indoors and socially distanced. So instead for this year, I decided to speak with a few founders in the community, to learn about their experiences over the past few decades and how they view the progress and change we’ve achieved.</p><h3>The Shock Factor</h3><p>I recall one particular story from a friend of mine in NYC: as a black man, he says, he cannot recount how many times people look surprised when he tells them he went to Harvard Law School. “I don’t think they mean to be disrespectful, but that look and automatic reaction: ‘Harvard, really?!’ just gives it all away. And that’s because they can see I’m black. Imagine telling them I’m gay too.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s 2020, and like it or not, we’ve still got some deeply ingrained prejudice.</p><p>That said, being a gay founder or entrepreneur in 2020, particularly in major cities like San Francisco, LA, New York or London might have lost its shock factor. According to most of the founders I spoke with, that may generally be attributed to a few considerations: political progress (particularly since the US Supreme Court’s 2015 marriage equality decision and the 2020 ruling concerning employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity); cultural progress and depictions of gay characters in movies and mass media; and the emergence of LGBTQ+ role models in various spheres: Tim Cook, Sam Altman, Arlan Hamilton, Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, Ellen DeGeneres, Leo Varadkar or Pete Buttigieg, to name but a few.</p><p>However, as many also pointed out, there’s a certain “hetero-normalization” that still seems to be expected. Thus, being white, male and gay might be very easily accepted – for two possible reasons: the cultural shift, or the fact that hiding one’s sexual orientation is very doable: most gay, lesbian or bisexual individuals have probably hidden, or at least not disclosed, their sexual orientation on more than one occasion. But what about trans individuals, LGBTQ+ people of color, or straight and LGBTQ+ women?</p><p>A recent piece by McKinsey paints a rather disturbing picture of the current US workplace environment. Over 70% of straight women and LGTBQ+ employees reported facing microaggressions in the workplace. Straight and LGBTQ+ women also experienced sexual harassment or were subjected to inappropriate jokes and comments at much higher rates than straight and LGBTQ+ men.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.founderslist.com/assets/rQ/rQaEyUAb1X2OToQPICKsXkU4WBnGKhQT.png" data-width="1490" data-height="1074" data-size="130362" data-caption=""></p><p>Gender disparity clearly remains an issue. Add race into the mix, and the story gets even more complicated. Several studies have been published around unconscious biases in hiring for instance – seeing a foreign, ethnic or woman’s name on a resume triggers automatic (and usually unintentional) reactions. This same issue also carries over to founders and entrepreneurs, and their experiences with clients, investors, business networks and their early employees and teams.</p><p>Jason, a black LGBTQ+ founder and executive at Google, for example, said he can recall several occasions where people (consciously or unconsciously) flashed a look of surprise when he walked into college classes, and later investor meetings. In his words, “I could easily not talk about being gay; but being black is something people see immediately and often see first.”</p><p>Irma Mesa, a founder in Indianapolis, echoed similar sentiments: for her, being Latina, a woman and gay just makes it feel like she’s got three sets of prejudices to overcome. Finding like-minded individuals with whom she can share experiences, concerns and feel part of a community with similar goals and objectives is not that easy – partly due to the smaller network in Indianapolis, but also since most LGBTQ+ tech groups tend to be dominated by gay white or Asian men. In fact, Irma says groups like Lesbians Who Tech are opening up more opportunities for founders and entrepreneurs of different backgrounds, and with different experiences and helping to create a broader support system.</p><h3>Role Models&nbsp;</h3><p>As a gay founder myself, I never really considered my role within the team or my own company. In fact, for several years many of my colleagues were unaware of my sexual orientation – it just wasn’t something I felt I needed to discuss, so much so that some were surprised when I even mentioned it. Looking back now, I realize this was a missed opportunity to be a better and more authentic leader, and to allow others on my team the chance to feel more represented or welcome to speak out.</p><p>David, an Irish LGBTQ+ founder expressed how grateful he was for having been exposed to various LGBTQ+ role models (and groups) during his college years. Growing up in a small town outside Belfast, he did not often encounter LGBTQ+ people and culture growing up. But upon entering Cambridge, he was suddenly immersed in a culture that embraced LGBTQ+ diversity and allowed him to discover himself and flourish. That support is something he consciously brings to the table within his own startup.</p><p>On the other hand, Gordon, another LGBTQ+ founder, discovered he lacked the support and role models during college, making his coming out experience problematic. However, he’s now based in San Francisco and is first to admit that he feels privileged there, particularly since he fits a certain mold that the city and the investor and startup communities are now comfortable with.</p><p>Thus having role models, particularly ones we can connect with directly within our own networks, rather than simply see in the media, makes a huge difference. Those same role models may allow others to feel more comfortable at work or within their teams – rather than to feel isolated – and to express themselves more openly and freely.&nbsp;</p><p>Lorenzo Thione, one of the founders at StartOut, says this has always been a key goal for the organization – allowing LGBTQ+ individuals to connect, but to also stand out as role models for others and future generations of business leaders. StartOut has also been keen to engage members in diverse communities, whether through partnerships with other organizations or through events and programs focused around bringing under-represented groups together.</p><p>On the flip side, a number of individuals I spoke with mentioned the added responsibilities of being held up as a role model. Some half-seriously joked about being asked to vet products, statements or press-releases to ensure they were “inclusive”, especially in the current racially and politically charged environment in the USA.&nbsp; Others spoke about being held to higher standards, because they were (knowingly or unknowingly) representing generally under-represented groups. And while most of the founders and entrepreneurs I spoke with embraced these added responsibilities, they also admitted the added burden of potentially failing to fulfill these unwritten expectations.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Being Gay is Still Illegal</h3><p>One thing I was clearly reminded of while interviewing people for this article is that, despite the real need for further progress here in the US, in Europe, and around the world, there are nevertheless several places where even basic rights for LGBTQ+ individuals are still a pipe dream.</p><p>Eugene is a founder, originally from Kyrgyzstan, educated in Russia and now lives between San Francisco and London. He knows first-hand what it is like to live in a country where being gay might not be technically illegal, but could get you arrested, or worse.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m sure we’ve also all read news reports of the “anti-gay purges” in Chechnya, or the very recent story of Sarah Hegazi, a gay Egyptian who was arrested and tortured for waving a rainbow flag during a concert, and ended up committing suicide barely a few weeks ago.</p><blockquote> Today, in 2020, some 68 countries criminalize homosexuality, and almost a dozen carry the death penalty for same-sex activity.&nbsp; </blockquote> <h3>Our Responsibilities</h3><p>I will admit that when I started writing this piece, I was uncertain of where it would lead, particularly given the recent Black Lives Matters protests, and the current political climate in the US. However, speaking with these LGBTQ+ founders and business leaders, I realized there are a few conclusions to be drawn.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, while we cannot deny the progress that has been made over the past 50 years, not everyone has benefited equally from this progress. We therefore cannot become complacent and must remember that it took several communities to help us get here today. And unless we continue to support each other, not only will fail to progress any further, but we risk losing what we have gained.&nbsp; So whether it’s supporting women’s rights, Black, Asian, Native American, Latinx, Muslim groups, equality for all, Immigrant rights, and other under-represented minorites, we will not be able to move forward unless we do so together.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, as LGBTQ+ founders, and business leaders, we have an added responsibility, whether we like it or not. We can directly impact our teams, our companies, and ensure we are taking positive action to encourage diversity, make everyone in the team feel included, and proactively hire and support all groups within our organizations. We certainly aren’t going to change the world at once, but change starts from within. Investing in these goals is more than the right thing to do societally, it is good for business – there is a large body of research …</p></div></div>

                    <p>At Bearer, we are a polyglot engineering team. Both in spoken languages and programming languages. Our stack is made up of services written in Node.js, Ruby, Elixir, and a handful of others in addition to all the languages our agent library supports. Like most teams, we balance using the right tool for the job with using the right tool for the time. Recently, we reached a limitation in one of our services that led us to transition that service from Node.js to Rust. This post goes into some of the details that caused the need to change languages, as well as some of the decisions we made along the way.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-context"><strong>A bit of context</strong></h2><p>We are building a solution to help developers monitor their APIs. Every time a customer’s application calls an API, a log gets sent to us where we monitor and analyze it.</p><p>At the time of the issue, we were processing an average of 30k API calls per minute. That's a lot of API calls made across all our customers. We split the process into two key parts: Log ingestion and log processing.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg" alt="Original architecture with Node.js" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>We originally built the ingestion service in Node.js. It would receive the logs, communicate with an elixir service to check customer access rights, check rate limits using Redis, and then send the log to CloudWatch. There, it would trigger an event to tell our processing worker to take over.</p><p>We capture information about the API call, including the payloads (both the request and response) of every call sent from a user's application. These are currently limited to 1MB, but that is still a large amount of data to process. We send and process everything asynchronously and the goal is to make the information available to the end-user as fast as possible.</p><p>We hosted everything on AWS Fargate, a serverless management solution for Elastic Container Service (ECS), and set it to autoscale after 4000 req/min. Everything was great! Then, the invoice came 😱.</p><p>AWS invoices based on CloudWatch storage. The more you store, the more you pay.</p><p>Fortunately, we had a backup plan.</p><h2 id="kinesis-to-the-rescue"><strong>Kinesis to the rescue?</strong></h2><p>Instead of sending the logs to CloudWatch, we would use<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/"> Kinesis Firehose</a>. Kinesis Firehose is basically a Kafka equivalent provided by AWS. It allows us to deliver a data stream in a reliable way to several destinations. With very few updates to our log processing worker, we were able to ingest logs from both CloudWatch and Kinesis Firehose. With this change, daily costs would drop to about 0.6% of what they were before.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg" alt="Architecture after adding Kenesis" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>The updated service now passed the log data through Kinesis and into s3 which triggers the worker to take over with the processing task. We rolled the change out and everything was back to normal... or we thought. Soon after, we started to notice some anomalies on our monitoring dashboard.</p><p><strong>We were Garbage Collecting</strong>, a lot. Garbage collection (GC) is a way for some languages to automatically free up memory that is no longer in use. When that happens, the program pauses. This is known as a <em>GC pause</em>. The more writes you make to memory, the more garbage collection needs to happen and as a result, the pause time increases. For our service, these pauses were growing high enough that they caused the servers to restart and put stress on the CPU. When this happens, it can look like the server is down—because it temporarily is—and our customers started to see 5xx errors for roughly 6% of the logs our agent was trying to ingest.</p><p>Below we can see the pause time and pause frequency of the garbage collection:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg" alt="GC pause and frequency charts" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>In some instances, the pause time breached <strong>4 seconds</strong> (as shown on the left), with up to <strong>400 pauses per minute</strong> (as shown on the right) across our instances.</p><p>After some more research, we appeared to be another victim of a<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/329"> memory leak in the AWS Javascript SDK</a>. We tried increasing the resource allocations to extreme amounts, like autoscaling after 1000 req/min, but nothing worked.</p><h2 id="possible-solutions"><strong>Possible solutions</strong></h2><p>With our backup plan no longer an option, we moved on to new solutions. First, we looked at those with the easiest transition path.</p><h3 id="elixir"><strong>Elixir</strong></h3><p>As mentioned earlier, we are checking the customer access rights using an Elixir service. This service is private and only accessible from within our Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). We have never experienced any scalability issues with this service and most of the logic was already there. We could simply send the logs to Kinesis from within this service and skip over the Node.js service layer. We decided it was worth a try.</p><p>We developed the missing parts and tested it. It was better, but still not great. Our benchmarks showed that there were still high levels of Garbage Collecting, and we were still returning 5xx to our users when consuming the logs. At this point, the heavy load triggered a <a href="https://github.com/benoitc/hackney/issues/594">(now resolved) issue</a> with one of our elixir dependencies.</p><h3 id="go"><strong>Go</strong></h3><p>We considered Golang as well. It would have been a good candidate, but in the end, it is another Garbage Collected Language. While likely more efficient than our previous implementation, as we scale there is a high chance we'd run into similar problems. With these limitations in mind, we needed a better option.</p><h2 id="re-architecting-with-rust-at-the-core"><strong>Re-architecting with Rust at the core</strong></h2><p>In both our original implementation and our backup, the core issue remained the same: garbage collection. The solution was to move to a language with better memory management and no garbage collection. Enter Rust.</p><p>Rust isn't a garbage-collected language. Instead, it relies on a concept called <em>ownership</em>.</p><blockquote>Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector. <br>— <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">The Rust Book</a></blockquote><p>Ownership is the concept that often makes Rust difficult to learn and write, but also what makes it so well suited for situations like ours. Each value in Rust has a single owner variable and as a result a single point of allocation in memory. Once that variable goes out of scope the memory is immediately returned.</p><p>Since the code required to ingest the logs is quite small, we decided to give it a try. To test this we addressed the very thing that we had issues with—sending large amounts of data to Kinesis.</p><p>Our first benchmarks proved to be very successful.</p><p>From that point, we were pretty confident that Rust could be the answer and we decided to flesh out the prototype into a production-ready application.</p><p>Over the course of these experiments, rather than directly replacing the original Node.js service with Rust, we restructured much of the architecture surrounding log ingestion. The core of the new service is an <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a> proxy with the Rust application as a sidecar.</p><p>Now, when the Bearer Agent in a user's application sends log data to Bearer, it goes into the Envoy proxy. Envoy looks at the request and communicates with Redis to check things like rate limits, authorization details, and usage quotas. Next, the Rust application running alongside Envoy prepares the log data and passes it through Kinesis into an s3 bucket for storage. S3 then triggers our worker to fetch and process the data so Elastic Search can index it. At this point, our users can access the data in our dashboard.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg" alt="Diagram of new rust service" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>What we found was that with fewer—and smaller—servers, we are able to process even more data without any of the earlier issues.</p><p>If we look at the latency numbers for the Node.js service, we can see peaks with an average response time nearing 1700ms.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/before-latency.png" alt="Latency with original Node.js service" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/before-latency.png 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/before-latency.png 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/before-latency.png 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/before-latency.png 2400w"></figure><p>With the Rust service implementation, the latency dropped to below 90ms, even at its highest peak, keeping the average response time below 40ms.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/after-latency.png" alt="Latency after re-architecture" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/after-latency.png 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/after-latency.png 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/after-latency.png 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/after-latency.png 2400w"></figure><p>The original Node.js application used about 1.5GB of memory at any given time, while the CPUs ran at around 150% load. The new Rust service used about 100MB of memory and only 2.5% of CPU load.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>As with most startups, we move fast. Sometimes the best solution at the time isn't the best solution forever. This was the case with Node.js. It allowed us to move forward, but as we grew we also outgrew it. As we started to handle more and more requests, we needed to make our infrastructure evolve to address the new requirements. While this process started with a fix that merely replaced Node.js with Rust, it led to a rethinking of our log ingestion service as a whole.</p><p>We still use a variety of languages throughout our stack, including Node.js, but will now consider Rust for new services where it makes sense.<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>In recent years, dark mode has grown in popularity as more and more devices and browsers are adding support for it.</p> <p>Those reasons make it a great little feature that we can add on our websites to improve the experience of the users who prefer to use dark mode.</p> <p>Let’s see how we can support this feature in 3 steps!</p> <p>First, we will take advantage of another great CSS feature: <a href="https://diamantidis.github.io/tips/2020/06/17/css-variables">CSS variables</a></p> <p>On the <code>:root</code> level, we will define two variables; one with the color of the background and one with the color of the text.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>--background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>#FFF</span><span>;</span>
    <span>--text-color</span><span>:</span> <span>#000</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Then, we will define a <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media query for the dark color theme. In this media query, we will override the values of the variables that we defined in the previous step.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>@media</span> <span>(</span><span>prefers-color-scheme</span><span>:</span> <span>dark</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>--background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>#000</span><span>;</span>
        <span>--text-color</span><span>:</span> <span>#FFF</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Lastly, we will use those variables to assign their values to CSS properties. In our case, we will use the variable to set the background and the color of the body.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>body</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--background-color</span><span>);</span>
    <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--text-color</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now all you have to do is to find a color palette for the dark theme and apply it following those steps!</p> </div></div>]]>

<div itemprop="text"><p><em>According to Sophos cybersecurity researchers, a new scam targeted at WordPress bloggers is currently circling the web. Over the weekend, the researchers received a well-crafted scam message that looked more convincing than many other scams out there. </em></p>
<h2>DNS Scam Targeting WordPress Bloggers</h2>
<p><a href="https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wordpress-image-hth.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wordpress-image-hth-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160" srcset="https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wordpress-image-hth-300x160.jpg 300w, https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wordpress-image-hth.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-old-src="//howtohosting.guide/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wordpress-image-hth-300x160.jpg" data-srcset="https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wordpress-image-hth-300x160.jpg 300w, https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wordpress-image-hth.jpg 640w"></a>The message pretended to come from WordPress itself, claiming that DNS security features would soon be added for their domain.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s an excerpt from the fake email message that Sophos received:</p>
<blockquote><p>From: WordPress<br>
Subject: nakedsecurity.sophos.com DNS Update<br>
Weâ€™re upgrading your domain DNS for something even better, freely!<br>
We care about your privacy and the protection of your domains, so we will soon be upgrading them, from basic Domain Name System (DNS) to Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).</p></blockquote>
<p>And hereâ€™s an actual screenshot of the scam message’s contents:<br>
<a href="https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dns-email-scam-sophos-howtohosting.guide_.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dns-email-scam-sophos-howtohosting.guide_.png" alt="" width="610" height="820" srcset="https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dns-email-scam-sophos-howtohosting.guide_.png 610w, https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dns-email-scam-sophos-howtohosting.guide_-223x300.png 223w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" data-old-src="//howtohosting.guide/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dns-email-scam-sophos-howtohosting.guide_.png" data-srcset="https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dns-email-scam-sophos-howtohosting.guide_.png 610w, https://howtohosting.guide/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dns-email-scam-sophos-howtohosting.guide_-223x300.png 223w"></a><br>

<p>Most users today are aware that DNS stands from domain name system, the globally distributed databases that turns server names into network numbers. In fact, as pointed out by the security experts, DNSSEC which is mentioned in the message (see above) does exist. It is a protocol that adds authentication to DNS data transfers with the idea to prevent cybercriminals from filling the DNS database with fake entries that hijack web traffic.</p>

<hr>
<p>DNSSEC means domain name system security extensions, and it has been available for more than 20 years. However, since DNSSEC is usually a feature used by service providers to help sustain their own DNS databases, most bloggers and website owners most likely have never set it up by themselves. This means that receiving this message could most likely trick bloggers into believing its authentic, which could lead recipients into revealing sensitive information, which is what usually scammers are after.</p>
<blockquote><p>Any data you enter here goes straight to the crooks, and if you donâ€™t have two-factor authentication enabled on your account, the crooks may very well be able to log on to your website or blog right away and take it over completely, Sophos warns.</p></blockquote>
<h3>What can WordPress bloggers like you do to protect themselves?</h3>
<p>Here are a couple of simple but useful tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Donâ€™t reveal your login credentials via links you received in unexpected emails. Usually, most companies and services donâ€™t support this practice, and would find a more appropriate way to inform you about any changes that concern you.</li>
<li>Use two-factor authentication to increase your accountâ€™s security.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-7486848344071731398" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
One of my favorite<a href="#foot1" id="cite1">¹</a> concepts for multi-dimensional data visualization is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face">Chernoff Face</a>. The idea here is that for a dataset with many dependent variables, it is often difficult to immediately understand the influences one variable may have on another. However, humans are great at recognizing small differences in faces, so maybe we can leverage that!</p><h2>
Tired: traditional plotting</h2><p>
The example from Wikipedia plots the differences between a few judges on some rating dimensions:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I_lJGg7QnmM/Xvl1rXrnm-I/AAAAAAAA534/0wm9LMMmQ0kgtxdNq9exqELo-jgSsqCMACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1000px-Chernoff_faces_for_evaluations_of_US_judges.svg.png"><img data-original-height="750" data-original-width="1000" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I_lJGg7QnmM/Xvl1rXrnm-I/AAAAAAAA534/0wm9LMMmQ0kgtxdNq9exqELo-jgSsqCMACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/1000px-Chernoff_faces_for_evaluations_of_US_judges.svg.png" width="320"></a></p><p>
which already improves on the "traditional" way to present such data, which is something similar to a line chart:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vFSg9Y-NJYg/XvmB6rUCFmI/AAAAAAAA54g/pXmUUEPqWf4QXqrasbL_WxSjN3zWu1_TwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/x.png"><img data-original-height="353" data-original-width="583" height="193" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vFSg9Y-NJYg/XvmB6rUCFmI/AAAAAAAA54g/pXmUUEPqWf4QXqrasbL_WxSjN3zWu1_TwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/x.png" width="320"></a></p>
<p>
or a radar chart:</p><p><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dh3hoPt0f5A/XvmBsL-eM7I/AAAAAAAA54c/r0KXd9byh1wQ06Yp5Y3Ds-LV44p_DEfpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/x.png"><img data-original-height="356" data-original-width="591" height="192" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Dh3hoPt0f5A/XvmBsL-eM7I/AAAAAAAA54c/r0KXd9byh1wQ06Yp5Y3Ds-LV44p_DEfpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/x.png" width="320"></a></p>


<p>
Clearly<a href="#foot2" id="cite2">²</a> the Chernoff faces are the best way to present this data, but they leave some of the gamut unexplored.</p>

<h2>
Wired: using GANs to synthesize faces</h2>


<p>
The GAN technique is pretty easily summarized. You set up two neural networks, a generator, which tries to generate realistic images, and a discriminator, which tries to distinguish between the output of the generator and a real corpus of images. By training the networks together, adding more layers, fooling around with hyperparameters and overall "the scientific process", you manage to get results where the generator network is able to fool the discriminator (and humans) with high-quality images of faces that do not actually map to anybody in the real world. StyleGAN improves on some of the basic structure here by using a novel generator architecture that stacks a bunch of layers together and ends up with an intermediate latent space that has "nice" properties.</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JxAnoglX3VU/Xvl-BPsI1XI/AAAAAAAA54I/HTbKb0qKkhE88y4HzqyHwele2NAzZM0WgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/n9fgba8b0qr01.png"><img data-original-height="1461" data-original-width="1600" height="292" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JxAnoglX3VU/Xvl-BPsI1XI/AAAAAAAA54I/HTbKb0qKkhE88y4HzqyHwele2NAzZM0WgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/n9fgba8b0qr01.png" width="320"></a></p>
<p><i>Basically how it works.</i></p>
<br>
<div><p>
A trained StyleGAN (1 or 2; the architecture for the dimensions does not change between versions), at the end of the day, takes a 512 element vector in the latent space "Z", then sends it through some </p><strike>nonsense</strike><p> fully-connected layers to form a "dlatent"<a href="#foot3" id="cite3">³</a> vector of size 18x512. The 18 here indicates how many layers there are in the generator proper—the trained networks that NVIDIA provides produce 1024x1024 images; there are 2 layers for each of the dimensions from 2^2=4 to 2^10=1024.</p></div>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RLpfhFZBSuo/Xvl-Wzo0B2I/AAAAAAAA54Q/ztjxSsS_JJYSz9MZBXnXBYuGC2IkT9SAACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/x.png"><img data-original-height="767" data-original-width="267" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RLpfhFZBSuo/Xvl-Wzo0B2I/AAAAAAAA54Q/ztjxSsS_JJYSz9MZBXnXBYuGC2IkT9SAACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/x.png" width="111"></a></p>
<p><i>What part of STACK MORE LAYERS did you not get?</i></p>
<br>
<div>
<p><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a>The upshot is that the 18x512 space has nice linearity properties that will be useful to us when we want to generate photorealistic faces that only differ on one axis of importance. The authors of the NVIDIA paper call each of the 18 layers a "style", and the observation is that copying qualities from each style gives qualitatively different results.</p><p>

The styles that correspond to coarse resolutions bring high-level aspects like pose, hair style, face shape; the styles that correspond to fine resolutions bring low-level aspects like color scheme. But they only roughly correspond to these, so it's going to be somewhat annoying to play around with the latent space! What we need is some way to automatically classify these images for the properties we want to use in our Chernoff faces...</p></div>
<p>
<br>
<h3>
Putting it all together</h3>
</p>
<div><p>
What I did was take an <a href="https://github.com/rosasalberto/StyleGAN2-TensorFlow-2.x">unofficial re-implementation of StyleGAN2</a> and run it to generate 4096 random images (corresponding actually to random seeds 0 - 4095 in the original repository). The reason why we're using an unofficial implementation is that the unofficial implementation ports everything to TensorFlow 2, which also enabled me to run it with (a) less GPU RAM (I only have a GTX 1080 at home) and (b) on the CPU if needed for a future project where I serve these images dynamically.</p><p>

I was also too lazy to train a network to recognize any features, so I fed these images through <a href="https://www.kairos.com/pricing">Kairos</a>'s free trial, receiving API responses that roughly looked like <a href="https://pastebin.com/PXWDKkYf">this</a>. (There's no code for this part, you can just do it with cURL<a href="#foot4" id="cite4">⁴</a>).</p><p>

<a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=2308943333455824725&amp;useLegacyBlogger=true"></a>Then, somewhere in this <a href="https://github.com/patrickxia/StyleGAN2-TensorFlow-2.x/blob/master/play_around_with_directions.ipynb">gigantic unorganized notebook</a>&nbsp;that I need to clean up, I train some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#Linear_SVM">linear SVMs</a> to split our sample of the latent space; eventually I will clean this up and make it so it's a little more automated than the crazy experimentation I was doing. After I train the SVMs and receive the normal vector from their separating hyperplanes, I manually explore the latent space by considering only one style's worth of elements from each of the normal vectors, plotting the results, and seeing what changes about the photos (which could be different than the feature from the API response!). This could probably be automated; I should likely use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_entropy">conditional entropy</a> of the Kairos API responses given the SVM result to rank which styles are most important and then automatically return that instead of manually pruning styles.<br>
<span><br></span>
<span>I ended up with seven usable properties plus one I threw out before I got tired of doing this by hand.</span></p><ul>
<li>yaw</li>
<li>eye squint</li>
<li>age</li>
<li>smile</li>
<li>skin tone</li>
<li>gender</li>
<li>hair length</li>
<li>quality of photo</li>
</ul>
<div><p>
I decided not to use quality of photo (you can see the results in the notebook results) because I didn't want half the photos to just look terrible. The good news is that I made <a href="https://github.com/patrickxia/StyleGAN2-TensorFlow-2.x/blob/master/chernoff_faces.ipynb">a new notebook</a> for generating the actual faces, one that should actually work for you if you clone the repo.</p><p>

After generating a few images and using the `montage` command from ImageMagick, we get our preliminary results!</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BUwEV9KxEHU/XvmKsnDLQdI/AAAAAAAA54w/LRRwtnI9zl80FV5sIQMEQfcmGFcX8cYCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/out.png"><img data-original-height="426" data-original-width="512" height="331" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BUwEV9KxEHU/XvmKsnDLQdI/AAAAAAAA54w/LRRwtnI9zl80FV5sIQMEQfcmGFcX8cYCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/out.png" width="400"></a></p>

<br></div>
<p>
Now that's the future!</p>

B. <a href="#PartB">Gravitational-wave detectors</a></p>
<p>I’ve uploaded the movies to youtube because the original ones in HD were about 75GB, and I’ve also uploaded the slides (as pdf) to google drive. The structure of the course we offer here is the “alternative” one. The original order of the lectures was dictated in part by the availability of the guest lecturers. I’m following an order more adapted to the topics.</p>

            <p>If you were dropped on a deserted island (let’s call it Island 1) that is absolutely barren, aside from an unlimited buffet and an empty cabin with a huge stack of paper and some pens. After the novelty of the buffet wore off, how long would it take for you to get so bored that you start writing, drawing, folding the paper, or playing with the food and making different things? How long would it take for you to start creating and producing things?</p>
<p>Now imagine a clone of that island (let’s call this one Island 2) except along with the cabin, buffet, pen and paper, you have a magical rock. This magical rock is the gateway to an endless catalog of entertainment, media, books, shows, news, comics, articles, games.</p>
<p>Now how long would it take for you to start creating and producing things on Island 2, and how would you feel about it?</p>
<hr>
<p>My goal is to go on my computer this morning and write this blog post. Unfortunately I live on Island 2. I have to use some willpower to not check the news, or browse social media and see what the world is up to. The very nature of my computer, my smartphone, my tablet, my smart speaker, all these devices that can connect me to an endless catalog of entertainment, makes it so that a state of distraction saturates my life. The side effect of this life is that the anticipation of doing something ‘productive’ fills me with a sense of dreadful obligation.</p>
<p>If I lived on the barren Island 1, this task of writing a blog post would be the farthest thing from an obligation, it would be a massively welcome oasis in the desert of boredom that I would be stewing in. Focus, distraction, would not be concepts I would even have to think about because I would be jumping at the opportunity to do something other than stare at the wall. I would have been so full of boredom just waiting to be burnt to make something.</p>
<p>This example is extreme but it highlights the obvious ability for boredom to drive us to do something, to create, change or produce something. The uncomfortable state of doing absolutely nothing generates boredom, which fuels us with the drive to do something to get out of that state.</p>
<p>Boredom acts like a pressure that builds up within us. After a certain point, it becomes extremely uncomfortable to hold in, and we feel the need to release it. We all learn as kids or teenagers that entertainment is a black hole for boredom, it can eat up a seemingly endless amount of our boredom, so as we grow up, we use most of our leisure time (and sometimes more than just our leisure time) engaging in this systemic destruction of our boredom.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we may have gotten too good at it.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://realisticwanderlust.com/assets/images/boredom-fuel/boredom-graph.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Boredom as shown on Island 1, and evidenced by the universal anecdote of ‘I did it because I was bored’, can fuel productivity and creativity but it’s rarely remembered as a driving force to create. Other more fuels of productivity and creativity are vastly more popular: survival/necessity (an increasingly rare motivator for those of us fortunate to live in developed countries), willpower and inspiration. The latter mental resources are some of our favorite fuels when we try and ‘be more productive’ or ‘create’. But although they can be effective, we are all too familiar with the ill side effects of relying solely on willpower or inspiration to help us get things done: we procrastinate or we burn out.</p>
<p>However if boredom is the fuel for your productivity and creativity, it produces none of these nasty by products. If you’re writing out of boredom, the concept of procrastinating on the task is ridiculous. If you’re building something because you’re bored, the concept of burning out makes no sense.</p>
<p>But how do we direct boredom to drive us to the things we want to get done? Well we don’t have any playbooks yet, because we’ve vilified it too much to explore the possibilities on a mainstream scale. We’ve been taught that being bored is a waste of time: <em>Carpe Diem, YOLO, Live every day as if it were your last</em>. These mainstream mantras are the antithesis of the engine of boredom. We tell ourselves we don’t have time to be bored, there’s too much to do and we need to do all of it. So we drive ourselves to the edge of our limited capacity of willpower and run on what small fumes of inspiration we have sputtering from our brains. Often, we produce more frustration than results. We spend large chunks of time procrastinating, dreading the things we have to push ourselves to do, and eventually we’ll need to recover from the inevitable burn out of squeezing our willpower and inspirations dry.</p>
<p>Yet this resource called boredom, that we all know can motivate us to create and produce things, piles up for free in our brains. We can’t even get rid of it fast enough, it keeps coming back, replenishing naturally, no matter what we do. We invent new forms of entertainment, gadgets and activities to try and decimate it, but it defies every attempt to clear it for good and inevitably comes back, more plentiful than before. What a crazy, endlessly renewable resource. </p>
<p>What if we experimented and learned how to harness it to fuel the things we want to do, instead of disregarding it because of it’s rough edges.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>I’ve been practicing letting myself be bored for about 4 weeks now, just to see what happens. Instead of reaching for my screens as soon as I feel a little sprout of boredom poking out, I just do nothing, maybe stare out the window. Initially it was awkward and uncomfortable but after a while it became very refreshing. I find myself more focused, clear headed, and looking forward to work and writing because I’m so bored. Also my house is the cleanest and most organized it has ever been.</em></p>

              <p>I arrived in Shanghai via train on February 6th, 2019; I did not know that this would be the last stop on my trip. I came into this city with a different mindset. I didn’t care to explore or see the sights here, I wanted a place to call home for a while, so that I wouldn’t have to be constantly planning where I was going to sleep the follow week. I also wanted to see if I would enjoy living in a busy urban city like Shanghai. I’ve traveled many times to...</p>

		<p>Between roughly 1975 and 1995, access to computers accelerated much more quickly than access to computer networks. First in the United States, and then in other wealthy countries, computers became commonplace in the homes of the affluent, and nearly ubiquitous in institutions of higher education. But if users of those computers wanted to connect their machines together – to exchange email, download software, or find a community where they could discuss their favorite hobby, they had few options. Home users could connect to services like CompuServe. But, until the introduction of flat monthly fees in the late 1980s, they charged by the hour at rates relatively few could afford. Some university students and faculty could connect to a packet-switched computer network, but many more could not. By 1981, only about 280 computers had access to ARPANET. CSNET and BITNET would eventually connect hundreds more, but they only got started in the early 1980s. At that time the U.S. counted more than 3,000 institutions of higher education, virtually all of which would have had multiple computers, ranging from large mainframes to small workstations.</p>
<p>Both communities, home hobbyists and those academics who were excluded from the big networks, turned to the same technological solution to connect to one another. They hacked the plain-old telephone system, the Bell network, into a kind of telegraph, carrying digital messages instead of voices, and relaying messages from computer to computer across the country and the world.</p>
<p>These were among the earliest peer-to-peer computer networks. Unlike CompuServe and other such centralized systems, onto which home computers latched to drink down information like so many nursing calves, information spread through these networks like ripples on a pond, starting from anywhere and ending up everywhere. Yet they still became rife with disputes over politics and power. In the late 1990s, as the Internet erupted into popular view, many claimed that it would flatten social and economic relations. By enabling anyone to connect with anyone, the middle men and bureaucrats who had dominated our lives would find themselves cut out of the action. A new era of direct democracy and open markets would dawn, where everyone had an equal voice and equal access. Such prophets might have hesitated had they reflected on what happened on Usenet and Fidonet in the 1980s. Be its technical substructure ever so flat, every computer network is embedded within a community of human users. And human societies, no matter how one kneads and stretches, always seem to keep their lumps.</p>
<h2>Usenet</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1979, Tom Truscott was living the dream life for a young computer nerd. A grad student in computer science at Duke University with an interest in computer chess, he landed an internship at Bell Labs’ New Jersey headquarters, where he got to rub elbows with the creators of Unix, the latest craze to sweep the world of academic computing.</p>
<p>The origins of Unix, like those of the Internet itself, lay in the shadow of American telecommunications policy. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Labs decided in the late 1960s to build a leaner, much pared-down version of the massive MIT Multics system to which they had contributed as software developers. The new operating system quickly proved a hit within the labs, popular for its combination of low overhead (allowing it to run on even inexpensive machines) and high flexibility. However, AT&amp;T could do little to profit from their success. A 1956 agreement with the Justice Department required AT&amp;T to license non-telephone technologies to all comers at a reasonable rate, and to stay out of all business sectors other than supplying common carrier communications.</p>
<p>So AT&amp;T began to license Unix to universities for use in academic settings on very generous terms. These early licensees, who were granted access to the source code, began building and selling their own Unix variants, most notably the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix created at the the University of California’s flagship campus. The new operating system quickly swept academia. Unlike other popular operating systems, such as the DEC TENEX / TOPS-20, it could run on hardware from a variety of vendors, many of them offering very low-cost machines. And Berkeley distributed the software for only a nominal fee, in addition to the modest licensing fee from AT&amp;T.<sup id="fnref-13802-fee"><a href="#fn-13802-fee">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Truscott felt that he sat at the root of all things, therefore, when he got to spend the summer as Ken Thompson’s intern, playing a few morning rounds of volleyball before starting work at midday, sharing a pizza dinner with his idols, and working late into the night slinging code on Unix and the C programming language. He did not want to give up the connection to that world when his internship ended, and so as soon as he returned to Duke in the fall, he figured out how to connect the computer science department’s Unix-equipped PDP 11/70 back to the mothership in Murray Hill, using a program written by one of his erstwhile colleagues, Mike Lesk. It was called <em><span>uucp</span></em> – Unix to Unix copy – and it was one of a suite of “uu” programs new to the just-released Unix Version 7, which allowed one Unix system to connect to another over a modem. Specifically, <em>uucp</em> allowed one to copy files back and forth between the two connected computers, which allowed Truscott to exchange email with Thompson and Ritchie.</p>

<p>It was Truscott’s fellow grad student, Jim Ellis, who had installed the new Version 7 on the Duke computer, but even as the new upgrade gave with one hand, it took away with the other. The news program that was distributed by the Unix users’ group, USENIX, which would broadcast news items to all users of a given Unix computer system, no longer worked on the new operating ssytem. Truscott and Ellis decided they would replace it with their own 7-compatible news program, with more advanced features, and return their improved software back to the community for a little bit of prestige.</p>
<p><span>At this same time, Truscott was also using <em>uucp</em> to connect with a Unix machine at the University of North Carolina ten miles to the southwest in Chapel Hill, and talking to a grad student there named Steve Bellovin.<sup id="fnref-13802-bellovin"><a href="#fn-13802-bellovin">2</a></sup> Bellovin had also started building his own news program, which notably included the concept of topic-based <em>newsgroups</em>, to which one could subscribe, rather than only having a single broadcast channel for all news. Bellovin, Truscot and Ellis decided to combine their efforts and build a networked news system with newsgroups, that would use <em>uucp</em> to share news between sites. They intended to distributed provide Unix-related news for USENIX members, so they called their system Usenet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Duke would serve as the central clearinghouse at first, using its auto-dialer and <em>uucp</em> to connect to each other site on the network at regular intervals, in order to pick up it local news updates and deposit updates from its peers. Bellovin wrote the initial code, but it used shell scripts that operated very slowly, so Stephen Daniel, another Duke grad student, rewrote the program in C. Daniel’s version became know as A News. Ellis promoted the program at the January 1980 Usenix conference in Boulder, Colorado, and gave away all eighty copies of the software that he had brought with him. By the next Usenix conference that summer, the organizers had added A News to the general software package that they distributed to all attendees.</p>
<p>The creators described the system, cheekily, as a “poor man’s ARPANET.” Though one may not be accustomed to thinking of Duke as underprivileged, it did not have the clout in the world of computer science necessary at the time to get a connection to that premiere American computer network. But access to Usenet required no one’s permission, only a Unix system, a modem, and the ability to pay the phone bills for regular news transfers, requirements that virtually any institution of higher education could meet by the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Private companies also joined up with Usenet, and helped to facilitate the spread of the network. Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) agreed to act as an intermediary between Duke and UC Berkeley, footing the long-distance telephone bills for inter-coastal data transfer. This allowed Berkeley to become a second, west-coast hub for Usenet, connecting up UC San Francisco, UC San Diego, and others, including Sytek, an early LAN business. The connection to Berkeley, an ARPANET site, also enabled cross-talk between ARPANET and Usenet (after a second re-write by Mark Horton and Matt Glickman to create B News). ARPANET sites began picking up Usenet content and vice versa, though ARPA rules technically forbid interconnection with other networks. The network grew rapidly, from fifteen sites carrying ten posts a day in in 1980, to 600 sites and 120 posts in 1983, and 5000 sites and 1000 posts in 1987.<sup id="fnref-13802-sitesandposts"><a href="#fn-13802-sitesandposts">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Its creators had originally conceived Usenet as a way to connect the Unix user community and discuss Unix developments, and to that end they created two groups, <em>net.general</em> and <em>net.v7bugs</em> (the latter for discussing problems with the latest version of Unix). However they left the system entirely open for expansion. Anyone was free to create a new group under “net”, and users very quickly added non-technical topics such as <em>net.jokes</em>. Just as one was free to send whatever one chose, recipients could also ignore whatever groups they chose, e.g. a system could join Usenet and request data only for <em>net.v7bugs,</em> ignoring the rest of the content. Quite unlike the carefully planned ARPANET, Usenet self-organized, and grew in an anarchic way overseen by no central authority.</p>
<p>Yet out of this superficially democratic medium a hierarchical order quickly emerged, with a certain subset of highly-connected, high-traffic sites recognized as the “backbone” of the system. This process developed fairly naturally. Because each transfer of data from one …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<p>The <acronym>npm</acronym> ecosystem seems unwell. If you are concerned with security, reliability, or long-term maintenance, it is almost impossible to pick a suitable package to use — both because there are 1.3 million packages available, and even if you find one that is well documented and maintained, it might depend on hundreds of other packages, with dependency trees stretching ten or more levels deep — as one developer, it’s impossible to validate them all.</p>

<p>I spend some time measuring the extent of the problem.</p>

<p>I suggest that this is a social problem, more than a technical one, and propose a semi-social solution: a human-maintained subset of the total registry, based on shared criteria by which a “healthy” package can receive a seal of approval. One criterion would be to only depend on other approved packages.</p>

<h3 id="the-premise">The premise</h3>

<p>I don’t like the way I feel when I’m installing packages with npm. Selecting a package, installing it, discovering the 93 additional packages that were installed along with it, and hoping all of <em>them</em> are also suitable for my project… it feels out of control.</p>

<p>I feel unhappy because picking dependencies is hard, so I blame npm, and that way my problems are not my fault.</p>

<p>Is there some way for me to measure this badness, and thus more thoroughly escape the blame?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-a-bit-like-a-scientist-but-not-too-much">Thinking a bit like a scientist, but not too much</h3>

<p>Can we make meaningful empirical measurements of the health of the <acronym>npm</acronym> registry? I think so; but before I do, in order to maintain the slightest semblance of impartiality, I want to lay out what I <em>expect</em> a healthy package registry to look like. If it turns out that npm, taken as a whole, mostly looks the way I expect a healthy registry to look, I’ll have to put my tail between my legs and take ownership of my struggles. If it looks wildly different, I’ll still have hope for blaming the system.</p>

<h3 id="imagining-a-healthy-repository">Imagining a healthy repository</h3>

<p>In my ideal world there are, mostly, 4 types of packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Utilities:</strong></p>

    <p>A utility is a simple package, with no dependencies, that accomplishes a single small but onerous task. For example: lodash is a collection of utilities (and you can install each one separately). Controversially, left-pad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Libraries:</strong></p>

    <p>A library is one step up in abstraction. It may depend on a handful of utilities, and it accomplishes a whole set of related tasks. For example: urlib has just a few simple dependencies, and while it does many things, it respects a clear unifying principle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Frameworks:</strong></p>

    <p>A framework provides scaffolding for an entire project, and may depend on multiple libraries and utilities. You should only ever need zero or one of these in your project. Examples: React, angular, express.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Plugins:</strong></p>

    <p>A plugin enhances a framework with additional, special-use functionality. For a plugin, the framework should be a peer dependency, not a true dependency. It might also depend directly on a library, or a handful of utilities. Examples: an angular component or a jquery plugin.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, the world is messy! I don’t expect 100% of packages to fit into such simple categories, nor are any of these definitions strict and unyielding. But overall, I’d hope <em>many</em> or even <em>most</em> packages to <em>mostly</em> conform to a categorization <em>something</em> like that, with most packages being utilities and libraries, and the fewest packages being frameworks.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-that-mean-statistically">What would that mean statistically?</h3>

<p>In a world where packages fit mostly into that hierarchy, a registry of many packages would have these qualities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No dependency cycles</li>
  <li>Most packages would have dependency trees 0-4 levels deep, leaning towards lower numbers</li>
  <li>Even the deepest and broadest frameworks would depend on fewer than 250 packages, including dependencies of dependencies (3-4 steps deep, with 3-4 dependencies per package, &lt;= 4<sup>4</sup> max). Most packages would install well under 30 other packages. These numbers are extremely generous; smaller numbers would make me even happier.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-do-we-actually-see">What do we actually see?</h3>

<p>I downloaded the metadata for all 1.3 million packages in the npmjs.org repository and attempted to crunch some numbers. (For more technical details on how I did this, see the final section, titled “Appendix: Methods”)</p>

<p>I’m going to use “the number of other packages that depend on this one” as a poor-man’s proxy for how popular a package is. It’s not a <em>good</em> proxy, but neither is the other common choice: the number of downloads (see the section <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/analyzing-pypi-package-downloads/#background">“Background”</a>, from PyPI). The number of downloads would have been much more computationally expensive to acquire, so I used dependents.</p>

<h3 id="circular-dependencies">Circular dependencies</h3>

<p>Of those 1.3 million packages, 1,700 depend directly on themselves, either perfectly circularly, or a different version of the same package. I have no explanation for that.</p>

<p>2500 packages are part of a two-package dependency cycle.</p>

<p>Then ~500, ~125, and ~25 are part of 3-, 4-, and 5-package cycles, respectively. (These are not always simple circles; it may be three codependent packages in any loopy arrangement)</p>

<p>My immediate reaction was that those numbers seemed like good news; out of a million packages, only a tiny percentage of oddball packages have circular dependencies, and the rest are fine. Right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, what I discovered was that almost 150,000 packages — more than 1 in 10 — had at least one of these circular dependencies <em>somewhere</em> in their dependency graph. That means at least a few of those “oddballs” are actually major, highly-referenced packages. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>babel-core</code> depends on <code>babel-register</code>, which depends on <code>babel-core</code>.</li>
  <li><code>yeoman-generator</code> depends on <code>yeoman-environment</code> which depends on <code>yeoman-generator</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are not isolated instances; I plucked them as the most easily recognizable out of a list of dozens of highly-depended-upon packages with circular dependencies.</p>

<p>I need to be clear, here, that this is not <em>technically</em> a problem! <acronym>npm</acronym> can install these packages just fine. They can circularly-depend on one another; there’s no technical problem. They work. Obviously. If <code>babel-core</code> didn’t work, someone would have said something by now.</p>

<p>But I’m not particularly comfortable with it. I’m especially uncomfortable when the cycles involved are longer than two packages, which makes them seem less intentional. Maybe there’s a good reason; these folks are smart, and I always try to assume that odd choices were made for important reasons. And yet…</p>

<h3 id="what-about-devdependencies">What about <code>devDependencies</code>?</h3>

<p>Among the most-depended-upon packages are</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>@types/</code>[something]</li>
  <li>compilers like <code>typescript</code> and <code>babel</code></li>
  <li>build systems like <code>gulp</code> and <code>webpack</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m <strong>not</strong> measuring that using <code>devDependencies</code> — <code>typescript</code> appears in over 12,000 “dependency” lists.</p>

<p>So while I am less concerned with packages having large and deep <code>devDependency</code> trees (I <em>am</em> still concerned, but less so), it seems that a large proportion of packages aren’t making use of the distinctions between <code>dependencies</code> and <code>devDependencies</code> in the first place. That <em>is</em> concerning.</p>

<h3 id="dependency-tree-depths">Dependency tree depths</h3>

<p>I am defining the depth of a package’s dependency tree as the longest dependency-of-a-dependency-of-a-dependency chain I can find. Especially deep dependency trees are a problem because of how difficult they make it to audit all the packages that will get installed when including a single new package.</p>

<p>The <em>average</em> dependency tree depth in npmjs.org is just under 4. Which doesn’t sound too bad!</p>

<p>As often happens, though, the mean does not tell the whole story. Almost half of all packages have no dependencies at all — which is a good thing! — but all those zeros dramatically drop the average of the packages that <em>do</em> have dependencies.</p>

<p>If we charted of the number of packages with each dependency tree depth greater than zero, then based on the idealized registry I imagined above, here’s what I’d hope to see:</p>

<p><strong>Imagined:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth_ideal.svg" alt="Imaginary chart of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>And here’s what we actually get:</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth.svg" alt="Real chart of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>Remember that we were hoping for mostly 2, 3, and 4. Instead, there is still a long tail of packages with tree depths <em>above 20</em>. 20 is… much larger than I was expecting, and I was expecting to be disappointed.</p>

<p>But let’s re-use the “oddball” theory: perhaps all those packages with extremely deep dependency trees are rarely used, and not worth worrying about. Let’s check.</p>

<p>Here’s a scatterplot, where each package is placed based on its tree depth plotted and how many other packages reference it. On the right of the plot are the most-referenced (~popular) packages; on the top are the deepest dependency trees. Again, my hopes first:</p>

<p><strong>Imagined:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth_and_dependents_ideal.svg" alt="Imaginary scatterplot of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>Followed by reality:</p>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_tree_depth_and_dependents.svg" alt="Real scatterplot of package counts per tree depth"></p>

<p>There are heaps of 10+ tree-depths up among even the most popular packages, and a few even reach 20+. Extremely deep trees are not just a problem of “oddball” packages.</p>

<h3 id="direct-dependencies-branching-factor">Direct dependencies (branching factor)</h3>

<p>The average number of direct dependencies (among packages with any dependencies at all) is 5. That, by itself, doesn’t seem to bad. It feels a little alarming when combined with high tree depths, though. Does that mean some of these packages have 5<sup>10</sup> total dependencies? (Spoiler: no.)</p>

<p>Here’s a graph of how many packages have 1 dependency, 2 dependencies… up to 30 — a nice, neat exponential decay.</p>

<p><img src="https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/npm_packages_per_direct_dependencies.svg" alt="Chart of package counts per direct dependencies"></p>

<p>This curve is clean enough that I would not be surprised to see something pretty similar in any package registry — maybe not the exact same parameters, but a similar shape. Not shown here is an <em>incredibly</em> long tail; there are 4 packages tied for the most direct dependencies with exactly 1000, and there are runners-up spread pretty smoothly up to that maximum.</p>

<h3 id="indirect-dependencies">Indirect dependencies</h3>

<p>Knowing the average depth and branching factor, you have to imagine that counting the total dependencies of each package, including dependencies-of-dependencies, is not going to yield good news. But many of the branches of a large dependency tree are shared — multiple packages in the tree all depend on the same library. And the tree depth I have measured is the <em>maximum</em> depth for each package — not the average. So the picture is not necessarily as dire as an initial …</p></div></div>

		<p>PicToBrick is a <span>software to generate mosaics</span> from digital pictures. The materials to construct the mosaic as well as their colours and forms can be chosen freely. For mosaics constructed  by <span>Ministeck®</span> and <span>LEGO®</span> PicToBrick provides complete system configurations. These configurations contain information for current colours and respectively forms of elements and can be modified and enlarged user-defined.</p>
		<p>To get results as good as possible for different master illustrations seven methods of  colour definition (quantisation) are at your disposal. In addition you can choose between five methods to define the element forms (tiling).</p>
		<p>Besides the produced mosaic picture PicToBrick provides a multitude of different output documents. Among other things they contain a list of materials, a construction manual as well as information about the utilised colours and forms of  material.</p>
		<p>PicToBrick was completely developed in <span>JAVA</span> and can be used <span>cross platform</span> (Windows, Linux, Mac). The software is published as <span>open source</span> under GPL2. Furthermore PricToBrick is <span>free</span>.</p>

<div>

<p>Introducing <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/stress"><code>stress</code>, a simple tool for debugging inconsistent errors</a>. No one likes seeing a test fail in (CI) and then pressing <code>Up</code> + <code>Enter</code> every 3 minutes locally to catch a flake!<sup><a href="https://cbzehner.com/introducing-stress/#lovemanuallytesting">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Try it out! <code>cargo install stress &amp;&amp; stress --output --bail -- ls -a</code></p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>This is frustratingly common in tests due to a variety of factors including</p>
<ul>
<li>Code-skew as the code changes without updating the tests</li>
<li>Poor test isolation</li>
<li>Transient errors as tests interact with multiple pieces of infrastructure. Ex: frontend + backend + database</li>
</ul>
<p>Often the fix is either <del>deleting the test</del><sup><a href="https://cbzehner.com/introducing-stress/#deletingflakes">2</a></sup> editing the test code or changing something about the environment where the test is running, increasing available memory or tweaking the config.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Pass in a command say <code>ls -a</code> and it will be run a specified number of times (default: 10). The exit codes encountered and the number of occurrences will be printed out along with the command output (with the <code>--output</code> flag). </p>
<p>If all that's needed is to see if any runs fail there's a <code>--bail</code> flag that stops the program on the first command run that ends with a failure (non-zero exit code).</p>

<p>Definitely! That's also a great option if it works for you! A while-loop in bash should be sufficient, as one of my coworkers wisely pointed out.</p>
<p>So why do this, you might wonder? Just to scratch my own itch.</p>
<p>Next time I need to debug a test, I can focus on the problem instead of the tooling.</p>
<h2 id="thanks-for-reading">Thanks for reading</h2>
<p>Leave your thoughts and feedback <a href="https://github.com/cbzehner/stress/issues">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you're using <code>stress</code> <a href="https://github.com/cbzehner/stress/issues">let me know</a> how I can improve it for <em>you</em>.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p><a name="lovemanuallytesting">1</a>: If you love manually trying to catch flakes...uh...🤯</p>
<p><a name="deletingflakes">2</a>: This is obviously a joke! But it's not always the wrong approach. Test flakes, especially in CI, are a burden on your entire engineering team. They slow down continuous development and reduce trust in the test suite. Empowering engineers to turn off flakes forces engineering teams to confront a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a>, failed CI runs.</p>

examples.</p><p>Service Workers enable the following features, which are the core of Progressive Web Apps:</p><ul><li>Offline capabilities</li><li>Periodic background syncs</li><li>Push notifications</li></ul><h3 id="offline-capabilities"><a href="#offline-capabilities" aria-label="offline capabilities permalink"></a>Offline capabilities</h3><blockquote><p><em>Since this is the main selling point of Service Workers, I'll go a little more into the details of how this works.</em></p></blockquote><p>Service Workers provide offline capabilities by <strong>caching</strong> resources and <strong>intercepting</strong> network requests, which can
be served with the previously cached resources instead of requesting the server.</p><p>We can derive two steps from this:</p><ul><li>Precaching</li><li>Serving requests from the cache</li></ul><p>Both of these steps make use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache">Cache API</a>, which can be used by Web Workers and the browser and which provides us
with a <strong>storage mechanism for network requests</strong>.</p><p>Access to localStorage is blocked for the context of Web- and Service Workers to prevent concurrency issues.
As an alternative, IndexedDB can be used for storing larger amounts of data.</p><h4 id="precaching"><a href="#precaching" aria-label="precaching permalink"></a>Precaching</h4><p>Precaching is a term that describes downloading and caching files <em>before</em> the Service Worker becomes active.
It's done during the "<a href="https://felixgerschau.com/service-worker-lifecycle-update#installing">Installing</a>" step of the Service Worker's lifecycle.
Once the Service Worker has become active, it will then be ready to serve the files from the cache.</p><blockquote><p><em>I wrote an entire <a href="https://felixgerschau.com/service-worker-lifecycle-update/">article on the Service Worker lifecycle</a>, which is why I won't go deeper on this topic right now.</em></p></blockquote><p>Usually, we want to cache the <a href="https://felixgerschau.com/how-to-make-your-react-app-a-progressive-web-app-pwa/#application-shell">Application Shell</a>,
which is the minimal amount of code required to run your website. It's the <strong>bundle of code that you would upload to
an app store</strong> if you developed a native application. This includes all the basic JavaScript, HTML, and pictures necessary.</p><p>service-worker.js</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>self<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'install'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

for the <code>install</code> and <code>activate</code> events of the Service Worker (read the documentation <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ExtendableEvent">here</a>).</p><h5 id="what-about-bundled-files"><a href="#what-about-bundled-files" aria-label="what about bundled files permalink"></a>What about bundled files?</h5><p>You might not always know the name of the files you want to precache because you are using a bundler that auto-generates
files with hashes in their names (like Webpack or Rollup for example).</p><p>For those cases, you can use <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox">Workbox</a>,
which provides tools that integrate into your build and automatically create a precaching list for you
(check out the Workbox plugin for <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-workbox">Rollup</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-webpack-plugin">Webpack</a>).</p><h4 id="serving-requests-from-the-cache"><a href="#serving-requests-from-the-cache" aria-label="serving requests from the cache permalink"></a>Serving requests from the cache</h4><p>At this stage we already have all our application code stored in the cache and the Service Worker has become active and is controlling the page.</p><p>Now the only thing missing is listening to the <code>fetch</code> event and returning results from the cache.</p><p>service-worker.js</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>self<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'fetch'</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, we respond with the cached content whenever possible. As a fallback, we make a network request.</p><p>This is called a <strong>cache first</strong> strategy. There are a few others, like <strong>network first</strong>, <strong>cache only</strong> and <strong>network only</strong>.
The names are already pretty self-explaining but if you want to read more about it you can read more on
<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/caching-files-with-service-worker">Google's developer blog</a>.</p><h3 id="periodic-background-syncs"><a href="#periodic-background-syncs" aria-label="periodic background syncs permalink"></a>(Periodic) background syncs</h3><p>As I already mentioned in the introduction, Service Workers run on a <strong>separate thread</strong> from the other Service Workers and they can even
execute their code when the page is closed. This ability is important for doing background synchronizations and providing push notifications.</p><p>I put "periodic" in parentheses because background syncs and periodic background syncs are not quite the same.
So let's have a look at what they can do:</p><h4 id="background-syncs"><a href="#background-syncs" aria-label="background syncs permalink"></a>Background syncs</h4><p>Background syncs are usually used for synchronizing data after the user navigated away from the page.</p><p>As an example, after editing a document on your phone you will hit "save" and leave the page. If your internet
connection drops during editing the document, you would have to wait for the connection to come back
to save the document.</p><p>Background syncs intend to solve this problem by <strong>automatically sending the data once the connection is re-established</strong>.</p><p>Instead of actively waiting for the connection to come back, your UI can give immediate feedback that the changes will be saved
in the background and you can put the phone back without losing time.</p><p>Let's have a look at a code example:</p><p>app.js</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>navigator<span>.</span>serviceWorker<span>.</span>ready<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>registration</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> registration<span>.</span>sync<span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>'sync-save-document'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>This codes registers a one-time sync in the Service Worker.</p><p>service-worker.js</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>self<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'sync'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>event<span>.</span>tag <span>===</span> <span>'sync-save-document'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    event<span>.</span><span>waitUntil</span><span>(</span><span>saveDocument</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>We can identify the sync by its <code>tag</code> attribute.</p><p><code>saveDocument</code> is a function that returns a promise that can either be resolved or rejected. If it's being rejected — due to
network issues for example — the sync will automatically try again.</p><p>One important thing to note is that the <strong>sync tags have to be unique</strong>. If I want to schedule 5 background syncs of the type
"message" for example, only the last one will go through. That's why in this case, each tag should have a unique identifier.</p><h4 id="periodic-background-syncs-1"><a href="#periodic-background-syncs-1" aria-label="periodic background syncs 1 permalink"></a>Periodic background syncs</h4><p>Periodic background syncs are supposed to solve a different problem than normal background syncs. This API can be used
for <strong>updating data in the background</strong> without having to wait for any interaction of the user.</p><p>This can be useful for a broad range of apps. With this technology, the user might be able to read the latest news articles without
having an internet connection.</p><p>To prevent websites from abusing this, <strong>the frequency of those synchronizations depends on the site-engagement score</strong>,
which the browser sets for every website. If you open a specific web app a lot, this frequency can go up to a maximum of 12 hours.</p><p>Another requirement for this to work is that the website is installed and added to the home screen as a Progressive Web App on mobile
devices.</p><p>At the time of writing this article, the <code>periodicSync</code> API is only supported by Chrome (v80) and Edge and thus not ready for
production use.</p><h3 id="push-notifications"><a href="#push-notifications" aria-label="push notifications permalink"></a>Push notifications</h3><p>Another native-like feature that Service Workers enable is push-notifications.
We usually know them from our phones in the form of messages or social media notifications, but they are also available on desktop computers.</p><p>They are supported on <strong>all major browsers except Safari</strong>, which has its own implementation for the desktop app.</p><p>To use push notifications, you need to set up a server, that will be <em>pushing</em> the notification to all clients.
Since the Service Worker runs in the background on a different thread, the user will be able to see push notifications <strong>even though
the page isn't currently open</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><em>The implementation is a little more complicated and worth of an article on its own, that's why I won't include any code examples
here. You can check out <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-push-notifications">this introduction</a> if you are curious.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="service-worker-browser-support"><a href="#service-worker-browser-support" aria-label="service worker browser support permalink"></a>Service Worker Browser Support</h2><p data-feature="serviceworkers" data-periods="future_1,current,past_1,past_2" data-accessible-colours="false">

</p><p>Nowadays, Service Workers are widely supported and ready to be used in production. Features like periodic background sync aren't ready yet but
the core, which is providing a rich offline experience, is supported by all modern browsers.</p><p>It's good to remember that Service Workers are part of Progressive Web Apps, where <em>progressive</em> means enhancing functionality.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the earliest bits of code in Laddertruck, the Ruby on Rails app that powers FireHydrant, consistently gets a mention in our Slack. Here it is:</p><pre><p><span>fun_creator = FunctionalityCreator.new(organization, actor: actor, account: account)</span></p><p><span>fun_creator.create(fun).tap do |funfunfun_looking_forward_to_the_weekend|</span></p><p><span>  if funfunfun_looking_forward_to_the_weekend.successful?</span></p><p><span>    service.functionalities &lt;&lt; funfunfun_looking_forward_to_the_weekend.object</span></p><p><span>  end</span></p><p><span>end</span></p></pre><p>If you’re unfamiliar, this is an homage to the oh so catchy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0">Rebecca Black’s “Friday.”</a></p><p>This tiny chunk of code adds functionality to a service in a user’s FireHydrant organization. As far as the user knows, this code could be anything, with any variables, and any class names.&nbsp;<strong>They only care that it works.</strong>&nbsp;But to us, this piece of code is much more, it’s a reflection of who we are as a team.</p><h3>The codebase should be a fun place to work</h3><p>We’re remote first, especially now, at FireHydrant. With no office, watercooler, or team outings, it can be challenging to talk to your peers. The place that we do “talk” to each other is our code. Our codebase is our metaphorical office, it’s where we collaborate and solve problems together. So why do so many companies have a codebase that’s sterile and devoid of any fun?</p><p>At FireHydrant, there’s a consistent laugh when you work in our codebases. You’ll find all sorts of things ranging from YouTube links that you have no idea where they go (it’s not a Rickroll, I promise), funny test arguments, and witty mentions to a phrase a teammate uses.</p><p>Take this piece that needs to clear a cache on the record in Laddertruck</p><pre><p><span># THE FRESH MAKER</span></p><p><span># &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgqgcE8Zck&gt;</span></p><p><span>incident.reload</span></p></pre><p>Another example is one of our engineers saying “dig” when he likes something. I believe it means “I dig it.” It caught on a little bit in the team, so when voting on runbooks was introduced, this line of code came with it.</p><pre><p><span>case params[:direction]</span></p><p><span>when ‘up’, ‘dig’</span></p><p><span>  # … voting up logic</span></p><p><span>when ‘down’</span></p><p><span>  # …</span></p><p><span>end</span></p></pre><p>Beyond having fun in code, we also write comments as if we were talking to each other in person. You can almost tell who wrote the comment without needing to git blame. They are entertaining to read, and I sometimes wonder if I would skip it entirely if it had no personality.</p><p>Said another way, our codebase has a personality:&nbsp;<strong>our company’s personality</strong>. Yours does, too.</p><h3>Your codebase is a result of your culture.</h3><p>You can see codebase culture in programming language communities. If you’re a Rubyist like I am, you probably know about the fun rubygem names like capybara, faraday, and puma. It’s not a surprise that the Ruby community has this commonality with personalities like Aaron “Tenderlove” Patterson and Bryan “test all the f***ng time” Liles, to name only two. Both of whom were exceptionally early in the Ruby community itself.</p><p>It’s incredibly likely that your company’s codebase mimics the personality of the engineers contributing to it. If you want a no-frills codebase, you should hire people that exhibit that behavior in their day to day work. If you wish to have a codebase that is fun and will make you laugh from time to time as I do, you need to hire people with that personality. It truly is your decision on what type of codebase culture you want, and it starts with hiring.</p><h3>Culture is set early.</h3><p>Probably everyone at FireHydrant has heard me say this: The trajectory of anything is set the second time you do something.</p><p>If you want to have a test-driven development culture, do it early and often. If you want a good code review culture, do it on as many pull requests as possible. If you want to see fun variables, Easter egg links, and descriptive comments… you get the idea.</p><h3>What type of codebase do you want?</h3><p>If your codebase doesn’t have your team’s personality, or worse, has a toxic one, what does that say about it? What constraints are teams operating within that they think exist, but don’t? Are people not writing comments because there is another group that thinks comments are useless? Are there no tests because it feels pointless to write one now?</p><p>A codebase with no personality makes me think of an office with bright fluorescent lights, plain walls, and no windows. I’d also assume product and project managers write a Jira issue, wad it up, and throw it to engineers saying it needs to be done by the end of the week.</p><p>We’re designing a company at FireHydrant. The early decisions we’ve made like the name of the application itself (Laddertruck), object names and even Slack channels like <code>#wtf_is_happening_with_my_code</code> are going to end up in our customer’s hands either directly, or indirectly. We want FireHydrant to be a fun and uplifting place to work, and looking at our codebase is one of the many ways to verify we’re doing that successfully.</p><p>Your codebase(s) are where you work, and having one that lacks any personality will make engineers feel like they don’t have agency in their contributions to it. I’m not advocating that you should name every single variable something funny, or that you should always write comments in first-person. Doing so would lead to a funhouse codebase where you have no idea what is up, down, left, or right. But every once in awhile, it’s a great idea to add some pizzazz to the codebase.</p><p>So why name a variable <code>functionality_creator</code> when you can call it <code>fun_creator</code> ?</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2><strong>Hi there! Who are you and whatâ€™s your background?</strong></h2>

<p>Howdy! Iâ€™m Justin Duke. I run two newsletters, both centered around my product (itself, fittingly, a newsletter tool) â€” <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown Monthly</a> and <a href="https://weeknotes.buttondown.email/">Weeknotes from Buttondown</a>. </p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not geeking out about newsletters, I â€¦ geek out about other things.  (Itâ€™s a habit.). Iâ€™m a big poetry and weightlifting nerd, and it's summer right now in Seattle so Iâ€™ve been trying to spend as much time outside as I can. (In my day job, I work as a software engineer at <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, making it easier for folks to start and grow their online business.)</p>

<p>Prior to Stripe, I cut my teeth working at Amazon building out infrastructure for Kindle content.</p>

<h2><strong>What are your newsletters about?</strong></h2>

<p>As you might guess, both of my newsletters focus on <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a>: the tool itself, the landscape, and my journey both as a developer and as a creator in the indie hackers niche.  It started out as a fairly typical product development newsletter (â€œhereâ€™s what we launched this monthâ€�, â€œhereâ€™s whatâ€™s coming down the pipelineâ€�) but I realized early on that folks were resonating <em>way</em> more with the trivial pieces: the bugs I ran into, the things I learned, and my personal stories rather than the â€œcorporateâ€� side of things.</p>

<p>When I launched paid newsletters, I knew I wanted to <a href="https://deviq.com/dogfooding/">dogfood</a>, and so I thought Iâ€™d pull out some of the most interesting bits for a paid weekly newsletter.  The intended audience of my main newsletter was, first and foremost, folks who used Buttondown as a product â€” I thought it would be more fun to generalize the paid newsletter a bit, to appeal to folks who were more interested in following my journey less from the â€œnewslettersâ€� point of view and more from the â€œcreatorâ€� point of view.</p>

<h2><strong>What is Buttondown? What motivated you to create the product?</strong></h2>

<p>Buttondown is a tool Iâ€™ve built for technical newsletters! Think â€œ<a href="https://tinyletter.com/">TinyLetter</a> or <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, except with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> and more APIsâ€� â€” itâ€™s a niche product for people like me, who are a bit more programmatically inclined but still want something quick and easy to manage emails and subscribers.</p>

<p>I was motivated to build Buttondown after I had been using TinyLetter for a while, and had perhaps the worst thought that any developer can have: â€œI bet I can build a better version of this in a weekend.â€�  It took quite a bit longer than that to get the entire thing done, but I was able to use my own tool instead of TinyLetter at the end of two weeks; after I showed it off to a few friends they convinced me to make it something more than just a self-hosted tool.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been building Buttondown for over three years now, after mistakenly thinking it would be a quick one-and-done project.  I got my first paying customer after around a month and itâ€™s now just shy of $5,000/month.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.radletters.com/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbmdDIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--32e0faa0c0d26f19431f0d9cd8755781d782cd30/btndwn2.png" alt="buttondown-product"></p>

<h2><strong>What are some of the difficulties youâ€™ve encountered in running your newsletters?</strong></h2>

<p>Motivation and timing is absolutely the hardest part for me.  Iâ€™ve been fortunate the past few months to get into a very strict schedule and rhythm (every Saturday morning, without fail, I sit down and write), but I experience a bit of a slipping effect every now and then: I forget (or life gets in the way) one weekend, so I miss it, and then the following weekend I get so anxious that I miss that one too, and so on.  The important part is <em>consistency</em>, both for yourself and for your readers.</p>

<h2><strong>Do you have a monetization strategy for your newsletters?</strong></h2>

<p>Having two newsletters means I get to segment a little bit!  My main updates newsletter is free, but you have to pay $4/month for weeknotes.  Theyâ€™re both ad-free (they advertise Buttondown, but that hardly counts ;)). Weeknotes brings in a solid $900/month, which is not exactly a life-changing amount but is still wonderful and humbling (and pays for my two biggest vices, coffee and Green Chartreuse.)</p>

<h2><strong>What newsletters are you subscribed to?</strong></h2>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">Money Stuff</a> is Bloombergâ€™s daily finance newsletter written by Matt Levine.  It is, for my money, the perfect newsletter: witty, informative, and precise.  Matt does an amazing job of breaking down things like credit default swaps or investor buyouts in a way that youâ€™ll grasp them easily <em>and</em> understand the bigger picture.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://letterstosummer.com/">Letters to Summer</a> is an intimate, sweet look at a conversation between two friends.  Iâ€™ve been turned onto this one from my friend Jasdev and itâ€™s been great: Iâ€™ve discovered new games, new music, and (clichÃ© as it is to say) a little bit of a new outlook on life.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>What goals do you have for the future?</strong></h2>

<p>If you had told me two years ago Buttondown would become as large as it has, I would have laughed â€” it was a tool I made for myself first and foremost, and secondarily for my friends who also wanted an easier way to build newsletters.  Thatâ€™s equally true for the newsletters: the fact that a hundred or so folks are willing to pay me for the privilege of following me on my journey is super humbling!</p>

<p>Honestly, I hope for more of the same down the line.  Buttondown â€” both as a newsletter and a tool â€” is something that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever want to do full time, because itâ€™s a privilege that it can be a place where I <em>retreat</em> from my day job.  </p>

<h2><strong>Where can readers go to learn more about you and your newsletter?</strong></h2>

<p>Readers can visit the <a href="https://buttondown.email/">website</a>, find Buttondown on <a href="https://twitter.com/buttondown">Twitter</a>, or sign up for Weeknotes from Buttondown at <a href="https://weeknotes.buttondown.email/">weeknotes.buttondown.email</a>!</p>

We<span>'ll read in the Antartica penguins dataset directly from a .csv file at the GitHub repository that hosts seaborn'</span>s datasets<span>.</span>

All sidetable methods use the `<span>.</span>stb` accessor<span>.</span> For more about the pandas accessor API<span>,</span> see this <span>[</span>post<span>]</span><span>(</span>https<span>:</span><span>//</span>pbpython<span>.</span>com<span>/</span>sidetable<span>.</span>html<span>)</span> by Chris Moffit<span>,</span> the author of sidetable<span>.</span>


The first sidetable DataFrame method we<span>'ll check out is `stb.missing()`.

With `df<span>.</span>info<span>(</span><span>)</span>`<span>,</span> we would have had to do the arithmetic <span>in</span> our head<span>.</span> 🤔

Yo<span>u've seen how you can use sidetable to quickly display missing values, make nicely formatted frequency tables, and show grand totals and subtotals. It'</span>s a handy little library<span>.</span> 👍



Here's a recap of the API<span>:</span>
<span>-</span> `stb<span>.</span>missing<span>(</span><span>)</span>` <span>-</span> display helpful information about missing values<span>.</span>
<span>-</span> `stb<span>.</span>freq<span>(</span><span>)</span>` <span>-</span> display counts<span>,</span> percents<span>,</span> <span>and</span> cumulative information <span>for</span> columns<span>.</span>
<span>-</span> `stb<span>.</span>subtotal<span>(</span><span>)</span>` <span>-</span> add a grand total row to a DataFrame<span>.</span> If applied to a groupby<span>,</span> add subtotal information <span>for</span> each group<span>.</span>

Passing `style<span>=</span><span>True</span>` to `stb<span>.</span>missing<span>(</span><span>)</span>` <span>and</span> `stb<span>.</span>freq<span>(</span><span>)</span>` makes the output nicely formatted<span>.</span> There are a nubmer of other arguments you can <span>pass</span> to `stb<span>.</span>freq<span>(</span><span>)</span>` to modify the output<span>.</span>

<p>These are the techniques I’ve found most effective to get paid fast when doing technology freelancing.<br></p>



<p><strong>1. Ask for a portion of the fee upfront.</strong></p>



<p>This one seems obvious to me now, but I went several years before I moved beyond the “work a bunch of hours then send an invoice and wait” model. You can do this whether you are fixed fee or hourly, basing the latter on an estimate.</p>



<p><strong>2. Ask for the entire fee upfront.</strong></p>



<p>You’d be surprised how acceptable this becomes once you simply start making it your convention. And, really, it’s not all that strange when you consider that you can’t drive away with a car (or even walk out of Walmart) before paying for your purchase, as well as the fact that in most cases you are taking on greater risk than the client is by working on a project for a client for a few weeks or months with only the “hope” that you’ll get paid at the end. You are a freelancer, not your client’s banker/lender.</p>



<p><strong>3. Set expectations upfront.</strong></p>



<p>If the buyer can make the full investment decision upfront, rather than hope or guess, it’s easier to get paid faster. A lot of delayed payments are really because the buyer is disappointed with either the fee, the value, or the result. If your fees are fixed and thus entirely set upfront, this is easy. If you charge hourly/daily/weekly, estimate conservatively and… see the next item.</p>



<p><strong>4. Offer compelling value.</strong></p>



<p>I prefer to not only discuss the project upfront, but to then come back to the client with a written summary (which ends up being the proposal). The summary is in my own words but drawn entirely from our discussions. It contains, at a minimum, with a nod to the value-based fee model taught by Alan Weiss:</p>



<ul><li>The situation appraisal</li><li>The business objectives (outputs/improved conditions) tied to the work</li><li>The believed value of the work (business-wise and sometimes personally and professionally for the buyer)</li><li>The implicit or explicit metrics or indicators of success for the work against the objectives</li></ul>



<p>In this way, the buyer and I don’t proceed until there is a true “meeting of the minds” over the value of the work. It’s easy to get into a discussion about the inputs (tasks), but the real value is in the results. The better understanding I have of the ideal result that the client has in mind, the closer I can tie my work to compelling value. And the happier the client will be to pay, period.</p>



<p><strong>5. Constantly communicate.</strong></p>



<p>You know when you should be providing updates. Generally it is whenever you’ve promised to, just before or after major milestones, when there are hiccups that may impact scheduling or results, or any other time you know you should but are avoiding doing so only because you are concerned about the reaction. 🙂</p>



<p><strong>6. Meet commitments.</strong></p>



<p>If you make a promise, meet it. Simple, but not always easy. If something isn’t going as planned, just communicate that and adjust. Unless you make a pattern of it – or don’t learn from your mistakes – it’ll be probably okay.</p>



<p><strong>7. Use plain language. (Avoid legalese.)</strong></p>



<p>Don’t create proposals that require legal departments / attorneys to get involved. And if you can’t avoid it entirely, keep them sane. Business is risk.[1]</p>



<p><strong>8. Make it easy to pay you.</strong></p>



<p>Accept checks, eChecks (ACH), and all major credit and debit cards as well as, if possible, via multiple processors. I accept payment via PayPal, Google Checkout, and Stripe. There is overlap between these, but every buyer/client has their own favorite service. I don’t care which they use, just as long as they pay as promptly or – preferably – as rapidly as possible.</p>



<p>If you are concerned about paying 2% to 3% on credit card transactions, you are overlooking that you are in a high margin business. Paying 3% on credit card transactions will make you cringe sometimes, but don’t overlook the big picture. You are providing a service with an 80%-90% profit margin. And, having money in your hand – rather than “in the mail” – is the difference between an actual sale and just talk. It’s also the difference between putting food on the table and starving waiting for money to arrive in the indefinite future.</p>



<p><strong>9. Follow-up when a payment is late. Do so immediately and in a professional, consistent, and assertive manner.</strong></p>



<p>I suggest clear language that doesn’t whine (it’s not their problem you can’t pay your mortgage, but it is their problem they are failing to fulfill their commitment). I prefer automated follow-up so that it always happens, otherwise I will put it off. Most on-line invoicing solutions can be set-up to do this automatically for you after a configured number of days.</p>



<p><strong>10. Always make payment arrangements and discuss payment problems with your buyer (the decision maker / business sponsor), not the client’s bookkeeper or accounts payable department.</strong></p>



<p>The buyer can escalate, assert their authority, and negotiate when there are problems. They are also the one who is impacted if a missed payment results in a project delay. The A/P department on the other hand isn’t any of these things.</p>



<p><strong>11. Generate professional invoices that are easy-to-read.</strong></p>



<p>They should clearly describe the work, account for every hour (if you are billing for time), and reference the project, proposal, and buyer clearly. Make them very simple, without any extra language or legalese.</p>



<p><strong>12. Send invoices in a timely manner and do so consistently.</strong></p>



<p>Immediately upon gaining agreement on a proposal. Consistently at milestones or the agreed upon dates. If possible, generate and schedule delivery ahead of time. If a series of invoices is likely, you can even provide them all upfront with rolling due dates, if that seems like it’ll be helpful.</p>



<p><strong>13. State a late fee on every invoice generated that applies if it is not the balance is paid in a timely manner.</strong></p>



<p>Pretty self-explanatory. A flat fee or charging interest are fine, but if the latter make sure you understand usurp your state/country specific restrictions on charging interest.</p>



<p><strong>14. State all invoices as being “Due upon receipt.”</strong></p>



<p>If you learn an organization is taking advantage of this phrasing to not pay within 7-10 business days, change their next invoice to be “Net 15” (due in 15 days). If they can’t pay on time, tell them to use a credit card.</p>



<p><strong>15. Offer a small discount for pre-payment in full upfront.</strong></p>



<p>I always ask for a portion of the fee upfront for every project, while offering a small discount for pre-payment in full upfront (in the 5% to 10% range). For projects I consider to be relatively small (e.g. &lt;$5,000) I don’t offer a discount, but outright require full payment upfront.</p>

<p>Ever since the <em>serverless</em> buzzword first took off around 2015, people
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22servers%20in%20serverless%22">have</a>
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22servers+in+serverless%22">been</a>
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless#toc-are-there--aDx9w_gl">asking</a>.</p>
<div><p>
Are there servers in serverless?
</p>

</div>

<p>Today, after some thorough research, and drawing on my experience working in
the deepest bowels of Amazon's gargantuan cloud, I can share the definitive
answer with you. Hover your mouse over the grey box below to find out.
</p>
<p>As you can see, since the word <em>serverless</em> contains the word <em>server</em>, we have
found evidence for <em>servers</em> in <em>serverless</em>! </p>
<p>Ok, so now you think I'm a smart-ass. Also, if you were
looking closely we only found <em>one</em> server, singular.</p>
<p>If you'll just bear with me for one second, I think we can do better.</p>


<p>Whoa! It turns out, there are server<em>s</em> (plural) in server<em>less</em> after
all! <a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2>A more serious answer</h2>
<p>First, let's start with a definition of <em>serverless</em>. I'm going to use one
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless">from AWS</a>, because they popularized the
term, and seem to be the leader in the space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without
thinking about servers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a pretty good definition. Developers always say they just want to think
about business logic. They don't want to worry about messy details, so this
sounds great.  But why do very smart people get so <a href="https://twitter.com/g_bonfiglio/status/1052680017249996800">passionate and
agitated</a> about the
word <em>serverless</em>. It seems to trigger almost a primal reaction in many
engineers, because they <em>know</em> there are some computers somewhere doing <em>the
thing</em> and if they're in a datacenter, you can probably call them servers.</p>
<p>I think the answer is: <em>serverless often fails spectacularly to deliver on it's
core promise</em>. Developers using serverless technologies are often finding
themselves dealing with servers, but in weird and unusual ways.</p>
<h3>Outrageous example: Aurora Serverless</h3>
<p>This example makes me suspect that some marketing team slapped the <em>serverless</em>
name on a feature that was designed with less lofty goals. I don't know for
sure, but I can't think of a better explanation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/faqs/">Aurora Serverless FAQ states</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Aurora Serverless [...] you pay a flat rate per second [...] with a
minimum of 5 minutes of usage each time the database is activated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AWS Lambda, the original service that popularized the <em>serverless</em> model has
100 <em>millisecond</em> increments for billing. But Aurora will bill me for FIVE
MINUTES For one request? That's like making one request to AWS Lambda, but
then getting charged for 3,000.</p>
<p>For comparison, the minimum billing increment for both a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing">Google Cloud Virtual
Machine (VM)</a>, or an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/#Per_Second_Billing">AWS
EC2 VM</a> is one minute.
Both of those products are actual (virtual) servers.</p>
<p>The bottom line? Aurora serverless has a less granular pricing model than
<em>actual servers</em>. That's a fail in my book.</p>
<h3>Subtle example: hunt the chips</h3>
<p>No current serverless technology<a href="#fn2"><sup>1</sup></a> abstracts the underlying
CPU. For instance, <a href="https://alestic.com/2014/11/aws-lambda-environment/">Eric
Hammond</a> found that his
Lambda function was running on an Intel Xeon E5-2680 in 2014. I think that's
the same CPU as the EC2 C3 instance type. AWS can probably migrate Lambda
functions to later-and-greater <em>Intel</em> EC2 instances without any customers
noticing too much.</p>
<p>However, AWS has recently been spruiking their ARM based Graviton2 chips as
being better value than Intel chips.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to bring customers the next gen of Amazon EC2 instances powered by <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AWS</a>-designed, Arm-based Graviton2 processors that deliver up to 40% better price/performance than comparable current x86 instances. Should be a game changer! <a href="https://t.co/UCmidWcTmP">https://t.co/UCmidWcTmP</a></p>— Andy Jassy (@ajassy) <a href="https://twitter.com/ajassy/status/1271264376394149888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>
Normally I would expect the Lambda team to migrate workloads to these newer,
cheaper EC2 instances. AWS loves to talk about how they <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-storage-update-s3-glacier-price-reductions/">"work relentlessly to
reduce [costs] and to pass the resulting savings
along"</a>.
However, with Graviton and Lambda, I don't think they can. A lot of code that
was written for the Intel, or x86 architecture will likely break on ARM, even
if it's running inside virtual machines like Python, or NodeJS. AWS doesn't
know if your Python, or JavaScript code depends on <a href="https://www.nickwilcox.com/blog/arm_vs_x86_memory_model/">subtle or less
subtle</a> features of
x86 architecture. If you're using their <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html#runtimes-custom-build">custom
runtimes</a>
then it's even worse.</p>
<p>Contrast this to services like S3 and DynamoDB. How would you, a customer know
if the S3, or DynamoDB team migrated from x86 to ARM? You wouldn't. You just
see data going in, and data going out. Everything else is Amazon's problem.</p>
<p>Will serverless hit a speed-bump as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_transition_to_ARM">industry</a>
<a href="https://www.top500.org/news/japan-captures-top500-crown-arm-powered-supercomputer/">shifts</a>
from Intel to ARM? Will we have to recompile our serverless functions to ARM to
get the lowest prices? I haven't seen anybody else talking about this yet, so
either I'm early, or it's less of an issue than I thought.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I've just shown one joke way, and two real ways where "servers", or the
underlying hardware are not fully abstracted by serverless. I suspect this is
one reason why people like to
<a href="https://twitter.com/IamStan/status/1018755075827814400">make</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/findgriffin/status/1205214120569556992">fun</a> of serverless
on Twitter. Additionally, I think those who argue
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq3Nx0S27dU">passionately</a> that serverless
isn't the future of our industry have a point. Surely there will be future
waves of innovation that deliver better abstractions, performance, and pricing
than serverless currently does.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you want to help me figure out what might come after serverless, please get
in touch, I have a few ideas.</p>
<hr>
<p><sup id="fn1">1</sup> There is actually a serious point to be made here, which
is to define your branding around what you're <em>for</em> rather than what you're
<em>against</em>. The point of serverless isn't that servers are bad. It's that I (a
developer) don't want to think about them. A better name for serverless might
have been something like "developer-centric", "zero-fixed-cost", or
"granular-scalability"<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p><sup id="fn2">2</sup> I'm only counting <em>compute</em> services here. In other
words, services that execute code. Examples include AWS Lambda, Google Cloud
Functions, Azure Functions, CloudFlare Workers, and Fastly <a href="http://blog.drgriffin.com.au/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7635191b06030213363312111358">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>
<p><sup id="fn3">3</sup> Ok, none of these are great, but hopefully you get the
idea. This is why I don't work in marketing.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">

<p>While Flask has become the de-facto choice for API development in Machine Learning projects, there is a new framework called FastAPI that has been getting a lot of community traction.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/flask-to-fastapi.png" alt="Flask and FastAPI Logo"></p>
<p>I recently decided to give FastAPI a spin by porting a production project written in Flask. FastAPI was very easy to pick up coming from Flask and I was able to get things up and running in just a few hours.</p>
<p>The added benefit of automatic data validation, documentation generation and baked-in best-practices such as pydantic schemas and python typing makes this a strong choice for future projects.</p>
<p>In this post, I will introduce FastAPI by contrasting the implementation of various common use-cases in both Flask and FastAPI.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Version Info:</strong></p><p>
At the time of this writing, the Flask version is 1.1.2 and the FastAPI version is 0.58.1
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Both Flask and FastAPI are available on PyPI. For conda, you need to use the <code>conda-forge</code> channel to install FastAPI while it’s available in the default channel for Flask.</p>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>pip <span>install </span>flask
conda <span>install </span>flask
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>pip <span>install </span>fastapi uvicorn
conda <span>install </span>fastapi uvicorn <span>-c</span> conda-forge
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="running-hello-world">Running “Hello World”</h2>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># app.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>Flask</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>Flask</span><span>(</span><span>__name__</span><span>)</span>

    <span>app</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>()</span>

<p>Now you can run the development server using the below command. It runs on port 5000 by default.</p>

<p><strong>FastAPI</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># app.py

<p>FastAPI defers serving to a production-ready server called <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/settings/">uvicorn</a>. We can start the server as:</p>

<p>You can also start it in hot-reload mode by running</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can change the port as well.</p>

<p>We want to get the user id from the URL e.g. <code>/users/1</code> and then return the user id to the user.</p>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>(</span><span>'/users/&lt;int:user_id&gt;'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>get_user_details</span><span>(</span><span>user_id</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'user_id'</span><span>:</span> <span>user_id</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong></p>
<p>In FastAPI, we make use of type hints in Python to specify all the data types. For example, here we specify that <code>user_id</code> should be an integer. The variable in the URL path is also specified similar to f-strings.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/users/{user_id}'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>get_user_details</span><span>(</span><span>user_id</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'user_id'</span><span>:</span> <span>user_id</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="query-strings">Query Strings</h2>
<p>We want to allow the user to specify a search term by using a query string <code>?q=abc</code> in the URL.</p>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>request</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>(</span><span>'/search'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>search</span><span>():</span>
    <span>query</span> <span>=</span> <span>request</span><span>.</span><span>args</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'q'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'query'</span><span>:</span> <span>query</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/search'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'query'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="json-post-request">JSON POST Request</h2>
<p>Let’s take a toy example where we want to send a JSON POST request with a <code>text</code> key and get back a lowercased version.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#</span><span> </span><span>Request</span><span>
</span><span>{</span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"HELLO"</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>#</span><span> </span><span>Response</span><span>
</span><span>{</span><span>"text"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"hello"</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>request</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>(</span><span>'/lowercase'</span><span>,</span> <span>methods</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'POST'</span><span>])</span>
<span>def</span> <span>lower_case</span><span>():</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>request</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'text'</span><span>:</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>()}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong><br>
If you simply replicate the functionality from Flask, you can do it as follows in FastAPI.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Dict</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'/lowercase'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>lower_case</span><span>(</span><span>json_data</span><span>:</span> <span>Dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>json_data</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'text'</span><span>:</span> <span>text</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>()}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But, this is where FastAPI introduces a new concept of creating Pydantic schema that maps to the JSON data being received. We can refactor the above example using pydantic as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>pydantic</span> <span>import</span> <span>BaseModel</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Sentence</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'/lowercase'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>lower_case</span><span>(</span><span>sentence</span><span>:</span> <span>Sentence</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'text'</span><span>:</span> <span>sentence</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>()}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As seen, instead of getting a dictionary, the JSON data is converted into an object of the schema <code>Sentence</code>. As such, we can access the data using data attributes such as <code>sentence.text</code>. This also provides automatic validation of data types. If the user tries to send any data other than a string, they will be given an auto-generated validation error.</p>
<p><strong>Example Invalid Request</strong></p>

<p><strong>Automatic Response</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"detail"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
        </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"loc"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
                </span><span>"body"</span><span>,</span><span>
                </span><span>"text"</span><span>
            </span><span>],</span><span>
            </span><span>"msg"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"none is not an allowed value"</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"type_error.none.not_allowed"</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="modular-views">Modular Views</h2>
<p>We want to decompose the views from a single app.py into separate files.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>-</span><span> </span><span>app.py</span><span>
</span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>views</span><span>
  </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>user.py</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Flask:</strong><br>
In Flask, we use a concept called blueprints to manage this. We would first create a blueprint for the user view as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># views/user.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>Blueprint</span>
<span>user_blueprint</span> <span>=</span> <span>Blueprint</span><span>(</span><span>'user'</span><span>,</span> <span>__name__</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>user_blueprint</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>(</span><span>'/users'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>list_users</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'users'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'a'</span><span>,</span> <span>'b'</span><span>,</span> <span>'c'</span><span>]}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, this view is registered in the main <code>app.py</code> file.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># app.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>Flask</span>
<span>from</span> <span>views.user</span> <span>import</span> <span>user_blueprint</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>Flask</span><span>(</span><span>__name__</span><span>)</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>register_blueprint</span><span>(</span><span>user_blueprint</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong><br>
In FastAPI, the equivalent of a blueprint is called a router. First, we create a user router as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># routers/user.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>fastapi</span> <span>import</span> <span>APIRouter</span>
<span>router</span> <span>=</span> <span>APIRouter</span><span>()</span>

<span>@</span><span>router</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/users'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>list_users</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'users'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'a'</span><span>,</span> <span>'b'</span><span>,</span> <span>'c'</span><span>]}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, we attach this router to the main app object as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># app.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>fastapi</span> <span>import</span> <span>FastAPI</span>
<span>from</span> <span>routers</span> <span>import</span> <span>user</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>FastAPI</span><span>()</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>include_router</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>router</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="data-validation">Data Validation</h2>
<p><strong>Flask</strong><br>
Flask doesn’t provide any input data validation feature out-of-the-box. It’s common practice to either write custom validation logic or use libraries such as <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">marshmalllow</a> or <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">pydantic</a>.</p>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong></p>
<p>FastAPI wraps pydantic into its framework and allow data validation by simply using a combination of pydantic schema and python type hints.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>fastapi</span> <span>import</span> <span>FastAPI</span>
<span>from</span> <span>pydantic</span> <span>import</span> <span>BaseModel</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>FastAPI</span><span>()</span>

<span>class</span> <span>User</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'/users'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>save_user</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>User</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'name'</span><span>:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
            <span>'age'</span><span>:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>age</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This code will perform automatic validation to ensure <code>name</code> is a string and <code>age</code> is an integer. If any other data type is sent, it auto-generates validation error with a relevant message.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of pydantic schema for common use-cases.</p>
<h3 id="example-1-key-value-pairs">Example 1: Key-value pairs</h3>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

<p>You can learn more about Python Type hints from <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/python-types/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-documentation">Automatic Documentation</h2>
<p><strong>Flask</strong><br>
Flask doesn’t provide any built-in feature for documentation generation. There are extensions such as <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flask-swagger/">flask-swagger</a> or <a href="https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/swagger.html">flask-restful</a> to fill that gap but the workflow is comparatively complex.</p>
<p><strong>FastAPI:</strong><br>
FastAPI automatically generates an interactive swagger documentation endpoint at <code>/docs</code> and a reference documentation at <code>/redoc</code>.</p>
<p>For example, say we had a simple view given below that echoes what the user searched for.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># app.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>fastapi</span> <span>import</span> <span>FastAPI</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>FastAPI</span><span>()</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'/search'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>'query'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="swagger-documentation">Swagger Documentation</h3>
<p>If you run the server and goto the endpoint <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</code>, you will get an auto-generated swagger documentation.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/fastapi-swagger.png" alt="OpenAPI Swagger UI in FastAPI"></p>
<p>You can interactively try out the API from the browser itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/fastapi-swagger-interactive.png" alt="Interactive API Usage in FastAPI"></p>
<h3 id="redoc-documentation">ReDoc Documentation</h3>
<p>In addition to swagger, if you goto the endpoint <code>http://127.0.0.01:8000/redoc</code>, you will get an auto-generated reference documentation. There is information on parameters, request format, response format and status codes.<br>
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/fastapi-redoc.png" alt="ReDoc functionality in FastAPI"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thus, FastAPI is an excellent alternative to Flask for building robust APIs with best-practices baked in. You can refer to the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">documentation</a> to learn more.</p>

                    <p>Why do startups move fast and enterprises move slowly?</p><p>I recently had a call with an ex-employee of a well known and a well-funded startup that has been around for a few years, let's say it was a household name.</p><p>She told me that getting anything done was slow, painful and costing the company growth and even worse, stopping the company quickly capitalising on new opportunities.</p><p>She then preceded to say that speed was one of our biggest strategic advantages as an early-stage startup.</p><p>I don't disagree.</p><p>Over the last 12 months, our startup VEED has moved extremely fast and grown even faster. It has been a lot of fun. Now that our team is getting close to 20 (Yikes :S) I can feel things slowing down a little.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-29-at-11.42.34.png"><figcaption>Growth At VEED - Indie Hackers</figcaption></figure><p>I am somewhat cool with that...</p><p>However, I want to try and uncover the exact formula that has allowed startups like ours to move fast so we can continue to do so in the future the bigger we grow. The main questions I would like to answer in this post are:</p><ul><li>What are the advantages of moving fast?</li><li>Can you build an infrastructure to allow your company to move fast?</li><li>How to build and hire a fast team?</li><li>And finally, how to continue moving fast as your company gets bigger?</li></ul><p>As this article is all about moving fast, let's get onto the first topic?</p><h3 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-moving-fast">What are the advantages of moving fast?</h3><p>By moving fast you can amplify the speed of learning in your company. The speed of learning is important because this gives the ability to make better-informed decisions on real data. This allows you to validate your ideas and hypothesis quicker.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/SpeedOfLEarning-.png"><figcaption>Publish fast, learn fast</figcaption></figure><p>If you can Build -&gt; Measure -&gt; Learn a product feature in just 1 week instead of 4, you will be 4 times closer to satisfying your customers needs in the same period of time. Simple, of course, but this means your are quicker to market and by building a better product quicker you help the company to start making money on these features faster.</p><p>For example, If we added billing to VEED 4 month earlier, our revenue would be double what it is now, that's a big deal and a lot of money. </p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/Add-Text-Copy-145.png"><figcaption>Cost of delay @ VEED.IO</figcaption></figure><p>However, by doing so you are obviously going to have to compromise. You absolutely have to "cut the fat" to see results quicker. This might mean reducing the desired feature set for launch, not having pixel-perfect implementation or handing over ownership to your team.</p><p>All the three points above perfectly sum up the first few months of our startup journey as we hacked together VEED. These were our humble scrappy beginnings ❤️</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/IMG_6063-1.jpg"><figcaption>First Office</figcaption></figure><p>One of my tutors at art school (Rebecca Ross) said something to me that I will never forget. "Perfectionism is a form of procrastination" As many early-stage startup founders come from a product background, it's easy to convince yourself that building polished feature after feature is a good use of your time, however, you might just be heading in the completely wrong direction.</p><p>The final strategic advantage for a startup to move fast is that you are able to simply outpace your competition before they have time to react and capture market share.</p><p>For example, we could easily assume competitors of ours such as Adobe are working on competing product offerings, however, they are not able to to move as fast as us.</p><p>It is crazy! Think about it, a bootstrapped company can move faster than corporate such as Adobe with a $190Bn Market cap!</p><h3 id="why-can-startups-move-fast">Why can startups move fast?</h3><p>Startups are fast.</p><p>Big companies are slow.</p><p>But why?</p><p>One common idea is related to network latency. The idea is simple, in a small team, information passing, validation of ideas and decision making can be made quickly as all of these things don't need to go through layers of bureaucracy.</p><p>Let's look at an example.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/moving-fast-veed.png"><figcaption><strong>Why can startups move fast?</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Above we can see that by reducing the number of stakeholders, information can flow quicker and therefore decisions can be made much faster. Amazon believes that 2 pizzas should feed each team. By keeping teams small, cross-functional and agile you can avoid holdups and eat the pizza while it is still hot!</p><blockquote><em>For more on this topic, I recommend reading the The Everything Store - by Brad Stone where he goes into detail how Amazon builds cross-functional teams.</em></blockquote><p><br>In the early days of VEED the team was just Tim and myself, between us we covered design, product, dev and marketing. Our next two hires Mate &amp; Veljko were also not afraid to step out of their comfort zone and work with new challenges outside their designated roles.</p><h3 id="how-can-you-build-an-infrastructure-to-allows-you-to-move-fast">How can you build an infrastructure to allows you to move fast?</h3><p>Another reason startups can move fast is they don not yet have the same infrastructure to maintain vs their enterprise counterparts. As your company gets bigger, so does your codebase, your user needs, testing surface area and more.</p><p>So how do you build an infrastructure that allows you to move fast. The answer is simple, you don't! Here is a good example I recently came across.</p><p>Superhuman is a popular email client that has raised over $33M in funding. A few weeks ago I went to update my billing information on the app and saw they were using Stripe's default checkout. Superhuman has the resources to build a custom checkout, however, they opted to use the default option provided by stipe.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/EXfLrkMWoAA57EN.jpeg"><figcaption>Keep it simple</figcaption></figure><p>I have a lot of respect for this. Superhuman is clearly focusing on building more value into the core reason why the user originally bought the product. Not spending time making a nice checkout process.</p><p>As I reflect on this, we have spent way too much time building custom login systems, custom checkouts and marketing automations that could have been spent building a better video editor.</p><p>In light of this, we have now moved all of our marking sites to Webflow and all of our marketing automation to Zappier. The idea is to use 3rd party tools / low code / no code wherever you can, so we can focus on building a great video editor. Everything else outside of video editing and our core value proposition is not where we should be spending our time, it is not what we are good at. By doing this you are reducing technical debt, engineering time and allowing your entire team to move faster.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/IMG_20200629_115539.jpg"><figcaption>Building Marketing Sites in Webflow</figcaption></figure><p>Let's look at building a login system from engineering point of view, as it is a good example. A customer login system requires connecting a mail provider, building password reset, protecting users data, adding the ability to update email and so much more. In addition, we had more than 10 customer service tickers every day with users who were unable to login. Most of the time they simply forgot the password or entered their email wrong. VS opting for passwordless login, we don't need to think about any of the above while also benefiting from incredibly low maintenance.</p><h3 id="how-to-build-a-fast-team">How to build a fast team?</h3><p>Just like when putting together Jamaica's first bobsled team, picking candidates that are already fast is a proven way to to make sure you have the DNA for speed. We like to look for side projects, self-initiated work, hunger to learn. We also look for candidates that show the ability to manage their own time well and also have the attitude to do their best work. &nbsp;However, we just don't have enough experience with hiring right now to effectively comment on this.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/06/cool-2.jpg"><figcaption>Moving Fast - Cool Runnings</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, the one thing we do have a lot of experience in is messing up! We believe that having a no-blame culture helps provide an environment that allows our team to experiment and make mistakes and if we are not making mistakes, we are not taking enough risks. If you had to attempt a backflip without a soft landing, there is little chance that you would attempt it, however knowing fully well that there is a soft landing, there is a good chance you will give it a go.</p><blockquote><em>The idea of a no-blame culture is partly stolen from Creativity, Inc - Amy Wallace and Edwin Catmull.</em></blockquote><h3 id="how-to-continue-moving-fast-as-your-company-gets-bigger">How to continue moving fast as your company gets bigger?</h3><p>Now we have explored all the main points that I wanted to cover, its time to put together a list of our key learnings for this post to help us to continue to move fast as we get bigger.</p><p><strong>Teams</strong></p><p>Keep teams small &amp; cross-functional. Keep information moving between the teams fast and avoid any outside stakeholders/gatekeepers. You should fully trust your team to do an amazing job, that's why you hired them.</p><p><strong>Individuals</strong></p><p>Give your team members the freedom to do their best work. Have a no-blame culture by never pointing the finger and celebrating failure.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p><p>Less code = the better! More off-the-shelf products means there is no need to reinvent the wheel. Don't block the team and empower everyone to push work/changes to production fast.</p><p><strong>The road ahead</strong></p><p>Provide top-line strategies, but provide enough flexibility to go off-piste... Rules are there to be broken! Remember validated learning with quicker feedback loops = faster team!</p><p>Final thoughts, there are going to be many things I have missed from this article, and in the spirit of moving fast, if this resonates with readers, we will be back to update it with more info. If you need an online video editing app or an amazing subtitle tool, this is something we can definitely help you out with.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_29_0ee">

<div>
<p>Facebook’s rise popularised the ‘News Feed’ as a social, infinitely scrollable aggregation of content posted by your family, friends and liked pages. Made up of ‘news’ closer to the home, the feed was largely composed of personal milestones, announcements, photo albums etc. But in late 2019 Facebook introduced a beta feature called the ‘News Tab’ that’s now been rolled out in the US this month, an entirely separate feature to the News Feed that focuses on aggregating news from vetted sources based on user curation. Though not immediately obvious, this is in fact a step toward its more private and personal approach to the platform – here we’re talking about the aggregation and distribution of news and journalism moving closer to its readership, with user-curated and distributed news bringing mainstream media into the fold of the user’s smaller, more personal circles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given that the premise of Facebook remains largely social, the introduction of this feature doesn’t necessarily mean all users will jump at the opportunity to actively curate and share news. It’s even located oddly offscreen where users need to click on the three-line “hamburger” and then find the news box amid other menu options. The News Tab rather represents a point of distribution, where the users who do actively participate will take on the role of curators for their respective networks within the platform. If successful, the News Tab represents a shift in the power of news distribution – away from publications and toward power users who have the ability to propagate information through the social network.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why do users hold more distribution power within the Facebook ecosystem?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>There are two factors that enable users to hold more distribution power within the Facebook ecosystem and they’re very much intertwined.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Private virality&nbsp;</li><li>Improved efficiency of sharing, discovery and signalling</li></ol>



<p>While private virality sounds like an oxymoron, it simply alludes to the nature of virality (the quick circulation of some media from one internet user to another) within the more private context of a circles-based social media platform like Facebook. To understand why the ‘private’ is an operative term lets explore the characteristics of user propagated information within social circles:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Greater levels of trust as the point of distribution gets closer to the inner circle → <strong>improved efficiency of sharing</strong></li><li>Greater alignment of interests as the point of distribution gets closer to the inner circle → <strong>improved efficiency of discovery&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Greater level of social signalling – social capital generated from social signalling to family and friends is stickier than capital generated in forums like Twitter and Reddit → <strong>improved efficiency of signalling</strong></li></ol>



<p>The virality of user propagated news on Facebook is stronger for the traits it carries as it passes through social channels, even the most tenuous social link is stronger than the links that currently exist between the public and media sources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The nature of private virality creates improved efficiency of discovery, sharing and signalling –&nbsp; creating a feedback loop that makes it a stronger and stronger proposition each time. Imagine that you, as a reader, discover an article that resonates with you on the source’s primary website (e.g. a NY times or WSJ) and decide to share it with your social or professional circles – at present this requires the added step of ‘porting’. Either follow a share link or copy and paste the article onto another platform. While this step is trivial in nature it signifies a disconnect between the source and destination of information in social networks, a disconnect that the Facebook News Tab would transform into one fluid motion (News Tab to News Feed) making private virality even easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The efficiency in sharing, both in terms of ease and relevance, creates better discoverability and in turn, makes for stronger signalling. The incentive to remain a connector node or user who distributes information and the incentive to continue consuming user propagated news appear much clearer and stronger than in the absence of the feature. Publishers, who are still able to tap into other avenues of propagation can expect to relinquish the propagation power within social networks to such connectors or power users –&nbsp; who in this instance are simply more effective distributors.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why has Facebook empowered its users as its distributors of information?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Typically news aggregators or publications act as the point of distribution, resulting in externally curated news feeds. Facebook is banking on shifting the externally determined distribution of news from Facebook or publishers, towards user-centric curation and propagation. It’s important to note that this adds value to the core user base of Facebook (regardless of whether they interact with the News Tab or not), where most consumption will take place in the personal feeds that these connector nodes share news to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The combination of Facebook’s social capital and a news aggregator tab is not typically available to other mediums of news distribution. This places Facebook in a unique position to not only become an effective news aggregator but also compound on the user stickiness to the platform – essentially extending their core value proposition.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why the News Tab is different to previous attempts</h3>



<p>Facebook’s previous iterations of news features like the Open Graph platform in 2011 and Instant Articles in 2015, failed to gain traction and were eventually phased out. This was primarily because Facebook introduced the news as an extraneous element to users’ primary use of Facebook which is to connect with friends and family. Open Graph, which auto shared articles users were reading at the time, came at a time when the platform was still consolidating its social focus. When Facebook changed its feed post design and deprioritised social reader apps in 2012, the platform was abandoned. Instant Articles – an in-application news content hosting feature – suffered a similar fate, it was abandoned in 2017 when Facebook’s restrictions around the content was affecting subscription conversions and ad revenue for the publishers using the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, Facebook decreased the presence of news in users’ personal feed from 5% to 4% to prioritize content from friends and family. This was Facebook deprioritizing news when it remained a peripheral element of the social network. The introduction of the News Tab, in a time when Facebook is more comfortably able to expand its proposition, speaks to Facebook’s newer strategy of prioritizing user-centricity across all of the platform’s experiences. The quote below, found on Facebook’s media page, is indicative of the platform’s shift to bring news into the fold of more personal experiences:</p>



<p>“Our goal with News Feed is to show you the stories that matter most to you, every time you visit Facebook. Your News Feed is a personalised, ever-changing collection of photos, videos, links and updates from the friends, family, <strong>businesses and news sources</strong> that you’ve connected to on Facebook.”</p>





<p>
<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Connectors and the tipping point for information dissemination in social networks</h3>



<p>In his magnum opus, The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell introduces the actors within a network who all have a role to play in the dissemination of information within a network. He references the ‘maven’ – a person who is innately knowledgeable or pursues knowledge and information, the ‘salesman’ – a person with the innate ability to convince others and ‘connector’ – a person with vast social reach and a predisposition for connecting others together.</p>



<p>“But in the case of Connectors, their ability to span many different worlds is a function of something intrinsic to their personality, some combination of curiosity, self-confidence, sociability, and energy.”</p>



<p>Gladwell’s litany on Lois Weisberg, a socialite in 1950s Chicago, is demonstrative of the power of ‘connectors’ to marry information from disparate ends of a network into cohesive and emphatic outcomes.</p>



<p>“if you looked harder at Weisberg’s life you could probably subdivide her experiences into fifteen or twenty worlds… The point about Connectors is that by having a foot in so many different worlds, they have the effect of bringing them all together.</p>



<p>“I [Lois Weisberg] said, do you know anyone in Chicago interested in talking to Arthur Clarke. He said, yeah, Isaac Asimov is in town.”… This is in some ways the archetypal Lois Weisberg story. First, she reaches out to somebody, to someone outside her world. Then, equally important, that person responds to her.”</p>



<p>Extrapolating to modern social networks, the concept of the ‘connector’ is very much still at the heart of information dissemination – where the networking platforms themselves are now the connector – democratising access to information and reach for their millions of users.</p>

    <p>You’ve likely experienced it: “You’re above and beyond everything we’re asking. There’s no promotion this round but all you need to do is <strong>__</strong>_”. Insert a semi-important but not absolutely necessary thing. Even worse if it’s something you’re really not good at.</p>

<p>One of the most demotivating things that an organization or manager can do is requiring “perfection” for a promotion. It’s a problem with two main dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s incommensurate with the value being added to the business.</li>
  <li>Perfection is subjective.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="incommensurate-with-value-add">Incommensurate with Value-Add</h2>

<p>Ultimately all performance comes down to one thing: how much value are you adding to the business? Examples of where forcing perfection gets things out of whack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I coded up a feature that brought in $10M to the business this year. I wasn’t promoted because they said I don’t speak enough in meetings.</li>
  <li>I saved the company from collapse because I was the only one who knew how to debug the system when it was melting. I wasn’t promoted because they said I show up too late every day.</li>
  <li>I identified a winning strategy for the entire business that drove us to another echelon of success. I wasn’t promoted because my design docs have typos.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that matters is the value being added to the business. There are nuances where behavior can set bad examples or cause issues for others, but that detracts from value added to the business and should be considered. The unfortunate and unbelievably common case is that some sort of benign missing strength is held against people.</p>

<h2 id="perfection-is-subjective">Perfection is Subjective</h2>

<p>When managers go down the rabbit whole of chasing perfect promotions they’re much more likely to be biased. In reality, most people’s internal picture of a perfect candidate for a promotion is something like “what did I look like when I got promoted?” That’s often the closest image a manager has of what a promotion at that level looks like.</p>

<p>In mild cases you get things like “when I got promoted I had to walk in the snow to work, uphill both ways.”</p>

<p>In more severe cases you get things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Men who don’t promote women because they’re not “aggressive enough” or they “don’t speak up enough”</li>
  <li>Extroverts who don’t promote introverts because they don’t like public speaking.</li>
  <li>Non-parents who don’t promote parents because they don’t work until midnight in the office.</li>
</ul>

<p>Promote people based on impact to the business, not their style of delivery.  Don’t hold people down because they deliver value in a way that isn’t comfortable, known, or practiced by you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In promotions and growth, focus more on amplifying strengths than fixing “weaknesses”.  You’ll find it’s much easier and much more fruitful to have people play to their strengths.</p>

<p>Promote imperfect people - that’s all you’ve got.</p>

<p>As a kid, there was nothing better than getting a new Klutz book (ok, maybe a Super Nintendo game). But unlike a replay of <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, these Klutz books require no nostaglia goggles. Here's why I think they're magic:</p>
<h3>Klutz books are spiral-bound</h3>
<p>Books for learning stuff should be able to open up and stay flat. The old 1980s computer manuals for computers like the Commodore VIC-20, the Commodore 64, and <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/my-new-old-apple-iie-computer">my new old Apple IIe</a> knew this much -- their manuals were spiral-bound and spell-binding.</p>
<p>So, why don't we see more spiral-bound books? Without knowing that much about printing costs, I imagine they're more expensive. Also, they do look slightly worse on a bookshelf, especially if you're going for that 'grammable color pattern look (so, just don't do this).</p>
<h3>Klutz books come with the required materials</h3>
<p>The little "paper" football that came with the <em>Table Top Football: A Guide to the Classic Lunchroom Sport</em> was a revered grail of mine. I remember that my dad took a sheetrock knife and made a small incision in its plastic case attached to the book so that the football could be slid in and out, with the explicit rule that the football must either be <em>in the case</em> or <em>being used in a game</em>. This is much like the inexorable <a href="https://hypercritical.co/">Jon Siracusan</a> rule for Airpods. Obey, or the Airpods will be instantly lost forever.</p>

<p>Side note that there are some people who just love making small cuts into the plastic cases for things, so that you easily return them to their "pristine" condition. I, myself, don't understand these people. I like wripping these cases to shreds instantly.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to these Klutz books. By including juggling bean bags, yarn for friendship bracelets, or a real harmonica, Klutz Press books gave you everything you needed to get your hands dirty. "Active learning", or something like that. Playing = learning. Etcetera.</p>
<h3>Klutz books have hilarious art</h3>

<p>Just look at that paper airplane stuck in the teacher's hair!</p>
<p>Klutz had a particular art direction that spoke to me as a child. The goofy people in their guides made me feel like it was <em>okay to be a klutz</em>. </p>
<p>Which brings me to the most important reason that Klutz books are special.</p>
<h3>Klutz books embrace the Beginner's Mindset</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities. In the experts mind there are few - Shunryū Suzuki</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone starts out as a klutz. No matter what. That means it's okay to make mistakes. It can even be funny - in fact, it should be funny! Because it's fun to learn new things.</p>
<p>Being a klutz, making mistakes, having fun, this is the path to wonderful things.</p>
<h2>Who's behind Klutz Press?</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klutz_Press">Wikipedia</a>, Klutz Press was founded in 1977 by three friends in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>The apocryphal story is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassidy_(author)">John Cassidy</a>, a recent Stanford grad working as a high school teacher, brought a bucket of tennis balls and some hand-written instructions for juggling to his remedial reading class. The laughs and learning and genuine reading and genuine juggling that ensued inspired Cassidy and his buddies from Stanford to publish <em>Juggling For the Complete Klutz</em> under their new company: Klutz Press.</p>
<p><em>Juggling For the Complete Klutz</em> has sold over 2.5 million copies. But Googling for Klutz Press is somewhat challenging these days. In 2000, Klutz was acquired by a company called Nelvana for $74 million, and in 2002 Klutz became a subsidiary of Scholastic, Inc. This latter merger is a good match in my book, as the Scholastic Book Fair also ranks heavily in my childhood memories of learning to love reading. The only other company I'd feel comfortable with owning Klutz Press is Pizza Hut - thanks to their delicious <a href="https://www.bookitprogram.com/">BOOK-IT!</a> reading program, which brought me dozens of delicious cheese Personal Pan Pizzas during the 1990s. My parents couldn't decide if they hated or loved Pizza Hut for this.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Klutz.com redirects to the Scholastic website, and it's unclear what's out-of-print or available from the voluminous Klutz catalog. So if you do find a genuine Klutz book and kit, I'd snag them quickly!</p>
<p>Luckily, I was able to find a good interview with Cassidy from 1995 on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616182712/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1154/is_n5_v83/ai_16857996/">Wayback Machine</a>. In 1995, Klutz was at the height of their power and influence in kid's minds. Here are some choice quotes from Cassidy:</p>
<p>On their company culture at Klutz Press:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In terms of being laid back, we take a back seat to nobody."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On their "teaching" style:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Talk to a kid about fun and math, and it's like you're talking about two different sides of the universe. If we can climb this mountain, there's nothing we can't tackle."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kids don't learn all that much by listening or reading. They need to get elbow-deep in a subject and touch it, feel it, and smell it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of Seymour Paypert's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465046746/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whatrocks09-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0465046746&amp;linkId=2949aefc36d4bd9d9f632170d2ac23de">Mindstorms book</a> about his work with LOGO and the Turtle machine (you can check out <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/mindstorms">my notes</a> on the book)</p>
<p>The article explains a bit about their business:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of Klutz' books sell for less than $20</li>
<li>They can have low prices because: (1) the books (with their accompanying "stuff") are viewed as more than books - but "toys/novelties", so more retailers than booksellers are interesting in carring them, and (2) they do large printing runs (150k copies vs the usual 10k for children's books)</li>
</ul>
<p>And, importantly, the final word from Cassidy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can hang a spoon off my nose," Cassidy boasts, "and I take a lot of pride in that".</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Create wonderful things, be good, have fun</h2>
<p>I just wanted to write that out again. I've decided to adopt their credo as my own life motto.</p>
<p>I learned so much from Klutz Press as a kid. I'm still learning now. Thank you, John Cassidy and team, for making these wonderful books. My juggling is finally starting to get pretty good, but I'll always be a klutz.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><article><header></header><a id="article"></a><p>The first blog post I wrote was lost, the oldest one I kept is from September 8, 2005. It’s been almost 15 years and I am very happy to see how much better I got in writing and in understanding the world.</p><p>Keeping a site like this is not just about writing and choosing photos. It takes curation and revising how things are organised to make sure nothing gets lost.</p><p>One of the things that I didn’t want to lose were the comments from all the amazing people that have stopped by and given some of their time to show appreciation or disagreement. The last one is always a good opportunity to learn and make sure your beliefs are still sound and logic.</p><p>So I dove into the database of comments, finding some of them lost and misplaced because the website’s posts changed links.</p><p>Some of the links were broken and had to be pieced together; others were wrong and their comments gone.</p><p>I believed I saved all of the comments and in the process drove down an avenue of memories and hindsight on fragile the web we built is.</p><h2 id="photos-and-images">Photos and Images</h2><p>Remember flickr ? It’s still alive and running but not everyone I knew back in 2007 still uses it. A lot of the photos you see in my old posts come from there, but the attribution link is broken because the user decided to delete their account. Some are still working, but the photographer moved on, or passed away.</p><p>Those links are still here for historical reasons, and because it is important to show that those photos have owners, talented people that were kind to share their work without asking for return.</p><p>And the problem doesn’t stop at the attributions of copyright that land in a “Page Not Found” message. Even the files seem to deteriorate.</p><p>As technology evolved, we got better cameras and better monitors. Photos that were pristine now look faded or pixelated. Storage was also a problem. Keeping a website means storing all the files and for a 25 year old with a small budget that meant saving every cent. So I made sure to keep a good balance in image quality and file size. It didn’t do an amazing job resisting the test of time.</p><h2 id="files-and-websites">Files and websites</h2><p>Websites have a life cycle, and some of the links I found no longer work. Google hates broken links as much as I do, but I also hate to be unjust to the reader. Links that point to other resources, that no longer exist, are still present in the articles I wrote. Again, for the reason of proof of existence.</p><p>I have known of this problem for a while now, and for that reason I got into the habit of saving every file that I use for reference. PDFs, videos, images, music, etc. They may not be used in the article, because there is a link to the original version or author, but if one day that link stops working, the value won’t be lost with it. (This is why this site amounts to over 9 GB)</p><p>Back in the day, like many, this site was powered by WordPress. It had it’s own comment system. Then disqus<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> appeared, and I tried it for a while. After I stopped using WordPress, I kept the same comment service running. This was when all the links changed to improve the Search Engine Rankings, and a lot of comments got lost in the database.</p><p>Remember Path? How about any of these?</p><ul><li>Delicious</li><li>FriendFeed</li><li>Google Wave</li><li>Jaiku</li><li>MySpace</li><li>Orkut</li><li>Posterous</li><li>Shelfari</li><li>Vine</li></ul><p>The list could go on, the point is that they have disappeared and some good content along with them.</p><p>And a social network doesn’t have to vanish for you to lose access to what’s there. The owner of a piece of content may lock their profile for any number of reasons and you or your readers won’t be able to see it ever again.</p><p>Legal action on copyright infringement can also take away access to something that was public. Just think about what happens when a YouTube video is found to be at fault with the guidelines.</p><h2 id="we-have-built-a-fragile-web">We have built a fragile web</h2><p>And we are making some of the same mistakes. Think about how many Social Networks use URL shorteners. What happens if Bit.ly decides to close and all those links stop working?</p><p>The websites that we are building use content management software like WordPress, Drupal and others. Will they withstand the test of time or will we have to migrate them to a new system at some point? Trick question, it won’t. Until then we can stay true to our mission and keep on publishing.</p><p>If you were hoping for a bright ending, please don’t give up just now.</p><h2 id="fragile-and-amazing">Fragile and Amazing</h2><p>Through these ordeals and all the experiments we have been running in the way we can communicate among ourselves, we saw a lot of good come out of it. Creators that could have gone unnoticed for ages found a spotlight.</p><p>Social Networks have found business models that are more or less stable without infringing on our privacy. Take <a href="https://patreon.com/">Patreon</a> and <a href="https://etsy.com/">Etsy</a> as an example.</p><p>We have built an economy and services that were important when dealing with the covid-19 lock down.</p><p>And if we fight fake news, we are able to see a variety of important perspectives about what is going on in the world. We can connect with a Human who lives across the ocean and who happens to play guitar.</p><p>The web we built is a living thing and is faced with challenges today. It grew too fast, got infected by fake news and scams. In the meantime, it helped us see what is wrong in our society through the Arab Spring and the Black Lives Matter movements.</p><p>It’s up to us to curate and educate. We should try to make sure that we publish with quality in mind and take steps to see it live on as much as possible. And we have to educate each other on how to use the web and how not to be a victim of misinformation and fake news.</p><p>That’s the only way that we can make sure that communities like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/">Random Acts of Kindness</a> stay alive to serve as inspiration on how amazing the web can be.</p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/VeUSCLJrLf4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Photo by jason leung"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-1px;fill:#fff" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><title>Unsplash Logo</title><path d="M20.8 18.1c0 2.7-2.2 4.8-4.8 4.8s-4.8-2.1-4.8-4.8 2.2-4.8 4.8-4.8c2.7.1 4.8 2.2 4.8 4.8zm11.2-7.4v14.9c0 2.3-1.9 4.3-4.3 4.3h-23.4c-2.4.0-4.3-1.9-4.3-4.3v-15c0-2.3 1.9-4.3 4.3-4.3H8l.8-2.3c.4-1.1 1.7-2 2.9-2h8.6c1.2.0 2.5.9 2.9 2l.8 2.4h3.7c2.4.0 4.3 1.9 4.3 4.3zm-8.6 7.5c0-4.1-3.3-7.5-7.5-7.5-4.1.0-7.5 3.4-7.5 7.5s3.3 7.5 7.5 7.5c4.2-.1 7.5-3.4 7.5-7.5z"></path></svg></span><span>jason leung</span></a><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Disqus is a worldwide blog comment hosting service for web sites and online communities that use a networked platform.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/demo.gif"></p><p><em>See bigger version of the above demo as .gif <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwplotka/bingo/master/examples/bingo-demo.gif" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a></em></p><p>In this blog post, I would like to introduce <a href="https://github.com/bwplotka/bingo" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>bingo</code></a>, a simple and efficient CLI (Command Line Interface) Tool ,
I wrote for managing versions of Go binaries that are required for your project development.</p><p><strong>TL;DR: <code>bingo</code> is built on top of the native <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Go Modules dependency management</a> and in my opinion,
it solves the hard problem of flexible versioning developer tools written in Go. It already improves our integration with tools in the
production-grade projects like <a href="https://thanos.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Thanos</a>. Check it out and contribute!🤗</strong></p><figure><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/ring.svg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/automation.gif" alt="This is NOT what you want to do in your project..."><figcaption>This is NOT what you want to do in your project...</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Automation is <strong>amazing</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Especially nowadays, all projects, whether open or closed source, use at least bunch of tools to automate some tasks. For example in Go community
you can see following popular tools:</p><ul><li>Running tests: <code>go test</code>, <code>go test -race</code></li><li>Benchmarks: <code>go bench</code>, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/benchcmp?tab=doc" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>benchcmp</code></a>, <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>benchstat</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra/tree/master/funcbench" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>funcbench</code></a></li><li>Auto formatters: <code>go fmt</code>, <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>goimports</code></a></li><li>Static analysis: <code>go vet</code>, <a href="https://github.com/golang/lint" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>lint</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>golangci-lint</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/fatih/faillint" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>faillint</code></a></li><li>Documentation Generators: <a href="https://github.com/campoy/embedmd" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>embedmd</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/tree/master/scripts/cfggen" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">docs auto generators</a></li><li>Build tools: <a href="https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>goreleaser</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/promu" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>promu</code></a></li><li>Other projects (!) you want to run integrations tests against.</li><li>…and millions of other tools: <a href="https://gohugo.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">website builder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/raviqqe/liche" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">link check</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/tree/master/scripts/copyright" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">copyright checker</a>, protobuf + gRPC generation, jsonnet generators and bundlers, <a href="https://github.com/brancz/gojsontoyaml" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">YAML tools</a>, etc…</li></ul><p>I could list even more, and to be honest, I am so amazed with the amount of things we have <strong>for free</strong>! They help to maintain a very good quality of the
project, and saves an enormous amount of time.</p><p>So what projects do? They obviously tend to use gazillion of those tools, reusing amazing ideas and solid code that someone else in open source wrote
and maintains every day with love.</p><p>That’s great, but how many times you have cloned the project, want to contribute run <code>make</code> and see things like:</p><pre><code>$ make 
zsh: command not found: clang
zsh: command not found: goimports
zsh: command not found: goreleaser
zsh: command not found: hugo
</code></pre><p>And that’s even a nice error! Usually, you get a confusing error that does not make any sense like:</p><pre><code>$ make 
dafg;lkghd;lsfjgpdsjgp 
zsh: exit 1
</code></pre><p>…because you have the required tool installed but <strong>WRONG version</strong> of it!</p><p>Now, if you want to be a nice project to work with, you give a hand and either print meaningful errors and tells how
to install a dependant tool and what version of it, in case of users not having a tool or have the wrong version installed. This is
a step in a good direction, but in my opinion <strong>we can do much better.</strong></p><p>In all projects I maintain, we tried hard to be even more explicit and helpful by ensuring our scripts will install all dependencies
needed manually. We also largely leverage a good, old school <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>Makefile</code></a> for tasks like this.
It is as easy as:</p><pre><code>DEPENDENCY_TOOL = $(GOBIN)/tool 

task: $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)
	@do task using $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)

# Will be built only if $(GOBIN)/tool file is missing.
$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL):
	@install tool
</code></pre><h2 id="always-pin-the-version">Always Pin the Version</h2><p>The above example works great, but obviously will not always work if you require a <strong>certain</strong> version of the tool.
If you would remember only one thing from this blog post, remember this:</p><blockquote><p>You really want to pin version of ALL the tools your project depends on!</p></blockquote><p>Why? Well, the quick answer is that versioning is hard and things are constantly moving. Tools are being improved and changed every day.</p><p>Trust me, the last things you want to do is to investigate why CI constantly fails or have the spam of bugs and issues, about someone, somewhere
being unable to build your project because of an obsolete, or a too new tool that was required.</p><p>We can easily extend our above <code>Makefile</code> example to improve resiliency and development experience by pinning tools’ versions
and maintaining immutable binary files.</p><p>Immutable binary names safeguard us from accidental usage of the wrong version that might have been installed outside. There is nothing worse than chasing a non-existing issue, only to realize you use the wrong version.</p><p>Without immutability, we would have to checksum and verify all build to ensure the correct version which is doable, just a bit more complex to maintain. (BTW, how nice it would
be to have CLI <code>man</code> equivalent for printing <code>version</code>! (: ).</p><p>We can achieve immutable binary names, as follows:</p><pre><code>DEPENDENCY_TOOL_VERSION = v1.124.3
DEPENDENCY_TOOL        = $(GOBIN)/tool-$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL_VERSION)

task: $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)
   @do task using $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL) 

# Will be built only if $(GOBIN)/tool-v1.124.3 file is missing.
$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL):
   @install tool@$(DEPENDENCY_TOOL_VERSION)
   @cp tool $(DEPENDENCY_TOOL)
</code></pre><p>Version pinning was easy, right? Now, fun stuff, how can we reliably install those tools in the required version? Let’s look at possible solutions:</p><h3 id="commit-built-dependant-binaries-straight-to-your-vcs-e-g-git">Commit built, dependant binaries straight to your VCS (e.g git) 😱</h3><p>This is usually <strong>a bad idea</strong>. While it might work for you, other users would probably want to run your software on different
machines with different architectures and different operating systems, etc. And even if you would host all permutations of
each required binary, each can “weight” from 10-100MB which is most likely too much for common VCSs (e.g <code>git</code>). This
will make it extremely slow, if not impossible to clone your project. Plus there is no merge conflict resolution that
works well for binary files.</p><p>Hope I made this clear: Please don’t do this. (:</p><h3 id="use-package-manager">Use Package Manager</h3><p>Now, this is what’s usually recommended, and it looks innocent.</p><figure><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/pkg.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/pkg.jpg" alt="Use Package Manager they said..."><figcaption>Use Package Manager they said...</figcaption></figure><p>The idea would be to use the package manager available on the user’s OS e.g. <code>apt</code> <code>yum</code>, etc.</p><p>I will stop here because in practice this is impossible. Let’s look at the following reasons:</p><ul><li>While there are standard package managers for major operating systems, some people might not use it (you can disable it).
On top of there are 99% chances that the amazing tool you need is not packaged there or the version available is extremely old.</li><li>There are other custom pkg managers like <code>snap</code>, <code>brew</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>pacman</code> <code>NuGet</code> <code>pip</code> but not everybody has them
preinstalled, so it’s <code>chicken &amp; egg</code> problem.</li><li>Most of the tools work only with tools written in a certain programming language that is NOT Go (:</li></ul><h3 id="curl-released-binaries">Curl Released Binaries</h3><p>You can probably get quite far with just automatic <code>curl</code> of pre-built binary against the certain operating system, released on
GitHub by authors. Unfortunately, again, in practice, not many projects maintain that. Especially, for a small tool, it’s an overkill.</p><h3 id="pre-build-container-images">Pre-Build Container Images</h3><p>That is quite a fancy solution and has many benefits (portability, isolation, etc). This is great but comes with the tradeoff of
long and non-trivial bake times, overhead, and latency when running a job inside a container.</p><p>On top of that, you have to most likely share files between guests and hosts, which is always clunky and problematic (permissions, paths, file ownership, etc).</p><h3 id="solution-pin-certain-version-of-source-code-instead">Solution: Pin Certain version of Source Code Instead!</h3><p>Have you spotted a certain pattern among all the tools I mentioned in <a href="#automate-all-the-things">Automate all the things!</a> section?</p><p><strong>Yes! They all are written in <a href="https://golang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Go</a>.</strong> The Go community believes in automation, so the amount of tools that was produced is <strong>impressing</strong>. And those are NOT only useful for Go projects but actually any project of it. Tools written in Go tend to be extremely reliable and very easy to maintain and fix. You should try writing your own tooling in Go as well, check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxc8B2fjDvY" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">this amazing video</a> from our friend <a href="https://twitter.com/fatih" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Fatih</a> ❤️ on how to write language tool (e.g linter).</p><p>So, if we assume all our tools will be written in Go, does this simplify our life? The answer is: Yes!</p><h4 id="rant-about-go-modules">Rant About Go Modules</h4><figure><img src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/gomod.jpg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://bwplotka.dev/images/blog/bingo/gomod.jpg" alt="Calling Go Modules for help!"><figcaption>Calling Go Modules for help!</figcaption></figure><p>A few years ago Go Team released its sophisticated answer for dependency problem in Go Community: <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Go Modules</a>.
It (usually) works and it’s quite amazing for many reasons:</p><ul><li>It is decentralized. Anyone can publish their code, anywhere.</li><li>Finally, Go projects do not need to be inside <code>$GOPATH</code></li><li>Supports using multiple different (major) versions of the same module in the same build.</li><li>It is ~secure. HTTPS and SSH are the default and <code>go.sum</code> exists to verify checksums.</li><li>Supports caching proxies/mirroring.</li><li>Semantic Import Versioning</li><li>It is an official tool, which means finally a single standard. They are also built-in other Go tools.</li></ul><p>But let me say this loud and clear: <strong>It’s also far from being perfect.</strong> Consider the following reasons:</p><ul><li>It assumes everyone uses <strong>semantic versioning</strong> properly.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Halo Go Team, can I have your attention for a second? 🤗</p></blockquote><p><strong>99.9% of Go projects do NOT use semantic versioning properly and NEVER will be!</strong></p><p>It’s because maintainers either have no time, don’t care or they simply semantically version their APIs or part of packages only.

discussion on this matter in Prometheus (30k stars’ project) mailing list.</a></p><p>This leads to most of the problems users experience. You can’t escape from a huge amount of <code>replace</code> hacks.
Plus, instead of making it easier for such use cases, Go blames others. ):</p><p>This is also why <code>bingo</code> was needed and why I built it.</p><ul><li><p>We build and import packages, but version modules. If you add an overhead of maintaining modules and releasing it (see the above issue),
it’s clear that maintaining multiple modules is not a good answer.

way of doing a major release and still support multi-version of the same dependency. I hope it will get redesigned someday.</p></li><li><p>Vendoring is allowed and sometimes even (😱) recommended. This is opinionated and controversial, but <strong>why would you use <code>git</code> if you want

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>If you go to the Wikipedia page for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_and_Clyde_Canal">Forth and Clyde Canal</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Siberian_Railway">Trans-Siberian Railway</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_line_(London_Underground)">the London Circle Line</a> you may notice that they all have route maps with a similar visual style.</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption>A route map of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Subway">Glasgow subway</a> from Wikipedia.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How do the many Wikipedia contributors create all these similar-looking maps? The answer is <strong>BSicons</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="bsicons">BSicons</h2>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/BSicon">BSicons</a> are the building blocks for these route maps. They are an SVG icon set that Wikipedia contributors use to map railways, subways, footpaths, waterways, cycle paths and roads. Any transport system that they want to produce a simplified schematic for.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/glasgow_subway_bsicon_grid.png" alt="A diagram of the Glasgow subway. The diagram is made up of square icons in a grid which is highlighted">
  
  <figcaption>The Glasgow subway map is made up of many BSicons icons. Most are square, but there are a few half-width icons too that allow for a more compact map.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The icons were first used on the German Wikipedia which is why most of their names are based on German words.
‘BSicons’ comes from the German word Bahnstrecken (Railway Lines).</p>

<p>Each icon has a shorthand name that follows some conventions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>Root</strong> picks a given icon such as a station or a crossing.</li>
  <li><strong>Prefixes</strong> change it’s status, such as if it’s underground or disused.</li>
  <li><strong>Suffixes</strong> denote direction and positioning, such as if it curves to the left or is one way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the icons:</p>

<div>
  <header>
    <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/BSicon_STR.svg">
    <h3>STR</h3>
  </header>
  <p>A rail line</p><p>
  Root: <b>STR</b> → <b>STR</b>eke (line)
</p></div>

<div>
  <header>
    <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/BSicon_KRZu.svg">
    <h3>KRZu</h3>
  </header>
  <p>Two rail lines crossing with one going under the other</p><p>
  Root: <b>KRZ</b> → <b>KR</b>eu<b>Z</b>ung (crossing)<br>
  Suffix: <b>u</b> → <b>u</b>nter (under)
</p></div>

<div>
  <header>
    <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/BSicon_STR%2Bl.svg">
    <h3>STR+l</h3>
  </header>
  <p>A rail line that comes from the left</p><p>
  Root: <b>STR</b> → <b>STR</b>eke (line)<br>
  Suffix: <b>+l</b> → <b>+</b> (from), <b>l</b>inks (left)</p><p> Directions are relative to the line (which is drawn from top to bottom) rather than the page. This is why the suffix says the line is from the left rather than going to the right.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <header>
    <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/BSicon_utkBHF%2B1.svg">
    <h3>utkBHF+1</h3>
  </header>
  <p>A station on an underground light rail line that comes from the first corner</p><p>
  Root: <b>BHF</b>  →  <b>B</b>ahn<b>H</b>o<b>F</b> (station)<br>
  Prefix: <b>utk</b> → <b>u</b>-bahn, <b>t</b>unnel, <b>k</b>ombination (Compound)</p><p>the <b>k</b> denotes that the icon is for drawing compound turns that span four columns of icons.</p>
</div>

<div>

<div>
  <header>
    <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/BSicon_tSTRa.svg">
    <h3>tSTRa</h3>
  </header>
  <p>A rail line that goes into a tunnel</p><p>
  Root: <b>STR</b> → <b>STR</b>eke (line)
  Prefix: <b>t</b> → <b>t</b>unnel<br>
  Suffix: <b>a</b> → <b>a</b>nfang (start)

<div>
  <header>
    <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/BSicon_mhKRZho.svg">
    <h3>mhKRZho</h3>
  </header>
  <p>An elevated rail line going over a light elevated rail line</p><p>
  Root: <b>KRZ</b> → <b>KR</b>eu<b>Z</b>ung (crossing)<br>
  Prefix: <b>mh</b> → <b>m</b>ischbetrieb (mixed), <b>h</b>ochbahn (high level/elevated)<br>
  Suffix: <b>ho</b> → <b>h</b>ochbahn (high level/elevated), <b>o</b>verpass
</p></div>

<p>These are a few examples. The <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/BSicon/Catalogue">BSicon Catalogue</a> explains many more conventions.</p>

<h2 id="building-maps">Building maps</h2>

<p>To help put all these icons together into a map Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Routemap">Routemap template</a>. The template defines a syntax to provide shortcuts to build maps.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://chriszetter.com/assets/bsicons/glasgow_subway_bsicons_row.png" alt="A diagram of the Glasgow subway loop that shows one line of icons highlighted.">
  
  <figcaption>Routemaps are made up of rows of icons </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here is the code used to generate the single highlighted row:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{Subway|Hillhead}}! !\utkBHF+1\\\utkBHF+4\tSTRa~~{{Subway|St George's Cross}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The syntax is a bit cryptic and uses the shorthand icons names we saw above. Here is what each part does:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code>{{Subway|Hillhead}}</code></strong> is a link to the Wkipedia article about this station</li>
  <li><strong><code>! !</code></strong> separates the text on the left from the icons</li>
  <li><strong><code>\utkBHF+1</code></strong> is the first icon a light rail station in a tunnel that curves</li>
  <li><strong><code>\\</code></strong> adds in two empty icon-sized spaces</li>
  <li><strong><code>\utkBHF+4</code></strong> adds in the second icon, similar to the last but towards top-left corner</li>
  <li><strong><code>\tSTRa</code></strong> adds in the third icon, a start of a stretch of tunnel</li>
  <li><strong><code>~~~</code></strong> separates the icons from the text on the right</li>
  <li><strong><code>{{Subway|St George's Cross}}</code></strong>  a link to the Wikipedia article about this station.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hundreds-of-thousands-of-icons">Hundreds of thousands of icons</h2>

<p>There are <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=File%3A+intitle%3A%22BSicon%22+intitle%3A%2FBSicon+.%2A%5C.svg%2F&amp;ns0=1&amp;ns6=1&amp;ns12=1&amp;ns14=1&amp;ns100=1&amp;ns106=1">more than 290,000 BSicons</a> out there due to an explosive number of combinations needed for different colours, rotations, intersections, bridges, curves, embankments and tunnels. Many obscure BSicons might only be used a few times across Wikipedia (like <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BSicon_BHFABZgl%2Bl.svg">BHFABZgl+l</a>)<sup><a href="#fn:triangle">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Each icon is simple, so simple many of them are marked as ineligible for copyright on Wikipedia. Together the icons can combine to map more complex systems.
Seeing how these icons can be combined inspired me to make a <strong><a href="https://mapmaker.chriszetter.com/">random BSicon map generator</a></strong>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve been trying alternatives to Google services lately. No offense to Google. I just used their services uncritically for years. Now I want to evaluate them against their competitors. For example, <a href="https://www.bitlog.com/2020/03/06/duckduckgo-is-good-enough-for-regular-use/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">I now use DuckDuckGo instead of Google.</a></p>
<p>Basecamp released HEY recently. It is a privacy-focused email client that aims to give power back to the user. This sounded like something that I might appreciate. Every Gmail account I’ve owned uses a similar combination of features. Priority inbox, some specific settings that must be checked, a bunch of filters, etc. It’s always the result of iteration and resignation. It never feels quite right. It’s easy for me to believe that an email client could provide me a “wow” experience by encoding my workflow into the UI, and providing an “I’ve never known it before, but I’ve always wanted that!” moment.</p>
<p>I got a launch invite and decided to try it for a week.</p>
<p>Let’s cut to the chase: HEY is a good email client, but it’s not a good fit for my relationship with email. I’m not going to pay for it. But this post isn’t a hit piece. Negativity is cheap and lazy. I’m going to explain the value that HEY provides. I will also explain why it wasn’t a good fit for me.</p>

<p>I forwarded my personal Gmail into my <a href="https://hey.com/">hey.com</a> account for one week. I got ~120 emails from ~80 senders. I only sent a handful of emails. This matches my personal email load for a typical week.</p>
<p>I kept a running Google Doc with notes. I especially wanted to split my negative notes into a few piles: bugs, dislikes, and mismatches.</p>
<p>I want to focus on mismatches in this post. When did HEY make me feel uncertain or afraid? When was I fighting it?</p>
<p>I’m not going to mention bugs. Do you really want to hear about a problem with using keyboard shortcuts to scroll through email? They probably fixed it before I published this post.</p>
<p>I’m not going to tell you about nitpicky choices that I didn’t like. This post would become a monument to my own change aversion. “The information density is too low! I can only see 9 emails on my laptop!” Jake. Chill. You’ll get used to it.</p>
<p>Anyways, I used HEY on a variety of platforms. I used the iOS client on my iPhone X. On desktop, I accessed it through Firefox on my 15″ Macbook Pro and my Windows gaming machine.</p>

I wore my mask for both.</figcaption></figure>

<p>I like HEY’s privacy stance. HEY explicitly blocks pixel trackers and loads images through a proxy. It will also “name and shame” companies that send emails with trackers by putting a special binoculars icon over the email.</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/J4_gTcVhCBBrzFWcXv0bWMaRyeUOkgmeuhY5fWewv-wzvCf98oK3pt7eVzDpF2JZarDMRGDmTzaYV32i1hWmCcCJqyKgw4F_OLd4X8wwx7NW5Lk9HfFAU5A1W0upESqUtxVhi6hp" alt="An example showing a pixel tracker notification from Etsy"><figcaption><em>An example showing a pixel tracker notification</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some digital marketers don’t like this. Mailing list health is an important metric. If they can’t track open rates, then they can’t know how people are “progressing through the funnel” of reading their emails.</p>
<p>Fine by me. It’s hard to imagine receiving any benefit from telling a remote server, “psst, I opened your email.” I like that people can opt-out of ads with ad blockers. I also like that HEY focuses on opting-out of tracking pixels.</p>
<p>I didn’t care about the “name and shame” part of their pixel tracking. I’d be happy if they just had a counter saying “We stopped 531 tracking pixels this month.” I’m not interested in learning who sent an email with trackers. I just like that the filtering works.</p>

<p>HEY requires you to “screen in” every email recipient. When someone sends you an email for the first time, HEY shows a button asking you to “screen them in.” You will receive all future emails from them if you say “yes.” You will never get their email if you say “no.”</p>
<p>Do you receive a lot of unsolicited email? Promotional email you never read? Recruiter spam? Then you should seriously consider using HEY. Imagine saying “no thank you” to a spammy recruiter and never thinking about their emails again. Imagine the promotional emails never grabbing your attention. Imagine opening your email every day and only seeing the emails you want to see. That seems to be HEY’s vision, and I like it.</p>
<p>I interacted with the Screener a lot. I received email from ~80 different senders this week. I screened five of them out.</p>
<p>I don’t receive much unsolicited email. I aggressively unsubscribe from promotional mailers. I turn off email notifications that I don’t want. I sometimes delete services if I get too much email as a result of being a member. As a sidebar, deleting my LinkedIn account was a huge email quality-of-life improvement. The constant parade of recruiters dropped to manageable levels. You should consider it.</p>
<p>I spent lots of time considering some of the Screener decisions. I used to have a Netlify project that I have since deleted. I don’t need to receive email from them now. Maybe I should say “no” to a promotional email that they sent me. But what if I want to use Netlify in the future? I liked Netlify. I might use it again. Would my “no” still apply? I would be missing email that I need to receive. What if I lose my job in the recession and Netlify contacted me about a job opportunity? Would it be screened out? I had this kind of debate repeatedly throughout the week. Who is a sender? Is it a single email address? Is it a company? Is it an individual who could be represented by multiple email addresses? What about catch-all addresses like noreply? When can I safely reject email? I only felt safe using the Screener in a few narrow cases. In cases like Netlify, I screened them in and unsubscribed from the mailing list.</p>
<p>I’d like to make two caveats to this section. First: it seems that Gmail does not forward spam to HEY. I don’t know how good HEY’s spam filtering is and I don’t know how important the Screener would be in relation to it. Second: I only used HEY for a week. The Screener was a constant presence in the beginning. It appeared less as the week went on. I imagine that it wouldn’t appear much next week.</p>

<p>When you screen an email into HEY, you can choose one of three categorizations.</p>
<p>The primary location is the Imbox. This is the <strong>IM</strong>portant <strong>BOX</strong>. It’s an intentional spelling, and is designed as an inversion of an email inbox. The logic goes like this: Other people get to decide when stuff appears in your inbox. You need to intervene to stop it. On the other hand, something only appears in your IMbox when you declare it IMportant enough. This means that you have reclaimed power over the email that you receive.</p>
<p>This is also why HEY provides The Feed and Paper Trail. These represent common email types that you may not need to see right away. This is designed to further improve the Imbox experience by moving these emails out of sight until you want to see them.</p>
<p>The Feed is “The place for newsletters, marketing emails, or anything you want to casually browse.” I put a word-of-the-day email, some Google Alerts, and some newsletters into The Feed. Instead of acting like an email inbox, it is designed to be a content reader. You can periodically skim this content. But it’s not front-and-center in your Imbox.</p>
<p>Paper Trail is “The place for receipts, confirmations, and other transactional emails you receive.” I put automated notifications into here: online order confirmations, credit card purchase notifications, Twitch’s “this streamer is now online” notifications, etc.</p>
<p>After using the categorization for a week, it was clear that I struggled with both of them. I receive a daily newsletter with lengthy emails (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">Money Stuff</a> by Matt Levine). It’s too big to read all at once during my workday. In practice, I sneak 5 minutes here, 10 minutes there. When it’s in The Feed, this means that it was not an email. Instead it’s a card that is slowly being pushed down by other things in The Feed. The later in the day I started reading it, the harder it becomes to complete it 5 minutes at a time. Maybe I’d move this specific newsletter out of The Feed. There’s not much left at this point. I’d have to keep polling to find when the two or three remaining things ended up in The Feed. Everything might as well be in the Imbox.</p>
<p>I also regretted putting many of my emails into Paper Trail. When I buy something, I want to see the purchase receipt Right Now. I also receive credit card alerts for every purchase I make. This helps me identify recurring purchases that I no longer need. When these are in my inbox, I can read and clear the notification immediately. When things are in Paper Trail, they don’t seem to have “Unread” markers. You need to scrutinize timestamps and dates to figure out what might be new. If my Amazon order ships, I want to say “Cool” and then delete the notification. I definitely want to see it.</p>
<p>I fought against this workflow all week. HEY does a good job of explaining its categorization system. But I struggled to live in it. I really just wanted everything to appear in the Imbox. This is the same reason that I stopped using the “Multiple Inbox” feature in Gmail: I’d rather stop unwanted emails at their source, instead of moving it into a separate low-frequency box.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is a good system that is a mismatch with my relationship with my emails. I don’t “casually browse” my newsletters, and I want to read all of my transaction receipts while my brain is still thinking about the purchase I just made.</p>

<p>There are other advanced features that I didn’t use, or used lightly.</p>
<p>Search worked well. I looked for a few things. I found what I was looking for.</p>
<p>HEY has a pair of features called “Reply Later” and “Reply Focus Mode.” This allows you to put off sending replies to emails. Later, you can enter a focused mode that allows you to reply to these specific emails without any UI distractions. I forwarded myself a few emails to put into here when I was experimenting with HEY, but I didn’t end up using the mode with any real seriousness. I don’t receive a ton of email in my personal account, so I don’t run into this problem much.</p>
<p>You can “Set aside” an email if you need to reference it. I can imagine needing this at work. If …</p></div></div>

<p>This Web site documents some moderately obscure computer graphics software history: a suite of animation products produced in the late 1980’s for the Atari ST personal computer platform. Although the fact is not widely known, this Atari software, published by a defunct computer magazine called Antic, directly preceded and led to the Autodesk 3D Studio and Discreet 3ds max products used by thousands of people today.</p>
<p>The articles herein basically comprise an oral history: the information is drawn from interviews and hands-on exploration of the software, running under emulation or on original equipment.</p>
<p>The site is organized into a chronological history, followed by in-depth discussions of each major product.</p>

<p>One of my little pet projects is a neurology book for psychologists, coaches and the like. What most people in these fields imagine about the brain is somewhere between perplexing, preposterous and potentially poisonous. (Seriously, I could tell you stories…) So I kind of wanted to write something like this for them.</p>
<p>Now I do consider it a tall order for me – I have some knowledge of neurology, but actually writing a SENSIBLE, understandable guidebook to neurology, with some practical applications too, that’s a challenge. (Senseless guidebooks to neurology are a dime a dozen, of course. In fact, I’ve walled in at least two people in one library, using only senseless pop-neurology books and as far I can tell, the rotting skeletons still haven’t been found. But then again the rotting corpse smell really doesn’t stand out much in most libraries I’ve been to, so I shouldn’t be surprised.)</p>
<p><a href="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg"><img src="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920.jpg 1920w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-1080x720.jpg 1080w, http://dissociativediaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/neuron-3567980_1920-610x407.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></p>
<p>But back to my main point. The great thing about trying to write a book like that, even attempting to prepare for doing it at one point in the future, when you know enough, is finding all the lovely little holes in how you’re telling the story to yourself. The teeny-tiny little jumps in understanding, the „lies-to-children”, the simplifications.</p>

<p>And one of these, for me, was how neurons get to connect.</p>

<p>And when I asked around, it turned out I wasn’t the only one missing this little bit.</p>

<p>I mean, yeah, we all know Hebb. „Neurons that fire together, wire together”, the neurology mantra in flesh. I can just imagine NeuroZen masters, walking around meditating neurologists, „fiiiiiiiiireeee toooooogeeeether” instead of „ommmm” going around.</p>

<p>That’s how neurons connect. When two fire at once, their connection becomes stronger. The synapse gains long term potentiation/LTP, by both an increase in the neurotransmitters produced, and an increase in the postsynaptic receptors for the neurotransmitters. Short-term it happens through utilizing some of the additional AMPA receptors available near to the synaptic membrane in the postsynaptic cell, long term by changes in protein synthesis and gene expression, in order to ensure a larger number of receptors. So far so good, in one way or another pretty much anyone who understands anything about neurology understands this bit. It might be more or less simplistic, you might have the AMPA receptors memorized or not, but you get the gist of it.&nbsp;(Although this begs the question: does Dale’s principle means that the increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter production influence not just this single synapse, but also the concentration of neurotransmitters in all synaptic connections of the presynaptic neuron? Or perhaps does a reverse mechanism happen, with other connections of the presynaptic neuron being stripped bare of their neurotransmitters? Something I need to check! )</p>

<p>Now here’s the kicker: how do neurons that AREN’T already connected connect? How does their “fire/wire” rule go?</p>

<p>I mean, that still applies, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Actually, it doesn’t apply in the original Hebb’s law, since that required the neurons to be connected already and a couple of other things as well. But still, the general principle is how we tend to explain things like associative learning, conditioning, etc. The direct wording of Hebb’s law can’t apply there, because then we’d need every neural network to be connected to every other neural network at once, and that’d be a mess that wouldn’t really work all that well. But the general principle seems to apply.</p>

<p>And when I started asking around, no one could tell me how exactly.</p>

<p>How does a neuron know to extend new axonal or dendric connections towards another neuron, so that they might actually form a synapse between the two? Because this has to happen somehow, and this has to happen in a fairly structured way. If it didn’t happen, if we were only left to the remains of the synaptic pruning we got since birth, then our neural networks would become pretty much immovable after were what, twelve? I mean yeah, I’ve met these people, and so have you, but they’re in the small minority… well, large minority… well, OK, a small majority. But even so, there are quite a few people who aren’t that way. And if the neural growth was haphazard, then we’d get a far more random jumble of associations, then the fairly clean ones we tend to get in any conditioning/associative learning experiences.</p>

<p>So I knew there must be some kind of system for neurons to detect other neurons it should be „aiming for” in their development.</p>

<p>And – this was about two or three years ago as of writing this – no one I asked could tell me what it was. I’ve reached out to a lot of people I’ve considered very competent in the field, including some of my old Uni professors, and no one could direct me. Nor could I find the answer in any of the textbooks I’ve referred to.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the answer is fairly recent, as articles about it only started to appear in the 2000s. Since it took me some time to find it back then, I figured I’d make this article to share it now, making the whole thing easier to find for others.</p>

<p>We’ve known from about 1890 that the endings of both the axon and the dendrites are covered in something known as a growth cone. Like the tip of the branch, this is the part where the cell can further develop and extend, either in original growth, in regeneration, or as a reaction to some factors (including a decrease in overall electric activity which causes a form of synaptic scaling – hence explaining the „devouring” of unused neural pathways of amputated body parts by nearby active structures). But how do the growth cones know how exactly to grow? The brain is a complex three-dimensional web of interconnected neurons, so „hitting” the right point is definitely too hard if the neurons just kept on growing until they hit anything at all.</p>

<p>Now, the synaptic scaling process is still a piece of the answer – even if a neuron forms a new synaptic connection with a different neuron, if the target neuron already has too many connections, it will tend to remove the weakest ones, and this includes the most recent ones. The scaling goes both ways after all – it goes for more synapses when it starts with too few, but for less, if it starts with too many.</p>

<p>But synaptic scaling is not everything. As it turns out, the tips of the growth cone constantly produce structures called filopodia, and these react to specific chemical attractants and repellents. These chemicals are produced by both cells at the target area, and by so-called guidepost cells along the way. There are suggestions that the system for such targeting is fairly robust, especially in early development (and its limitations in later life might explain why spinal cord injuries and the like are so hard to fix).</p>

<p>(There is one other process for directing cells, the growth along the radial glia, but since it mainly refers to embryonic development, it’s really not all that interesting for us in this topic.)</p>

<p>Now, the more perceptive of you will already have noticed that while what I’ve given is AN answer, it is not THE answer to the question I’ve originally asked. Or at least, not necessarily.</p>

<p>It might be possible, that the interaction of the three systems:<br>– a pre-set network of attractor/repellent chemical pathways for guiding axon/dendrite growth,<br>– the synaptic scaling mechanism of homeostatic plasticity, which limits the max connections and promotes new connections if existing neural excitability falls below what is the baseline for the network,<br>– and the good old Hebbian mechanism for strengthening existing neural connections,<br>is in fact enough. That the interplay of these systems does answer our basic question, and simple enough rules result in sufficient flexibility to explain what is observed.</p>

<p>But, obviously, the process might be a bit more complicated. There isn’t that much literature about it, unfortunately, so what I’m doing here is more of an (un)educated guess, but since guidepost cells tend to be neurons which have yet to develop an axon – but already have dendrites and can receive signals, a slightly more complex – but better targeted – system can be imagined, where guidepost cells would be a part of a wider neural network, the stimulation of which „calls forth” further cells to build connections. This, in my understanding (Again, limited, so don’t take my word for it. I mean it.) would be a more effective explanation of how we can rapidly learn to connect fairly new information, even across huge (neurologically-scaled) swaths of neural space. A strongly agitated system produces a stronger „call for connections”, hence mediating the faster development of new and broader associations.</p>

<p>So there you have it, a quick summary of one part of neural connectivity I’ve yet to see described in a textbook about the brain, but which really should be given out there, along with the classic Hebbian principle. Hope it’s useful 🙂</p>

<p>Two years ago, on June 4th of 2018, Microsoft announced its acquisition of GitHub, unicorn darling of the developer tools startup ecosystem, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">for $7.5B in stock</a>. The announcement unearthed a wide range of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17221527" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">opinions and pontifications</a>, ranging from “GitHub is doomed” to “Microsoft is smart”, with many predictions about GitHub’s future. Some thought Microsoft’s growing investments in its cloud offering, Azure, might help GitHub. Could an investment by Microsoft improve GitHub’s reliability or harden them against outages like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/github-ddos-memcached/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DDOSes</a>? Have any of these predictions come true?</p>



<p>We set out to analyze one angle of the GitHub acquisition: Has GitHub become more reliable since its acquisition by Microsoft? Our service, <a href="https://statusgator.com/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">StatusGator</a>, monitors more than 700 status pages of cloud providers and SaaS companies large and small. We aggregate and normalize status page data and make it available to our subscribers however they need: in notifications by email, Slack, Teams, or webhook, and in a <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/01/24/how-to-save-precious-minutes-during-incident-response/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">unified status dashboard</a> for all service dependencies.</p>

<p>For more than 5 years, we have analyzed the <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GitHub status page</a> constantly. Every 5 minutes, StatusGator takes a screenshot and <a href="https://statusgator.com/services/github" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">collects relevant data</a> about their service status. That means we are uniquely positioned to offer analysis of the downtime that GitHub themselves announce via their status page.</p>



<p>What does the data tell us? In the two years since the acquisition announcement, GitHub has reported a 41% increase in status page incidents. Furthermore, there has been a 97% increase in incident minutes, compared to the two years prior to the announcement. Does this actually point to a decrease in reliability? We can’t say. This could simply mean GitHub has increased its transparency, publishing to their status page more frequently.</p>



<h2>Incident Counts</h2>



<p>We calculated an incident count in the 24 months preceding the announcement and the 24 months after. We <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/12/26/under-the-hood-inside-a-status-page-aggregator/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">classify status pages</a> into four states: <em>up</em>, <em>warn</em>, and <em>down</em>, and <em>maintenance</em>. GitHub does not expose scheduled maintenance on their status page. For these calculations we consider an incident to be any change in status between <em>up</em> and <em>warn</em> or <em>down</em>.</p>



<p>Before the acquisition, there were 89 incidents published on the GitHub status page. After, there were 126 incidents. A 41% increase:</p>

<h2>Incident Minutes</h2>



<p>We calculated incident minutes by subtracting the start and end time of time of incidents. Although not 100% realtime, StatusGator checks frequently: every 5 minutes, so status page changes are detected quickly. We counted time where the page was not in an overall <em>up</em> state.</p>



<p>In the 24 months prior to the acquisition announcement, there were 6,110 minutes of downtime. During the 24 months after, there were 12,074 minutes of downtime, a 97% increase:</p>

<h2>Status Page Evolution</h2>



<p>During these four years, GitHub has made enormous improvements in their status page information granularity and design. In December 2018, they switched from a home grown status page to one operated by Atlassian’s StatusPage service, <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/03/11/2019-statusgator-status-page-awards/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">the most popular status page provider</a>. In doing so, they added numerous <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/11/22/component-status-filtering-is-here/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">individual component statuses</a>. Here’s what GitHub’s status page looked like before their switch to Atlassian StatusPage:</p>



<h3>GitHub’s Old Status Page</h3>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old.png" alt="GitHub status page showing only a single status across all GitHub services." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old.png 645w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-300x187.png 300w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-580x361.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-status-page-old-320x199.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px"><figcaption>GitHub status page showing only a single status across all GitHub services.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When they switched to their new status page format, GitHub took a huge step towards increased accountability and transparency by detailing the following individual service components:</p>



<ul><li>Git Operations</li><li>API Requests</li><li>Issues, PRs, Dashboard, Projects</li><li>Notifications</li><li>Gists</li><li>GitHub Pages</li></ul>



<p>Overtime, they have expanded and refined their component statuses. They also started showing historical data right on their status page. As you can see in their newest and most detailed status page format, it shows the following service component statuses:</p>



<ul><li>Git Operations</li><li>API Requests</li><li>Webhooks</li><li>Issues, PRs, Projects</li><li>GitHub Actions</li><li>GitHub Packages</li><li>GitHub Pages</li></ul>



<h3>GitHub’s New Status Page</h3>



<figure><img src="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-944x1024.png" alt="GitHub status page showing detailed statuses of each of the major components of their service." srcset="https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-944x1024.png 944w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-277x300.png 277w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-768x833.png 768w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-720x781.png 720w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-580x629.png 580w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new-320x347.png 320w, https://nimbleindustries.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-satus-page-new.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px"><figcaption>GitHub status page showing detailed statuses of each of the major components of their service.</figcaption></figure>



<p>They also moved their status page to a dedicated domain, <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">githubstatus.com</a>, <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/21/your-status-page-deserves-its-own-domain/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">which follows a best practice we recommend</a> to anyone who hosts a status page. All of this additional transparency, details, and historical data is a commendable effort to relay the most up-to-date information about the status of all GitHub systems. More providers of critical cloud infrastructure should emulate what GitHub has done. <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2019/12/07/your-status-page-is-useless-if-you-dont-use-it/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Your status page is useless if you don’t use it.</a></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>What can we conclude from all of this data? Objectively, we can conclude that GitHub has published to their status page more frequently in the two years after their acquisition announcement. They have posted more incidents of disruption and downtime. Those incidents have been longer in duration. According to the data they provided, GitHub has been down more since the acquisition by Microsoft. </p>



<p>But that could be all a part of coordinated effort to be more transparent about their service status, an effort that should be applauded.</p>



<p>Our goal at StatusGator is not to shame anyone for disruptions and outages. Everyone experiences unexpected downtime. We simply strive to make status page data available and accessible in more useful ways. From Slack and <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/03/status-page-monitoring-in-microsoft-teams/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">Microsoft Teams</a>, to <a href="https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/04/30/status-page-webhooks-new-and-improved/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="follow">webhooks</a>, an API, and more. StatusGator aggregates status page data and empowers you to keep your team informed. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Coronavirus and the lockdowns it forced has probably sped up the transition to working from home in many jobs by at least a decade. Workers who previously spend time sitting in cubicles or offices found out they could have just as well worked from home. Millions started looking for software that would help them do that. </p>
<p>Enter Zoom, a somewhat popular video-conferencing program made all the way back in 2011. It was already fairly popular before the pandemic, but this year it’s popularity has exploded. The daily average user numbers went from around 10 million in December to over 300 million in April. </p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>Zoom became the go-to choice for many mainly because it’s really easy to use and free (well at least the basic version is) The usually highlighted advantages of Zoom are:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple and easy to use interface</li>
<li>good audio and video quality</li>
<li>smooth and easy to set up conference calls even for large groups up to 100 people</li>
<li>compatibility with various systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS</li>
<li>ability to share slides and content</li>
<li>scheduling conferences via a calendar that can be shared with others</li>
<li>virtual backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<p>Zoom also helped itself by making the program free to use for K-12 schools in the US since early March, just as the lockdowns were starting. It also received a lot of free publicity from famous users, even the UK government used it to host sessions.</p>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<p>Well, it’s not all as rosy as it sounds. Zoom has been involved in some controversies that have become more and more apparent as it gained popularity. The main point of criticism has been lackluster security. </p>
<ul>
<li>In 2019 Apple was forced to remove Zoom from Macs after it turned out a security flaw could let websites hijack users’ cameras. Although the company quickly addressed this with fixes and a lengthy blog post, it wasn’t a good look.</li>
<li>Zoom has no end-to-end encryption, despite some advertising materials claiming otherwise. It stores all the keys involved in user data encryption in its own cloud infrastructure. Which means it can access user data at will.</li>
<li>Zoom calls have random generated IDs consisting between 9 and 11 digits and these can apparently be brute-forced or even randomly guessed which means hackers can get into meetings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The flaws were pretty notorious and led to a phenomenon called <em>zoom bombing</em> where pranksters would join meetings to broadcast inappropriate content. It got so bad the FBI had to officially warn schools.</p>
<h2>The Ugly</h2>
<p>Remember that thing about Zoom having access to user data? Well, it turns out that’s not an accident.</p>
<ul>
<li>This month Zoom admitted to closing three meetings commemorating the Tiananmen Square crackdown and suspended the accounts of activists who organized them. This led to teachers voicing concerns about how they’re supposed to cover such topics in classes hosted on the platform.</li>
<li>In April the New York Times found out Zoom’s data mining feature was automatically sending user’s names and emails to LinkedIn allowing participants to access other users’ profile data.</li>
<li>In March Motherboard found out Zoom’s iOS app was automatically sending device analytics to Facebook without informing the user and did it even if the user did not have a Facebook account. There was no mention of this in the privacy policy either.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far this has led to a couple of lawsuits, an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission and outright bans from some tech companies and the UK’s ministry of defense. Not good news for the company to put it mildly. Yet despite all that Zoom is still hugely popular and looks like it will stay that way despite its flaws. To be fair it’s not like it’s main competitors like Microsoft Teams and Google Hangouts don’t have any either, so pick your poison.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs.

Scientists believe the discovery, published online on June 29, 2020 in The Journals of Gerontology, Series A, could signal the dawn of new, affordable, home-based eye therapies, helping the millions of people globally with naturally declining vision. The article is titled “Optically Improved Mitochondrial Function Redeems Aged Human Visual Decline.” In the UK, there are currently presently 12 million people aged over 65: in 50 years, this will increase to approximatley 20 million and all will have some degree of visual decline because of retinal aging. Lead author, Professor Glen Jeffery, PhD, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, said: "As you age your visual system declines significantly, particularly once over 40. Your retinal sensitivity and your color vision are both gradually undermined, and with an aging population, this is an increasingly important issue. To try to stem or reverse this decline, we sought to reboot the retina's aging cells with short bursts of longwave light."In humans around 40 years-old, cells in the eye's retina begin to age, and the pace of this aging is caused, in part, when the cell's mitochondria, whose role is to produce energy (known as ATP) and boost cell function, also start to decline. Mitochondrial density is greatest in the retina's photoreceptor cells, which have high energy demands. As a result, the retina ages faster than other organs, with a 70% ATP reduction over life, causing a significant decline in photoreceptor function as these receptors lack the energy to perform their normal role. Researchers built on their previous results in mice, bumblebees, and fruit flies, which all demonstrated significant improvements in the function of the retina's photoreceptors when their eyes were exposed to 670 nanometer (long-wavelength) deep red light. </p>
<p>"Mitochondria have specific light absorbance characteristics influencing their performance: longer wavelengths spanning 650 to 1000 nm are absorbed and improve mitochondrial performance to increase energy production," said Professor Jeffery. </p>
<p>The retina's photoreceptor population is formed of cones, which mediate color vision and rods, which provide peripheral vision and adapt vision in low/dim light. </p>
<p>For the study, 24 people (12 male, 12 female), aged between 28 and 72, who had no ocular disease, were recruited. All participants' eyes were tested for the sensitivity of their rods and cones at the start of the study. Rod sensitivity was measured in dark-adapted eyes (with pupils dilated) by asking participants to detect dim light signals in the dark, and cone function was tested by subjects identifying colored letters that had very low contrast and appeared increasingly blurred, a process called color contrast. </p>
<p>All participants were then given a small LED torch to take home and were asked to look into its deep red 670 nm light beam for three minutes a day for two weeks. They were then re-tested for their rod and cone sensitivity.</p>
<p>COLOR &amp; NIGHT VISION BOTH IMPROVED BY SIMPLE APPROACH</p>
<p>Researchers found the 670 nm light had no impact in younger individuals, but in those around 40 years and over, significant improvements were obtained. </p>
<p>Cone color contrast sensitivity (the ability to detect colors) improved by up to 20% in some people aged around 40 and over. Improvements were more significant in the blue part of the color spectrum that is more vulnerable in aging.<br>
Rod sensitivity (the ability to see in low light) also improved significantly in those aged around 40 and over, though less than color contrast.</p>
<p>Professor Jeffery said: "Our study shows that it is possible to significantly improve vision that has declined in aged individuals using simple brief exposures to light wavelengths that recharge the energy system that has declined in the retina cells, rather like re-charging a battery.</p>
<p>"The technology is simple and very safe, using a deep red light of a specific wavelength, that is absorbed by mitochondria in the retina that supply energy for cellular function.</p>
<p>"Our devices cost about £12 (~$15) to make, so the technology is highly accessible to members of the public." </p>
<p>WARNING</p>
<p>Be aware these are preliminary results of a very small study. This approach should not be attempted by anyone until further studies are completed to determine the safety and efficacy of this novel approach. Please consult your ophthalmologist to determine the status of this developing approach to possibly reducing vision loss associated with aging. </p>

<p>After publishing the URU Key project people keep asking me to make it open source. I have tried to organize sources in a more readable way but I still think that plain C and ESP IDF are too difficult for the broad audience. And, unfortunately, the biometrics part is covered by NDA and can not be published.</p>
<p>Therefore I am starting a new project to address these and other issues.</p>
<h2 id="size-and-form-factor">Size and form factor</h2>
<p>A few months ago I have finalized the <a href="https://en.ovcharov.me/2020/04/06/uru-key-final-hardware-design/">URU Key hardware design</a> and started working on housing for it. Yes, it is very small and lightweight but carrying it around is a kind of a problem. The device is too fragile to be worn on the keyring and a bit thick to put in the pocket. The necklace is not my style.</p>
<figure>

<p>However, my wallet is always with me. The PCB sized as a standard credit card should perfectly fit there. The power source becomes a problem, that’s true. But, wait, is it difficult to find a charger or power bank with Micro USB nowadays?</p>

<p>The name <strong>URU Card</strong> makes a lot of sense for this project, isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User interface</h2>
<p>As on one hand, I can not use biometrics for open source project and on other hand, I do not want to omit the authentication completely leaving the device insecure there is a need for some form of user verification. Simple touch keyboard and OLED screen should allow people to enter pin code or password.</p>
<figure>

<p>The keyboard should be implemented with the <strong>MPR121</strong> I2C touch-sensor controller, and the screen is a widely available <strong>OLED</strong> screen with the <strong>SSD1306</strong> controller. The screen is placed in the special cut in the PCB keeping the device thickness below 2 millimetres.</p>
<h2 id="framework-for-the-development">Framework for the development</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the <strong>Arduino</strong> framework is ported to the <strong>ESP32</strong> platform. There are hundreds of libraries for almost every use case and this factor should significantly simplify the project. There are libraries for <strong>ATECC508A</strong>, <strong>MPR121</strong> and <strong>SSD1306</strong> already. All that is needed is to wire everything together.</p>
<p>However, the Arduino IDE will be hardly usable for a project complex like this one. I am going to use Visual Studio Code + <strong>PlatformIO</strong> for the development and recommend others to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-state-of-the-project">The current state of the project</h2>
<p>At the moment the working <strong>BLE server</strong> with <strong>FIDO2</strong> endpoints is implemented. The device is “visible” and the computer connects to it in order to perform an authentication procedure. However, the commands are not implemented yet - it’s going to be the next step.</p>

<p>There is a PCB design as well and you can try to build the device, but do it on your own risk - it’s in a very early stage now.</p>
<h2 id="joining-the-project">Joining the project</h2>
<p>Sweetest part. The project is free to join for everyone. The minimal requirement is just an ESP32 development board like the one below.</p>

    <p>Existing ML for code methods often learn from <a href="https://github.blog/2019-09-26-introducing-the-codesearchnet-challenge/">raw source code</a> and sometimes use <a href="https://slideslive.com/38917598/program-understanding-synthesis-and-verification-with-graph-neural-networks">data flow</a> to understand programs.
While these offer large amounts of data they don’t actually show what code fundamentally does, changes state.</p>

<p>With that in mind I’ve created a dataset of over 1 million ran python programming solutions with state changes shown after each line of code. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/frasergreenlee/ran-hackerrank-solutions">Get it here</a></p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Most AI for code models only learn from reading code. This lets AI models recognise patterns in the code &amp; generate sensible-looking code.</p>

<p>But do these models really understand code? If you were to read code without running anything and had no prior knowledge of programming would you know how to use it?</p>

<h3 id="an-example">An example</h3>

<p>Lets try learning about a single program character the way an AI would.</p>

<p>Below is a simple program with just 1 character replaced by a Chinese character making the code inscrutable. This is a similar experience for an AI seeing the true character for the first time.</p>

<p>As you can see the code is inscrutable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>C</span> <span>=</span> <span>A六B</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>B六C</span>
<span>E</span> <span>=</span> <span>A六D</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>C六E</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How could I make this understandable without showing the true character?</p>

<p>Since all code does is change state, lets show state changes between each line.</p>

<p>Below shows state changes but the values are also represented by Chinese characters.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>..</span> <span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>书</span>
<span>..</span> <span>B</span> <span>=</span> <span>書</span>
<span>C</span> <span>=</span> <span>A六B</span>
<span>..</span> <span>C</span> <span>=</span> <span>書</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>B六C</span>
<span>..</span> <span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>书</span>
<span>E</span> <span>=</span> <span>A六D</span>
<span>..</span> <span>E</span> <span>=</span> <span>书</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>C六E</span>
<span>..</span> <span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>書</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Lets look at all the operations with the values substituted in:</p>

<p><code>书六書=書</code>, <code>書六書=书</code>, <code>书六书=书</code>, <code>書六书=書</code></p>

<p>If you are familiar with programming you may be able to guess that <code>六</code> is an <code>and</code> operator with <code>书</code> being <code>True</code> &amp; <code>書</code> being <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s the original code with swapped words:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#  and is 六
#  True is 书
#  False is 書
</span><span>C</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span> <span>and</span> <span>B</span>
<span>A</span> <span>=</span> <span>A</span> <span>and</span> <span>C</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>C</span> <span>and</span> <span>B</span>
<span>D</span> <span>=</span> <span>D</span> <span>and</span> <span>D</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Think how much more code you would need to read to figure out what <code>六</code> meant if you couldn’t see state changes. For this reason I rekon showing state changes will help AI models understand code.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-got-this-data">How I got this data</h2>

<p>I first found the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/arjoonn/codechef-competitive-programming">CodeChef dataset</a> it’s got 1 million solutions to programming problems but few are in Python and many aren’t runnable.</p>

<p>HackerRank is a site where programmers can practice for interviews on their huge range of programming problems. It has a “See Solutions” button that lets you read other peoples solutions.
I used <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html">Selenium</a> to click on that button for every problem to get solution URLs. Then I used <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Requests</a> to download those solutions.
After a few days I had 1 million solution code snippets with on average 1k solutions per problem.</p>

<h3 id="recording-state-changes">Recording State Changes</h3>

<p>Once I had my runnable code snippets I used <a href="https://github.com/alexmojaki/snoop">Snoop</a> to record all the state changes occurring in each program run.</p>

<p>Snoop dynamically adds logs to your code showing what has executed &amp; which state values have changed. To see how this works check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm47491S-Fo">talk</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/snoops-output.png" alt="Some Snoop output." title="Some Snoop output."></p>

<p>Next step was to run all the code snippets. The script used to run the code and progress logs can be found <a href="https://app.wandb.ai/fraser/run-code-snippets/runs/3q9pzype/files/code/data/run_code/hacker-rank/get_problem_snoops.py">here</a>. Thankfully running all these code snippets didn’t cause many issues, I just had to watch out for some the occasional massive code snippet.</p>

<p>An interesting yet worrying feature of the Snoop files is that they are highly compressible, the zip file is 1/10th the size of the txt file. This is likely due to repetitions in the snoop due to the same code being ran repeatedly in for loops and method calls.</p>

<h2 id="initial-results">Initial Results</h2>

<p>With the dataset completed I trained <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">gpt2</a> to perform causal language modelling on the raw text. I wanted to see if the Snoops text offers the model any unique insights about code.</p>

<h3 id="pre-training">Pre-Training</h3>

<p><a href="https://app.wandb.ai/fraser/lm_snoop">Here</a> you can see some initial results on training gpt2 &amp; <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/">BERT</a> on the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/snoops-gpt2-training.png" alt="Eval loss while training gpt2-medium from-scratch/pre-trained on the Snoop text." title="Eval loss while training gpt2-medium from-scratch/pre-trained on the Snoop text."></p>

<p>Surprisingly gpt2 with OpenAI pre-training (blue) is actually already very accurate on the Snoop text.</p>

<p>When having it generate text with short prompts I found it to be far less accurate than the 1.1 evaluation perplexity. It seems like the gpt2 model is spotting patterns in it’s prefix string &amp; is using them to predict future tokens rather than having a probabilistic model of an interpreter.</p>

<h3 id="a-downstream-task">A Downstream Task</h3>

<p><a href="https://app.wandb.ai/fraser/conala">Here</a> you can see it fine-tuned on <a href="https://conala-corpus.github.io/">CoNaLa</a> (a description-to-code translation task). The Snoop data is better than no pre-training but not as good as gpt2 with OpenAI pre-training. Of course the Snoops model hasn’t had the same amount of training time nor has it seen natural language before so its not a fair test.</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/conala-gpt2.png" alt="Fine-tuning gpt2 from scratch vs pre-trained." title="Fine-tuning gpt2 from scratch vs pre-trained."></p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/conala-gpt2-pretrained.png" alt="Fine-tuning Snoop pre-trained vs OpenAI pre-trained." title="Fine-tuning Snoop pre-trained vs OpenAI pre-trained."></p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of potential in using state changes to understand code. Right now I don’t think just reading the raw snoops text is the way to go but I think a well formatted, compressed version could do better.
Next time I’ll show how well a compressed version of this dataset can teach a transformer to act as a Python interpreter.</p>

<p>Here’s some other investigations you could do with this dataset:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Further testing on how this helps downstream tasks, try training a language model on just the code &amp; just the Snoop, see which does better on downstream tasks &amp; by how much. These downstream tasks could include bug detection, data type prediction, search &amp; description2code generation.</li>
  <li>Run Snoop on the Django source code with the <a href="https://ahcweb01.naist.jp/pseudogen/">English2Django dataset</a> comments in the code. That way a language model will learn NLP, code &amp; state all at the same time. Warning I got a lot of <code>STATE_UNAVAILABLE</code> messages when I tried this so be ready to filter a lot of data.</li>
  <li>Try applying this method to another programming language, maybe there’s a similar tool for Java or Javascript?</li>
  <li>Try filtering &amp; rearranging the data for new tasks. It offers a valuable insight as to what parts of the source code are useful to humans.</li>
</ul>

            <p>“I’m trying to go down a bottomless pit. I’ll never make it till the end.”</p>
<p>That’s what I thought when I tried to create my own video game. I was young, beautiful, and I was struggling to use <code>for</code> loops and <code>arrays</code> at the same time.
There was so much to learn!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found the strength to continue. More and more, the concepts behind programming began to make sense. From there, learning wasn’t a chore anymore, but an intrepid journey. Going through a book about C and trying to create my own adventure on MS-DOS was a crazy Indiana Jone’s-like discovery I’ll never forget.</p>
<p>My first video game wasn’t great, but it was mine. It was <em>my</em> creation. Yet, what I remember today, with a tear in my left eye, is not the result, but the learning process itself. It was these “Aha!” moments which brought me the most joy!</p>
<p>I love learning. For a long, long time. That’s why I tried, through the years, to make my learning gradually more effective and efficient.</p>
<p>Learning is essential for developers. We need to learn about the new breakthroughs, discoveries, and changes in the industry.</p>
<p>We need to learn about our history, to know what’s really new, what’s not, and what to do with it, <em>in what context</em>.</p>
<p>We need to learn about the business domain of the company we’re working with.</p>
<p>We need to learn how to better communicates with our teammates.</p>
<p>We need to learn about what our customers really want.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, this article will brush over the wide subject of learning, as a developer. We’ll try to answer these questions together:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s learning?</li>
<li>Why do we learn? Should learning serve a goal?</li>
<li>How to avoid ineffective learning methods, procrastination, and distractions?</li>
<li>Should we have a mentor or learn by ourselves?</li>
<li>Is practice only makes perfect?</li>
<li>How to test ourselves to avoid the illusion of competence?</li>
<li>Are feedback important? What kind of feedback can you get? What feedback should you be interested in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to dive? Good. Take your machete and let’s go together through the Deep Jungle of Knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="whats-learning">What’s learning?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we can be very surprised of the meaning of common words. Especially if we never question their definitions.</p>
<p>For example, I’m always surprised to hear people saying that learning is only a question of memory. It’s not wrong, but it’s incomplete.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oxford dictionary</a>
, learning means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives us clues about how to learn (study, experience, or being taught), but not really about the meaning of “acquisition of knowledge”.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the definition of <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/knowledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge</a>
:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can already see, thanks to these definitions, two main foundations for learning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding</li>
<li>Remembering (acquisition)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll add a third one:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Transfer</li>
</ol>
<p>Transfer is applying the knowledge from the learning context to another context. For example, it could be applying the programming knowledge your learned at school to the side project you always dreamt to build.</p>
<p>Transfer is not a necessity for learning. After all, you can understand and remember something without ever using what you learned.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, we learn in hope to apply the knowledge acquired. That’s why it’s still a major component of our learning experiences.</p>
<h2 id="why-learning">Why Learning?</h2>

</picture>



<h3 id="enriching-your-life">Enriching Your Life</h3>
<p>Learning will enrich your life in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your opinions will evolve.</li>
<li>Your vision on the world will change.</li>
<li>You’ll feel strong connections with people who share your interests, creating passionate and mind-binding conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning can open doors in your professional life:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can help you climbing the corporate ladder.</li>
<li>It can help you to negotiate a better salary. After all, we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge workers</a>
: our worth is <em>partly</em> our knowledge.</li>
<li>It will create opportunities for <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/guide-debate-software-developer-skill/">healthy debates with your fellow colleagues</a>
.</li>
<li>Your CTO might call you <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/software-developer-titles-junior-senior/">“Rockstar” or “Ninja”</a>
 too, you lucky pit of knowledge!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learning-with-or-without-goals">Learning With or Without Goals?</h3>
<p>When you try to learn something, it’s useful to have concrete goals you want to achieve with the knowledge acquired. These goals could be a good occasion to <em>transfer</em> your knowledge.</p>
<p>For example, you want to learn programming because you always dreamt to create a revolutionary video game, where you can break bricks with a ball. Maybe you want to learn what’s the <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/dry-principle-cost-benefit-example/">DRY principle</a>
, to finally refactor your favorite legacy application.</p>
<p>Without meaningful goals, it will be difficult to be motivated in the long run. Learning is not easy. Understanding can be a daunting task (depending of what you learn), remembering even more so, and transfer is maybe the worst of all.</p>
<p>It takes time, too. That’s why being able to reach concrete goals with your new skills and knowledge can be very satisfying. It will give you the needed motivation to continue on your learning path.</p>
<p>It’s even more true when you try to learn complex topics. Your motivation is something you should try to assess and even measure along the way, to see if you need to boost it by making (and finishing) something important to you.</p>
<p>It’s always possible to learn for the sake of learning. Heck, I do it quite a lot myself. Yet, you need to have a good confidence on your motivation, and you need to be aware of the benefits of the learning journey itself.</p>
<p>If you have difficulties to find concrete ideas and goals where you can transfer your new knowledge, I wrote a whole article about techniques <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/generate-programming-side-project-ideas/">to generate project ideas</a>
.</p>

    <img src="https://thevaluable.dev/images/2020/learning_developer/experts.jpg" alt="Being an expert is not necessarily your goal">
</picture>



<p>Now that you have your goals, you need to decide <em>how much</em> you want to learn.</p>
<p>After all, you don’t need to be an expert in everything.</p>
<p>Moreover, knowledge acquisition is not like buying a new table for your living room. You need some maintenance not to forget the knowledge and skills acquired.</p>
<p>It means that you need to constantly refresh your knowledge and skills, for everything you want to be an expert at. It takes time, energy, and require, again, a lot of motivation.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that your life’s dream is to write a PHP script to rename automatically thousands of your holidays pictures. You don’t need to be a PHP evangelist to answer your needs. Trying to understand superficially how PHP works to accomplish what you want might be enough.</p>
<p>Superficial learning works well if you don’t have any goal, too. You can read about programming paradigms for example, by pure curiosity, to have a global overview of all of them. You can still dive deeper if you wish later.</p>
<p>Beyond the superficial, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreyfus model of competence</a>
 can help you deciding how competent you want to become:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novice</strong> - Shallow understanding, or no understanding at all.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Beginner</strong> - Can make things works, often rely on following a series of steps.</li>
<li><strong>Competent</strong> - Can spot the roots of problems (background understanding), know all the rules and can select a rule depending of the situation. Still make many mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Proficient</strong> - Very conscious about performance, know perfectly what approaches to take in what situation.</li>
<li><strong>Expert</strong> - Intuition very well developed, apply his skills without thoughts, performances look magical.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1nzADdV6zk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose your destiny</a>
, depending on your needs!</p>

</picture>



<p>Let’s see now how you should prepare yourself before learning anything.</p>
<p>The following advice won’t change your life from one day to another. You need to work on it, actively seeking to apply these advice, day after day. The rewards are, however, huge. I promise.</p>
<h3 id="the-mistakes-to-avoid">The Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<p>Let’s go back years in your past, when you were young, innocent, and not a caffeine junky yet.</p>
<p>You’re at school. The teacher is speaking about whatever subject he wants you to learn. His tone is monotonous, he doesn’t believe in what he’s saying, you think about what you’ll eat at lunch.</p>
<p>You’re bored.</p>
<p>The seconds feel like minutes. Minutes feel like hours. You can’t do anything, except waiting. Will it ever end? Will you feel joy again? Is it the end of time?</p>
<p>Finally, against all odds, the course end. The teacher ask you to learn a new chapter of your book. He will test you next time.</p>
<p>At home, you read again and again the learning material. You have difficulties to concentrate, but you’re a serious boy (or girl), so you push yourself through. After five reading, you judge yourself good enough to pass the next test.</p>
<p>You close your book, satisfied with yourself, and switch on the TV, because Youtube might not exist yet.</p>
<p>What I just described is the worst way to learn something. <em>Passively</em> listening to somebody, then <em>passively</em> going through some learning materials might teach you something, but very, very slowly. You don’t need to be in a class for that: just switch on Youtube and consume <em>passively</em> any video on programming.</p>
<p>When you close your book after your passive learning, you think you learned something. Yet, when you’ll pass your test, you’ll understand that you really didn’t.</p>
<p>This is called <strong>illusion of competence</strong>: we have often the <em>impression</em> we learned something, even if we didn’t.</p>
<p>You should spend most of your time <em>actively learning</em>. You need to be an actor in your own learning, not only consuming it like you would consume Netflix.</p>
<p>I would compare active learning as playing a video game. Yes, I was a video game junky.</p>
<p>When you play, you’re actively doing something. Consequently, I’m sure you can remember many more video games than what you read in your last books.</p>
<p>This is due to two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Video games are fun. You can make your learning experience fun, too. More you’ll learn what you love, more you’ll like the process of learning.</li>
<li>Playing is an active endeavor, not a passive one.</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, before actively learning, you …</p></section></article></div></div>

                <p>A program is not a very fast pencil.</p>
<p>Software operates on different plane when compared to pen-and-paper business. It is the duty of software developer to avoid the trap of aligning software with principles of a traditional business.</p>
<p>In this article, we will describe how the fast pencil fallacy becomes reality in a common software development project. After that, we will explain how that fallacy can be avoided.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
<p>To better understand how brand-new software inadvertently becomes a fast pencil, we need to understand the process of delivering software. It all begins with the customer, probably feeling lost in the process of defining requirements – desires if you will – specifying what the future product should and should not do.</p>
<p>The customer is running a business, in a way which has remained the same for a hundred years maybe. They are using very primitive tools, quite different from the tools we use in software development. They are accustomed to using a pencil.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image1.png" alt="image1.png"></p><p>And what they ask a software developer to do, is to come up with a nice and square software to enhance the way their business is run. And indeed, developer comes up with a piece of software, which is meant to replace that traditional pen-and-paper business. That is the moment when magic happens in its least desired form, because the customer, no matter how hard they tried, will never be able to see the difference between the two, the pencil and the software.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image2.png" alt="image2.png"></p><p>They will normally see the program as a very fast pencil. They will invariantly look at the program as a fast replacement for their traditional business. And that is the problem. Modern software development practices based on accepting customer’s requirements and implementing them to the point where any distinction between software and a pencil disappears is the root cause of bad software design.</p>
<p>If you try to oversee software development today, you will see programs of all kinds working exactly the same as the pen-and-paper business they are addressing, with only one tiny distinction, and that is that software is automated to a degree. That is precisely why customers will keep seeing software as their very fast pencil.</p>
<p>Do you want to develop that? No, you don’t! But what will you do instead? How will you respond to customer’s requirements? To answer these questions, we need to return to place where it all begins: To the bare business.</p>
<p>Spoiler ahead. When developing software, we will not regard customer as the source of truth. Not everything your customer will tell is correct. We will now look at software development from a different perspective.</p>
<h2>Avoiding the Fallacy</h2>
<p>To understand how software should be developed, we will once again start from the customer, who is utterly lost with so many thoughts in their head. They have a business, that’s the fact. But that is not relevant to software development, because nobody wants to have a business. People want to have a vacation, not a business. Something else they have is of our interest instead, which remains to be discovered.</p>
<p>In software development, voyage begins with understanding that customer, who owns the business, has something else of importance. That will probably be the element you have never met in your programming life. They, customers, have the problem. They have something that is hurting them, or hurting their own customers.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image3.png" alt="image3.png"></p><p>Their entire business is built around methods of addressing that problem. That is the whole point of businesses, and the reason why it was said above that nobody wants to have a business. Customers want to solve the problem for their own customers and to make money by being successful at it.</p>
<p>Where does the software fit into this picture, then? Software comes as a representation of a solution to the problem. You would move the problem away from the customer and put software in between. That makes software a layer of abstraction between the user and the problem.</p>
<p>At this point, we are switching to term user, not customer anymore. Basically, user is the one who is using software, and customer is the one who is paying for the software to be developed. This definition may not cover all angles, but it will be sufficient to understand the explanations that follow.</p>
<p>When put that way, users will use the software, and software will abstract away that pointy thing below which is hurting them. The rule of the game is to remove the problem from user’s view, and to replace it with an abstract representation of the problem, so that software can act as an automated solution to the problem instance.</p>
<p>Finally, there comes the question of avoiding the fast pencil fallacy. You will avoid it best if you understand that software itself is of no interest to the user. What is of interest, however, is the way the user will send commands to software. That is how user is controlling the abstraction of the problem. You will need to think about how to best implement commands, then.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image4.png" alt="image4.png"></p><p>Software will ultimately produce one tiny item, and that is the only thing your user will ever care about. That is the output, the product of applying software.</p>
<p>In effect, the user will only be concerned with giving commands to software and collecting the result. And even those commands will be of little concern, with that result of applying software remaining the only thing that is useful to the user. Software is not important. Problem is not important. Output is the only thing that counts.</p>
<p>Software developer will effectively switch to thinking how to let somebody apply the program to produce output. In that way, all that lies below a very thin line under the user interface becomes the developer’s own problem, rather than being the customer’s problem. The customer will see none of the elements below the surface and they will forever remain the software developer’s domain of business.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.codinghelmet.com/articles/the-fast-pencil-fallacy-in-software-development/img/image5.png" alt="image5.png"></p><h2>Software as a Useful Tool</h2>
<p>From a broader perspective, to develop a working software means to develop the inner parts in such way that outer parts, the user interface, can operate and let the user produce the desired output.</p>
<p>All business processes remain the duty of the software to perform. Software will not expect the user to navigate through processes and effectively run them manually. Instead, software will expect the user to fill in the required information so that the processes can be executed on their own.</p>
<p>If you were successful doing that, your software will not be a very fast pencil. It will turn the tables and do the right thing (whatever that is) to solve the problem for the user.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, we have shed light on one of the most prominent issues in software development – the problem of understanding what customer needs, as opposed to accepting what the customer is asking for.</p>
<p>When we scratch under the surface, we find great uncertainty in customers’ views, which comes from misunderstanding the role of software, and the working principles of machines if you like.</p>
<p>Customers need guidance to the realm of software. Developers need to interview customers to understand the problem the business is solving, not just the current working principles of the business itself.</p>
<p>Once understanding of the problem is established, the duty of software developer is to produce abstract model of the problem and implement processes upon it. The result should be the software product, which is performing business processes in fully automated fashion, so that the user doesn’t have to perform them manually.</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the bait of this inflammatory and simplistic title. I promise you that the rest of the article will be more reasoned and nuanced.</p><p><strong><i>In summary:</i></strong> for far-ranging data attributes, such as database columns and API fields, <strong>I recommend namespacing keys using 'snake case', contrary to the current Clojure convention of using 'lisp-case' (for example: favour <code>:myapp_user_first_name</code> over <code>:myapp.user/first-name</code>)</strong>, because the portability benefits of the former notation outweigh whatever affordances Clojure provides for the latter. This is an instance of trading local conveniences for system-wide benefits.</p><p>You may already be convinced at this point, in which case the rest of this article will be of little value to you. Otherwise, I want to provoke you to go through the following mental process:</p><ol><li><strong>Consider <code>:namespacing_keys_in_snake_case</code> for data attributes</strong> in Clojure, rather than the conventional <code>:namespacing.keys/in-lisp-case</code>.</li><li><strong>Get angry</strong>, because that's disgusting to any self-respecting Clojure-bred programmer.</li><li>Recognize that you're angry because you've got <strong>attached to an arbitrary convention,</strong> and superficial ergonomics around it.</li><li>Optional: try to bargain with reality, by attempting to find some hacky mechanisms to keep both notations around. Realize that it's not satisfactory.</li><li>Give up, be at peace, and reap the benefits of designing your programs <strong>system-first rather than language-first</strong>.</li></ol><p>I went slowly through this process myself, with some maintenance pains in the way, which hopefully this article can spare you.</p><h2 id="the_great_benefits_of_namespaced_keys">The great benefits of namespaced keys</h2><p>First, it's worth emphasizing that <strong>the naming of data attributes is an important issue, however innocuous it may feel.</strong> Data attributes such as database columns or API fields are not only the bread and butter of our code, they're also some of the strongest commitments we make when growing an information system, often stronger that the choice of programming language. Once a data attribute is part of the contract between several components the system, it becomes very hard to change. This is true even of small systems such as web or mobile apps.</p><p>In recent years, Clojure has encouraged the programming convention of conveying data using <i>namespaced</i> keys, e.g using <code>:myapp.user/id</code> rather than just <code>:id</code>. Namespacing is great, because by reducing the potential for name collisions, it eliminates a lot of ambiguity about names.</p><p>The <strong>significant benefits</strong> of this approach are:</p><ol><li><strong>context-free readability:</strong> when you see <code>:myapp.user/id</code> in your code, thanks to the <code>myapp.user</code> part, you can tell immediately what kind of data it conveys, and what type of entity it operates on. If you just saw <code>:id</code>, you'd have to figure that out from context.</li><li><strong>data traceability:</strong> with a simple text search in the code, you can immediately follow all the places where this piece of data is used across your entire system, whatever the language used at each place. This basic ability is significantly helpful for maintenability. I think many developers don't realize how big a difference it makes.</li></ol><p>Observe that these benefits apply regardless of the choice of namespacing notation: you would reap them whether you write <code>:myapp.user/id</code>, <code>:myapp-user-id</code>, <code>:myappUserId</code> or <code>:myapp_user_id</code>. <strong>It does not matter which namespacing notation you choose, as long as you use it everywhere.</strong></p><p>In other languages, programmers have traditionally relied on type systems to remove such ambiguity. Type systems are not as good for this purpose, because they don't reach beyond language boundaries.</p><p>Clojure's specific convention also offers some comparatively <strong>insignificant benefits:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>prettiness:</strong> <i>"look at <code>:myapp.user/first-name</code>, it's so beautiful! I can use slashes and dashes in programmatic names, this is THE POWER OF LISP!"</i></li><li><strong>concision affordances:</strong> in Clojure code, using namespace aliases, you can write <code>::user/first-name</code> as a shorthand for <code>:myapp.user/first-name</code>. Big deal. I mean, I can relate to how pleasing this feels when coding, but again, please consider that thinking of the whole system may be more important than this sort of local preferences.</li></ul><h2 id="advantages_of_'snake_case':_portability_and_ubiquity">Advantages of 'snake case': portability and ubiquity</h2><p>In a real-world system, data attributes are bound to travel through many media: SQL columns, ElasticSearch fields, GraphQL fields, JSON documents... if the system involves other languages as Clojure, they may be represented as class members. As mentioned above, using the same name - spelled in <i>exactly</i> the same way - for the data attribute in all these representations is a precious thing, because you can trace it across your codebase with one basic text search. You can track its usage not only in Clojure code, but also in SQL queries, ElasticSearch queries, JavaScript client code, etc.</p><p>Clojure's conventional notation for keys (e.g <code>myapp.person/first-name</code>), <strong>a.k.a lisp-case, is portable to almost none of these other platforms:</strong> it's not suitable for SQL column names, nor for GraphQL field names, nor for ElasticSearch fields, nor for Java/Python class members... Some people have argued that in those systems you should just drop the entity-name part (<code>myapp.person</code>), as it will be represented in another construct such as the SQL table name, but that's generally misguided IMO, because you're back to having to disambiguate meaning from context, and you're making the fragile assumption that colocated keys should always have the same entity-name part (think e.g of <code>:myapp.person/name</code> and <code>myapp.admin/password</code>).</p><p>On the other hand, as far as I can tell, <strong>it's hard to come by a platform that does not support <code>snake_case</code>.</strong> Using it may not always be idiomatic, but it's almost always supported. That's reason enough to make snake_case a better default, because having one ubiquitous notation is much preferrable to having many locally idiomatic ones.</p><h2 id="frequent_objections">Frequent objections</h2><h3 id="'this_is_not_idiomatic_clojure'">'This is not idiomatic Clojure'</h3><p>Arguably, your programs have more important requirements than being idiomatic. Programming history is riddled with bad design decisions made in the name of being idiomatic. Anyone who's worked through a nasty Scala class hierarchy knows how much incidental complexity some programmers are willing to inflict upon themselves for the sake of being idiomatic (<i>"because it's SO much better to write <code>subject.verb(complement)</code> than <code>verb(subject, complement)</code>. It's more idiomatic, you see."</i>). Let's avoid doing that to your program, or the Clojure ecosystem.</p><h3 id="'the_lisp-case_convention_lets_me_destructure_keywords'">'The lisp-case convention lets me destructure keywords'</h3><p><i>I like the ability of destructuring my keywords into an entity-name part and an attribute part, for instance:</i></p><pre><code>(namespace :myapp.user/first-name)
=&gt; "myapp.user"

(name :myapp.user/first-name)
=&gt; "first-name"
</code></pre><p><i>I can leverage that to manipulate my data attributes generically in my programs.</i></p><p>Don't do that. Don't treat Clojure keywords as composite data structures. This is accidental complexity waiting to happen. Programmatic names are meant for humans to read, not for programs to interpret. Changing an attribute name should not be able to change the behaviour of your program. In Hickeyian terms: you'd be complecting naming with structure.</p><p>As a basic example of how this may break, consider that it's normal and expected to find in the same entity keys with different namespaces, e.g <code>:person/first-name</code> and <code>:myapp.user/signup-date</code>. If you have a SQL database, there's a high chance that you need both attributes as columns of the same table (1): yet the default behaviour of a namespace-aware tool like <a href="https://cljdoc.org/d/seancorfield/next.jdbc/1.1.547/doc/readme"><code>next.jdbc</code></a> is to constrain both keywords to have the same namespace, which would be problematic in this case, and may be viewed as revealing a complecting of attribute naming and storage layout (2).</p><p><i>Notes:</i></p><ul><li><i>(1) Yes, I know about SQL tables normalization... and that you can do too much of it.</i></li><li><i>(2) Don't worry, that won't prevent you from using <code>next.jdbc</code>: this default behaviour is easily opted out of.</i></li></ul><h3 id="'but_clojure.spec_encourages_the_use_of_clojure-namespaced_keywords!'">'But clojure.spec encourages the use of Clojure-namespaced keywords!'</h3><p>Yeah... I know. In a way, Clojure Spec does what I've told you not to do in the previous section: relying programmatically on a naming convention for keywords, as Spec expects the keys you register to be Clojure-namespaced. Pushing further in that direction would be, in my opinion, a design error of clojure.spec.</p><p>That said, clojure.spec does quite sensibly make room for other namespacing conventions (via <code>:req-un</code> and <code>:opt-un</code>), and so clojure.spec is compatible with the recommendation this article is making. The semantics of Clojure Spec would be completely broken if name collisions were allowed, and so it's understandable that it's decided to check for namespacing.</p><h3 id="'this_will_create_inconsistencies_in_our_code_style'">'This will create inconsistencies in our code style'</h3><p><strong>What might worry you:</strong> some parts of your code might be forced to use keywords in lisp-case - for instance, because libraries like Integrant impose them on you. Having these keys in lisp-case and other in snake_case might be disturbing.</p><p>If that's troubling you, you're in for a pleasant surprise: the visual constrast between <code>snake_case</code> and <code>lisp-case</code> actually makes the code <i>more</i> readable, because it's signals which keys are meant for local use and which are meant to travel across the system.</p><p>By the way, you have already seen an instance of readability enhanced by contrasted notation: in Clojure's syntax itself, where parens <code>(... )</code> are used to denote invocations, and square brackets <code>[... ]</code> are used to denote lexical bindings, departing from the Lisp tradition of using …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>This is a (very late) reply to Patrick McKenzie's "<a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice</a>". I find much of his advice very sensible, and it might be very helpful to someone in the beginning of their career – assuming they can act upon it (and I really don't know whether my 20-year-old self could actually use the advice to improve his negotiation skills, for example).</p>
<p>A few things in the article I disagree with, however. Here I'll mostly focus on those few things, recommending you to read the original article so that you don't miss the rest of it.</p>
<p>"Disagree" is not necessarily the right word – a more precise way to put it would be "it's different in my experience". Which is to be expected because both of us are speaking based on our own careers, which have been rather different. Patrick McKenzie is a small business owner running <a href="http://www.bingocardcreator.com/">Bingo Card Creator</a> and a successful consultant. I'm a lead chip architect at a billion-dollar company. Both of us have thus traveled some distance away from "purely programming" (whatever that means), but in rather different directions.</p>
<p><strong>What company are you going to work for?<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Patrick McKenzie says 90% of the jobs involve things like implementing an internal travel expense reporting form, rather than a product shipped to external customers. He advises you to get used to the idea, even though such software is "soul-crushingly boring" as he puts it.</p>
<p>How bad is it, and is it really 90% of the jobs? Spolsky <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/04.html">thinks</a> it's maybe 80% – and that it's bad enough to "drain the life out of you". He goes on to elaborate why it "sucks to be an in-house programmer":</p>
<ul>
<li>There's rarely a business reason to improve in-house software past the point of "barely good enough". "Forget any pride of craftsmanship – you're going to churn out embarrassing junk".</li>
<li>At software companies, what you do is more directly related to the way the company makes money, so you're more likely to be respected. "A programmer is never going to rise to become CEO of Viacom, but you might well rise to become CEO of a tech company." "…no matter how critical it was for Viacom to get this internet thing  right, when it came time to assign people to desks, the in-house  programmers were stuck with 3 people per cubicle in a dark part of the  office".</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that McKenzie and Spolsky are in almost complete agreement over these points. But then Spolsky says you should be gunning for a position in a software company – the environment where creatures of your kind naturally thrive. Conversely, McKenzie explains how to prosper as a programmer outside software companies – <em>moving in the opposite direction of where things go by default</em> (being stuck in a dark part of the office while they're trying to outsource your job.)</p>
<p>So the question is which path you prefer. "Not so fast", you say: one of these jobs is way easier to land – 80-90% of the chances are you're not getting inside a software company – so it's not just a question of preference.</p>
<p>Here I disagree: even if only 10-20% of programmers work in software companies (where are the stats?..), and even if they're "the best" (according to what metric?), McKenzie himself says in that same article:</p>
<blockquote><p>You radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with:&nbsp; Many people already successfully employed as senior engineers cannot actually implement FizzBuzz.</p></blockquote>
<p>But if competition is relatively unskilled on average, you probably can land a job in the 10-20% of the sector that you want – as did most people who graduated around the time I did. So I rather firmly believe that it's a matter of choice: do you <em>want</em> to work on in-house software or one-off businessy projects of that kind, or do you prefer a software company?</p>
<p>Let's proceed to McKenzie's advice to in-house programmers – which should in itself help one make that choice.</p>
<p><strong>How to call yourself<br>
</strong></p>
<p>One such advice is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don't call yourself a programmer. “Programmer” sounds like “anomalously high-cost peon who types some mumbo-jumbo into some other mumbo-jumbo.” Instead, describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previous employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure – an in-house programmer is likely doing some type of expensive mumbo-jumbo in the eyes of his non-technical MBA-wielding manager.</p>
<p>To me, however, a programmer is who I'm looking for, while a resume full of revenue increases and cost reductions sounds like an "anomalously high-cost parasite who types some mumbo-jumbo into Excel and PowerPoint, claiming credit for others' work".</p>
<p>McKenzie says a software company looks at this just like a company hiring internal programmers, essentially. His example is "the guy who wrote the backend billing code that 97% of Google’s revenue passes through – he’s now an angel investor". The guy apparently got rich by being near a "profit center" rather than through his unusual skills.</p>
<p>The thing is, in this case I believe he's talking about <a href="http://www.flownet.com/ron/">Ron Garret</a>, the PhD from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Do you think they hired him because he described his work at the JPL in terms of revenues and costs? (BTW he didn't like working on the billing code, bought his stock options and quit, instead of choosing a career at the company's biggest "profit center".)</p>
<p>Did any unusual skills go into the billing code? Ron Garret <a href="http://www.flownet.com/ron/xooglers.html">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I did end up writing the credit card billing and accounting system, which is a nontrivial thing to get right. Fortunately for me, just before coming to Google I had taken some time to study computer security and cryptography, so I was actually well prepared for that particular task. …I designed the billing system to be secure against even a dishonest employee with root access (which is not such an easy thing to do). I have no idea if they are still using my system, but if they are then I'd feel pretty confident that my credit card number was not going to get stolen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds to me that his technical knowledge and programming ability was the bulk of his contribution, whereas deep thoughts such as realizing that there will be some "cost reduction" due to not having credit card numbers stolen is not something an employer needs to hire anyone for.</p>
<p>So if I ever send out a resume as a chip architect, I will focus on my technical role in transitioning from fixed-function hardware accelerators to programmable processors, more than the manpower this saved and the business we won as a result (which I think were real outcomes of our work, but which is rather hard to quantify – as these things often are unless you're a business-friendly-sounding liar.)</p>
<p>Incidentally, I'm not sure <em>when </em>I'll send out that resume, which brings us to the next point.</p>
<p><strong>On job hopping, backstabbing, and the lack thereof </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Co-workers and bosses are not usually your friends: You will spend a lot of time with co-workers.&nbsp; You may eventually become close friends with some of them, but in general, you will move on in three years…</p>
<p>&lt;your boss will&gt; attempt to do things that none of your actual friends would ever do,  like try to talk you down several thousand dollars in salary or  guilt-trip you into spending more time with the company when you could  be spending time with your actual friends. &nbsp;You will have other  coworkers who — affably and ethically — will suggest things which go  against your interests…</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a certain internal consistency to a view that your coworkers are not your friends, because you will move on in 3 years. In fact, it's a bit circular. They aren't your friends – because you'll move on. And why will you move on? Well, I dunno, maybe for a 10% salary increase. What's there to lose? Relationships with coworkers? But coworkers aren't your friends!</p>
<p>Again, I don't disagree, but rather offer an alternative view, equally internally consistent. I have stayed at one job for more than a decade, in large part because I'm rather attached to the people I work with. To be sure, I got raises, and I was ready to quit over employment terms – but it'd take much more than 10%.</p>
<p>Isn't it just a quantitative difference in preferences – a 10% raise not being fundamentally different than, say, 100%? Well, sufficiently large quantitative changes add up to qualitative changes, as Marxian dialectics or some other Soviet philosophy thingie that my parents sometimes quote taught us. What's going on is that both approaches can lead to career advancement, but they do so very differently.</p>
<p>If you're willing to change jobs over a small raise, you'll be changing them frequently. You won't get attached to people, or to the work you're doing together. You will be very good at finding jobs and you will know what's generally going on in the industry and what's in demand. You will <em>not </em>know that many things specific to any of your employers. <em>You and your employer will become very useful to each other fairly quickly, but you'll also be somewhat expendable for each other.</em></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can keep a job as long as it's a fun environment, requiring a significant raise once in a while. Your relationships with people combined with your long-term outlook can let you do things together that you otherwise couldn't plan or execute, and learn things you wouldn't have learned.</p>
<p>Much of my knowledge about chip design comes from ASIC hackers I worked with, and their willingness to develop their biggest ideas together with me came from trust that necessarily took time to build. It takes time to learn that none of you is in the habit of "suggesting things going against the other's interest", or pulling other unfriendly shenanigans.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you stay at one place for a long while, then your worth to the employer grows to the point where you can get the significant raise that you'd quit over without actually quitting. Your worth can also grow well above what employers are willing to pay to experienced new hires, so there's no longer a point in switching jobs. This is somewhat analogous to becoming a consultant after having switched a …</p></div></div>

It can happen in smaller teams as well. Two features could have been working perfectly fine until they got merged together and broke something. That's a highly possible case. There are many other cases which could cause such hard to understand and subtle bugs which even continuous integration (CI) systems running the entire test suite of our projects couldn't catch.</p><p>We are not going to discuss how such subtle bugs can get into our release branch because that's just a wild territory out there.

The deviation could be any behaviour of our code that we can measure distinctively — either good or bad in general.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Examples of deviations</th><th>Measurement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A commit that introduced a bug or a regression</td><td><code>Good</code> or <code>Bad</code></td></tr><tr><td>A commit that changed the code style</td><td><code>New</code> or <code>Old</code></td></tr><tr><td>A commit caused a benchmark's performance</td><td><code>Fast</code> or <code>Slow</code></td></tr><tr><td>A commit that fixed a bug</td><td><code>Fixed</code> or <code>Broken</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Finding the exact point where it changed the course of our code base in terms of either of such deviations could be difficult to trace down and involves a lot of efforts if we have to do it manually.</p><h2 id="a-common-problem"><a href="#a-common-problem" aria-label="a common problem permalink"></a>A common problem</h2><p>Let's assume an example.</p><p>We are looking for a commit that broke something in our shipment feature which was working perfectly fine until the last release. We had tagged that release commit with <code>v12.1.0-rc4</code>. We also have a few tests in our test suite that can help us identify whether that commit is good or bad. Then just recently, some teams merged their feature branches that introduced about close to hundred of commits into our release branch. That's a normal practice in our project assuming we have a bunch of teams working on different feature branches constantly. Then suddenly our CI service reports a red build for the tests run on the latest release branch. CI marked that build as failed since it found that the tests related to the shipment feature were failing. That's very unfortunate and all teams are worried now. But why everyone has to worry? Because everyone have to start with the code in the release branch as the base code and build features atop meaning they would get same test failures in their feature branches, too and won't be able to merge that without a succsessful build on CI. Such a cascaded effect slows down the overall progress and morale of the teams, right?!</p><div>

  </div></div><p>Because we are the team responisble for the shipment feature, we need to fix those failing tests in the release branch. But everyone in our team is pretty sure that it's not our fault because the overall shipment feature was working until we released <code>v12.1.0-rc4</code>. But anyway we need to triage and fix it, right? So we start with the <code>HEAD</code> commit in the latest release branch. We confirm that the shipment feature breaks on it by running our test suite. Then we keep checking out to each of the previous commits in the Git history until we find a commit where our test suite passes. In a worst case scenario, that succsessful commit could be the one which is tagged with <code>v12.1.0-rc4</code> — meaning we have to checkout to about hundred commits one-by-one to find a good commit. The commit made just after that <strong>good commit</strong> in the commit history tree is what we can refer a <strong>bad commit</strong>.</p><p>If we take such a route, we would end up spending unimaginable hours (or days) chasing down a bad commit.

It requires us to specify a bad commit and at least a good commit (can specify many good commits though to further narrow down the search).

      <p><time datetime="2020-06-27 00:00:00 +0000">27 Jun 2020</time></p><p>Having your application produce the right amount and quality of logs will help you debug faster, optimize better and keep your data safe and secure. I was always fascinated with logging and tried to figure out the best ways to log and create telemetry for my applications.</p>

<p>Having the opportunity to work with multiple startups, I came into close contact with all of Node.js’ major logging packages. Lately, I had the luck to work with highly security aware businesses, for whom security is an existential threat. When tasked with the challenge of creating secure applications for them, I knew without hesitation that I had to create a new library to meet all the new requirements that were at play.</p>

<p>I want to introduce you to <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a>, a versatile and powerful logger for Node.js.</p>

<p><img src="https://thanpol.as/assets/blogimg/planning.jpg" alt="Logging Flow"></p>

<h2 id="the-logging-requirements">The Logging Requirements</h2>

<p>These are the logging requirements that were on the drawing board when Logality was first implemented. I could find some of them in some packages, but not all of them in one package:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#a-common-logging-schema"><strong>Complete Flexibility on Properties</strong></a>. In order for my organization to have a common logging schema, it is required of the logging library to allow the definition of properties from scratch. A lot of the packages make those decisions for you leaving you with no options to normalize the logging schema. The most common example for this is the date field, you can find it as <code>dt</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>timestamp</code> or any other variance, without any option to change the name.</li>
  <li><a href="#serializers-of-data-objects"><strong>Serializers of Data Objects</strong></a>. As <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> is primarily a JSON logger, dealing with data is the most common operation. Being able to serialize known data structures is key in this case. Just drop your user data object to logality and the built-in or your custom serializer will make sure to transform the object so only what you want will be logged.</li>
  <li><a href="#custom-output-and-pretty-print"><strong>Support Custom Outputs</strong></a>. Logality’s Default output is JSON but the library should not limit you as to the kind of output you want, for instance print human readable logs while on development. Custom outputs also allow you to filter log messages so you can suppress dynamically certain types or log levels of messages.</li>
  <li><a href="#logging-metadata"><strong>Logging Metadata</strong></a>. Have the logger automatically log the location of the file that the log originated from. As well as other useful system information (OS version, runtime info, etc).</li>
  <li><a href="#the-power-of-middleware"><strong>Middleware Support</strong></a>. Supporting middleware is a very powerful way to transform and augment each one of your log messages. The options that this feature opens up are endless.</li>
  <li><a href="#linking-multiple-logality-instances"><strong>Logging for Libraries</strong></a>. All open source contributors must have faced this challenge at least once: How do I output logs from my library? This is no easy task, Logality provides an eloquent and powerful solution to this problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these requirements in place, <a href="https://github.com/thanpolas/logality">Logality</a> was created on May 18, 2018. Ever since then the library has been iteratively improving and bug fixed. Today, the current Version is 3.0.0, which was released on April of 2020. In the following sections, we will go through a more detailed analysis of the features and powerful capabilities of Logality.</p>

<h2 id="a-common-logging-schema">A Common Logging Schema</h2>

<p>The more standardized your log messages are, the easier it will be to query, parse and subsequently analyze them. Consequently, your log messages need to have a schema. As we all know, the most ubiquitous format for text based serialization today, is JSON.</p>

<p>Logality is a JSON logger that provides an initial recommendation of a logging schema but allows you to define your own schemas down to the last property.</p>

<p>This is a very important feature. When you are trying to have a common logging schema across multiple operating systems, platforms and programming languages, it is essential that your tooling allows you to be flexible and versatile.</p>

<p>Schema mutation in Logality happens through <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> and <a href="#serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers</a>, both of which we touch on below.</p>



<p>Logality will take care of all your metadata needs so you won’t need to log any additional information. In particular, Logality will automatically resolve and log for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The location of the file where the log originated from.</li>
  <li>The hostname of the machine that runs the application.</li>
  <li>The process id.</li>
  <li>The process name.</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple <code>log.info('hello world')</code> log will produce the following log message (expanded):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"severity"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"level"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"info"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"dt"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2018-05-18T16:25:57.815Z"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"message"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"hello world"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"event"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span><span>
    </span><span>"context"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"runtime"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"application"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"testLogality"</span><span>
        </span><span>},</span><span>
        </span><span>"source"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>"file_name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/test/spec/surface.test.js"</span><span>
        </span><span>},</span><span>
        </span><span>"system"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"hostname"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"localhost"</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"pid"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>36255</span><span>,</span><span>
            </span><span>"process_name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"node ."</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the use of <a href="#the-power-of-middleware">Middleware</a> you can create and attach your own metadata on each one of your log messages.</p>

<h2 id="serializers-of-data-objects">Serializers of Data Objects</h2>

<p>As standardization of logging data is a primary requirement for Logality, serializers were introduced to solve the problem of consistently logging known data objects.</p>

<p>Let’s take for example the User Data Object (UDO) and the action of logging in, you could log the event as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>`User </span><span>${</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>}</span><span> logged in`</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But that is not a JSON log message, that is a string log message and it is not easily query-able. Let’s try this again with Logality’s JSON logging feature:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>User logged in</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>user</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we passed the UDO to logality, however, Logality has no instruction of what portions of the UDO we want logged and here is where serializers come in. Serializers are simple functions that take the objects that you pass as input and output the properties that you want to have logged.</p>

<p>This way, you standardize how your models are logged across your infrastructure and protect your system from logging sensitive fields like a user’s password or unnecessary information like meta data of a product.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-middleware">The Power of Middleware</h2>

<p>Logality introduces middleware which allows you to manipulate and mutate the logging messages as you see fit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>((</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Remove user data object from logging</span>
    <span>delete</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>user</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Add debugging flag on all messages</span>
    <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>debug</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Middleware, you can create powerful data flows, augmenting log messages as they come in with rich metadata information collected from the environment and runtime.</p>

<p>You can also have conditional transformations of the data that pass through logality for absolute control over the data flows and your compliance requirements.</p>

<h2 id="linking-multiple-logality-instances">Linking Multiple Logality Instances</h2>

<p>As an open source contributor, one of the biggest problems I have been challenged with is how to log on open source libraries. If you want to have logging on your library you are challenged with quite a few problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide an option to turn off logging.</li>
  <li>Provide a way to filter the logging level.</li>
  <li>How do you format the logs according to your downstream application’s standards?</li>
  <li>Should you log to stdout, an event or a function?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are very challenging problems, to the point where no practical solution exists. Until today that is, as Logality introduces piping. You can pipe one Logality instance into another and have all the middleware functions handle the piped logality’s log messages. When Logality is piped, the log messages get passed as pure data objects so that the downstream consuming function can properly parse and manipulate them.</p>

<p>This is huge as it enables your application to granularly control how much information is logged from the libraries you are using. And at the same time have your third-party libraries log in the exact same format-schema that your entire infrastructure is logging. Isn’t that great?</p>

<p>Piping happens simply by providing the child Logality instance to the parent’s <code>pipe()</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>thirdPartyLibrary</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>thirdparty</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<span>applicationLogality</span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>thirdPartyLibrary</span><span>.</span><span>logality</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, after all the processing the log message has gone through, you can control how the final serialization and output is handled. By default Logality will JSON serialize and output to stdout but you may have other plans.</p>

<p>This operation also enables you to filter certain log messages based on your custom criteria. This is particularly useful when managing multiple log streams from various upstreams (third-party libraries) that are piping their logs to your main application Logality logger.</p>

<p>Logality also offers a built-in pretty print functionality that, as the word suggests, will print the log messages in a human readable format, with nice colors, emojis and all. This is particularly useful when you are developing the application and don’t want to see JSON serialized log messages.</p>

<h2 id="synchronous-or-asynchronous">Synchronous or Asynchronous?</h2>

<p>With a flick of a switch you can have Logality become asynchronous and reveal its Promise API. When in async mode, Logality’s Middleware and Custom Output functions will be able to handle a promise and allow you to capture log messages en-route.</p>

<p>Say you want to push all log messages to a queue, or for any reason, you want to store some, or all, of the log messages into your database. By enabling async mode on Logality you can easily and safely perform those tasks:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Security middleware for logality, store the log message</span>
<span>// in our database as well and send it to our queue for</span>
<span>// further processing and alerting</span>
<span>logality</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>security</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>/* ... */</span>

<span>// login failed, log it</span>
<span>await</span> <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>warn</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Login Failed</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>security</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you rightfully observed, when async mode is enabled Logality’s logging is, well, async, and thus returns a promise that needs to be resolved. Therefore, that is why you see the <code>await</code> before the <code>log.warn()</code> invocation.</p>

<p>Personally, my use case for using async mode and secondary data stores <a href="https://srop.co/" title="SROP The Secure Drop">at SROP</a> was for auditing log trails. When an audit log event occurred, …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Cross-compiling self-contained Java desktop application launchers.</p><h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2><p>Java’s promise of <em>write once, run anywhere</em> still resonates with me, perhaps because I cut my teeth on JDK 1.0.2b. It was amazing to write cross-platform networking applications without concern for variations in POSIX implementations, or having to worry about nuances between C compilers, or even needing to grok <code>htons</code>. Someone else could wrestle with <code>#ifdef</code>s, shielding others by high-level, standard abstractions. Although Smalltalk had concocted platform-independence punch in 1983, it wasn’t until 1996 that Java’s virtual machine (VM) and subsequent OEM distributions made drinking the mantra of cross-platform development an easy reality.</p><p>Strategically—and selfishly—Microsoft smote that future with a sledgehammer: it moved to <em>embrace and extend</em> Java to achieve vendor lock-in, splintering the platform.</p><p>Developers can no longer rely on systems having a Java VM available. This implies that end-users must download (and install) two independent programs: a suitable VM and a Java archive. It also means that developers now have choices ahead of them that were once bygone worries. Choices that burden end-users and developers alike. Asking people to download a VM for their operating system and CPU architecture is a barrier to product adoption. What’s worse is that some VMs now support “full” Java while others don’t support JavaFX modules at all.</p><p>We’ll address that last point later.</p><p>In late 2019, <a href="https://github.com/kevinrushforth">Kevin Rushforth</a>, of Oracle’s Java Team, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZGW9AalZLN4?t=504">presented</a> a solution to the packaging problem: <code>jpackage</code> and <code>jlink</code>. During the presentation he listed some of the tooling’s shortcomings, which include:</p><ul><li>No cross-platform deployment</li><li>No cross-compilation (must run on MacOS to produce <code>.dmg</code>)</li></ul><p>Let’s not mince words: Java developers could once build applications on their preferred operating system and deploy anywhere; now, they must build installers for every individual platform they intend to target on those very systems.</p><p>Was that the <em>punch-line</em> to a two-decade lead up?</p><p>Requiring developers to have at least two commercial operating systems (Windows, MacOS X), even if emulated inside of a virtualized container—as opposed to using physical hardware—for a platform-independent programming language is an ironic barrier to entry. <em>Especially</em> for people bereft of bankroll.</p><p>Yes, those tools—alongside modules—help produce minimal executables. Who cares? What they don’t do is make it possible to create a set of native, standalone launcher binaries from a single build machine. Let’s fix that by pouring over the big splashes of how to cross-compile application launchers for Java on one build machine. We’ll use Linux because it’s free.</p><h2 id="software-requirements">Software Requirements</h2><p>You will need:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/dgiagio/warp">Warp Packer</a>, a tool for building native application launchers</li><li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, a source code management tool</li><li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>, a tool for fetching files</li><li><a href="https://gradle.org/">gradle</a> version 6.4.1, a build system</li><li><a href="https://dave.autonoma.ca/blog/2020/06/29/write-once-build-anywhere/build-template">build-template</a>, my own starter shell script (MIT licensed)</li></ul><p>Install <code>git</code> and <code>wget</code> using the package manager for your Linux distro.</p><h3 id="install-warp-packer">Install Warp Packer</h3><p>The installation instructions for Warp Packer are a bit buried. Install the software on a Linux system as follows (change the version number to suit):</p><pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/bin
cd $HOME/bin
wget -O warp-packer \
  https://github.com/dgiagio/warp/releases/download/v0.3.0/linux-x64.warp-packer
chmod +x warp-packer</code></pre><p>If needed, include <code>$HOME/bin</code> in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable by adding the following line to <code>$HOME/.bashrc</code>:</p><pre><code>export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"</code></pre><p>Apply the new environment settings by opening a new terminal or <code>source</code>’ing the <code>.bashrc</code> file directly.</p><p>Warp Packer is installed.</p><h3 id="install-build-template">Install Build Template</h3><p>Copy, move, or download <code>build-template</code> into <code>$HOME/bin</code>.</p><p>The build template is installed.</p><h2 id="javafx">JavaFX</h2><p>Before we get into building a Java application, a little more history is warranted. Originally, the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) came bundled with Java, for the same reasons that having a bundled networking API was useful. The AWT lacked aesthetic, both in appearance and as a library. Swing, the AWT’s successor, made strides to address both, but fell short. JavaFX, which was also initially bundled with Java (versions 8 to 10), is a modern graphical user interface (GUI) library for developing desktop applications, as well as a superb replacement for Swing.</p><p>It has been argued that JavaFX should never have been bundled with Java. Nevertheless, the decision to un-bundle JavaFX from Java 11 onwards has led to Java projects that will be stuck with old Java versions for years to come—possibly leading to their abandonment—because it takes <em>a lot</em> of effort to migrate a build process to support these new, un-bundled Java Development Kits (JDKs).</p><p>Part of that effort entails re-bundling JavaFX. There are a few ways this can be accomplished:</p><ul><li>Create a single <em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11947093/59087">überjar</a></em> that contains native libraries for all intended platform targets.</li><li>Create separate <em>überjars</em>, with each JAR containing native libraries specific to its target platform.</li></ul><p>It’s almost a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_choice">Hobson’s choice</a> because we have to create launcher binaries for each target platform anyway. Meaning bundling all of the target platform libraries into each native launcher is wasteful; however, bundling them in a single JAR file for those who have a Java VM installed already may be somewhat useful.</p><p>Java has introduced the concept of modules, looking to simplify the build process. Sometimes, though, modules cannot be included because of outdated dependencies. Problems can arise when running <code>jlink</code> against old dependencies. Compounding the issue is when the projects have been sundowned or have long release schedules. Nevertheless, for our purposes, we’ll want to download a version of OpenJDK that supports JavaFX.</p><p>With that background in mind, let’s go cross-compile some binaries.</p><h2 id="java-application">Java Application</h2><p>We’ll create native application launchers for <a href="https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar/">Scrivenvar</a>, a JavaFX-based text editor that I’ve been developing.</p><p>Dive in by cloning the latest version as follows:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p $HOME/dev
cd $HOME/dev
git clone https://github.com/DaveJarvis/scrivenvar.git
cd scrivenvar</code></pre><p>The application is downloaded.</p><h2 id="build-scripts">Build Scripts</h2><p>Let’s review the scripts that help build the application, which include:</p><ul><li><code>build.gradle</code> — builds application Java Archive (JAR) files</li><li><code>installer</code> — builds native, standalone binaries</li></ul><p>Separating the <code>installer</code> script’s responsibilities from <code>build.gradle</code> is not necessary, technically. When running third-party executables (e.g., <code>warp-packer</code>), my first inclination is to use a shell script, rather than gradle’s <code>exec</code>.</p><p>The <code>installer</code> script invokes <code>gradle</code> when requested.</p><h2 id="gradle-script">Gradle Script</h2><p>Open up <code>build.gradle</code> to review a few pertinent code blocks.</p><h3 id="target-operating-system">Target Operating System</h3><p>The first snippet determines what native JavaFX libraries (i.e., target platform code) to include within the JAR file:</p><pre><code>String[] os = ["win", "mac", "linux"]

if (project.hasProperty('targetOs')) {
  if ("windows".equals(targetOs)) {
    os = ["win"]
  }
  else {
    os = [targetOs]
  }
}</code></pre><p>Unless instructed otherwise, the build script will create a JAR file that includes JavaFX binaries for Windows, Linux, and MacOS embedded. We can target a specific platform by using the <code>-P</code> command line option when building, such as:</p><pre><code>gradle clean build jar -PtargetOs=linux</code></pre><p>There’s a catch here in that <code>win</code> and <code>windows</code> are different names. The <code>installer</code> script needs to use <code>windows</code> because that’s part of the JDK file name being downloaded. Arguably, we could move that logic into the <code>installer</code> script, but the point is that the JDK filename and JavaFX refer to Windows using different terminology. The difference must be captured somwhere.</p><h3 id="javafx-dependencies">JavaFX Dependencies</h3><p>The second snippet tells the build system to include JavaFX for a given set of operating systems, as follows:</p><pre><code>def fx = ['controls', 'graphics', 'fxml', 'swing']

fx.each { fxitem -&gt;
  os.each { ositem -&gt;
    runtimeOnly "org.openjfx:javafx-${fxitem}:${javafx.version}:${ositem}"
  }
}</code></pre><p>The application uses JavaFX controls, graphics, fxml, and notice that it also lists a JavaFX-Swing integration. Using <code>.each</code> is a tidy way of not having to maintain a list of JavaFX-specific imports for each operating system, should either or both need to change.</p><h3 id="javafx-exclusions">JavaFX Exclusions</h3><p>Of lesser importance are exclude groups:</p><pre><code>implementation('de.jensd:fontawesomefx-fontawesome:4.7.0-11') {
  exclude group: 'org.openjfx'
}</code></pre><p>Without excluding JavaFX from certain JavaFX-related dependencies, the build will fail. Unfortunately, the build fails in such a way that the developer must investigate what package caused the conflict. Ideally, the build failure would pinpoint any collisions for the developer.</p><h3 id="run-application">Run Application</h3><p>The last point of note are the following lines:</p><pre><code>applicationDefaultJvmArgs = [
    "--add-opens=javafx.controls/javafx.scene.control=ALL-UNNAMED",
    "--add-opens=javafx.controls/javafx.scene.control.skin=ALL-UNNAMED",
    "--add-opens=javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.css=ALL-UNNAMED",
]</code></pre><p>These lines address permissions issues encountered when running the application using gradle, such as:</p><pre><code>gradle clean build run</code></pre><p>Now that we understand how this build script works, let’s move on to the <code>installer</code> shell script.</p><h2 id="installer-script">Installer Script</h2><p>Looking at the big picture, the <code>installer</code> script performs the following steps to create a native launcher binary:</p><ol type="1"><li>Configure platform-specific parameters for extraction.</li><li>Rebuild the <em>überjar</em> for the target platform.</li><li>Clean out the distribution directory for a fresh build.</li><li>Extract the target JDK into the distribution directory.</li><li>Create a platform-dependent launch script to run the application.</li><li>Copy the <em>überjar</em> into the distribution directory.</li><li>Wrap the distribution into a standalone binary.</li></ol><p>These high-level steps can be found in the <code>execute()</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at how the script works.</p><h3 id="build-template">Build Template</h3><p>The <code>build-template</code> script is described in depth in the first three parts of my Typesetting Markdown series. We reuse the script here because it simplifies writing user-friendly shell scripts.</p><p>Downloading and extracting a requisite JDK is pivotal. JDKs can be downloaded from a few places, but most of them have …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">  <p>When casting from YouTube to a Chromecast, sometimes the audio playback will <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/thread/13807879?hl=en">skip</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/17251626?hl=en">stutter</a>. This issue is independent of the quality of the video, the FPS, or the internet connection. Trying to watch certain videos will reliably cause playback issues on the Chromecast.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/thread/13807879">this thread</a>, the playback issue only appeared in the latest and final firmware update for the Chromecast. Successful playback of the videos was possible in the past, and casting the downloaded YouTube videos eliminates the problem entirely. The problem exists solely when casting certain videos using the YouTube app.</p>  <p>Given that the problem only occurs with the YouTube app, you can download a video and cast it via <a href="https://github.com/xat/castnow"><code>castnow</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt"><code>catt</code></a>, skipping the YouTube app entirely.</p> <p>You could do something like:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>export </span><span>url</span><span>=</span><span>"https://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg"</span>

<span>function </span>cast<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>url</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>
    
    <span>filename</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>youtube-dl <span>--get-filename</span> <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    youtube-dl <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
    
    <span># wait a bit to download the file</span>
    castnow <span>"</span><span>$filename</span><span>"</span>
    <span>rm</span> <span>"</span><span>$filename</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

cast <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>But having to skip using the YouTube app to cast is already a clunky solution, and downloading every video before playing them is an even worse user experience. Instant playback and ephemeral streams are what make for a pleasant video streaming experience in 2020, and this solution implements neither of them</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md">Since <code>youtube-dl</code> allows us to output to <code>stdout</code></a>, if we can hook its <code>stdout</code> to a casting app, we could emulate the instant playback and ephemeral videos we expect because we don’t have to wait for an entire file to download.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <code>castnow</code> and <code>catt</code> won’t cast from <code>stdin</code>. You’re expected to pass it file locations to cast from.</p> <p>This is where one of my favorite shell features really shines: <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html">process substitution</a>.</p> <p>With process substitution, Bash gives us a convenient way to make ephemeral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_pipe">anonymous pipes</a>. This method is both efficient and concurrent, making this primitive an apt choice to build a solution to the problem at hand. A process reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">pipe</a> blocks until the pipe is opened by another process for writing. A process writing to the pipe will suspend until the pipe’s buffer is read by another process. The anonymous pipe will automatically remove itself, and when it is manually removed, its dependent processes will be terminated.</p> <p>When using process substitution, a process’ <code>stdout</code> is hooked up to an anonymous pipe. That pipe can be accessed from a file descriptor, and the location of the pipe is given to the calling process.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
/dev/fd/63

<span>$ </span><span>cat</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"Content sent to pipe"</span><span>)</span>
Content sent to pipe
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In the example above, the <code>&lt;(command)</code> syntax is how we invoke process substitution in Bash. The output of <code>command</code> is written to an anonymous pipe, and the calling process is given the location of the file descriptor to access that pipe.</p> <p>Using that example, we can take advantage of process substitution:</p> <div><div><pre><code>vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The command above will play the YouTube video locally with <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a>, and illustrates that process substitution can work for our use case.</p> <p>However, when we try to use <code>castnow</code>, we can’t cast from the pipe:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>castnow &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: Load failed
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Nor can we cast with <code>catt</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>catt cast &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
Error: The chosen file does not exist.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We know we can use VLC locally, and VLC also lets you cast to a Chromecast using its IP address.</p> <p>Let’s try that again using VLC:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>cast_vlc<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>

    <span># get the ip address for chromecast.lan host</span>
    <span>ip</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>dig +short chromecast.lan | <span>tail</span> <span>-n</span> 1<span>)</span>

    vlc <span>-I</span> ncurses <span>\</span>
      <span>--sout</span> <span>'#chromecast'</span> <span>\</span>
      <span>--sout-chromecast-ip</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$ip</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
      <span>--demux-filter</span><span>=</span>demux_chromecast <span>\</span>
      <span>"</span><span>$path</span><span>"</span> &lt; /dev/tty
<span>}</span>

cast_vlc &lt;<span>(</span>youtube-dl <span>-q</span> <span>-o</span> - <span>"</span><span>$url</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

What’s written to the pipe is read from the pipe in first in, first out order. This behavior maps well to video streaming.</p> <p>While you can interact with anonymous and named pipes like you would a file, the interface isn’t 1:1 with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Regular_file">standard file</a>. You cannot <code>seek()</code> forward or backward in pipe, you can just read the next forward values. For our use case, that means we cannot skip forward or backward in our streaming videos. We can only play, pause or stop the video.</p> <p>That’s not a problem for me, however it’s something that can be mitigated if it’s a problem for you. The first solution I can think of would be to write to a temporary file via <code>youtube-dl</code> and read from it. Or <a href="https://alexdelorenzo.dev/programming/2019/04/14/buffer">perhaps a temporary spooled file can act as a buffer for the pipe</a>, such that you can <code>seek()</code> through the buffer, but the buffer itself is ephemeral unlike a normal file.</p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/dCcLQ5TLFANMj0p3Uh/giphy.gif" alt="Press F to pay respects"></p>
<p>For a year or so I have owned a nice fake-vintage radio/bluetooth speaker that originally caught my eye for sale in a FedEx office. The front has a quite nice VFD-style LED to show the status, a volume knob and four hard buttons. It has Bluetooth, USB, AUX and FM input. The radio and bluetooth was not bad, but there was nothing to be impressed about. It was definitely not "smart."</p>
<p>I decided to hack it to make it a bit smarter: to do AirPlay and be a smart alarm clock and whatever else I could think of. Since it was inexpensive, I had nothing to lose and everything to win. I thought putting a Raspberry Pi 0 or something in it would be nice.</p>
<p>My original plan was to somehow figure out how to hijack all the external components and control them to make the front and back of the radio as neat-looking as possible. At least I hoped to hijack the speaker, the volume knob, and the buttons. The problem I foresaw was that those components are often not documented and there was little chance that I could get a datasheet for them. I was very worried that I might have to give up the fake-VFD LED screen.</p>
<p>It turns out that I had to spend a year hacking it on and off. Here goes.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/fedex-sale.jpg" alt="FedEx sale"></p>
<p>First, I gutted the radio and saw that it has a main PCB with the LED panel directly soldered to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/radio-disassembled.jpg" alt="Disassembled radio"></p>
<p>The chip on the PCB isn't something I recognized. Luckily, the knob and the hard buttons are on a separate breakout board and are connected to the mainboard via a connector.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/main-pcb.jpg" alt="Main PCB"></p>
<h2 id="the-speaker">The speaker</h2>
<p>The speaker is also easy to deal with, as it is completely ordinary. It only required me to desolder it from the mainboard. As the Pi 0 has no built-in soundcard, I had to get a separate sound card for it.</p>
<h3 id="audio-injector-zero">Audio Injector Zero</h3>
<p>Initially, I used the Audio Injector Zero that I have no use for normally. To save space, I decided to permanently sandwich the Audio Injector to the Pi 0. I also had to buy a cheap amp for it, as the sound card can't directly drive the speaker.</p>
<p>One little issue was that the sound card produces stereo input, and the amp is also stereo, but I only have one speaker. I needed to mix both channels left and right to that speaker somehow. To that end, I am sure a Linux guru could make it work with configuring the sound card in software. However, I am not extremely well-versed with how ALSA or Pulse Audio works. I just wired both channels left and right of the amp to one channel input of the amp to mix the channels. For power, the amp needs 5V input, so I siphoned the two power pins from the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>I was surprised when the amp produced a very annoying hum. The hum was extremely noticeable when the Pi is under load. I don't know exactly why this happens, but I spent way too much time on this with no significant improvement. Ultimately, I decided it's the cheap amp that was giving me a hard time, because it was way too noisy. I know the Audio Injector itself was okay because the headphones output was clean.</p>
<h3 id="google-aiy-voice-hat">Google AIY voice hat</h3>
<p>After giving up on the Audio Injector Zero + Amp solution, I tried a different route: Drive the speaker directly with the Google AIY voice bonnet hat. Because the Google AIY sound card doesn't provide an easy way to set up on a plain raspbian, I just got their distro and started from there.</p>
<p>The speaker was hum-free after switching to the Google AIY soundcard. The tradeoff was that the Google Voice Bonnet V2 sound card made the stack quite a bit thicker. It has a female row of pins soldered on it, so I couldn't solder it directly on top of the Pi Zero.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/sound-cards.jpg" alt="Sound cards"></p>

<p>The front panel of the radio has two sets of elements: A knob of some sort to control the volume and four hard buttons. It has four wires hanging out of it. After I inspected the traces on the PCB, it was apparent that there is one common ground. The three other pins are for the buttons and the knob. All of the buttons are connected to a single pin, and the volume knob is connected to the other two.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/buttons-knob.jpg" alt="Buttons and knobs"></p>
<p>As a software person, I didn't know what the knob is called. <a href="http://dbindner.freeshell.org/">Dr. Don Bindner</a> suggested that the button might be a rotary encoder, and that turned out to be true. It seemed <a href="http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Rotary-encoder-circuit.php">trivial enough to read the knob</a>.</p>
<p>The buttons are more interesting. After poking around with a multimeter, it turned out that the buttons were tactile but each of them is connected in series to a different resistor. Then they all connect out to the same pin. The software in the chip scans the pin and figures out what button was pressed by sampling from an Analog-to-Digital (ADC) Converter reading. As the Pi has no ADC, we need something else that has an ADC to figure out what the button was pressed. Of course, I could as well hijack the tactile buttons and not have to deal with the ADC stuff but that seemed too aesthetically unpleasant for me.</p>
<p>I decided to pull out anArduino Pro Micro clone that I bought from China years ago. My reasoning for using the Pro Micro:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Arduino Pro Micro is super cheap: $2 cheap.</li>
<li>Even if I could add an ADC to the Pi, I need to continuously read the ADC from the Pi. That is a pain in the neck. I can't guarantee the timings on the Pi without going to a lot of care.</li>
<li>The Pro Micro can emulate a keyboard over USB, so the Pi can use triggerhappy to catch it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So with that, I made my arduino sketch and it worked out. I wanted to emulate the Winamp-style buttons ZXCV for multimedia keys and UD for volume up/down. Later on, I was quite annoyed with it because the keyboard dumps the keystrokes to the terminal, and <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/very-odd-bug-found-in-jailbreaking-process-20081109/">it could be bad</a>. I decided to implement the keys as multimedia keys. Unfortunately, you need a HID library to implement multimedia keys. Luckily, there is a library called <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/HID">HID-Project</a> to achieve exactly what I wanted. After some tweakings for debounce, I could get the volume knob and the buttons to work exactly as I expected:</p>

<p>I could test the Arduino implementation right on my development computer with <code>xev</code> so that was really nice.</p>
<h2 id="the-fake-vfd-led-screen">The fake VFD LED screen</h2>
<p>The screen was the part that I had the most doubt about being able to control, because I have never worked with such a device before. Before trying to reverse-engineer it, I tried to look up similar 7-segment LED screens online hoping to find something similar. Those screens often have more than 8 pins (1 for the ground, 7 for each segment, and some more to select the digit. This one is nothing like that: It has only 7 pins. I wanted to give it up and just buy another screen that has a datasheet to save myself from trouble but I couldn't find anything that would fit into the original cutout for the screen. So I had to bite the bullet and hack the LED screen (I had nothing better to do in the craziness of the pandemic).</p>
<h3 id="general-workings">General workings</h3>
<p>There was no giveaway from the PCB what the ground pin for the display might be. I only had a multimeter in hand so what I did was set it to the diode tester mode. Then I probed pairs of pins to see what lights up. As luck would have it, I found out that each pair of pins lit up a different segment on the screen. So there was no common ground at all! I drew the screen and noted what pin pair light up each segment (excuse my nasty draft paper):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/fake-radio-hack/matrix-draft.jpg" alt="Draft Matrix"></p>
<p>First, I was really annoyed because the screen is yet another custom device I had to reverse engineer. Then, it really impressed me that this screen is quite well designed for such a cheap device. There were exactly 42 segments on this LED screen! The number of different segments is exactly the maximum number of permutations between any 2 pins: P(7,2) = 42. After some more digging, I found out that this wiring scheme is called <a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/charlieplexing/">Charlieplexing</a>. So each LED segment has a voltage drop of 1.860V, and my Arduino is 5V. I assumed a 20mA current and used a LED calculator and to figure out that I need to connect a 150K resistor to the LED. Because of the charlieplexing setup, I actually need half of that resistance for each pin (it will be apparent as you read on), so I soldered a 68K resistor to each pin.</p>
<h3 id="control-the-led-screen-programmatically">Control the LED screen programmatically</h3>
<p>The question then became how to control this LED screen programmatically. It was clear to me I can't possibly draw every segment by toggling the pins on and off in one whole sweep. Then I realized that I need to think of the LED screen like an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r38nVmxBfvM">analog TV screen</a>. Thus, each of the pins can be thought of as a horizontal scanline – except they are not on the same “line”! This might be quite obvious to those who have dealt with CRTs in the past (which I have not), but it might be hard to imagine for those who grew up with LCDs.</p>
<p>Let's say I want to draw the screen with segment 17, 18, and 11 lit up. That means I have to do two sweeps. First, pull pin 1 to GND and pull pin 2 to V_LED to light up segment 18. Then, pull pin 4 to GND and pull pin 1 and 7 to V_LED to light up segment 17 and 11 at once. Do it fast enough, and my eyes won't be able to tell we are flashing them!</p></div></div>

        <p>Local economies around the U.S. have continued to change quickly and dramatically – states and cities are slowly reopening, unemployment rates are starting to decline from the recent all-time high, COVID-19 cases are increasing in some states while decreasing in others, and communities are responding to the social unrest and George Floyd protests with city-wide curfews having impacted many businesses that were just able to reopen.</p>
        <p>Yelp last reported on the state of the local economy in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/yea-q1-2020.html">our quarterly Yelp Economic Average report on April 28</a>, showing how much consumer activity in major swathes of Main Street had dropped off in just a couple of weeks in March. Now as states start to reopen and the nation responds to anti-Black racism and police brutality, a new set of challenges lay ahead for local economies.</p>

      <h2>Some Businesses Slowly Reopen, While Many Permanently Close</h2>
        <p>As of June 15, there were nearly 140,000 total business closures on Yelp since March 1. In April we reported more than 175,000 business closures, indicating that more than 20% of businesses closed in April have reopened. Las Vegas, NV, endured the highest number of closures relative to the number of businesses in the city (1,921 total closures), while Los Angeles, CA, had the largest total number of closures (11,774 total closures).</p>

        <p>Of all business closures on Yelp since March 1, 41% are permanent closures. Our data shows the largest spikes of permanent closures occurred in March, followed by May and June, indicating that the businesses that were already struggling had to permanently close right away and the businesses that were trying to hold on, but unable to weather the COVID-19 storm, were forced to shutter in recent months.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Retail and Restaurant Businesses Continue Innovating Amid High Closure Rates</h2>
        <p>While many business sectors have struggled during COVID-19 there are a few industries that have endured especially high closure rates. Among those with the highest rate of business closures are shopping and retail (27,663 closed businesses), restaurants (23,981 closed businesses), beauty (15,348 closed businesses) and fitness (5,589 closed businesses).</p>
        <p>Retail was by far the hardest hit, experiencing the highest number of total closures, with the average daily rate continuing to increase since March. Of all closures on Yelp since March 1, 20% are for retail businesses and 35% of closed retail businesses are indicated as permanent on Yelp.</p>
        <p>In March, Restaurants had the highest number of business closures, compared to other industries, and have continued to close at high rates. Of the businesses that closed, 17% are restaurants, and 53% of those restaurant closures are indicated as permanent on Yelp. Restaurants run on thin margins and can sometimes take months or even years to break even, resulting in this higher rate of permanent closures.</p>

Many restaurants pivoted to offering takeout and delivery, while some experimented with take home meal and drink kits, and even virtual cooking classes. Some are finding new ways to use existing technology, like <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.yelp.com/2020/04/use-waitlist-online-takeout-restaurants?utm_source=biz_blog&amp;utm_medium=yelp_blog&amp;utm_content=blog_text_link">Yelp Waitlist to manage curbside pickup</a>. Servicing food to-go produces high margins for restaurants, and we’ve seen a 10X increase in searches for takeout since March 10.</p>
        <p>With many retail businesses shifting to curbside pickup, we’ve seen consumer interest spike in obtaining their goods in this way with a 20% increase in searches for curbside pickup. In the beauty industry we’ve seen hair stylists offering video hair cutting tutorials, estheticians offering virtual consultations, and small shops shifting their focus to ecommerce. Fitness in particular has seen a significant shift in their business model with gyms and studios offering virtual classes and personal trainers offering one-on-one virtual training sessions. If nothing else, local businesses owners have proven themselves to be resilient and creative during these trying times.</p>

      <h2>The Desire to Support Black-Owned Businesses Continues to Grow</h2>
        <p>As acknowledgement of anti-Black racism and police brutality become more wide-spread across the nation people are continuing to look for ways to support the Black community. Since May 25, we’ve seen a 1785% relative increase in searches for Black-owned businesses, compared to the three weeks prior. Review mentions of “Black-owned” (and related terms) also skyrocketed, up 426%, as people look to support and surface these businesses to the community.</p>
        <p>D.C. had the highest number of Black-owned searches, accounting for nearly 1% of all searches on Yelp, followed by Minnesota, Maryland, Michigan and Georgia. In fact, every state has shown an increase in searches for Black-owned businesses. Looking at metros, Ann Arbor, MI has the highest increase in searches for Black-owned, up 105X (accounting for 3% of all searches), followed by Denver (up 27X), Minneapolis (up 23X) and Baltimore (up 19X).</p>

      <h2>The Recovering Economy May Look Different Than the Old Economy</h2>
        <p>While some normal activity is starting to bounce back, due to the many changes impacting local economies — state rules, consumer behavior, and social unrest — many of the consumer interest shifts we saw in March and April started to rebound in May, with dramatic shifts in June.</p>
        <p>Outdoor activities that became popular at the height of the pandemic as people were finding ways to stay active while social distancing – such as mountain biking (down 40%), lakes (down 34%), golf (down 33%) and hiking (down 28%) – have dropped in consumer interest since May 1 relative to other active activities. People are starting to feel more comfortable participating in indoor activities, with increased consumer interest for escape games (up 182%), Go Karts (up 147%), axe throwing (up 113%), gyms (up 81%), bowling (up 63%) and yoga (42%). That said, in some instances people are still finding ways to stay outdoors while social distancing with an increased interest in mini golf (up 132%), amusement parks (up 28%) and horseback riding (up 21%).</p>
        <p>The previous spike in community supported agriculture and grocery has started to dip (down 54% and 26%, respectively) as people start heading back into restaurants. In fact, Yelp’s diners seated data shows significantly more people are dining-in at restaurants. During the peak of the pandemic, the number of diners seated across Yelp Reservations and Waitlist dropped essentially to zero. In early June, we've seen diners seated come back substantially – now down 57% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Restaurants that cater to group dining are among those making a comeback – fondue (up 123%), tapas bars (up 98%), hot pot (up 49%) and surprisingly, even buffets (up 17%) – as foods that gained increased interest through takeout and delivery have started to fall – pizza (down 28%), chinese (down 26%), fast food (down 18%). That said, takeout and delivery has continued to sustain interest on Yelp, still up 148% based on consumer interest relative to pre-pandemic levels, indicating this could be a trend that’s here to stay.</p>
        <p>People are also headed back into malls with outlet stores, shopping centers and thrift stores all up (up 84%, 81%, 72%, respectively), as well as hosting or attending formal events with increased interest in bridal (up 70%) and formal wear (up 102%). The previous increase in cannabis dispensaries, head shops and tobacco shops has declined (down 40%, 35% and 32%, respectively). There have also been significant shifts in consumer interest for health and wellness businesses with an increased interest in saunas (up 75%), reflexology (up 69%) and dentists (up 28%), while skilled nursing (down 46%) and hospitals (down 37%) decline.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The finance world is quickly entering the mainstream —</p><p>Every month a notable company goes public. Every week a hot startup raises millions of dollars. And every day moms, pops, and teens check on their stocks. </p><p>Whether a company builds rocket engines or mobile apps, they tell their story using the same language —&nbsp;financial statements. Here's how they work.</p><p>Let's say you run a subscription t-shirt business.</p><p>It's going well — you have happy customers and healthy profit. You're thinking of buying your own factory to make more t-shirts, more quickly, and more cheaply.</p><p>There's just one problem — you can't afford a factory.</p><p>So, you ask the bank for a loan. Your company is profitable and the factory will pay for itself in 3 years, so you know you'll be able to pay it back. But while you know this, the bank doesn't — you'll need to convince them. The bank, however, doesn't know anything about the subscription clothing business.</p><p>To get on the same page, you need a shared language for talking about your business.</p><p><h4 id="heading-1">Double-entry Bookkeeping: The birth of accounting</h4></p><p>Double-entry bookkeeping was the first formalism in finance. The Middle East had it in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40697986" target="_blank">first century AD</a>, Korea independently got it in the <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/issn/1598-2661" target="_blank">11th century</a>, and by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627232023/http://130.74.92.202:82/record=b1000778" target="_blank">1500s</a>, it had been well-documented across Europe.</p><p>It's a simple concept designed to reduce errors when documenting transactions: every entry to an "account" requires an equal and opposite entry to another "account".</p><p>If you bought some cotton to turn into t-shirts, you might record the transaction like this:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-371c827e421c-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde0379b53032713cde77_bookkeeping.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>When you spend $100 on cotton, your "Cash" account gets debited (loses) $100, and your "Materials" account gets credited (gains) $100. The underlying principle is that <em>you can't create something out of nothing</em>.</p><p>This might seem contrived, but with more and more transactions, it can help you spot errors. Since every entry has an equal and opposite entry, the sum of all the debits should always equal the sum of all the credits. If not, you know you made a mistake, and you can look back through your transactions to find it.</p><p>A list of transactions is pretty interesting — it tells a very detailed story about what your company's been up to. Certainly enough to answer the bank's questions when you ask for loan.</p><p>But just as the bank doesn't have time to learn about subscription t-shirts businesses, they don't have time to go through thousands of transactions. To understand what's going on, they need a shorter summary.</p><p><h4 id="heading-2">Financial Statement #1: The Balance Sheet</h4></p><p>If you went through all your transactions and worked out the net value of each account, you'd be able to see things like</p><ul role="list"><li>How much cash you have in the bank</li><li>The total value of the cotton in your inventory</li><li>How much money you owe to your cotton suppliers</li></ul><p>This will give you a snapshot of the current state of your company, split up into "everything you own" (<strong>Assets</strong>) and "everything you owe" (<strong>Liabilities</strong>) — a <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>. These generally won't be equal — ideally your assets will be worth more than your liabilities.</p><p>The difference between the assets and the liabilities is what you, the owner of the company, can rightfully stake a claim to. Crudely, if you sold all your assets today and used that money to pay off all your debts, you'd be left with a pile of cash all to yourself.</p><p>This idea is usually expressed by the "accounting equation":</p><p><strong>Assets - Liabilities = Shareholders Equity</strong></p><p>This is where the "balance" comes in: both sides of the equation are equal. Note that this equation is actually a definition — it asserts that the value of the <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> is the difference between <strong>Assets</strong> and <strong>Liabilities</strong>. This is the same equation that underpins double-entry bookkeeping.</p><p>Here's what your balance sheet might look like:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-89b5b437bd58-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde1a11602b68a068a079_balance-sheet.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The bank will be interested in seeing this before giving you a loan. It's a quick 'n' dirty way for them to understand the big picture:</p><ul role="list"><li>The orders of magnitude involved — does this company operate in the thousands, millions, or billions?</li><li>An estimate for how much the company is "worth", based on the shareholders equity</li><li>An indication of company health — is the company drowning in debt?</li></ul><p>Financiers often calculate metrics based on the balance sheet, to further summarise the information and to compare numbers across companies.</p><p>The <strong>Debt/Equity Ratio</strong> is a big one, telling you how much a company relies on borrowing money. If it's too high then the company might be too dependent on loans, but if it's too low, this might indicate an inefficiency, since borrowing money to spend on growth can be quicker than earning it the hard way.</p><p>So — the balance sheet summarises a lot about your company, in a way that the bank can understand.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't answer a crucial question — "Do you make money?"</p><p><h4 id="heading-3">Financial Statement #2: The Income Statement (P&amp;L)</h4></p><p>The balance sheet is a snapshot of a single point in time. To understand whether a company makes money, you need see how things change over a period of time (e.g. every month).</p><p>The first thing you need to know is how much money you receive — your <strong>Revenue</strong>. You don't keep all of it — there are costs and expenses along the way — so you need to subtract these. The final number you end up with is your <strong>Profit</strong> — the money you've made at the end of the day.</p><p>Here's how you might do the calculation:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-a4e76259fbb4-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe0c6c8f0be2b6743533b_p%26l.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>You start at Revenue (the top line), subtract your costs, and end up at Profit (the "bottom line" — get it?). This is a simple <strong>Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L)</strong>, or <strong>Income Statement</strong>. Most companies make one every month, to keep an eye on things. </p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-fec0fade16bf-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe17879b5309ce33ce18b_35274025-14536291245349646_origin.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>With a P&amp;L, you and the bank can understand what's going in and out of your business. If your P&amp;L consistently shows a profit, then the bank will be happy, and so will you.</p><p>In theory, this is very simple. But in practice, each P&amp;L item has hidden nuances to address.</p><p>Let's take just the top line — what does <strong>Revenue</strong> actually mean?</p><p><strong>What is revenue?</strong></p><p>When you started selling shirts, it was a simpler time — you bought them in bulk from China and sold them at the local market.</p><p>Revenue, too, was simple — it was the cold hard cash in your hand.</p><p>But things changed. You started taking bulk orders from shops, who pay you 1 month after you deliver the shirts. And when you went online, your customers started paying you for 12 month subscriptions, all in one go.</p><p>It turns out that if you keep thinking of revenue as "cash in your hand", then things get a little weird —</p><ul role="list"><li>When you get a bulk order, your expenses shoot up. But since you don't get paid until next month, your profit goes way down this month.</li><li>When someone buys a 12-month subscription, your revenue spikes up. But for the next 11 months you have to keep delivering on the order (non-zero cost) without further payments (zero revenue) — your bottom line takes a hit.</li></ul><p>Bulk orders and upfront payments are great for your business, but if revenue means "cash in hand", then your P&amp;L might tell the opposite story.</p><p>A better way to think about revenue is as "the value of products delivered or service provided".</p><p>In each month of a subscription, you do 1 month of work. So even with 12 months' payment upfront, you only recognise 1/12th of that payment as revenue each month. The remaining 11/12th becomes <strong>Deferred Revenue.</strong> This is actually a liability on your balance sheet — your customers have essentially given you a loan which you must pay back each month, in the form of t-shirts.</p><p>The same principle applies for bulk orders — you recognise the revenue when you deliver the product, <em>not</em> when you get paid.</p><p>This is called <strong>Accrual Accounting</strong>, and it more accurately answers the question "Do you make money?".</p><p>So — you've got a balance sheet, showing your current financial state, and you've got a P&amp;L, showing how things change over time. The bank, however, remains unsatisfied.</p><p>Sadly, consistent profits, measured with accrual accounting, can still leave you penniless on payday.</p><p><h4 id="heading-4">Financial Statement #3: The Cashflow Statement</h4></p><p>In 1863, the Dowlais Iron Company had a dilemma.</p><p>On paper, things were great — they'd recovered from a downturn and were posting healthy profits. To smelt more iron, they set out to buy a new blast furnace. But despite their promising P&amp;L, it turned out that they had no cash to buy it.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>Their problem was in spending cash too quickly — as soon as they got some, they'd use it on inventory (iron ore, etc). The profits were rolling in, but the cash wasn't sticking around.</p><p>The company needed a way to understand how cash was coming in and out — the cashflow. Their solution was the origin of the modern <strong>Cashflow Statement</strong>.</p><p>Like the P&amp;L, the cashflow statement shows how things change over each month, but crucially, it only focuses on cash — how much you started with, what you spent it on, where you got more of it, and how much you ended up with. In short, the cashflow statement explains the difference between one balance sheet and the next.</p><figure id="w-node-508193268673-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe644e9cf27ec56e99c29_Untitled-3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The bank should now have enough information to decide whether to give you a loan:</p><ul role="list"><li>Balance Sheet — shows everything that you own, and everything that you owe</li><li>P&amp;L/Income Statement — shows how your business operates</li><li>Cashflow Statement — shows how you spend and earn cash</li></ul><p>These financial statements are a shared language, letting businesses communicate across industries and borders. They also "flatten" a business' evolving operations — new business models, delivery methods, and products — to give a coherent view of a company through time.</p><p>Investors use financials to judge performance, lenders use them to assess credit-worthiness, and governments use them to make sure that taxes are correctly paid.</p><p>But the whole system only works if every company follows the same rules when compiling their financials. These rules require years of study to fully understand (this is why accountants exist) and include:</p><ul role="list"><li>How to recognise revenue —&nbsp;accrual accounting</li><li>How to "amortise" costs — spreading upfront expenses over time</li><li>How to "capitalise"&nbsp;costs —&nbsp;turning big purchases into assets on the balance sheet</li></ul><p>Who made these rules?</p><p><h4 id="heading-5">Accounting Standards: Mind the GAAP</h4></p><p>The Industrial Revolution …</p></div></div>
