			<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Stories and takeaways from growing ProveSource from 0 to $700k ARR as a 2-person team in less than 3 years and with no funding.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover.png" alt="3 year story provesource" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover.png 1920w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-300x169.png 300w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-1024x576.png 1024w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-768x432.png 768w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<h2><strong>Our false start</strong></h2>
<p>We started the company in June 2015 with no real idea.</p>
<p>Most people we know fail to ever get started because they’re looking for the perfect idea.</p>
<p>As the founder of Instagram famously said:</p>
<p>“It’s about going through false starts. The best companies in the world have all had predecessors. YouTube was a dating site. You always have to evolve into something else.”</p>
<p>We brainstormed for several days and because both myself and Natan (my co-founder) are very good with mobile app development (iOS &amp; Android) we decided to build a personalization platform for mobile apps and sell it to enterprises.</p>
<p>Around 2.5 years later, having invested almost $100k out of our own pockets, having done hundreds of calls and demos with huge enterprises and dozens of Proof of Concepts, we decided it’s time to move on…</p>
<p>It felt awful – like you’re killing something you love, but it had to be done.</p>
<p>That was our “false start”. But more on that another time.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>The sooner you kill an idea that is getting no traction, even if it’s super hard because it’s your baby, the less painful it is. The more time and resources you devote, the harder it becomes to pull out in case things don’t work out.</p>
<h2><strong>Starting over – The lean way</strong></h2>
<p>In January 2018 we decided to start working on a new SaaS product.</p>
<p>The idea was to “steal” the social proof hack that Booking.com was using (e.g. 5 people booked this hotel, etc.) and create a platform from it – a social proof marketing platform.</p>
<p>This time, because we were running on fumes, both in terms of cash and motivation, we decided to validate the idea first.</p>
<p>We had a single purpose in mind – getting 100 leads interested in our product.</p>
<p>We created a landing page that showcased our new idea as a real product, including pricing, a signup button, and all – a social proof marketing platform for mobile apps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps.png 1920w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-300x169.png 300w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-1024x576.png 1024w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-768x432.png 768w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<p>The fastest way to get targeted traffic to your website is to use Google Ads targeting the brand names of the biggest players in your niche.</p>
<p>So we did that.</p>
<p>We also posted the landing page anywhere we could think of: Reddit, ProductHunt, BetaList, social media, wherever…</p>
<p>About one month and – $300 later, we had around 200 leads that wanted to try out ProveSource.</p>
<p>We were finally making progress!</p>
<p>We figured that even if only 1% of them converted, we would already have 2 paying customers.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>You can easily get traction without having a product.</p>
<p>Just buy a domain, build a landing page, and go validate your business idea.</p>
<p>We usually create landing pages to validate products using plain HTML and Airtable, to send the leads we collect from the forms. No fancy designs, no expensive CRM.</p>
<h2><strong>Making our first dollar $</strong></h2>
<p>Next goal – how do we make a dollar?</p>
<p>That is, unlike our previous product which made practically $0 in 2.5 years.</p>
<p>We created a rule that whenever we launch a new product, all our efforts will be towards making our first dollar, so we can have real-life validation.</p>
<p>So we have 200 people interested in ProveSource.</p>
<p>Now we needed to give them a product and get them to pay.</p>
<p>We built the leanest MVP possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product just for website owners (mobile was too small of a niche).</li>
<li>You could only show how many page visitors you had on your website.</li>
<li>The whole UI and UX should be super simple. No menus and extra buttons, don’t give users a reason to abandon your product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you forget your password and need to reset it? Sorry, no can do.</p>
<p>Did we accidentally change your password when you logged in? Oops, we’re on it.</p>
<p>What are onboarding and email automation? Dunno, don’t care.</p>
<p>April 2018 – we are approached by a Facebook Group admin that is interested in promoting our product to his group as a “lifetime deal” (LTD).</p>
<p>This means selling a lifetime subscription to your product for a one-off payment ranging from $39-$99.</p>
<p>We’ve never heard of this before so we thought long and hard about the consequences of selling a lifetime deal and how it would position the product and our company…</p>
<p>We decided to go with the deal and ran it with the group for 1 week.</p>
<p>We generated over $7k revenue, got tons of feedback, ideas for product improvements, tons of bugs were discovered in the process, which taught us the value of having live chat support.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>In hindsight, there were no real consequences, only advantages to running a lifetime deal.</p>
<p>Sure, you have a few dozens of customers that are not paying you on a recurring basis – but they help a lot in the beginning when you need the cash and the validation.</p>
<p>Once we were done with the LTD we started pushing the product in all marketing channels and to our 200 user waiting list. None of them converted by the way.</p>
<p>A couple of days later we got our first monthly subscription customer ($19/month).</p>
<p>It was an amazing moment, validating that you indeed have a real business opportunity in your hands.</p>
<h2><strong>Our “wow moment”</strong></h2>
<p>During the next months, we focused on spreading the word, squashing bugs, and doing tons of support for our existing customers.</p>
<p>How did we decide what to build next?</p>
<ul>
<li>We learned to ask questions about our product’s value. Why do people buy our product? Is it because they want to increase conversions? How do we help them achieve that?</li>
<li>We brainstormed about what it means to be a social proof platform.</li>
<li>We heard our customers’ feedback</li>
<li>We learned from competitors; but not too much. We found that those who only copy will always lag behind.</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole process has to be accompanied by analytics and metrics.</p>
<p>You don’t have to measure each and every step or A/B test you do, though.</p>
<p>We don’t really do it, to this day.</p>
<p>A lot of product leaders talk about the “wow effect” or “wow moment” – if you want to retain users, make them say “wow”.</p>
<p>For Facebook, for example, their “wow moment” is logging into their platform and seeing familiar faces. That’s why they make sure that during sign up, you connect with as many people you know on Facebook as possible.</p>
<p>In our case, we focused on improving our user onboarding.</p>
<p>Since the product requires users to install a javascript snippet on their website, we put a big emphasis on making that process as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Our thought was – if users can see a social proof notification on their website, they’ll get to that “wow moment”.</p>
<p>We can see a very close correlation between successful onboarding and someone becoming a paying customer.</p>
<p>The funnel looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-10% of visitors will signup.</li>
<li>70% of those signups will complete the onboarding.</li>
<li>7-10% of those users who are onboarded will eventually become paying customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel.png" alt="ProveSource Signups Funnel" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel.png 1920w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-300x169.png 300w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-1024x576.png 1024w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-768x432.png 768w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>Find what your “wow moment” is in your users’ experience, and make sure you get users to experience it as early in the onboarding process as possible. That way you can spend a lot on User Acquisition activities because the users you bring in end up becoming paying customers and sticking with you.</p>
<h2><strong>Our First Growth “Hack”</strong></h2>
<p>After we added some “necessary” features like showing recent sales and polishing the product to have fewer bugs – we wanted to grow bigger, we wanted to scale up, we wanted to get more exposure.</p>
<p>How do you scale a notifications product that is essentially an add-on for websites?</p>
<p>You build integrations for all website builders.</p>
<p>So we worked hard on adding more and more integrations: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/provesource/">WordPress plugin</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/provesource">Shopify app</a>, Magento plugin, Wix app, <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/provesource/integrations">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/provesource-social-proof/">BigCommerce</a>, and more.</p>
<p>All of these marketplaces and app stores proved to be really good traffic sources and traction channels for us, each with its own audience and unique requirements.</p>
<p>Today, around 20% of our customers and revenue comes from Shopify alone.</p>
<h2><strong>Scaling past 2 people</strong></h2>
<p>Being a two-person team that does development, marketing, support, accounting, and more is tough. But it also teaches you a lot, you learn so much about your business, your audience, and your customers.</p>
<p>And that gives you the experience you need on what to look for when hiring someone to take over some of your responsibilities.</p>
<p>In September 2019 we decided it’s time to scale the team.</p>
<p>After all, a great company can’t be just 2 people, right?</p>
<p>Naturally, a software company’s first hire would be a developer.</p>
<p>Bringing Dima to the team, allowed us to build more integrations faster, and scale the company beyond its initial stage.</p>
<p>So we now have tons of integrations, pretty much with any large marketing or website platform out there.</p>
<p>We also scaled and optimized our Google and Facebook ads as much as we could.</p>
<p>We optimized our product onboarding rate, increased prices, added great features, and made it even easier to use the product, by adding tooltips, auto-suggestions, wizards, and more.</p>
<p>We were growing at a steady rate, so what could possibly be bothering us?</p>
<p>Well, we didn’t know how to grow faster, or what to do next.</p>
<p>We came up with a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring a Growth team member to scale our marketing efforts and bring new ideas to the table.</li>
<li>Since our product offering is strong and we couldn’t think about any impactful feature we could develop – we thought about zooming out of our product’s initial market.</li>
<li>Build a new product – we have no investors so we are free to make any decision we want about the company’s direction. Investors often block the founders from doing whatever is best for the company and push for a point where they can exit.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Building a new product</strong></h2>
<p>At this point, we decided to build another product to scale the company further.</p>
<p>We had these questions in mind before picking what to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How big is the market, is it potentially bigger than our current product?</li>
<li>Would our existing customers be customers of this new product too?</li>
<li>What do our existing customers need and are willing to pay for?</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding ProveSource to your website is great, but, there is a critical prerequisite to making it work for you and your website: traffic. If your website has no traffic, you won’t be able to generate social proof.</p>

    <section>
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <span>“T</span>he Democratic Party,” wrote the late Walter Laqueur, was “liberal and slightly left-of-centre in outlook, progressive but not too much so, in favour of reform but afraid of going too far. . . . They had quite a few professors among their leading supporters and also some bankers and industrialists, but for the majority of academics . . . [it] was quite unacceptable.” Bourgeois parties “are never militant, almost by definition”—and the “Democratic Party was perhaps the least militant of all.”</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Central to its impotence, Laqueur believed, was “the mood of an activist younger generation.” An “unthinking, aimless radicalism,” which “preferred drums to speeches and parades to long and inconclusive discussions,” could “turn left or right or lead nowhere at all.” Not just on college campuses: “Contempt for ‘the system,’” its “vested interests, cliques, and party caucuses,” permeated the middle class. Leftists “attacked the Republic and all it stood for as something that was rotten through and through,” while conservatives thought “‘the system’ so corrupt that any political order that succeeded it would be an improvement”—even as they complained (correctly) that “the left was anti-patriotic.” Both sides “were unhappy, though for different reasons, with . . . the existing state of affairs.” “There was not the slightest willingness to take each other’s point of view seriously, let alone to compromise.” </p><p>That, at any rate, is how Laqueur saw Weimar Germany with the benefit of hindsight.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <span>A</span>merica is not Weimar. We have not lost a World War or been forced to pay war debt; we’ve had 250 years of democracy, not 25; Trump isn’t Hitler, and Biden, whatever his faults, isn’t calling for communism. There is street violence, but a lot less of it—for unlike Weimar, we do not generally let paramilitary groups supplant the police, Seattle’s “autonomous zone” being the exception that proves the rule.
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But the exceptions are mounting. In Portland, protestors <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/protesters-attempt-create-autonomous-zone-portland-graffiti-smoke-pigs-precinct-1513743">attempted to create</a> an autonomous zone of their own by barricading the area with stolen property and blocking the exits of a nearby police precinct; “going to burn the building down,” one man threatened. In Minneapolis, a precinct actually did burn down after it was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/protests-looting-erupt-again-minneapolis-area-following-death-george-floyd-n1216881">set ablaze</a> by “demonstrators,” two of whom (<a href="https://www.startribune.com/charges-minneapolis-brothers-destroyed-property-inside-third-precinct/571450752/">both white</a>) were subsequently charged. In Kenosha, riots claimed two lives and several more city blocks, which <a href="https://twitter.com/joshglancy/status/1299734436792197120">were</a> “indistinguishable from a war zone” by the time the dust settled. </p><p>And throughout the country, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/nyregion/nyc-shootings-surge.html">New York City</a> to <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-chicago-police-six-month-crime-stats-20200626-wqsf3rebavaldex7v54ozqsnxe-story.html">Chicago</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/davon-mcneal-shot/2020/07/05/16390c1a-bec6-11ea-b178-bb7b05b94af1_story.html">Washington, DC</a>, shootings have surged alongside looting—in some places, <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/nypd-shootings-increase-1.46044819">by over 400 percent</a>—destroying lives and livelihoods in their wake.</p><p>On its own, this would hardly warrant comparison with Weimar. Crime and violence are as American as apple pie, and street fighting, though aesthetically German, has plenty of precedent in the U.S. What recalls interwar Germany is not the chaos itself, but the way it has been excused, even encouraged, by those notionally in a position to stop it—many of whom seem ambivalent about whether the republic it threatens deserves defense. Examples of this excuse-making include, but are not limited to:</p><ol><li>The true <a href="https://unherd.com/2020/07/the-ugly-truth-about-the-blm-protests/">but trivial claim</a> that the protests have been “mostly” peaceful.</li><li>The argument, made by a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/03/of-course-destruction-of-property-is-violence-299759">Pulitzer-winning <em>New York Times</em> journalist</a>, that “destroying property, which can be replaced, is not violence.”</li><li>A <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/in-defense-of-looting/">widely-circulated essay</a>, written during the Ferguson protests of 2014, that defends looting as a “righteous,” attention-grabbing tactic in the fight against white supremacy. (The author subsequently elaborated her arguments in a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/08/27/906642178/one-authors-argument-in-defense-of-looting">controversial interview</a> with NPR.)</li></ol><p>It is telling that, despite reaching the same conclusion, these excuses all contradict one another. If violence were extraordinarily rare (1), there would be no reason to deny its status <em>as</em> violence (2), or to defend its tactical value (3)—whereas if looting <em>weren’t</em> violent, if it didn’t disrupt or endanger life, its attention-grabbing power would be extraordinarily diminished. The contradictions suggest that elite alegality isn’t rooted in any specific principle, but rather a kind of inchoate radicalism: a vague, burn-it-down impulse increasingly common across the political spectrum, whose ends are drifting farther and farther apart. If the 2016 election <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/18/12210500/diagnosed-dysfunction-republican-party">seemed to confirm</a> the existence of “asymmetric” polarization, the 2020 tumult suggests that polarization can only remain asymmetric for so long. </p><p>And as the symmetries grow more apparent, the shadow of Weimar grows longer still. Much has been made—<a href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/11/12/resilient-democracies/">too much</a>—of what are ultimately very weak parallels between Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler. But though<strong> </strong>Trump’s America looks nothing like Nazi Germany, it <em>has </em>developed echoes of the Republic from which Nazism arose—echoes that implicate the left no less than the right. Weimar was not, as is sometimes suggested, a good society beset by bigots and bad luck. It was a febrile, dysfunctional culture in which few voters, and even fewer elites, believed in the Republic they eventually dissolved. We often hear about the perils of “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/trump-impeachment-journalism/">bothsidesism</a>,” of treating “fascists” and “anti-fascists” as equivalent threats. Yet in the collapse of Weimar Germany, both sides played an important role.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <span>T</span>o be fair, Weimar didn’t have a whole lot to work with. One of the things it did not have—or rather had stolen—was a well-defined founding. Officially, it began outside the German Reichstag on November 9, 1918, where the Social Democratic minister Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the birth of the Republic. But unofficially, it began at Hohenzollern Palace two hours later, when the communist leader Karl Liebknecht proclaimed a Republic of his own—the first of many such putsches by Germany’s leftmost wing. The repeated attempts to overthrow the government, and the fact that the Social Democrats, like the communists, claimed to be committed Marxists, made it easy for the right to blame instability on the left, and for the masses to associate that instability with Weimar's socialist architects.
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But many republics, including ours, had violent foundings. What made Weimar special, as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weimar-Republic-Crisis-Classical-Modernity/dp/0809015560">historian Detlev Peukert put it</a>, was that it “was not marked by an event that served as an old-fashioned but politically unifying . . . moment in national history, along the lines of the American Declaration of Independence.” It had two competing proclamations, two rival origin stories, which meant that there was “no legitimizing founding ritual” to sustain “active commitment to the new order.” Germans did, of course, debate which story was the true one. That it was debated at all both signaled and intensified a profound lack of legitimacy, an open wound ripe for infection. </p><p>These disagreements—less about facts than about symbolism—did not mean collapse was inevitable. (Weimar survived the 1920s, after all.) But they did mean that there were few common reference points to rein in polarization, and more chances for insurgent ideologies—never mind actual insurgents—to gain steam. </p><p>Weimar had no shortage of radicals; centrists, on the other hand, were a dying breed. The intelligentsia fell roughly into one of two camps: leftists who hated everything about Germany, from its culture to its constitution; and rightists who hated the constitution because it was insufficiently German—which is to say, insufficiently authoritarian. The last group dominated the universities, whose reliance on public funds did not dampen their rancor toward the Republic. In fairness, those funds hadn’t stopped the academic job market from cratering after WWI, which meant that even the best-credentialed thinkers were often precariously employed. With few prospects in the existing system, the intellectual class saw little reason to defend it, and had an easy time rationalizing its destruction. The upshot was that college-educated civil servants typically hated the Republic they were serving, as did judges, policymakers, and educators. Ditto artists, journalists, and playwrights, though these professions skewed left. </p><p>Beyond their shared anti-Republicanism, all that the two sides had in common was their contempt for one another. The left derided the right as backwards-looking and chauvinistic, while the right derided the left as self-hating and unpatriotic—all of which, it must be said, was true. Kurt Tucholsky, Weimar’s leading leftwing satirist, complained that “the German spirit was poisoned almost beyond recovery,” and that “German democracy [was] a facade and a lie.” “There is no secret of the Germany army I would not hand over readily to a foreign power,” he bragged in 1931, a boast that did not exactly endear him to the people who took power in ‘33. Those people, of course, were just as Tucholsky described them: irredeemable, backwards bigots whose deaths could not come soon enough.</p><p>But the Nazis never won more than a plurality of the vote—and most conservative elites were not Nazis. (Indeed, several became their victims.) What united the right was not a particular political program, but a general sense of grievance against the far left and republican center, distinct groups it would often synonymize. Marxism, modernism, liberalism—these were all shades of the same thing, corruptions of the old order. An equal but opposite elision occured on the left, with the communists calling everyone to their right—including the Social Democrats—fascists, an unfair charge that many leftwing intellectuals nonetheless echoed. The result of these stereo-stereotypes was threefold.</p><p>First, they exacerbated Weimar’s crisis of legitimacy. If the Republic lacked a founding ritual, the elites were in no hurry to invent one; rather, the “center” was so widely anathematized that it effectively didn’t exist. In one case, <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/communists-allied-with-nazis.html">the communists even endorsed a Nazi referendum</a> to overthrow the Social Democratic government in Prussia, on the theory that social democracy was a greater threat than National Socialism.

<div id="abstract"><p>In this multi-part tutorial I'm going to show you how you can use cheap and "low end" hardware to build an amazing router with firewalling capabilities, DNS, DHCP and much much more, using the fantastic OpenBSD operating system. I am going to use a setup in which the router segments the local area network (LAN) into separate networks, one for the grown-ups in the house, one for the children, and one for public facing servers, such as a private web server or mail server. I'll also show you how you can use DNS to effectively block out most ads, porn, and many harmful websites on the Internet. Last, but not least, I'll show you how you can use the firewall to block outgoing telemetric data from computers running Microsoft Windows, NVIDIA graphics drivers, etc. The router can also be used on small to mid-size offices.</p><p>If you don't need a segmented network, but simply need a solid firewall and/or DNS server, you can still use the tutorial as I am going to guide you step by step introducing and setting up one solution at a time.</p></div>

<li><a href="#the-network">The network</a></li>
<li><a href="#why-openbsd">Why OpenBSD?</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-a-firewall">Why a firewall?</h2>
<p>Almost no matter how you connect to the Internet from your home or office you need a real firewall between you and the modem or router that your ISP has provided you with.</p>
<p>I have worked for quite some time in the ISP business and if there is one thing I can tell you for sure, it is that not only do they rarely keep your modem or router firmware up to date, they almost always use some of the most miserable products on the market.</p>
<p>One of the sources for most of the SPAM email on the Internet originates from consumer market modems and routers that has been compromised.</p>
<p>With a firewall between you and the Internet, meaning the modem or router from your ISP, you can not only protect your computers much better, but you can also monitor the traffic that comes and goes to and from your house, and you can react to situations that might call for an alarm.</p>
<p>Without a firewall between your local network and the ISP modem or router you could basically consider this an open door policy, like leaving the door to your house wide open, because you cannot trust the equipment from your ISP.</p>
<p>At one particular ISP I have even witnessed how some employees used to hack into customers computers using the services that the ISP provided. Of course the ISP didn't know that at the time, but this illustrates my point very well.</p>
<p>It is always a really good idea to put a real firewall between your local network and your ISP and with OpenBSD you get a very solid solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>You don't have to buy expensive hardware to get an effective router and firewall for your house or office. Even with cheap and "low end" hardware you can get a very solid solution.</p>
<p>I have build multiple setups using the <a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Q1900DC-ITX/">ASRock Q1900DC-ITX</a> motherboard that comes with an Intel Quad-Core Celeron processor.</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/asrock-q1900dc-itx.png" alt="ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard"></p>
<p>I'll admit, it's a pretty "crappy" motherboard, but it gets the job done and I have several builds that have run very solid for many years on gigabit networks with full saturation and the firewall, DNS, etc. working "overtime" and the CPU hardly breaks a sweat. This is contrary to the extremely expensive Soekris, which people used to recommend, that typically ran less powerful Intel Atom processors not capable of saturating a gigabit network.</p>
<p>The ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard has the advantage that it comes with a DC-In Jack that is compatible with a 9~19V power adapter, making it very power saving.</p>
<p>The ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard is no longer sold, but I'm just using it as an example because I have used several of these boards in the past.</p>
<p>I have also used the ASRock Q1900-ITX (it doesn't come with the DC-In Jack) combined with a PicoPSU.</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/picopsu.png" alt="PicoPSU power supply"></p>
<p>You can find different brands and versions of the PicoPSU, some are better quality than others. I have two different brands, the original and a cheaper knockoff, both performing very well and they save quite a bit of power contrary to running with a normal power supply that typically requires at least 10 watts more.</p>
<p>Lastly, I am using a cheap Intel knockoff quad port NIC found on Ebay like this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/intel-quad-nic.png" alt="Intel Quad NIC"></p>
<p>Now before you start condemning me for using low end hardware, I know it is better to use quality hardware, especially on a network that you care about, but this tutorial is about how you can get away with using fairly cheep hardware and still get an extremely useful product that will continue to serve you well for many years - at least that is my experience.</p>
<p>I recommend that you look for a low power mini ITX board with hardware <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html">supported by OpenBSD</a> such as an Intel Celeron or Intel i3 processor. These boards are typically cheap, less power hungry, and they don't take up very much space. I don't recommend using the Intel Atom CPU if you have a gigabit network as they usually choke because they can't handle the amount of traffic, but your milage may vary. Also, I have never had any luck finding any useful AMD boards because the CPU usually would require much more power than the Intel counterpart - however my experience with AMD is mostly outdated and I haven't used AMD for many years. I also don't recommend older dual core Intel CPU's, they will work perfectly, but they also require more power.</p>
<p>Oh, and then you need a couple of cheap gigabit switches too for the segmented LANs, at least if you have more than one computer you want to connect to the same LAN :)</p>

<h2 id="the-network">The network</h2>
<p>A router is basically a device that regulate network traffic between two or more separate networks. The router will ensure that network traffic intended for the local network doesn't run out into the wild on the Internet and traffic on the Internet, that is not intended for your local network, stays on the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Just for information, a router is sometimes also referred to as a gateway, which generally is alright in layman's terms, but in truth a real gateway joins dissimilar systems. An example of a gateway would be a device that joins a PC network with a  telecommunications network.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we're building a router and we have 4 different but similar networks to work with. One is the Internet and the other three are the internally segmented LANs. Some people prefer to work with virtual LANs, but in this tutorial I'm going to use the quad port NIC from above. You can achieve the same result by using multiple one port NICs if you prefer that, you just have to make sure that you have enough room and free PCI slots on the motherboard. You can also use the Ethernet port on the motherboard itself, but it depends on the driver and support for the device. I have had no problems using the typical Realtek PCI gigabit Ethernet controller that normally comes with many motherboards even though I recommend Intel over Realtek.</p>
<p>Of course you don't need to segment the network into several parts if you don't need that, and it will be very easy to change the things I setup in this tutorial, but I have decided to use this approach in order to show you how you can protect your children by segmenting their network into a separate LAN that not only gets ad and porn blocking using DNS (all the segments gets that), but you can even whitelist the parts of the Internet you want them to have access to. The last part about whitelisting is difficult and generally not recommended unless your children are very small and only requires very limited access, but it is doable with some work.</p>
<p>This is an illustration of the network we're going to setup:</p>
<pre><code>
                       Internet
                          |
                    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
                    ISP Modem (WAN)
                      10.24.0.23
                          |
                       OpenBSD
                      10.24.0.50
                  (router/firewall)
                          |
     -------------------------------------------
     |                    |                    |
    NIC1                 NIC2                 NIC3
192.168.1.1          192.168.2.1          192.168.3.1
LAN1 switch          LAN2 switch          LAN3 switch
     |                    |                    |
     -- 192.168.1.2       -- 192.168.2.2       -- 192.168.3.2
     |  Grown-up PC       |  Child PC1         |  Public web server
                          |
                          -- 192.168.2.3
                          |  Child PC2
</code></pre>
<p>The IP addresses that begins with 10 are whatever IP addresses your ISP router gives you, in my case it looks similar to the above. The IP addresses beginning with 192 are IP addresses that we're going to use in our local network.</p>
<p>I have not dealt with any kind of wireless connectivity in this setup. Wireless chip firmware is notoriously buggy and exploitable and I recommend you don't use any kind of wireless connections if you can do without. If you do require wireless connections I strongly recommend that you disable wireless access completely from the ISP modem or router (if possible), and then buy the best wireless router you can find and put it behind the firewall in an isolated segment instead. That way should your wireless device ever be compromised you can better control the outcome and limit the damage. You can further setup the wireless router such that any devices connected to it have their own IPs that pass directly through the wireless router, but at the same time block traffic directly originating from the router itself. That way you can prevent the wireless router from "phoning home". You can also get a wireless adapter supported by OpenBSD and have your OpenBSD machine run as the actual access point, however I much prefer to segment the wireless part to either a separate wireless router or another OpenBSD machine serving as a wireless access point behind the firewall itself. Also, as of writing (as far as I know) none of the OpenBSD wireless drivers are fully without problems.</p>

<p>Many applications can be updated automatically and without any user interaction. This is commonly considered a good practice from the security point of view, since it allows for quick distribution of patches for critical vulnerabilities. However, automatic updates also carry an additional risk because they allow the software developers to push arbitrary code to users’ machines. Unfortunately, users often have no choice but to trust the developers that they will only use the update channel for its intended purpose and that they will protect it from malicious third parties.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we’ll show that this trust might sometimes be misplaced. Specifically, we’ll show how one torrent client and three adblockers surreptitiously installed the FakeMBAM backdoor through automatic updates. We reverse engineered this backdoor and describe its inner workings in the second part of this post.</p>



<h2>An unexpected infection vector</h2>



<p>We recently <a href="https://blog.avast.com/fake-malwarebytes-installation-files-distributing-coinminer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on a fake Malwarebytes installer</a> that we detected on over 100,000 machines protected by Avast. This installer attempted to pass itself off as the legitimate Malwarebytes installer, mimicking it to a great extent – it was distributed under the same filename, it used the same icon and it created a Malwarebytes installation directory containing legitimate PE files digitally signed by Malwarebytes. However, that was all just a pretense, because the installer did not actually install Malwarebytes. In fact, the installer’s main purpose was to open a backdoor to attacker-controlled servers in order to give its operators the ability to push additional malicious payloads to the infected machines.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="829" height="509" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo.png 829w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo-300x184.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px"><figcaption>A map illustrating the distribution of Avast users protected from the FakeMBAM backdoor. The backdoor is most active in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In our first report, we stated that we did not know how this fake installer was being distributed. Since then, we spent some time reverse engineering the malware and investigating its infection vector. We found that the fake installer was pushed to the victims’ machines through automatic updates of one torrent client (<code>download[.]studio</code>) and three adblockers (<code>netshieldkit[.]com</code>, <code>myadblock[.]com</code> and <code>netadblock[.]com</code>). Listed on the websites of these applications are three different companies that are supposedly behind these applications, “Sigma Software”, “GRAND MEDIA, TOV” and “Birmon Software”. However, based on high code similarities and shared infrastructure (and on the fact that they all distributed the very same piece of malware), we consider it very likely that there is one actor behind all four applications.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Download Studio</h3>



<p>To investigate the infection vector used to distribute the fake installer, we first turned to the metadata that was submitted to us when we detected the installer in the wild. This provided us with two important clues: The installers were supposed to be executed with the command line arguments <code>/SP- /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /NOCANCEL /NOICONS</code>, by a process named <code>dstudio-gui.exe</code>. The first clue suggested that the installer was not supposed to be spread through social engineering, because the above arguments instruct Inno Setup to install software silently in the background. The second clue hinted at the possible suspect: Download Studio.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="699" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-1024x699.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-1024x699.png 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-300x205.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-768x524.png 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website.png 1163w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A screenshot of the Download Studio product page.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Download Studio is a free torrent client popular in Russia and Ukraine. It features an embedded library of torrent files, offering a wide selection of movies, software, video games, music and more. As is usually the case with torrent downloaders, there is a lot of copyrighted material that can be easily downloaded for free using this software, which seems to be the main reason why it is so widespread. Download Studio is detected by some anti-malware software as a potentially unwanted program (PUP) or as riskware, because it encourages illegal behavior and puts its users at risk through downloading torrents of unknown origin.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="639" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-1024x639.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-1024x639.png 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-300x187.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-768x479.png 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot.png 1234w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A screenshot of Download Studio’s movie library.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To clear up some potential confusion, let us state that there is also another piece of software named Download Studio: <a href="http://www.conceiva.com/products/downloadstudio/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a download manager developed by Conceiva</a>. Apart from the name, this software has nothing in common with the torrent client described in this blog post and there is therefore no reason to doubt its legitimacy. In the rest of this blog post, the name Download Studio will denote the torrent client described in the previous paragraph.</p>



<p>Since Download Studio can be used to download various software, it would make sense to think that the fake Malwarebytes installer was distributed through it as a regular torrent file (after all there were 609 results when we searched for “Malwarebytes” inside Download Studio). However, that would not explain the command line arguments that we observed in the wild. They simply indicated that running the installer was not a user-initiated action and that the user might not have been aware of the installer at all. Furthermore, the number of users that we protected from the fake installer matched our estimates of the number of Avast users running Download Studio, which made it look like Download Studio itself was somehow responsible. Therefore, we decided to reverse engineer it to see if it contained hidden malicious code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We immediately found some evident code similarities with the FakeMBAM backdoor. Both Download Studio and the backdoor were developed using the Qt framework and they both used the very same string obfuscation methods. One of the obfuscation methods was particularly interesting, because it was not very effective at, well, obfuscation. It consisted of XORing the obfuscated string twice with the same mask, so the plaintext was clearly visible in the disassembly.</p>

<p>Other code similarities were found in a piece of code that computed HMAC of custom HTTP headers or in a piece of code that created scheduled tasks using the <code>ITaskService </code>COM interface. We also found that Download Studio contained a string with the exact command line arguments that we mentioned earlier. These arguments were used to execute application updates silently in the background. By reverse engineering Download Studio, we also found that the application updates are supposed to be executed from a temporary directory the name of which can be described by the regular expression <code>ds-\d{7}\.tmp</code>, which further matched our metadata from detections of the fake installer.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EYMmgDsZBnHuIzdKo7GQt5DdYt6l7syDb4q3c1qFhXzhW4qMCp8SuY2yl0csbOzTBRbt-0p5zDqgY5X8BM4SdnQN1b1nSG7neF4-80rOm2-x9HK7ci-S7XagvX8tXUcUJQjwcmb-" alt=""><figcaption>Disassembled snippet of Download Studio, showing the code responsible for execution of automatic updates.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point, it seemed almost certain that the backdoor was distributed through the automatic updates of Download Studio. However, we wanted to be absolutely sure that this was the case, so we monitored the updates and logged the filename and hash of each observed update. This gave us the following list:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>SHA-256</td><td>filename</td></tr><tr><td><code>16d0559067f3cc0ab19e22b935ac90d44897f09f3426f858498dfd7e667c4bda</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>1d77fdc7f1b1efc8bdb0938cacc713baa70a2549412ce0be18adf2ebd133cb70</code></td><td><code>updater-full.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>333dd34d3efc4ded71b36f5fc38bce67de71f80b7fab43358a36e8ba7d4df0f0</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>5822d2b9717cc2a87ba54173587a3808e17f5961f42f5b1702c4a75950ecd4f6</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>6754c5e7d3c03f4e2bf29b013b1a0d532b7f4e8e145da82e6973376785938f65</code></td><td><code>DS-updater-1.8.0.0-full.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>9c112b452ce839536a5cd4a3d8f4999adcb03dc3af5cbd86ca3a477c5b75127b</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b1acc87c7b010f4aafbe03cd70a6452679de07ef31bc2d5701de63d573654615</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b3359c92cd87bd39ecbf8159666f2c7e123903751654bb8aefd714e23f8e7f7f</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b4039b6a15af681d7c02d1ff798f41023a378668b32132761c8cdffd648a5a5d</code></td><td><code>DS-updater-1.8.0.0.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>c759c6fffe3d32424f8b29b58ee5cb11d68be5f27e50ba1d1a4755fb56602f7d</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>dfb1a78be311216cd0aa5cb78759875cd7a2eeb5cc04a8abc38ba340145f72b9</code></td><td><code>MBSetup.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>f2caa14fd11685ba28068ea79e58bf0b140379b65921896e227a0c7db30a0f2c</code></td><td><code>MBSetup.exe</code></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Just based on the filenames alone, the last two entries immediately stand out. Indeed, while all the previous entries correspond to legitimate updates of Download Studio, the last two hashes are the fake Malwarebytes installers that we have been investigating. They were executed in the same way as all the other automatic updates, silently in the background and without the users’ awareness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that someone tried to infect all users of Download Studio with the FakeMBAM backdoor. While we do not know precisely what happened behind the scenes, there are three possible scenarios that come to mind. The first one would be that the developers of Download Studio wished to “monetize” their large install base in a very unethical way. Code reuse between Download Studio and the FakeMBAM backdoor would suggest that this could be the case. Another explanation is that the backdoor was spread by a group of rogue employees who acted without the knowledge of the rest of the company. Finally, it is also possible that some unknown attacker hacked Download Studio and carried out a successful supply chain attack.</p>



<p>We were looking for some answers and so we reached out to the developers of Download Studio, asking about the backdoor. They claimed that they detected a security incident on their continuous integration server in August 2020 and that they have since thoroughly investigated this incident and put additional security measures in place. They did not respond to our additional inquiries about how many of their users could be impacted by this incident and if they notified the impacted users.</p>



<h3>Adblockers</h3>



<p>Download Studio was not the only software that distributed the FakeMBAM backdoor. We also found three adblockers whose automatic updates were abused in the same fashion. These adblockers are NetShield Kit (<code>netshieldkit[.]com</code>), My AdBlock (<code>myadblock[.]com</code>) and …</p></div></article></div>

<h2 id="flyover-country">Flyover Country</h2>

<p>When I was younger and my family finally made it <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2014/05/upward-immigrant-toy-mobility-in-the-wild-1990s/">to the American middle class</a>, we went on vacations to Europe. Plane travel was a lot more boring in the days before cell phones, and I would spend a significant amount of any given flight tracking the progress of the tiny plane icon on the flickering screen. When Godthab, Greenland, and then the tiny dot labeled Reykjavik appeared on the legend, I knew we were close to our destination across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>For most traveling Americans, until very recently, Iceland was no more than a flyover destination. But the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932011_Icelandic_financial_crisis">2008 financial crisis</a>, the eruption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">Eyjafjallajökull</a>, and the filming of Game of Thrones <a href="http://icelandmag.visir.is/article/thingvellir-featured-first-episode-season-4-game-thrones">there</a>, combined with aggressive marketing and low pricing by Iceland’s two airlines have drastically improved Iceland’s standing on the map.</p>

<p>Today, if you talk to any pour-over coffee drinker living within driving distance of an Ikea, there’s a seventy-six bajillion percent chance they’ve been. Since over <a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/10/18/13261804/iceland-tourism-on-the-rise">1.5 million tourists hit Iceland last year</a> it really seems like everyone I know has either been, or is headed north.</p>

<p>In spite of all that, Iceland is still not a country Americans really pay attention to. I mean, we don’t care about most things that aren’t Kardashian, but Iceland, nestled way up against the Arctic Circle with a population smaller than Cleveland, can be easy to overlook.  As such, I had no preconceived notions going in. But, almost immediately I was won over.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-to-iceland-heres-some-júníus-meyvant">Welcome to Iceland. Here’s some Júníus Meyvant</h2>

<p>What amazed me the most was that there is a USB charging port right next to the TV screen of my Icelandair flight. I’ve flown an average amount, and nowhere yet have I seen this feature in economy class on American planes.</p>

<p>At first glance, this, seems like a totally banal yuppie thing to get excited about. But if you are flying with a smartphone, it’s a HUGE relief not to have to worry about charging in the airport where you land, saving battery, and generally running around like crazy on what should be your vacation or business trip. You just plug in, and you’re ready to go. It’s a really small thing that makes a huge difference in peace of mind for travelers.</p>

<p>As we boarded, Icelandair also played <a href="https://soundcloud.com/recordrecords/junius-meyvant-neon-experience-1">soft mood music</a> from a <a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/icelandair">Spotify playlist</a>. To someone who is used to traveling within the American flight culture, where you’re lucky if the flight attendants throwing $14 bags of peanuts at you hit in the general vicinity of your torso, it was all very new. And, of course, you could track the flight path on your phone free of charge.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/flightrack.PNG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>It so happened that we went to Iceland because Mr. B was invited to a bachelor party there.  In my day, these parties were held at local dive bars where the floor was more Miller Lite than laminate, but that was before Instagram. I decided to tag along for a couple days before the party, because Iceland was so close, and because it’s been a while since I’ve travelled further than the distance between the crib and the couch.</p>

<p>We got in at six in the morning, but even in my red-eyed haze, I could see just how pristine everything at Keflavík Airport was. My freshly-charged phone immediately connected to Iceland’s Vodafone network without a glitch.  “We’re here. Everything is clean and smells like Ikea,” I texted my mom.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/airport.png" width="400"></p>

<p>I had already booked a ticket on <a href="https://www.re.is/flybus/">Flybus</a>, which goes from Keflavík to Reykjavik, online, so all we had to do was get on and wait. I’ve never been brave enough to take public transportation from the airport anywhere I’ve been, including even Israel, where I speak the language, but the website made it so easy. The bus, like the plane, had Wi-Fi, a feature we’d see being offered again and again on buses, in cafes, restaurants, and bookstores, like a lure to trap urban Americans wearing plaid button-downs.</p>

<h2 id="iceland-is-for-humans">Iceland is for humans</h2>

<p>From the get-go, there were a lot of things in Iceland that seemed like they were out of a fairy tale about what an ideal human life should look like, at least from the perspective of someone living in the United States.</p>

<p>For example, on our first day, our guide from <a href="http://www.iheartreykjavik.net/">I Heart Reykjavik</a>, took us on a walk through Reykjavik, stopping at a small building that looked like something out of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. “That’s the prime minister’s office,” she told us. “No guards, nothing. He just goes about his work here.” We walked on, towards another two-story building that looked like an office for a small-to-medium business.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/Althingi.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>It was the national Parliament, the Alþingi. “It’s made up of 48% women,” our guide said.  “We’re just short of 50%,” she continued ruefully. I have to admit, I had a sharp intake of breath. It sounded like an impossible miracle. But in Iceland, equality, and more importantly, humanity, shows itself in lots of different ways.</p>

<p>There is the USB charger so you don’t have to coddle your smartphone like an animal.  In the big picture, there is <a href="https://grapevine.is/mag/articles/2017/05/05/poll-most-icelanders-support-equal-pay-law/">gender equality</a>. Not only do women make up a large percentage of the workforce, but childcare is heavily subsidized, costing something like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/28/iceland-women-feminist-paradise-gender-gap-pay">$180 a month per child</a> for eight hours of childcare, including food. Mr. B and I personally pay $800/month, and I know our daycare is on the cheaper end.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/woke.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>There is also a large <a href="https://grapevine.is/news/2017/05/03/only-3400-unemployed-in-iceland/">social safety net</a>, healthcare, and all the goodies that make Scandinavia – Scandinavia.</p>

<p>Additionally, I felt more like a treasured guest than a potential criminal when passing through Icelandic customs, more than I can say for my trip back to the country where I’m actually a citizen.</p>

<p>But there is a lot of humanity in the small things, too. For example, the tap water is not only potable, but delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/water.jpeg" width="400"></p>

<p>When we went to buy a bottle of water at the supermarket, the clerk looked at us like we were crazy. “You know it’s the same thing in the tap,” she said, motioning for us to put the bottle back. The shower water smells like sulfur, because all of Iceland gets its cold water from a glacier, and hot water from <a href="http://wakeupreykjavik.com/the-icelandic-water/">geothermal heating.</a></p>

<p>Then, there’s the matter of the prisons. The <a href="http://www.icenews.is/2016/05/26/old-prison-in-reykjavik-center-gets-a-new-role/#axzz4gOqBvd8b">old town prison in Reykjavik</a>, which had no wire fence around it, or even bars on the windows, grew too small (it can only house 16 prisoners) and is being reconsidered for repurpose as a cultural center.  The current prison population of Iceland is <a href="http://www.icenews.is/2016/05/26/old-prison-in-reykjavik-center-gets-a-new-role/#axzz4gOqBvd8b">153</a>, or less than one tenth of one percent of the population.</p>

<p>Oh, and everyone speaks nearly perfect English.</p>

<p>It seems very, very hard to find anything wrong with Iceland. Until you get to the financial crisis of 2008, when the three largest banks folded, the currency plummeted, and unparalleled levels of corruption were exposed in the government, leading to massive unemployment and genuine fear and panic.</p>

<p>But even as large and traumatic as that <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/iceland-financial-crisis-bankruptcy-and-economy-3306347">devastating moment of extremely poor judgement for the country</a>, was, Iceland now seems to have passed it, i<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35485876">f not with flying colors</a>, at least with more wisdom and grace than the U.S. could muster up during its own fall.  It’s true that the krona has fallen and Iceland experienced a brain drain after the crisis. But it’s also true that a restructuring of the economy has led to a significant decrease in unemployment. The bankers that caused the 2008 financial crisis <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-03-31/welcome-to-iceland-where-bad-bankers-go-to-prison">are also in prison</a>, where they “spend their days doing laundry, working out in the jailhouse gym, and browsing the Internet.” “Sometimes they go horseback riding,” our guide said.</p>

<p>The economy has been on the upswing since 2011, particularly with a lot of strength in the tourism sector, which the Icelandic government is heavily pushing - probably the reason all my friends have known about it. The low cost of the airfare to Iceland relative to Europe or even the West Coast in America, thanks to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/03/business/filling-a-trans-atlantic-air-niche.html?pagewanted=all">hub and spoke model</a> (Iceland is a huge place for flights from Europe and the United States to connect, thus maximizing capacity and optimizing costs for travelers), is huge.</p>

<h2 id="from-lice-to-nice">From lice to nice</h2>

<p>How did Iceland get to this point?  Originally settled in the 10th century by Vikings (and any <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/why-people-in-iceland-look-just-like-us-1.1104676">Irish slaves</a> they picked up on the way), the island was not a very hospitable place.  When the settlers first came, there were almost no native animal species, so they had to bring by boat all the livestock they could to survive. There were also few trees, meaning most houses were made of mud and turf. Life was simply miserable for the first thousand years of Iceland’s existence.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/thingvallir.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>Also, the weather in Iceland is terrible. There are two seasons: rain, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laki">lava</a>. Exposed to both the Arctic wind and laid bare to all the vagaries of the Atlantic Ocean, it rains at least a little every day, in spurts. It was sunny for maybe 15 minutes that I was there. On a particularly windy day, we went <a href="http://eldhestar.is/">riding</a> on the <a href="http://www.visiticeland.com/things-to-do/activities/the-icelandic-horse">small, sturdy horses</a> that are descendants of the original horses the Vikings brought over (no imports are allowed to keep the purity of the breed), and all I could think about, instead of focusing on the beautiful, broody landscape of Hveragerði was about how many Vikings died of pneumonia and ear infections.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/us.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>Things got marginally better over the centuries with more established trade routes, but as late as the the 1800s, men were climbing vertical cliffs plunging to the sea to steal sea bird eggs from ledges. Without these natural “pantries”, a large amount of Icelanders would likely have starved. If you weren’t killed by hunger, the climate, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Abductions">random Turkish raiding parties</a>,  there were always the eagles, one of the only native bird species to grace the island.</p>

<p>The economy really kicked into gear when exposed to the economic crosswinds of World War II, and, of course the British and the Americans. Once the economy took off, it’s been going. Iceland is now diversified away …</p></article></div></div>

<li><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-threat-modeling-machine-learning/">Attacks</a>: Some of the attacks I want to investigate, learn about, and try out</li>
</ul>
<p>A few weeks ago while preparing demos for my GrayHat 2020 - Red Team Village presentation I ran across “Image Scaling Attacks” in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-quiring.pdf">Adversarial Preprocessing: Understanding and Preventing Image-Scaling Attacks in Machine Learning</a> by Erwin Quiring, et al.</p>
<p>I thought that was so cool!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-image-scaling-attack">What is an image scaling attack?</h2>
<p>The basic idea is to hide a smaller image inside a larger image (it should be about 5-10x the size). The attack is easy to explain actually:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacker crafts a malicious input image by hiding the desired target image inside a benign image</li>
<li>The image is loaded by the server</li>
<li>Pre-processing resizes the image</li>
<li>The server acts and makes decision based on a different image then intended</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal was to hide a husky image inside another image:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>Here are the two images I used - before and after the modification:
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>If you look closely, you can see that the second image does have some strange dots all around. But this is not noticable when viewed in smaller version.</p>
<p>You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/EQuiw/2019-scalingattack">Github</a>. I used Google Colab to run it, and there were some errors initialy but it worked - let me know if interested and I can clean up and share the Notebook also.</p>
<h2 id="rescaling-and-magic-happens">Rescaling and magic happens!</h2>
<p>Now, look what happens when the image is loaded and resized with <code>OpenCV</code> using default settings:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>On the left you can see the original sized image, and on the left the same image downsized to 128x128 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>That’s amazing!</strong></p>
<p>The downsized image is an entirely different picture now! Of course I picked a husky, since I wanted to attack “Husky AI” and find another bypass.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>This can have a set of implications:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Training process:</strong> Images that poisen the training data (as pre-processing rescales images)</li>
<li><strong>Model queries:</strong> The model might predict on a different image than the one the user uploaded</li>
<li><strong>Non ML related attacks:</strong> This can also be an issue in other, non machine learning areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess security never gets boring, there is always something new to learn.</p>
<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>
<p>Turns out that Husky AI uses PIL and that was not vulnerable to this attack by default.</p>
<p>I got lucky, because initially Husky AI did use <code>OpenCV</code> and it’s default settings to resize images. But for some reason I changed that early on (not knowing it would also mitigate this attack).</p>
<p>If you use <code>OpenCV</code> the issue can be fixed by using the <code>interpolation</code> argument when calling the <code>resize</code> API to not have it use the default.</p>
<p>Hope that was useful and interesting.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Johann.</p>

<p>Firearms (guns) are one of the hot button issues in the United States and globally. I’m sure it is understandable why — pull the trigger and something dies. Killing is the primary purpose of a firearm. Naturally, this leads many to be fearful of firearms, but should people be fearful?</p>
<p>When I started writing this, I wanted to answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are firearms inherently unsafe?</p>
<p>Should firearms be banned, as many believe?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s quite ambitious. One may believe you can just find an answer on a website / paper somewhere or is obvious. Unfortunately, the reality is far more complicated and has turned this into my longest article to date.</p>
<p>It’s been said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns don’t kill people, people kill people. <em>– unknown</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Many agree and many others strongly disagree. That divisiveness has made firearms a political issue, leading to a plethora of bias studies, inaccurate analysis, and more. Thus, to answer these questions I had to go through the data myself; I pulled <a href="#Data_Tooling">data from the CDC, FBI, RAND, Census and others</a> and completed my own analysis.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Due to the nature of this analysis, it is important to highlight some items upfront.</p>
<p>1. The United States is often the focus throughout the analysis. This is because the United States has an abundance of firearms, a relatively uniform society and the most available &amp; accurate records.</p>
<p>2. This analysis focuses on general trends. Specific situations vary wildly, even in the same region: country, state, county, city, and neighborhood situations vary. As such, I caution making detailed / specific inference, beyond what the data explicitly shows (in the general case).</p>
<p>3. Some important data is lacking, such as socioeconomic status associated with crimes. This makes it very difficult to isolate confounding factors and leads to confusion / lack of definitive answer(s).</p>
<p>The goal of this analysis was to analyze available (and unbiased) data as in-depth as enabled, with no particular outcome in mind. <em>If new data comes in that materially changes what can be inferred, I’ll attempt to update the analysis.</em> With that in mind, I want to highlight that I dive into demographic information and I found some surprises. Politics seems to stifle this topic and in fact the truth. Instead I went to the data, I hope you can find it as interesting as I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is not for all men, but only for those who seek it.<br>
– Ayn Rand</p></blockquote>
<p>If anything in this analysis was missed,<strong> please feel free to reach out or leave comments.</strong></p>


<p>Globally, firearms are highly controlled, particularly in the Europe and Asia. In contrast, the United States has more firearms held by it’s citizens than the rest of the world combined.<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w"></a>The real question — do the number of firearms really matter? From the graph above, it’s clear China, Russia and Iran have a high number of military firearms when compared civilian held firearms (and I suspect most civilian held firearms are former military, in countries such as China, Russia ,Iran, India, etc). In contrast, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free world</a>” has an order of magnitude more civilian firearms, when compared to military firearms.</p>
<p>Clearly, what matters to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second world</a>” is having a large military arsenal, when compared to civilian held firearms.</p>
<p>It can be argued an unarmed society allows the military to impose their will, allowing countries to maintain the status quo and avoiding violent revolutions overthrowing the government.</p>
<h2><span id="Homicides_Firearms_Globally"></span>Homicides &amp; Firearms Globally<span></span></h2>
<p>In the “free world,” the main concern surrounding firearms are homicides &amp; suicides, with homicides being the most concerning. Below is a comparison of homicides by firearm deaths per 100,000 people across the globe.</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" alt="" width="1228" height="677" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1228px) 100vw, 1228px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w"></a>When we compare the world, a few things become clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>The America’s, Caribbean and Africa have a much higher firearm homicide rate</li>
<li>The United States has the highest firearm homicide rate of a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first world</a>” country</li>
<li>Europe has the lowest firearm homicide rate globally</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s not clear, is whether or not firearms are really leading the increased firearm homicide rate.</p>
<p>Are homicides just naturally higher in these regions?</p>
<h2><span id="Firearm_Death_Rate_per_Firearm"></span>Firearm Death Rate per Firearm<span></span></h2>
<p>Below is an argument from the Amnesty International’s website:</p>
<blockquote><p>governments [with] poor regulation of the possession and use of <strong>guns lead to violence</strong> and that they must tackle this now through strict controls on guns and effective interventions in communities suffering high levels of gun violence.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/arms-control/gun-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amnesty International</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The key statement is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns lead to violence</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement above implies a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gun volume and violence are correlated</li>
<li>As the number of guns increase, violence increases</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few ways to invalidate / validate this statement. The clearest method is to simply compare firearm deaths per firearm. If firearms lead to more violence, we should see the ratio of firearm deaths to firearms (firearm deaths / firearms) staying constant (or growing at a constant rate). This ratio should stay or grow at a constant rate because as the firearm count increases, the firearm homicides should increase (keeping the ratio constant). We could also assume a direct correlation if “guns lead to violence” as it would probably occur at some constant rate.</p>
<p>Below you can see the comparison between firearm deaths and firearms:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png" alt="" width="1313" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png 1313w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-300x157.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-1024x536.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-768x402.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1313px) 100vw, 1313px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png 1313w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-300x157.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-1024x536.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-768x402.png 768w"></a>As seen in the chart, the Caribbean, South America, Africa have a high number of firearm deaths per firearm, Columbia having one death per five hundred firearms. In contrast, “First World” (Europe and the United States) has a much lower number of fatalities per firearm, the United States having only one death per ten thousand firearms.</p>

<p>For further evidence firearms aren’t correlated with violence, it’s possible to directly compare the number of firearms vs homicides:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w"></a>Across the bottom of the chart you can see all the countries with high homicide rates. The United States stands out clearly, if firearms were correlated with homicides we’d expect the U.S. to have many more homicides than it currently does. It does not appear more firearms are correlated with more homicides, in fact the trend line shows the opposite to be true (more firearms are correlated to less homicides).</p>
<p>For a final validation, we can compare firearms against homicides and firearm homicides against total homicides. Both should have a similar growth rate, if there was a correlation.</p>

<p>It’s important to note the graph is a logarithmic comparison for homicides and homicides by firearm (firearms per 100k Inhabitants are not logarithmic). The trend line comparison of Total Homicides and Homicides by Firearm is linear, but because the comparison is logarithmic, it appears exponential on the chart.</p>
<p>It is clear as homicides increase, homicides by firearm increase (blue data points). In contrast, when there are more firearms, homicides by firearm remain flat (purple data points), implying more firearms do not cause increase the number of homicides involving a firearm.</p>
<p>Further, you can see the blue star representing the United States homicide rate to homicide firearm deaths is right where it is expected. However, the purple star, representing the United States homicide rate to firearms per 100k inhabitants, is way outside the norm.</p>
<p>To summarize,</p>
<blockquote><p>Globally, as the firearm homicide rate increases, the total homicide rate increases; as the prevalence of firearms increase, the homicide rate <span>does not increase</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The United States is clearly the largest holder of firearms in the world, most states have more firearms than entire countries. Fun fact:</p>
<blockquote><p>Texans and the Chinese military have the same number of firearms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, there’s a culture of gun ownership in the United States. When the United States was formed it had just fought a war of independence and regularly combated Native Americans, settling North America by force. Even today, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States National Guard</a> is one of the largest militias in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.<br>
–<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-2/"> Constitution of the United States</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Without diving into politics, the constitution &amp; culture has enabled the United States to be relatively unique. Firearms are regulated, but just barely. Generally, citizens can do everything from carrying a firearms in public to purchasing assault rifles, flamethrowers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miniguns</a>, rocket launcher(s), etc. Often the only requirement is obtaining permit to own weapons, after that you can regularly purchase as many firearms as you’d like.</p>
<p>As seen in the previous section, the United States does have a higher (on average) number of firearm deaths. However, this doesn’t necessarily tell the whole story. In the prior section, we focused on the homicide rate. In the following sections, the focus will expand as uniform data collection, similar social norms and a widespread framework for law makes comparisons much easier.</p>
<p>Some topics we will explore here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suicide vs homicide vs accidental rates</li>
<li>The type of weapons used in homicides</li>
<li>How demographics impact firearm fatalities</li>
<li>How firearm fatalities compare to other fatalities</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Suicides_Homicides_in_the_United_States"></span>Suicides &amp; Homicides in the United States<span></span></h2>
<p>First, it is also important to highlight just how small the number of firearm related homicides really are, when compared to all deaths. On average, the total (suicide, homicide &amp; accidental) number of firearm related fatalities account for about 1.33% of all deaths in the United States (firearm related homicides account for ~0.44% of all deaths) and it varies wildly between states.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important item to discuss is that this is the “<em>firearm fatality rate</em>“, often conflated with the “<em>firearm homicide rate</em>” by political pundits. While all fatalities are unfortunate, most American’s would argue there is a different between <em>suicides</em> and <em>homicides</em>. Some states, such as Washington, support medically assisted suicides (for the terminally ill).</p>

</p>
<p>There’s a popular book called “JavaScript: The Good Parts.” And there’s a common meme around the relative size of that book versus “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIf3EJh.jpg"></p><p>Haskell is in my opinion a far more well designed and coherent language than JavaScript. However, it’s also an old language with some historical baggage. And in many ways it’s a bleeding edge research language that sometimes includes… half-baked features. And due to an inconsistent set of rules around backwards compatibility, it sometimes will break code every six months, and sometimes keep strange decisions around for decades.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>True mastery of Haskell comes down to knowing which things in core libraries should be avoided like the plague.</p><p>* foldl<br>* sum/product<br>* Data.Text.IO<br>* Control.Exception.bracket (use unliftio instead, handles interruptible correctly)</p><p>Just as some examples</p></div>— Michael Snoyman (@snoyberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/1321049221697544193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>After a request and some tongue-in-cheek comments in that thread, I decided a longer form blog post was in order. I’m going to start off by expanding on the four examples I gave in that tweet. But there are many, many more examples out there. If there’s more interest in seeing a continuation of this series, please let me know. And if you have pet peeves you’d like me to address, input will be very welcome.</p>
<h2>What is a “bad part”</h2>
<p>Very rarely is there such a thing as a language feature, function, type, or library that is so egregiously bad that it should never, ever be used. Null is of course the billion dollar mistake, but it’s still incredibly useful in some cases. So when I say that something is a “bad part” of Haskell, I mean something along these lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rarely-useful feature has been promoted to a position of prominence</li>
<li>A function has major downsides that are not documented</li>
<li>There’s an unexpected performance implication</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a large tendency in the Haskell community to be overly literal in responding to blog posts. Feel free to do that to your heart’s content. But this caveat serves as a word of warning: I’m not going to caveat each one of these with an explanation of “yes, but there’s this one corner case where it’s actually useful.”</p>
<h2>Why attack Haskell?</h2>
<p>Since I’m a Haskeller and advocate of the language, you may be wondering: why am I attacking Haskell? I don’t see this as an attack. I <em>do</em> wish we could fix these issues, and I think it’s a fair thing to say that the problems I’m listing are warts on the language. But every language has warts. I’m writing this because I’ve seen these kinds of things break real world projects. I’ve seen these failures manifest at runtime, defeating yet again the false claim that “if it compiles it works.” I’ve seen these become nefarious time bombs that disincentivize people from ever working with Haskell in the future.</p>
<p>I hope by calling these out publicly, I can help raise awareness of these problems. And then, either we can fix the problems at their source or, more likely, get more widespread awareness of the issue.</p>
<p>Also, because it feels appropriate, I’m going to take a more jovial tone below. I personally find it easier to beat up on a language I love like that.</p>
<h2>foldl</h2>
<p>Duncan Coutts <a href="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2014/04/fixing-foldl/">already did this one</a>. <code>foldl</code> is broken. It’s a bad function. Left folds are supposed to be strict, not lazy. End of story. Goodbye. Too many space leaks have been caused by this function. We should gut it out entirely.</p>
<p>But wait! A lazy left fold makes perfect sense for a <code>Vector</code>! Yeah, no one ever meant that. And the problem isn’t the fact that this function exists. It’s the <strong>name</strong>. It has taken the hallowed spot of the One True Left Fold. I’m sorry, the One True Left Fold is strict.</p>
<p>Also, side note: we can’t raise linked lists to a position of supreme power within our ecosystem and then pretend like we actually care about vectors. We don’t, we just pay lip service to them. Until we fix the wart which is overuse of lists, <code>foldl</code> is only ever used on lists.</p>
<p>OK, back to this bad left fold. This is all made worse by the fact that the true left fold, <code>foldl'</code>, is not even exported by the <code>Prelude</code>. We Haskellers are a lazy bunch. And if you make me type in <code>import Data.List (foldl')</code>, I just won’t. I’d rather have a space leak than waste precious time typing in those characters.</p>
<p>Alright, so what should you do? Use an alternative prelude that doesn’t export a bad function, and does export a good function. If you really, really want a lazy left fold: add a comment, or use a function named <code>foldlButLazyIReallyMeanIt</code>. Otherwise I’m going to fix your code during my code review.</p>
<h2>sum/product</h2>
<p>The <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> functions are implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>. Well, actually <code>foldMap</code>, but list’s <code>foldMap</code> is implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>, and lists are the only data structure that exist in Haskell. “Oh, but <code>foldr</code> is the good function, right?” Only if you’re folding a function which is lazy in its second argument. <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are both strict in both of their arguments.</p>
<p>If you’re not aware of that terminology: “strict in both arguments” means “in order to evaluate the result of this function/operator, I need to evaluate both of its arguments.” I can’t evaluate <code>x + y</code> without knowing what <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are. On the other hand, <code>:</code> (list cons) is lazy in its second argument. Evaluating <code>x : y</code> doesn’t require evaluating <code>y</code> (or, for that matter, <code>x</code>). (For more information, see <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/all-about-strictness/">all about strictness</a>.)</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say. “What if I have a custom data type with a custom typeclass instance of <code>Num</code> that has a custom <code>+</code> and/or <code>*</code> that is in fact lazy in the second argument! Then <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> are perfect as they are!”</p>
<p>That’s true. Now go off and write your own <code>lazySum</code> and <code>lazyProduct</code>. 99 times out of 100, or more likely 999,999 times out of 1,000,000, we want the fully strict version.</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t matter, GHC will optimize this away.” Maybe. Maybe not. Stop relying on GHC’s optimizer to convert horribly inefficient code into not efficient code. (But I digress, we’ll talk about why the <code>vector</code> package is bad another time.)</p>
<h2>Data.Text.IO</h2>
<p>I’ve already covered this one once before when I told everyone to <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/12/beware-of-readfile">beware of <code>readFile</code></a>. In that blog post, I talk about a bunch of <code>String</code> based I/O functions, especially the titular <code>readFile</code>, which is obnoxiously exported by <code>Prelude</code>. Those are bad, and I’ll reiterate why in a second. But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is arguably far worse. The reason is that there’s pretty good awareness in the community that <code>String</code>-based I/O is bad. Even though the <code>String</code> part is the least of our worries, it does a good job of scaring away the uninitiated.</p>
<p>But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. We’re all told by people who think they can tell people how to write their Haskell code (<em>cough</em> me <em>cough</em>) that we should exorcise <code>String</code> from our codebases and replace it in all cases with <code>Text</code>. Attacking the <code>Text</code> type is a topic for another time. But the problem is that by cloaking itself in the warm embrace of <code>Text</code>, this module claims more legitimacy than it deserves.</p>
<p>The only module worse in this regard is <code>Data.Text.Lazy.IO</code>, which should be buried even deeper.</p>
<p>OK, what exactly am I on about? Locale sensitive file decoding. It’s possible that this has been the number one example of a Haskell bug in the wild I’ve encountered in my entire career. Not the spooky memory leak. Partial functions like <code>head</code> randomly throwing exceptions are up there, but don’t quite rise to prominence.</p>
<p>You see, when you are dealing with file formats, there is typically an actual, defined format. YAML, XML, JSON, and many others give a lot of information about how to serialize data, including character data, into raw bytes. We want to be consistent. We want to write a file in one run of the program, and have it read in a separate run. We want to write the file on a Windows machine and read it on a Linux machine. Or we want to interact with programs in other languages that read or write data in a consistent format.</p>
<p>Locale sensitive file encoding and decoding laughs in our face. When you use <code>Data.Text.IO.readFile</code>, it plays a mind reading game of trying to deduce from clues you don’t care about which character encoding to use. These days, on the vast majority of systems used by native English speakers, this turns out to be UTF-8. So using <code>readFile</code> and <code>writeFile</code> typically “just works.” Using functions from <code>Data.Text.IO</code> looks safe, and can easily get hidden in a large PR or a library dependency.</p>
<p>That’s when all hell breaks loose. You ship this code. You run it in a Docker container. “Oops, you forgot to set the <code>LANG</code> env var, Imma crash.” But it’s worse than that. Typically things will work well for weeks or months, because it can often be a long time before someone tries to encode a non-ASCII character.</p>
<p>The same kind of thing happens regularly to Stack. Someone adds a new feature that writes and reads a file. The code passes all integration tests. And then someone in Russia with a weird Windows code page set and a Cyrillic character in their name files a bug report 2 years later about how they can’t build anything, and we sheepishly tell them to run <code>chcp 65001</code> or build in <code>c:\</code>.</p>
<p>Friends don’t let friends use <code>Data.Text.IO</code>.</p>
<p>“Oh, but <code>putStrLn</code> is fine!” Yeah, maybe. It’s also potentially slow. And it will throw a runtime exception due to character encoding mismatches. Just use a good logging library. That’s why we have one in <code>rio</code>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Since so many people have asked: instead of <code>readFile</code>, I recommend using <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-16.20/rio-0.1.19.0/RIO.html#v:readFileUtf8"><code>readFileUtf8</code></a>, which is available from <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a>.</p>
<h2>Control.Exception.bracket</h2>
<p>This is by far the least objectionable of the bad things in this list. I included it because the entire original tweet was inspired by a coworker telling me about a bug he ran into because of this function.</p>
<p>Async exceptions are subtle. Very, very subtle. Like, super duper subtle. I’ve devoted a large percentage to my Haskell teaching career towards them. Async exceptions are a concept that don’t truly exist in most other languages. They require rewiring the way your brain works for …</p></div></div>

<p>Call me arrogant, but I’d rather optimize my indoor environment than try to spend more time in the capricious outdoors. I think it’s defeatism to give up on improving our indoor spaces and resign ourselves to the fickle weather and seasons. </p>
<p>If I was going to create an ideal environment for a human, I think there are several things I would include that we routinely fail to include in our homes and offices.</p>
<h3 id="lighting">Lighting</h3>
<p>Our indoor lighting situation usually sucks. The fact that “natural lighting” is a selling point in real estate shows how terrible a job we are doing in this department. We rely on the sun naturally providing us with sufficient light, and if it’s an overcast day or the days have grown shorter in the winter, then I guess we’re shit out of luck. </p>
<p>Usually, indoor areas are around 50-500 lux. This is hundreds of times dimmer than the sunlight. Clearly, we weren’t designed to thrive in such dim environments, and science does verify a connection between brighter light and alertness. If we don’t want to be sleepy like it’s nighttime, we shouldn’t light our rooms like it’s nighttime. For some, the effects of dim lighting go beyond simple lethargy and, especially in the winter, cause serious mood problems like seasonal affective disorder or the winter blues. This is common, but it’s not necessary. Bright light, particularly blue light, can also generally boost mood and may be a comparable stimulant to caffeine. (Those who are prone to mania should be careful, as intense light can trigger mania or hypomania in those predisposed.) Brighter lighting can also help circadian rhythm issues (which I, for example, have struggled with for years), both by entraining your circadian rhythm so your body better knows when it’s day, and by shortening it if it’s too long. </p>
<p>Lighting isn’t as expensive as it used to be, so we can do better than we have in the past. The cost of electricity for LED lighting is now negligible, and the only real factor is the cost of the bulbs themselves. Reaching for the full 100,000 lux of sunlight would still be prohibitively expensive, but going for at least 10,000 lux is doable with only a few hundred dollars. I won’t go into specifics here, but you can get more information on specific lighting setups <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hC2NFsuf5anuGadFm/how-to-build-a-lumenator">here</a> or <a href="https://meaningness.com/metablog/sad-light-lumens">here</a>. In particular, get bulbs with a color temperature close to sunlight (5600k), but make sure the bulbs have a <span>good<span>good means 90+</span></span> Color Rendering Index (CRI), otherwise the light will feel harsh.</p>
<p>I recommend putting any bright lighting you buy for your home on electrical timers so you don’t accidentally leave them on during the evening and screw up your sleep. You may also want to set your phone/computer brightness on a timer, if you can. The goal is to mimic the natural day/night cycle of our evolutionary environment, but without all the pesky volatility of nature. You can get programs like f.lux too, which reduce the amount of blue light emitted by your device in the evening, but in my experience this isn’t good enough and reducing the actual brightness of the device at night is also important.</p>
<p>“But what about vitamin D? Just go outside!” This is terrible advice, and I hear it too often. Sunlight is a powerful carcinogen, and vitamin D supplements are not, and they’re cheap. </p>
<h3 id="carbon-dioxide">Carbon dioxide</h3>
<p>Carbon MON-oxide is the deadly one you probably already have a monitor for in your house. Carbon DI-oxide is the feeble cousin of carbon monoxide, but it still has a negative effect on human health: <span>high (but common)<span>1,000 ppm or higher</span></span> levels impairs our ability to think. Just what you don’t want in an office. High levels may also have a negative long-term impact in other areas of our health. </p>
<p>Hold your breath. When it sucks and you decide to start breathing again, it’s carbon dioxide buildup, not lack of oxygen, causing you to feel panic and the need to breath. Carbon dioxide is a toxin. And we breath it out into poorly ventilated rooms, where the levels can rise to double or triple what they are <span>outdoors<span>around 400 ppm</span></span>.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown significant (temporary) cognitive impairments due to carbon dioxide levels over 1,000 ppm, but such levels are <span>common<span>I recently bought a carbon dioxide meter and found such levels in my home.</span></span> in poorly ventilated shared spaces. Fortunately, the solution is simple: open a window. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work when it’s raining, or when it’s too hot outside, or when it’s too cold outside… In particular, I have to contend with Canadian winters, which means opening the window is a valid strategy for a minority of the year unless I buy an expensive heat recovery ventilator. I don’t have a good solution for mitigating carbon dioxide buildup in the winter. Let me know if you do.</p>
<p>And, by the way, plants won’t work. They won’t suck up nearly enough carbon dioxide. You would need hundreds of plants per person, or roughly a dozen full-size trees per person, to offset the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans in a room.</p>
<p>A fun fact: if we don’t stop pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, then in about a century, carbon dioxide <em>outdoors</em> may reach cognitively impairing levels. Then what do we do? </p>
<h3 id="temperature-and-humidity">Temperature and Humidity</h3>
<p>High/low humidity and high/low temperature both lead to discomfort and lower scores on concentration measures. People generally have temperature under control, or at least it’s something they’re aware of. Humidity is less common to measure, but a $10 hygrometer should help you get your indoor space to the ideal 30-50% humidity range if it isn’t already. Air conditioners also tend to reduce humidity as well as temperature, so air-condition in the summer and use a humidifier in the winter.</p>
<p>At night, drop the temperature a few degrees if you can; It’s easier to sleep in a cool room. I wonder how many hours of sleep have been reclaimed already due to the advent of smart thermostats.</p>
<h3 id="background-noise">Background Noise</h3>
<p>I imagine this factor is more subjective than the others, but too loud is distracting, even aggrivating; too quiet makes your sniffles and sighs painfully audible to others, and so is distracting. Uneven background noise like traffic is worse than the uniform background noise of white noise or trickling water. Bad background noise leads to poorer cognition and focus.</p>
<p>It’s easy to be bothered by noise and not realize it until the noise stops and a wave of relief finally makes you aware of how annoyed you were by the sound. Noise issues are happily easy to control: earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones will generally do the trick. It would be utopic to eliminate bothersome noise from the environment altogether, but it’s not necessary. </p>
<h3 id="segregation-of-activities">Segregation of Activities</h3>
<p>A heroin addict who normally takes their dose in their car decides one day to inject in their bathroom. They die of an overdose, even though they took the same amount they normally do. Why? Our brains maintain associations with different environments. If you normally inject heroin when you get in your car, then your body starts to prepare you for the drug as soon as you get in the car. Drug tolerance, then, is partly environmental. (This <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1196296/">actually happened</a> and happens regularly.) Your mind and body are affected by your environment due to Pavlovian conditioning. When the bell rings, the dog salivates. When the lunch bell rings, so do you. </p>
<p>One common piece of advice given by doctors to insomniacs is to only use your bed for sleeping and for sex, and it’s good advice. If you use your bed for reading, studying, and watching TV, then your mind will not form a strong association between the bed and sleep, and you will have a harder time falling asleep. </p>
<p>Likewise, if you do all your slacking off at the same desk you do your work at, you will probably have a harder time focusing. Even having your smartphone within your field of view while you work has been shown to reduce focus. So it wouldn’t hurt to have different areas for work and play, and to not eat at your desk. (And even different user accounts on your computer for work and non-work, if you don’t find that idea to be a pain in the ass like I do.)</p>
<p>We also form associations not just with space, but with time. Hence another piece of common sleep hygeine advice: go to sleep at the same time every night. Your body will learn to expect sleep at that time. Likewise, people who eat at the same time every day eat with their bodies prepared to receive food, and so are less likely to become obese. Studies have shown this. Unfortunately, setting every aspect of your life to a clock can make you feel like a robot, so I usually don’t tolerate such rigidity in my life. But it’s worth thinking about.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brighter lights for your poor eyes</li>
<li>Better ventilation for your poor lungs</li>
<li>Optimal temperature and humidity for your poor skin</li>
<li>Less distracting background noise for your poor ears</li>
<li>Activity-specific areas for your poor brain</li>
</ul>
<p>I also think the aesthetics of most of our indoor environments could use an upgrade, but I don’t have much to say on the subject besides simply saying so. (Though I would bet: green lush &gt; grey drab.)</p>
<p>We sometimes act like we are just <span>machines<span>caffeine in ⟶ code out</span></span>, but we are not. We’re mushy creatures with delicate bodies and delicate minds, too. And we evolved for one specific environment. There is no guarantee that the indoor environment which is cheapest to produce is going to be just as good for us as a bespoke imitation of our evolutionary environment, and in fact it is not. I think life would be more pleasant if people took these factors more serously when designing indoor environments, and our work would be more efficient and less prone to mistakes.</p>

<p>A recently published book in France warns about how digital devices are seriously affecting the neural development of children and young people.</p>
<p>The text is called <em>The digital cretin factory</em> and it was written by Michel Desmurget, director of research at the French National Institute of Health.</p>
<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-54554333.amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, the author of the work, which has become a bestseller in his country, assures that today’s young people are the first generation in history with a lower IQ than the previous one.</p>
<p>“Researchers have observed in many parts of the world that IQ increased from generation to generation.  This was called the ‘Flynn effect’, in reference to the American psychologist who described this phenomenon.  But recently, this trend began to be reversed in several countries ”, says the researcher.</p>
<p>“In those countries, digital natives are the first children to have a lower IQ than their parents.  It is a trend that has been documented in Norway, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, France, etc. ”.</p>
<p>Although the specific factors involved in this phenomenon have not yet been determined, it has been proven that the time a child spends in front of a screen would have an important effect on their IQ.</p>
<p>Thus, according to the author, when the use of television or video games increases, IQ and cognitive development tend to decrease.</p>
<p>This would directly affect the main foundations of our intelligence, such as language, concentration, memory and culture in general, which would end up causing a significant drop in academic performance.</p>
<h2>Why is this happening?</h2>
<p>According to Desmurget, dependence on screens and digital devices is associated with a decrease in the quality and quantity of family interactions, as well as a decrease in the time spent on other activities that can be more enriching.</p>
<p>Sleep disruption, overestimation of attention, intellectual under-stimulation (the brain cannot unfold its full potential) and the adoption of an excessively sedentary lifestyle are also involved.</p>
<p>Michel Desmurget, with studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of California, criticizes the enormous amount of time that today’s children spend in front of digital devices.</p>
<p>“On average, almost three hours a day for 2-year-olds, about five hours for 8-year-olds and more than seven hours for adolescents,” he explains.</p>
<p>“This means that before reaching the age of 18, our children will have spent the equivalent of 30 school years in front of recreational screens or, if you prefer, 16 years of full-time work!  It is simply crazy and irresponsible ”.</p>

<h2><a href="https://chrisseaton.com/">Chris Seaton</a>, 28 October 2020</h2>


</header>

<p>There’s a proposal to add <em>Software Transactional Memory</em>, or <em>STM</em>, to the Ruby programming language. This is part of a wider effort to add better support for concurrency and parallelism in Ruby, and in particular the idea of <em>ractors</em>. A concept has been <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/3652">implemented</a> by Koichi Sasada.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/ruby-stm/testBoard.gif" width="50%">
<figcaption>An animation of the algorithm we're going to use as an example of STM - we'll explain this later on</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This article gives some context on what STM is, how you use it, and why you might want to use it. We’ll show an application which is well-suited to STM and we’ll use this to talk about the benefits, issues, and some open questions.</p>

<p>We’ll finish by setting a challenge for STM in Ruby.</p>

<p>I wrote the first half of my PhD on STM, and the second half on Ruby, so I’ve got quite a bit of experience with both and the idea of their combination is very interesting to me.</p>

<h2 id="why-might-we-want-an-stm">Why might we want an STM?</h2>

<p>Let’s say we’re a bank managing many bank accounts. Each account has a total. We get a never-ending stream of requests to move a sum of money <code>m</code> from an account <code>a</code> to account <code>b</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Something not everyone may know about Ruby is that <code>x += y</code> is equivalent to writing <code>t = x; x = t + y</code>. We’ll write that out in full to make that clear to ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>

<p>We’ve got a lot of transfers to run through, so we’ll have multiple threads processing these transfers.</p>

<p>We’ve got a few problems here now. With all these threads running at the same time, what happens if two threads are putting money into your account concurrently?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>100</span>

<span># thread 1                        # thread 2</span>
<span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
  <span># balance = 100</span>
                                  <span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
                                    <span># balance = 100</span>
<span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
  <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
                                  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
                                    <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two transfers have run, but your balance is 110. The other 10 has been lost - this is called a <em>lost update</em>, meaning it’s as if the update was never made.</p>

<p>Also consider what happens if the thread crashes after taking money from <code>a</code> but before putting it into <code>b</code>? The transfer would be applied partially and again we’d lose money.</p>

<p>We need to use some kind of <em>synchronization</em> on our accounts. Ruby has <em>mutual exclusion locks</em> or <em>mutexes</em>, so we can try using those.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Does this work? What if we process a transfer from account 1001 to account 1002 on one thread at the same time as processing a transfer from account 1002 to 1001, so the other way around, at the same time?</p>

<p>The first thread will try to lock 1001 and then 1002. The second thread will try to lock 1002 and then 1001. If the first thread gets as far as locking 1001, and the second as far as locking 1002, then both will be waiting for the opposite lock and will never release the lock they already have. We will be in <em>deadlock</em>.</p>

<p>If we always acquired locks in the same order, by collecting them up first and sorting them, we could fix this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>].</span><span>sort</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>y</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now in both transfers account 1001 is locked first and 1002 is locked second. That will work.</p>

<p>We have to make up a somewhat artificial requirement to explain the next issue, but consider if for some good reason we wanted to transfer to one account if we had a lot of money, and a different account if we only had a little money. Maybe if we’re rich this month we donate to charity, otherwise we unfortunately need to save for ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if account balance &gt; 1000
  transfer 10 to charity
else
  transfer 10 to savings
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll talk about accounts <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, now, and a threshold of money <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>It’s starting to get very complicated. And this locks more than it needs to - it locks both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> but then only uses one of them. If you use <code>b</code> in the end, ideally another thread could be serving a transfer to <code>c</code> at the same time, but you’ve locked it and it can’t. Imagine if instead of two potential accounts it was thousands and you had to lock them all. Imagine if you couldn’t work out at all which account you’d be transferring to until you started the transfer - then you’d never be able to process two transfers at the same time.</p>

<p>At this point as well we’re likely to start to make errors trying to do all this locking and ordering of locks and things.</p>

<p>Stepping back and taking it all in, we can draw up some requirements for what we need.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>atomicity</em> - that all writes in the transfer are applied or none are applied</li>
  <li><em>consistency</em> - meaning that our data structures are always valid - the total sum of money never changes</li>
  <li><em>isolation</em> - meaning one transfer does not interfere with another</li>
  <li><em>durability</em> - meaning that when applied the transfer is available to all subsequent transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally a library or the language could do this all for us. We’d like to be able to write almost what we originally wrote, but with just an annotation to make the code inside a block atomic, consistent, isolated, and the result durable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>atomically</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is what a <em>transactional</em> memory can let us do. It will automatically monitor what you read and write inside the <code>atomically</code> block, which is a <em>transaction</em>, and will make sure it is either applied fully or not, that the balance of the whole system is always consistent, that transactions do not see the result of each other partially applied, and that writes appear and stay.</p>

<p>It may be implemented using the code we eventually arrived at ourselves, or it could do something else instead. In practice how it is often implemented is that
reads and writes are stored in a log, then at the end the transaction works out if anyone else has written locations that you’ve read. If they have then the values you read are no longer valid, so your transaction <em>conflicts</em> with another, is <em>aborted</em> and retries, reading the locations again. When it eventually does not conflict with any other transactions it is <em>committed</em> and succeeds. This means you don’t need to lock everything up-front, which means you avoid the problem of what happens if you may potentially need every account. Locking everything up-front is called <em>pessimistic locking</em>. We’re moving to <em>optimistic locking</em></p>

<p>Koichi’s <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> STM for Ruby, in combination with his proposed <em>ractors</em> (similar to <em>actors</em>) would look like this.</p>

<p>He’s using a <code>Ractor</code> but you can think of it as a thread for the purposes of this article. Instead of an array of account balances, we now have an array of <code>TVar</code> objects that contain values. A <code>TVar</code> is a <em>transactional variable</em>. Only these variables are transactional - not any other Ruby value you read or write. His design requires that the <code>TVar</code> objects you’re going to use are passed into the <code>Ractor</code>, due to rules about sharing that aren’t relevant for this article.</p>

<p>This looks good, doesn’t it!</p>

<h2 id="a-more-complex-application">A more complex application</h2>

<p>Let’s consider a larger application, in order to illustrate further and to talk about some issues and open questions. The <a href="https://github.com/chrisseaton/ruby-stm-lee-demo">code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s say it’s our job to lay out the wires on a circuit board. We get a board with <em>pads</em> (connections to components mounted on the board) and a list of <em>routes</em> that we need to draw between these pads. There are a great many pads and routes, there isn’t much space on the tiny board, and another catch is that it’s very expensive to have wires crossing each other. Let’s say it’s exponentially more expensive for more deeply stacked wires.</p>

<p>In this minimal example we we can see two routes, and how they have to cross each other.</p>

<p>This example is a processor module and shows what kind of scale we might want to be working at. This board has many longer routes which are more likely to conflict.</p>

<p>This example is a memory module. It has many shorter routes which we may expect to conflict less.</p>

<p>We’ll use this test board, which is somewhere between all these extremes.</p>

<p>There’s an algorithm to lay each routes, and it actually produces an optimal solution for an individual route, but not for all routes. It’s called <em>Lee’s algorithm</em> and was published back in 1960. We’ll …</p></article></div>

<p>Addressing is a fertile ground for incorrect assumptions, because everyone's used to dealing with addresses and 99% of the time they seem so simple.
Below are some incorrect assumptions I've seen made, or made myself, or had reported to me.
(If you want to look up an address for a UK postcode or vice-versa to confirm what I'm telling you, try the <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/postcode-finder/">Royal Mail Postcode Finder</a>)</p>

<!-- Composition of building numbers -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>An address will start with, or at least include, a building number.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, WC2E 9DD, United Kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there is a building number, it will be all-numeric.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 1A Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT</p>

<p>4-5 Bonhill Street, London, EC2A 4BX</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No buildings are numbered zero</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 0 Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well, at the very least no buildings have negative numbers</strong></p>

<p>Guy Chisholm provided this counterexample: Minusone Priory Road, Newbury, RG14 7QS</p>

<p>(none of the databases I've checked render this as -1)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We can put those funny numbers into the building name field, as no buildings have both a name and a funny number</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Idas Court, 4-6 Princes Road, Hull, HU5 2RD</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's a building name, there won't be a building number (or vice-versa)</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Flat 1.4, Ziggurat Building, 60-66 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8QX, United Kingdom</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building number will only be used once per street</strong></p>

<p>The difference between 50 Ammanford Road, Tycroes, Ammanford, SA18 3QJ and 50 Ammanford Road, Llandybie, Ammanford, SA18 3YF is about 4 miles (<a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=SA18+3QJ+to+SA18+3YF">Google Maps</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's line with a number in an address, it's the building number.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Flat 18, Da Vinci House, 44 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8FH, United Kingdom</p>

<p>You also get suite numbers, floor numbers, unit numbers, and organisations with numbers in their names.</p>

<p>Adrien Piérard contributes an address from Japan with fifteen digits in six separate numbers (five if you count the zip code as a single number). The format is: 980-0804 (zip code), Miyagi-ken (prefecture) Sendai-shi (city) Aoba-ku (ward) Kokubuncho (district) 4-10-20 (sub-district-number block-number lot-number) Sendai (building name) 401 (flat number).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, the first line starting with a number then</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 3 Store, 311-318 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BN</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building will only have one number</strong></p>

<p>Benton Lam offers this address from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - it has both a number on its road (14) and in its group of buildings (3): 15/F, Cityplaza 3, 14 TaiKoo Wan Road, Island East, HKSAR</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The number of buildings is the difference between the highest and lowest building numbers</strong></p>

<p>Tibor Schütz points out building numbers may be skipped - for example, on a street where even-numbered buildings are on one side, odd numbers on the other; multiple buildings sharing the same number (such as where a new house has been built) and buildings with more than one number.</p>

<p>Cyrille Chépélov and Sami Lehtinen tell me in Antibes, France and rural Finland some buildings are numbered based on the distance from the start of the road - such as Longroad 65 for the building 750m from the start of longroad.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If the addresses on the left of the road are even, the addresses on the right must be odd</strong></p>

<p>Cyrille Chépélov points out that in places, <a href="https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=48.857415,2.467167">Boulevard Théophile Sueur, Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France</a> has evens-only on both sides. The two sides are also in different cities and Départements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building name won't also be a number</strong></p>

<p>Ben Tilly reports on Ten Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA - which is not, reportedly, the same as 10 Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well, at least you can omit leading zeros</strong></p>

<p>Shaun Crampton reports living at 101 Alma St, Apartment 001, Palo Alto - where apartments 1 and 001 were on different floors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A street with a building A will not also have a building Alpha</strong></p>

<p>Douglas Perreault reports he lived in a block within a condo association; it was a large association, with blocks A through Z then Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Theta. Mail and deliveries were often misrouted from block Alpha to block A and vice-versa. His address at the time was: 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Tampa, FL 33613</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- Composition of street names -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A street name won't include a number</strong></p>

<p>8 Seven Gardens Burgh, WOODBRIDGE, IP13 6SU (pointed out by Raphael Mankin)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but numbers in street names are expressed as words, not digits</strong></p>

<p>Jan Jongboom reports streets can be numbered in the Netherlands - for example, Plein 1944 in Nijmegen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's a numbered street and a house number, there will be a separator between them</strong></p>

<p>Another from Jan Jongboom: Gondel 2695, Lelystad, means area Gondel, street 26, number 95</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Street names always end in descriptors like 'street', 'avenue', 'drive', 'square', 'hill' or 'view'</strong></p>

<p>They don't always - for example: Piccadilly, London, W1J 9PN</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but when they do have a descriptor there will only be one</strong></p>

<p>A street name can be entirely descriptors: 17 Hill Street, London, W1J 5LJ or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_Road">Avenue Road, Toronto, Ontario</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but when they do have a descriptor it will be at the end</strong></p>

<li><p><strong>OK, but if there's a descriptor it'll be at the start or end of the street name.</strong></p>

<p>Kirk Kerekes spent several years using an address of the form "2 mi N then 3 mi W of Jennings, OK 74038" which regularly got successful deliveries. Mike Riley used to mail the Very Large Array radio telescope at "50 miles (80 km) West of Socorro, New Mexico, USA"</p>

<p>Sam pointed me to <a href="http://www.menomoneefallsnow.com/news/99857214.html">Menomonee Falls</a> where houses are addressed using Milwaukee County's grid system instead of house numbers - giving addresses like N88 W16541 Foobar St.</p>

<p>Andy Monat sent the following address example, from a <a href="http://ciapa.tulane.edu/uploads/1_EE_2012_Acceptance_Packet_INFORMATION-1340749206.pdf">semester abroad program at Tulane University </a>: CIAPA, 50 meters north of the Hypermas/Walmart of Curridabat, San Jose, Costa Rica. Adrien Piérard and Luke Allardyce point out street names are seldom used in Japan - instead, districts and blocks and lot numbers are used (more info on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">Wikipedia entry for the Japanese addressing system</a>).  A <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/592.cfm">2002 World Press Review report</a> gave this sample address: From where the Chinese restaurant used to be, two blocks down, half a block toward the lake, next door to the house where the yellow car is parked, Managua, Nicaragua. Shaun Crampton sent <a href="https://vianica.com/nicaragua/practical-info/14-addresses.html">an article with more details and examples of the Nicaraguan system</a>. Stig Brautaset pointed out <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14806350">a BBC article about post in Kabul</a> gives this example: "Hamid Jaan, behind Darul-Aman palace". Nathan Fellman reports similar addressing is used in Nicaragua and Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Paul Puschmann and Tibor Schütz pointed out the city of <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratestadt">Mannheim in Germany is sometimes called Quadratestadt (City of Squares)</a> as the city centre is arranged in a grid, with blocks assigned a letter (along the north-south axis) and a number (along the east-west axis) then buildings numbered by block number. So an example address at numbers 6 to 13 on block R 5 would be: Institut für Deutsche Sprache, R 5, 6-13, D-68161 Mannheim </p>

<li><p><strong>A road will have a name</strong></p>

<p>Plenty of roads like driveways, onramps and the aisles of carparks don't have names. Some roads in Japan also don't have names, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">the prevalent addressing system works on districts, subdistricts, blocks, lots and lot numbers</a>.</p>

<p>Peter Kenway points out in America some homes are addressed as Rural Routes, where numbers are allocated to boxes on a route covering multiple roads. For example: Box 1234, R.R. 1, Winthrop, ME 04364.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A road will only have one name</strong></p>

<p>Many different roads, from Goswell Road in London to Regent Road in Edinburgh, make up the 410 mile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_road_%28Great_Britain%29">A1</a>. And while there may only be one "1 Goswell Road" and only one "1 Regent Road" there are multiple buildings numbered 1 on the road designated A1.</p>

<p>Roads may also be named in multiple languages. For example, in Ireland roads may be named in both English and Irish</p></li>

<p><span>Written: 28 Oct 2020 by <i>Jeremy Howard</i></span></p><blockquote>
<p><em>Update Oct 20, 2020</em>: NumFOCUS <a href="https://numfocus.org/blog/jeremy-howard-apology">has apologized</a> to me. I accept their apology. I do not accept their assertion that “At the time of the interview, the committee had not determined that there was a violation of the code of conduct, only that there were two complaints filed and being examined.” The email to set up the call said “We would like to schedule a meeting so that we can discuss the results of our investigation with you” - nothing further. During the call, the committee stated the list of violations, and said “that is what the reporters stated, and what we found”. I asked why they didn’t take a statement from me before that finding, and they said “we all watched the video, so we could see for ourselves the violation”. The committee offered in their apology email to me to have a follow-up discussion, and I declined the offer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary: NumFOCUS found I violated their Code of Conduct (CoC) at JupyterCon because my talk was not “kind”, because I said Joel Grus was “wrong” regarding his opinion that Jupyter Notebook is not a good software development environment. Joel (who I greatly respect, and consider an asset to the data science community) was not involved in NumFOCUS’s action, was not told about it, and did not support it. NumFOCUS did not follow their own enforcement procedure and violated their own CoC, left me hanging for over a week not even knowing what I was accused of, and did not give me an opportunity to provide input before concluding their investigation. I repeatedly told their committee that my emotional resilience was low at the moment due to medical issues, which they laughed about and ignored, as I tried (unsuccessfully) to hold back tears. The process has left me shattered, and I won’t be able to accept any speaking requests for the foreseeable future. I support the thoughtful enforcement of Code of Conducts to address sexist, racist, and harassing behavior, but that is not what happened in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In my recent JupyterCon keynote, “I Like Jupyter Notebooks” (re-recording provided at the bottom of this post, if you’re interested in seeing it for yourself), I sought to offer a rebuttal to Joel Grus’ highly influential JupyterCon presentation “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a>”. Joel claimed in his talk that Jupyter is a poor choice for software development and teaching, and I claimed in my talk that it is a good choice. The NumFOCUS committee found me guilty of violating their code of conduct for having not been “kind” in my disagreement with Joel, and for “insulting” him. The specific reasons given were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I said that Joel Grus was “wrong”</li>
<li>I used some of his slides (properly attributed) and a brief clip from one of his videos to explain why I thought he was wrong</li>
<li>That I made “a negative reference” to his prior talk</li>
<li>I was also told that “as a keynote speaker” I would “be held to a higher standard than others” (although this was not communicated to me prior to my talk, nor what that higher standard is)</li>
</ul>
<p>Code of Conducts can be a useful tool, when thoughtfully created and thoughtfully enforced, to address sexism, racism, and harassment, all of which have been problems at tech conferences. Given the <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996">diversity issues in the tech industry</a>, it is important that we continue the work of making conferences more inclusive, particularly to those from marginalized backgrounds. Having a code of conduct with explicit rules against violent threats, unwelcome sexual attention, repeated harassment, sexually explicit pictures, and other harmful behavior is the first step towards addressing and stopping those behaviors. The JupyterCon code provides the following examples of unacceptable behavior, none of which are at all similar to what I did (i.e. saying that someone was wrong on a technical topic, and explaining how and why):</p>
<ul>
<li>Violent threats or violent language directed against another person</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”)</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop</li>
</ul>
<p>My experience with the NumFOCUS code of conduct raises a few key issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CoC enforcement process involved conflicting &amp; changing information, no opportunity for me to give input, the stress of a long wait of unknown duration with no information about what I was accused of or what would happen next, and the committee members violated their own CoC during the process</li>
<li>There were two totally different Codes of Conduct with different requirements linked in different places</li>
<li>I was held to a different, undocumented and uncommunicated standard</li>
<li>The existence of, or details about, the CoC were not communicated prior to confirmation of the engagement</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend avoiding requirements of politeness or other forms of “proper” behavior, but should focus on a specific list of unacceptable behaviors. The JupyterCon CoC, however, is nearly entirely a list of “proper” behaviors (such as “Be welcoming”, “Be considerate”, and “Be friendly”) that are vaguely defined</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend using a CoC that focuses on a list of unacceptable behaviors. Both the codes linked to JupyterCon have such a link, and none of the unacceptable behavior examples are in any way related or close to what happened in this case. But NumFOCUS nonetheless found me in violation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would rather not have to write this post at all. However I know that people will ask about why my talk isn’t available on the JupyterCon site, so I felt that I should explain exactly what happened. In particular, I was concerned that if only partial information became available, the anti-CoC crowd might jump on this as an example of problems with codes of conduct more generally, or might point at this as part of “cancel culture” (a concept I vehemently disagree with, since what is referred to as “cancellation” is often just “facing consequences”). Finally, I found that being on the “other side” of a code of conduct issue gave me additional insights into the process, and that it’s important that I should share those insights to help the community in the future.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The rest of this post is a fairly detailed account of what happened, for those that are interested.</p>
<h3 id="my-talk-at-jupytercon">My talk at JupyterCon</h3>
<p>I recently gave a talk at <a href="https://jupytercon.com/">JupyterCon</a>. My partner Rachel gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frc7FgheUj4">talk at JupyterCon</a> a couple of years ago, and had a wonderful experience, and I’m a huge fan of Jupyter, so I wanted to support the project. The conference used to be organized by O’Reilly, who have always done a wonderful job of conferences I’ve attended, but this year the conference was instead handled by <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>.</p>
<p>For my talk, I decided to focus on Jupyter as a literate and <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2019/12/02/nbdev/">exploratory programming environment</a>, using <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>. One challenge, however, is that two years earlier Joel Grus had given a brilliant presentation called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a> which had been so compelling that I have found it nearly impossible to talk about programming in Jupyter without being told “you should watch this talk which explains why programming in Jupyter is a terrible idea”.</p>
<p>Joel opened and closed his presentation with some light-hearted digs at me, since I’d asked him ahead of time <em>not</em> to do such a presentation. So I thought I’d kill two birds with one stone, and take the opportunity to respond directly to him. Not only was his presentation brilliant, but his slides were hilarious, so I decided to directly parody his talk by using (with full credit of course) some of his slides directly. That way people that hadn’t seen his talk could both get to enjoy the fantastic content, and also understand just what I was responding to. For instance, here’s how Joel illustrated the challenge of running cells in the right order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png">
</figure>
<p>I showed that slide, explaining that it’s Joel’s take on the issue, and then followed up with a slide showing how easy it actually is to run all cells in order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png">
</figure>
<p>Every slide included a snippet from Joel’s title slide, which, I explained, showed which slides were directly taken from his presentation. I was careful to ensure I did not modify any of his slides in any way. When first introducing his presentation, I described Joel as “a brilliant communicator, really funny, and wrong”. I didn’t make any other comments about Joel (although, for the record, I think he’s awesome, and highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/1492041130">his book</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-code-of-conduct-violation-notice">The Code of Conduct violation notice</h3>
<p>A week later, I received an email telling me that two CoC reports were filed regarding my JupyterCon keynote presentation. I was told that “The Code of Conduct Enforcement Team is meeting tomorrow to review the incident and will be contacting you to inform you of the nature of the report and to understand your perspective”.</p>
<p>The CoC wasn’t mentioned at all until after I’d been invited to speak, had accepted, and had completed the online registration. I had reviewed it at that time, and had been a bit confused. The email I received linked to a <a href="https://jupytercon.com/codeofconduct/">JupyterCon Code of Conduct</a>, but that in turn didn’t provide much detail about what is and isn’t OK, and that in turn linked to a different <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">NumFOCUS Code of Conduct</a>. A link was also provided to <a href="https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT">report violations</a>, which also linked to and named the NumFOCUS CoC.</p>
<p>I was concerned that I had done something which might be viewed as a violation, and looked forward to hearing about the nature of the report and having a chance to share my perspective. I was heartened that JupyterCon documented that they follow the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct/response-and-enforcement-events-meetups">NumFOCUS Enforcement Manual</a>. I was also heartened that the manual has a section “Communicate with the Reported Person about the Incident” which says they will “Let the reported person tell someone on the CoC response team their side of the story; the person who receives their side of the story should be prepared to …</p></div></div></div>

It doesn't matter how large your application gets, each page only downloads what it needs, which is actually pretty uncommon in the React ecosystem.</p><p>React apps are typically built two ways: bundle everything into one enormous file (yikes!) or code split into multiple bundles to load on demand. The apps that code split usually send down a very large build manifest, listing every asset you could possibly need. That means as you add files and pages to your site, the footprint of <em>every page</em> grows.</p><p>Remix never loads more code than the page the user is looking at. You can have 10 or 10,000 routes, the footprint for each remains constant. Just because you added some routes to the photo viewer doesn't mean the contact page gets bigger over the network.</p><h3 id="beyond-heavy-javascript-in-the-browser">Beyond heavy JavaScript in the browser</h3><p>Do you ever look at some of the pages on your website and think "why does this need to download any JavaScript at all?". We do too. Go ahead and open the dev tools on this page you're reading right now.</p><p>Yeah, you, open the dev tools.</p><p>That's right, no JavaScript! This is a marketing page with nothing interactive but links. There's no reason to load JavaScript here. You might think "but wouldn't you be able to speed up the transitions if you loaded in a client side router?" Great question. The answer is, not always.</p><p>Open the devtools again. You'll note in the network tab that we've already loaded in the "/buy" page with a link response header. When you click "buy" (please click buy), the browser already has the page and will navigate there immediately. It can't get faster than that.</p><p>With Remix, you have full control of how your app is delivered at every route. Load a bunch of JavaScript for a really interactive page, or skip it for a static page. Preload a page you think they'll navigate to, or only load that page when they navigate to it. It's all up to you.</p><h3 id="closing-the-gap-between-production-and-development-builds">Closing the gap between production and development builds</h3><p>Remember that one time you were implementing dark mode and put a <code>window.matchMedia</code> in state? Remember how everything was awesome until you deployed and then suddenly the production server was crashing? That's right, there is no window on the server and you weren't server rendering in dev!</p><p>Remember when you pushed some new CSS to production and your elements started bouncing around because your CSS lib was moving style tags around in production but not dev?</p><p>Remember when the requests for code split resources in development seemed fine but in production they were widly different and included way more in them than expected?</p><p>Production bugs live in the delta between development and production environments. Remix closes that gap.</p><p>Remix server renders the same in development as production, loads CSS the same (<code>&lt;link/&gt;</code>, ofc) and code splits the same. How can we do this? We only build the page you're looking at in development, so we can build it like production in a few milliseconds.</p><h3 id="a-refreshing-take-on-css">A refreshing take on CSS</h3><p>Remix lets you use the CSS skills you already have. While we love the innovation that has happened in the CSS-in-JS space, and you can use them in Remix, we provide a back-to-basics approach with a twist.</p><p>One of the trickiest parts of CSS and highly dynamic websites is knowing when to apply it and when to remove it. Because of nested routes, we know the layouts that are being rendered and which aren't. As the user navigates around Remix automatically loads and unloads the styles for the layouts on the page.</p><p>It might sound like no big deal at first, but once you try it you'll realize it's quite powerful.</p><p>Remix also adds a few improvements to CSS like auto prefixing and nesting, and support for tailwind out of the box, but other than that, we keep it simple.</p><h3 id="so-much-more">So much more</h3><p>Perhaps the most unique thing about Remix is that there's hardly any API at all. It gets out of your way wherever it can to allow you to use the web and React the way they were each designed. You have control over every entry point into your app, from the initial request handler to the deepest matching route's meta tags. No plugins, no complicated rendering abstractions, just React and HTTP as designed.</p><h3 id="who-is-remix">Who is Remix?</h3><p>We're Michael Jackson (no, not that one) and Ryan Florence. We've been running the company <a href="https://reacttraining.com/">React Training</a> since 2015.

        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

<p>2020-10-26</p>

<p>For some weeks now I've been fantasizing about creating this blog. I've thought about creating an HTTP server from scratch just to serve it on a Linode instance, writing a static blog engine to generate the HTML from Markdown, besides every other kinds of over-engineering just for fun.</p>

<p>I've also compiled a list with a dozen blogs I enjoy the most. Then I've tried to distill what are their qualities that makes me enjoy them, and how I may achieve those in my own blog.</p>

<p>Well, as you may see, this is my first post. Doing all of the above lead me to not start any blog at all.</p>

<p>This may be called "analysis paralysis", "over-engineering" or "perfect is the enemy of the good". Whatever it may be, I'm done with it now.</p>

<p>The most valuable thing is to produce something and put it out in the world. All the planning, engineering, thinking exists just to support that. With no realization, no "getting started", ultimately there's no value to be generated at all.</p>

<p>This is obvious in hindsight, but it's very easy to forget this lesson.</p>

<p>So, what have <em>you</em> been putting off through planning and fantasizing? What is keeping you from just <em>doing</em> what you want to do? Can't you get started right now or are you avoiding it by doing easier things? And by doing what you are doing, are you generating any value for yourself or for anyone?</p>

<p>To see it in action, we declare an enum of all possible actions.
Of course, these can be way more complicated in the real world use-case.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]</span>

<p>We build a chain from a sample of actions.</p>

chain<span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>actions<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then generate a few actions.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>for</span> action <span>in</span> chain<span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>take</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> action<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which gives us the following output.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span><span data-user="root" data-host="localhost"></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span>cargo run --example traffic

<p>Notice how after each <code>SignIn</code> there's a <code>ListTodos</code>, which means <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>L</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>I</mi><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P(ListTodos|SignIn)=1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
Built model can represent inherent rules of our application.
Some series of actions will not be generated, those having probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which is a lot better than uniformly generated random data.</p>
<p>Some combination of actions might not be possible, because they'd break business rules.
Those can be filtered out, or left in to test invalid requests.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>For founders, this question comes up a lot:</p><blockquote>“I have too many startup ideas. I don’t know which idea to focus on.”</blockquote><p>It certainly did for me. </p><p>I have been building SaaS products for the last few years, with bad to mediocre results. Each one taught me something new. Each one revealed one or two factors about the idea that I wish I knew BEFORE working on it.</p><p>For example, if there is a HUGE population with the problem I'm solving, then there's a better chance of me surviving despite incumbents and competitors. Larger pie, more slices to go round.</p><p>If I had known how to evaluate these ideas beforehand, I would have saved a lot of time. It won't be a guarantee of success, but it would have helped increase my odds.</p><p>I wanted to know what else I should know before starting work on an idea, so I researched articles, podcasts and videos with successful founders to find out how they evaluate ideas.</p><p>The result is a <strong>30-point checklist</strong>, curated from over 40 founders, that I want to share with you below. </p><p>Having a list makes it easy, and even fun, to evaluate your ideas in a structured and repeatable way. Think of it as <strong>due diligence</strong> you're doing before investing your time in your idea.</p><h2 id="but-ideas-don-t-matter-execution-does-">"But ideas don't matter. Execution does!"</h2><p>The intention of this advice is good, but, I feel this is misleading.</p><p>Given two ideas, executing on the one that has a better chance of succeeding will yield better results. Executing on a bad idea wastes time, money, and motivation.</p><p>Would you not want to know if an idea is a "good idea" before you spend lots of time and money trying to validate it?</p><p>If you think evaluating an idea before investing time and money in it isn't practical, then tell that to angel investors. They have to - they can't afford to give away money based on hunches. In their world, it's called due diligence.</p><blockquote>"Ideas mean everything and nothing at the same time. They mean everything, because you can 10x your odds of success by simply picking a better one. They mean nothing, because with bad execution you'll achieve nothing, no matter how good the idea." — Alex West, <a href="http://cyberleads.co/">cyberleads.co</a></blockquote><h2 id="the-saas-idea-evaluation-checklist">The SaaS idea evaluation checklist</h2><p>So here's the list I'm using. I have grouped them into 3 groups:</p><ul><li>Must-haves: Don't even start without having all of these.</li><li>Should-haves: The more you have of these, the better your chances.</li><li>Nice-to-haves: Not essential, but really helps if you do have them.</li></ul><h3 id="must-haves">Must-haves</h3><p>1. <strong>Solves a very specific problem</strong>. What's the specific problem you are aiming to solve?</p><p>2. <strong>Targets a very specific niche</strong>. Which specific group of people has that problem?</p><p>3. <strong>Has a large enough market</strong>. How big is this market? Is it enough to meet your business goal? A large market also means there's room for competitors.</p><p>4. <strong>Will generate profit</strong>. How much will it cost to run this business, and will you be able to turn a profit? Obvious, but a surprising number of founders don't work this out until much later!</p><p>5. <strong>Can operate profitably without the founder</strong>. Can this business grow profitably without you?</p><h3 id="should-haves">Should-haves</h3><p>6. <strong>Solves my own problem</strong>. Are you building this for yourself? Great start if you are!</p><p>7. <strong>"Hair on fire" problem</strong>. Will your customers need your solution urgently? Or is it not that important?</p><p>8. <strong>Frequently occurring problem</strong>. How often does someone have this problem? Hourly, daily, or at most weekly, would be best.</p><p>9. <strong>Growing market with this problem</strong>. More and more people are having this problem every day. More and more people will want your solution.</p><p>10. <strong>This is a mandatory problem</strong>. For example, this there's been a change in law and your customers need a solution. Like GDPR.</p><p>11. <strong>Customers are small businesses</strong>. These are the best customers to have because they have money, are motivated to spend, and has short lead times.</p><p>12. <strong>Founder has built an audience in target group</strong>. Do you already have followers or subscribers that have this problem.</p><p>13. <strong>Can be launched quickly</strong>. The faster you can launch, the quicker you can learn, and the quicker you get to revenue.</p><p>14. <strong>Clear customer acquisition channel</strong>. You can think of at least one obvious way to reach your target customers and offer your solution.</p><p>15. <strong>Founder - market fit</strong>. Do you know this market well?</p><p>16. <strong>Founder - product fit</strong>. Are you the right person to create this solution? Do you need to build a team?</p><p>17. <strong>Founder unfair advantage</strong>. Are you one of only a handful of people who can build on this idea? E.g. you own a patent.</p><p>18. <strong>You love serving this market</strong>. Will you enjoy talking to and serving this group of customers day in and day out? Do you genuinely want to help them?</p><p>19. <strong>Market is proven</strong>. Are people already paying money to solve this problem? Are your competitors making tonnes of money?</p><p>20. <strong>Arduous but not impossible</strong>. Is this a problem that not many people want to solve because it's so troublesome? Is it a solution that requires a lot of "<a href="http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html">schlep</a>"?</p><p>21. <strong>Unique value proposition</strong>. Are you providing novel solution to the problem? Perhaps focusing on a small part of the bigger problem and providing a focused, but effective, solution?</p><p>22. <strong>Can be a sellable asset</strong>. Can this business become an asset that you can sell later?</p><p>23. <strong>No monopolies</strong>. Are the incumbents monopolies that can wipe you out in 2 seconds?</p><h3 id="nice-to-haves">Nice-to-haves</h3><p>24. <strong>Market is highly motivated</strong>. The market is willing to spend money on anything that will improve their lives or work.</p><p>25. <strong>The market has the purchasing power</strong>. They have the money to spend on your solution.</p><p>26. <strong>Able to pre-sell the solution</strong>. Are you able to pre-sell the solution, as a way to validate demand?</p><p>27. <strong>The problem is not sexy</strong>. Sexy products get people excited, but also attracts more competitors. There's money being made on problems that don't get mentioned in TechCrunch or Wired.</p><p>28. <strong>The solution is simple</strong>. Is your solution simpler to understand and use than your competitor's?</p><p>29. <strong>Target customers exist as communities</strong>. Do your customers hang out online together? This helps with word of mouth traffic.</p><p>30. <strong>Quick time to first customer</strong>. Are you able to get your first paying customer within 4 weeks? Or quicker, relative to your other ideas?</p><h2 id="how-to-use-this-checklist">How to use this checklist</h2><p>To make it easy for you, I have created a checklist in a Google Sheet with all the criteria above. Just make a copy of it and then use it to quickly tick off attributes of your idea, and to find gaps in research that you may need to do. I've included one idea as an example - a simple Shopify analytics app for store owners.</p><p><strong>✅ </strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/101Hi6atV5cY3R4Fb39jWv7slS2Tth3Ti54fAMrVODno/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>Get the SaaS Idea Evaluation Sheet here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Here's how I use the scoring sheet:</p><ul><li>As a way to score and compare my ideas before I pick the next one to work on.

						<p>Now that 2020 is here, let’s look at what we can expect from the next decade in software. As Web developers, our solutions can help shape the organizations we work for. The tools we build and the architectural decisions we make have a compounding effect on society at large. What are the new trends, and will they help empower or enslave people?</p>
<h2>The Old Trends</h2>
<p>The trends in the last 10-20 years have led to more and more <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2017/08/20/centralization-and-open-source/">centralization of the Web</a>, consolidation of power in the hands of the largest services (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Reddit) and their extended ecosystems. Between these and the large publications, the “independent Web” has suffered a tremendous setback.  Most people and organizations trust large corporations with proprietary algorithms to manage their data, identity and brand. This has led to <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2019/03/08/how-qbix-platform-can-change-the-world/">massive new issues for individuals and society</a>, involving governments and corporations, and how we all relate to one another. Attempts to resolve these issues have spawned some projects to <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2017/08/30/the-future-of-decentralization/">decentralize the Web</a>.</p>
<p>When the Web was born, browsers rendered HTML documents, and there was very little support for client-side programming. Whatever Javascript support was introduced over the next decade was inconsistent because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a>, and led to <a href="http://www.jqueryvsmootools.com/">Javascript libraries</a> to bridge the gap, of which jQuery emerged as the winner. The last 10 years saw the rise of <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, new versions of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">Javascript</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">HTML5 Web APIs</a>, which finally made front-end Web programming a powerful proposition on the most widely deployed platform in the world.</p>
<h2>Client-First Web Apps</h2>
<p>As Javascript was maturing, a conventional wisdom has developed among most Web developers, that you should render the HTML on the client side, and then progressively enhance it with Javascript. This was considered best practice and recommended by pretty much every authority from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">2009</a> to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">2018</a>.</p>
<p>In this decade, Web developers will turn this conventional wisdom on its head, and start to consider progressive enhancement to go the other way:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, develop static HTML, CSS and Javascript</li>
<li>Make Javascript fetch data from servers, render it on the client</li>
<li>Progressively enhance the site for older environments (Server-rendered HTML)</li>
</ol>
<p>What follows are multiple reasons for why this is the better approach going forward. <span>This one shift in how we approach Web development will have profound technological and societal implications.</span></p>
<h2 id="distributing-software">Distributing Software</h2>
<p><strong>1. Separation of concerns.</strong> It pays to decouple the rendering of an interface from the delivery of code / markup. That way we are not tied to one type of app delivery — that of a server on the web sending our executable code. We are able to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading">sideload apps</a>, download them from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources">app stores</a>, and update specific files when they have changed. And we use one language for each task, too: JS is the code. HTML / Handlebars / etc. can be used for templates / markup. CSS is used for presentation. JSON or XML is used for data. After you have done this, if you want to pre-render HTML on a server for AJAX, you can, but will start to feel “dirty” as you’ll be coupling things unnecessarily again. Things are going this way as <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-10-15-free-headless-cms/">headless CMSes</a> are making an appearance, while <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>, <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> represent other ways of delivering code through app stores.</p>
<p><strong>2. Trust. </strong> You can’t trust what code is running remotely (although Signal <a href="https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/">has been experimenting</a> with using <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/innovative-technology-for-cpu-based-attestation-and-sealing">Software Guard Extensions</a> by CPU makers, originally designed for DRM, to go the other way and ensure what code runs on a server). But even if you can, you have no guarantee some other process won’t steal or corrupt your data. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">Trusted Computing Base</a> should not include arbitrary amounts of remote sites shipping code at any time. Decoupling how the code is loaded (see point #1) onto your client allows you or your user agent to verify checksums and certify that it is indeed the code you think it is. And it is that code that should be managing your data and using the personal keys on your device. Package managers and app stores will be able to distribute code that has been audited by third-party security firms, and people will be able to trust them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Decentralization of Code.</strong> As the next decade unfolds, we will find that&nbsp;code bases don’t necessarily have to live shrink-wrapped on a specific server. Rather, clients can use multiple interoperable software modules and versions and can have multiple app stores and distributors in the future helping maintain repos and package managers for end-users and organizations. We will probably see automated package management become more user friendly in the 2020s, as we already have a docker container culture, we have browser based package managers etc.</p>
<h2 id="data-ownership">Data Ownership</h2>
<p><strong>4. Decentralization of Data.</strong> This is the big one in terms of effect on society. By having web servers render your webpage, you are implicitly locking yourself and your organization into the type of model where the servers store and access the data in a private database. They have enough data to render everything, apply access control rules to manage what you can read and write, and so on. Instead, we as a society need to empower people and their client side apps, and push the logic of fetching data, caching it and assembling it to the <a href="https://continuations.com/post/108271329110/tedxnewyork-big-and-bot-policy-proposals">user agents</a>. We can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capabilities</a> / <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/">access tokens</a> for data instead of a centralized site rendering HTML. <span>In this way, always inverting the progressive enhancement is an <em><span>activist</span></em> position to change society against the abuses of power </span><a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2019/03/08/how-qbix-platform-can-change-the-world/">like the ones listed here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Reliability</strong> After the 2015 ISIS attacks in Paris, countries around the world expressed solidarity with the French people. French colors were flown, but similar-sized attacks at the same time by ISIS in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/world/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-attacks-paris.html?smid=tw-nytimesworld&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">Beirut</a> were totally forgotten. Facebook rolled out a feature to customize one’s profile with the French flag superimposed, but only the French flag. So we used the Qbix Platform to quickly build a small app called <a href="https://customizemypic.com/">customizemypic.com</a> to allow anyone to change their profile picture to a flag of their choice. The goal was to make a statement and express solidarity with people in Beirut, Baghdad and other areas hard hit by terrorism. Today, that same app is no longer able to do its core function because Facebook <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/">removed any way for users to give permissions to apps</a> to upload a photo on their behalf. This is what happens when you rely on third parties to announce what you can and cannot do with your own profile picture. The most extreme reliability is achieved by an <a href="http://offlinefirst.org/">offline-first</a> approach, which is a close cousin of the client-first trend that will grow in the 2020s.</p>
<p><strong>6. End to End Encryption.</strong> Server-side rendering perpetuates a culture where the server has all the data unencrypted. Even if the data is encrypted at rest, the served holds all the decryption keys and is one central target for hackers, government agencies, and advertisers. Rendering things client-side goes hand-in-hand with a culture of people storing their own keys on devices of their choice, and letting key management and password management be the domain of operating systems and trusted computing bases, not random websites.</p>
<h2 id="Data Delivery">Data Delivery</h2>
<p><strong>7. Bandwidth.</strong> Ever since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm8FAHGJB3M">Steve Jobs presented WebObjects</a>, we have wanted sites to render dynamically. Well, that often involves looping through various items and rendering each one. It is extremely wasteful to send the HTML results of rendering hundreds of items to a client, when you could have just sent the data, which would then be “hydrated” into 5. templates by the client. However, I can understand pre-rendering just the items above the fold (if one could estimate this number, not knowing the size of the window on the first request).</p>
<p><strong>8. Caching Issues.</strong> Often, you have subtle and pervasive changes on every page when a person is logged in vs out. (I should remark that “logging in” into a site itself is an artifact of “centralized” thinking, but I digress.) Their avatar might be rendered in various places. New links are shown that might not be available otherwise. And new information may be shown that access control and discovery suggestions determines they can see. If you render everything on the served, there is no way to cache most of the fragments of the page, because they are changing. If you render client-side, all this comes for free.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps for Web Developers</h2>
<p>So by now you may be convinced that “client-first” is a good design pattern and progressive enhancement can be implemented later, by “speeding up” the first render, and by making it available to “dumb” crawlers and user agents who don’t execute Javascript in 2020. Here is how that would actually look, in actionable terms:</p>
<p><strong>9. Preloading. </strong>Okay, now that you are rendering everything client-side, you can implement a mechanism to preload data from the server. Perhaps put all the JSON in one file and send it over on the first render. Which — remember — happens only when you use a Web Browser to visit a page directly, a very specific scenario. Every other request besides that, including subsequent requests from a web browser, don’t need this preload. It’s an extra flair you can add for that specific use case. So the preloaded data comes and your Javascript will already have it and will render the HTML synchronously and quickly.</p>
<p><strong>10. Static Site Generation. </strong>The most popular static site generators today are still pretty narrow in their use-case. They help with blogs and publishing, eg <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, etc. But if you already have a dynamic site, you can sort of transform it into a static site by having a server-side script request some (dynamically specified) set of pages and render them to some related static html documents, and then begin sending 301 redirects on the dynamic pages to permanently tell browsers to go to the static pages in the future. (Because rewriting all links in your site may be infeasible). This approach runs into problems I described in point 5 — so a naive approach would only work for publicly accessible pages …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Small things matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Know where things are. Naming is crucial.</li>
<li>A piece of code should be where you expect to find it. If not, refactor to get it there.</li>
<li>Don't litter your code with comments and commented-out code that "capture history or wished for the future".</li>
<li>Standardization is important.</li>
<li>Have the discipline to follow the practices. To frequently reflect upon your work — and be willing to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>"In code, refactor mercilessly". Reminds me of a simple writing tip: Imagine that you are paid for each word that you remove, while still keeping the meaning. That's how you write well.</p>
<p>Craftsmanship is the way to write good code. How do we learn it? Knowledge and work. Gain the knowledge (principles, patterns, practices, heuristics) and grind that knowledge into yourself by working hard and practicing.</p>
<p>You could know it all, but without the hard work, you wouldn't be able to put it to practice. Practice and fail. And then try again.</p>
<p>You could skip the case studies in this book, in which case you've read another 'feel good' book about writing good code. Then you've learned nothing. But you can pay close attention to even the smallest details and follow along closely, then you'll learn quite a lot.</p>

<p>If you keep making a mess, it'll slow you down in the long run.</p>
<p>We read more code than we write, so we should make it easier to read — even if that makes it harder to write. But since we can't write it without reading it, we're actually making it easier to write as well. But this is over the long term.</p>
<p>We don't just write clean code. We have to maintain it as well. So keep it clean.</p>

<ul>
<li>Names should reveal intentions. If it requires a comment to explain, it's not a good name</li>
<li>"Avoid Disinformation"</li>
<li>Be very careful with similar names — it can be very misleading (breaking the above rule!)</li>
<li>"Make Meaningful Distinctions" — different names for different things. <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> could be <code>source</code> and <code>destination</code> — much better names.</li>
<li>"Noise words are redundant". <code>variable</code> should never appear in a variable name, don't put <code>string</code> in the name of a string, don't make two variables like <code>thing</code> and <code>theThing</code>. Distinguishing names is important.</li>
<li>"Use Pronounceable Names"</li>
<li>"Use Searchable Names"</li>
<li>"Avoid Encodings" — never actually seen this before.</li>
<li>
<p>"Avoid Mental Mapping" — Just because you know what it means, doesn't mean that someone else will.</p>
<ul>
<li>Class names should be nouns or noun phrases, not verbs.</li>
<li>Method names should be verbs or verb phrases. Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be prefixed with <code>get</code>, <code>set</code>, or <code>is</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Don't Be Cute" — Say what you mean. Jokes are only fun for you and those in on them.</li>
<li>"Pick One Word per Concept" — If you write <code>fetch</code> and not <code>retrieve</code>, stick with it.</li>
<li>"Don't Pun"</li>
<li>"Use Solution Domain Names" — You can use technical terms</li>
<li>"Use Problem Domain Names" — When there are no technical terms, use the name from the problem domain.</li>
<li>"Add Meaningful Context" — If you see an address form, you might see 'state' as a variable. But if you see 'state' alone somewhere, would you assume that it's related to an address? Here, meaningful context could be naming it <code>addrState</code>.</li>
<li>"Don't Add Gratuitous Context"</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Functions should be small.</li>
<li>They should do only one thing.</li>
<li>One Level of Abstraction per Function.</li>
<li>Code should be able to read from the top to bottom. This is <em>The Stepdown Rule</em>.</li>
<li>General rule for switch statements: "they can be tolerated if they appear only once, are used to create polymorphic objects, and are hidden behind an inheritance".</li>
<li>Use descriptive names.</li>
<li>The fewer arguments the better.</li>
<li>They should have no side effects.</li>
<li>They should either do something or answer something. Not both.</li>
<li>Exceptions &gt; Returning Error Codes</li>
<li>Extract Try/Catch blocks into functions of their own.</li>
<li>Error handling is one thing.</li>
<li>Don't Repeat Yourself. The more duplicates, the more has to be changed when necessary. And more room for errors.</li>
<li>You don't have to get all of this perfect in your first try. It is as writing. You can edit and refine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chess, for practical purposes, is solved. Using online platforms players can compare their moves against optimal moves generated by chess engines/AI’s. Centipawn Loss (CPL) is a measure of how suboptimal one’s move is. A centipawn is equal to <code>1/100th</code> of a pawn, meaning a CPL of <code>100</code> indicates the player made a move that lost the equivalent to <code>1</code> pawn. A CPL of <code>100</code> does not necessarily mean you lost a pawn unnecessarily; CPL also takes into account positions and potential mates. <a href="https://lichess.org/faq#acpl">Average Centipawn Loss</a> (ACPL) is the average CPL across a given game. ACPL is a positive number between 0 and infinity. An ACPL near 20 is excellent indicting near perfect play, whereas an ACPL above 300 either means you’re a 3 year old toddler or purposefully losing the game. Being able to calculate ACPL raises the question, is ACPL correlated to one’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">rating</a>?</p>

<details><summary>In-depth CPL explanation</summary>

<div>

    <p>Let’s examine the following board</p>

    <p><img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/even_game.PNG" alt="Even chess game"></p>

    <p>Both sides have similar pieces and similar positions. <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a> gives this board a score of <code>-0.69</code> (i.e. black is up <code>69/100th</code> of a pawn or <code>69</code> Centipawn’s).</p>

    <p>The optimal move is to move your bishop to <code>b4</code>.</p>

    <p><img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/optimal_move.PNG" alt="Average Centipawn Loss vs Rating"></p>

    <p>That board is evaluated at <code>-0.71</code>.</p>

    <p>If instead we played the bishop to <code>c3</code>, Stockfish will reevaluate the board to <code>-0.89</code>.</p>

    <p><img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/bad_move.PNG" alt="Average Centipawn Loss vs Rating"></p>

    <p>Since the optimal move resulted in a board evaluation of <code>-0.71</code> and our move achieved an evaluation of <code>-0.89</code>, our move receives a CPL of <code>-71 - -89 = 18</code>.</p>

  </div>
</details>

<figure>
  <img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/acpl_vs_rating.PNG" alt="Average Centipawn Loss vs Rating">
  <figcaption><b>Fig 1</b>: Rating vs ACPL per game <sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="a15"><a href="#f15">[1.5]</a></sup></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The graph shows a negative correlation between rating and ACPL (ACPL decreases as rating increases) which follows common sense; as a player gets better they tend to perform moves that are closer to the optimal.</p>

<p>ACPL, as most performance indicators, require context. A player can achieve an ACPL of 20 in a variety of ways. They can immediately blunder their queen and attempt to stretch out the inevitable<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> or they can play an excellent game.</p>

<p>Instead of looking at rating vs ACPL, we’ll look at rating vs move types. Online chess platforms tend to classify moves into several broad categories: best move, good move, inaccuracy (CPL between <code>50-100</code>), mistake (CPL between <code>100-300</code>) and blunder (CPL <code>&gt;200</code>).</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/errors_vs_rating.PNG" alt="Errors vs Rating">
  <figcaption><b>Fig 2</b>: Rating vs Errors per game <sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">[1]</a></sup></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As one would expect, the number of blunders (game losing moves) drastically decreases with rating. It is unclear if the actual CPL per blunder decreases or increases with rating.</p>

<p>What is interesting is how mistakes stay relativity even, this may be due to the examined games being from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#:~:text=and%20regular%20ratings.-,Blitz,minutes%20or%20less%20per%20player.&amp;text=The%20USCF%20defines%20blitz%20chess,and%2010%20minutes%20per%20player.">blitz variant</a> of chess. Since the players have a limited time to think they are likely making moves that are good in the short term (<code>3-5</code> moves ahead), but may be suboptimal in <code>10+</code> moves. Realistically, it will be difficult for humans to ever eliminate all mistakes and inaccuracies from their play, but concentrating on reducing one’s blunders even by <code>25%</code> yields incredible gains in ones rating.</p>



<p>In both graphs, it is evident that the correlation factor between errors/ACPL and rating is low. Both are metrics that can be used to estimate the players’ rating in a range, but are unideal to accurately judge a player’s performance. Nonetheless, it is difficult to dispute the notion that better players have better ACPL.</p>



<p><b id="f1">[1]</b> A sample of <code>~2500</code> games was taken using <a href="https://lichess.org/api">Lichess’s API</a>, resulting in <code>~5000</code> ACPL samples being used. Players were pooled in buckets based on their ELO (i.e. the ACPL was averaged for players across <code>700-719</code>, <code>720-739</code> etc). <a href="#a1">↩</a></p>

<p><b id="f15">[1.5]</b> There is a peculiar uptick in ACPL at the very upper ranks likely due to low sampling of <code>2900+</code> rated games. <a href="#a15">↩</a></p>

<p><b id="f2">[2]</b> One can imagine a scenario where the player immediately blunders their queen, causing their initial ACPL to be very high. As the game progresses, since the game is in such a dire position, all the player’s available moves will be roughly of the same quality, meaning any move the player makes will have a CPL close to 0. Eventually, as the number of moves grows larger the initial spike in CPL will be averaged off. <a href="#a2">↩</a></p>

                    <p>Posting on Hacker News is like a box of chocolates – you never know what you’re gonna get. I’ve been submitting since 2017 and never had more than one point. So I stopped trying.</p><p>A month ago, I got access to OpenAI API. After ten minutes of tinkering, I’ve got an idea: what if I could make it write good Hacker News titles for my blog posts? I quickly looked up the most favorited posts, designed the prompt in plain English, and generated my first title. It looked weird. I even doubted for a few minutes if it’s worth sharing. But I was curious – so I closed my eyes and hit submit.</p><p>The post went to the moon with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24547098">229 points and 126 comments</a> in one day. Fascinated, I continued generating titles (and what would you do?). In three weeks, I got to the front page five times, received 1054 upvotes, and had 37k people come to my site.</p><p>Below is everything I’ve learned building a Hacker News post titles generator with OpenAI API, designing GPT-3 prompts, and figuring out how to apply GPT-3 to problems ranging from sales emails to SEO-optimized blog posts. At the end of the post, I cover the broader implications of GPT-3 that became obvious only after a month of working with the tool. If you’re an entrepreneur or an investor who wants to understand the change this tech will drive, you can read my speculations there.</p><p>If you have no idea what I’m talking about, read more about GPT-3 in <a href="https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2020/05">Gwern’s post</a> first, or check <a href="https://beta.openai.com/">OpenAI’s website</a> with demo videos. In my work, I assume you’re already familiar with the API on some basic level.</p><p><em>Oct 28 update: After I published the draft, 23 people asked how to apply GPT-3 to their problems. To help them get started with the OpenAI API, I started building the first GPT-3 course that covers everything I learned – from use cases to prompt design.

As there were no tutorials on approaching the problem, I went to the playground and began experimenting.</p><h2 id="generating-new-titles">Generating new titles</h2><h3 id="1-finding-the-data">1. Finding the data</h3><p>First, I wanted to see if I could make GPT-3 generate engaging post titles at all. To do that, I needed two things:</p><ol><li>Write a prompt that concisely describes the problem that I want to solve.</li><li>Feed the API some sample data to stimulate the completion.</li></ol><p>I went ahead and searched for the most upvoted HN posts of all time. In a few minutes, I’ve got <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?query=&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;prefix&amp;page=0&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=story">an Algolia page</a> with a list of links. But after skimming through them, I figured out that upvotes wouldn’t work. They are mostly news and poorly reflect what kind of content the community values.</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.18.27-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.18.27-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.18.27-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.18.27-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.18.27-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?query=&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;prefix&amp;page=0&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=story">Most upvoted HN posts of all time.</a></figcaption></figure><p>Disappointed, I discarded upvotes as a metric. I needed something that would describe the value people get from the post. Something like... bookmarks?</p><p>I quickly looked up <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351073">the most favorited HN posts</a>. The idea was simple: people don’t bookmark news. They favorite things they want to explore later.</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.21.11-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.21.11-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.21.11-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.21.11-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.21.11-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/hacker-favourites-analysis">Most favorited HN posts of all time.</a></figcaption></figure><p>The next step was to grab the data from the list, insert it into the playground, and write a clear and concise prompt.</p><p><em>I actually grab data from the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351073">dang’s comment</a> rather than the original post; his list was a global one.</em></p><h3 id="2-designing-a-prompt">2. Designing a prompt</h3><p>The best way to program the API is to write a direct and straightforward task description, as you would do if you were delegating this problem to a human assistant. </p><p>Here’s how my first prompt looked like:</p><blockquote>Generate viral titles for Hacker News (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a>) posts. The titles have to be provocative and incentivize users to click on them.</blockquote><p>Data-wise, I needed to clean up the list slightly, get rid of irrelevant stuff like IDs, and choose up to five titles to use as a sample – OpenAI team suggests that selecting three to five titles works best for text generation. If you feed the API more examples, it picks up wrong intents and generates irrelevant completions.</p><p>In a few minutes of Google Sheets work, the cleanup was done, and I had a data set of the most favorited HN post titles of all time. I put together my first prompt and clicked “Generate.”</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.29.16-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.29.16-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.29.16-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.29.16-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.29.16-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Cleaned up titles of most favorited HN posts of all time.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="3-tinkering-with-completions">3.

The best stuff comes after dozens of experiments, sometimes after generating completions with the same parameters many times with the Best Of parameter and writing another GPT-3 classifier to discover a good one. Moreover, you need to test the prompt’s quality, data samples, and temperature (“creativity” of responses) individually to understand what you need to improve. </p><p><em>If you’re looking for prompt design tips, head on to chapter 2 of the post.</em></p><p>Here’s a list of experiments I’ve done:</p><ul><li>Edited the prompt many times, including and excluding adjectives from the task description. I tried “catchy,” “provocative,” “thought-provoking,” and many others. The best configuration I’ve got was “Write a short, thought-provoking, and eye-catching post title for a Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/) submission.”</li><li>Split the prompt into two sentences, separating the task and its description. Discovered that one-sentence long prompts work best for simple tasks.</li><li>Played with data samples.

The best results came at .9, while anything less than .7 was repetitive and very similar to the samples. Titles generated with temperature 1 were too random and didn’t look like good HN titles at all.</li></ul><p>To judge the quality of completions, I’ve come up with a question: “If I saw this on HN, would I click on it?” This helped me move quickly through experiments because I knew what bad results looked like.</p><p>After half an hour of tinkering, I’ve got the following completion: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My first good GPT-3 completions for HN titles.</figcaption></figure><p>That’s when I realized that I’m onto something. From the list of generated titles above, I’d click on at least three links just out of curiosity. Especially on “A developer’s guide to getting in shape.”</p><p>What’s even more interesting, the completion above was a result of fine-tuning the API. Title8, What You Love Is Not Your Life’s Work, was originally a part of another completion that was lame. So I cut out the bad stuff, added Title8 to my data sample, and continued generating from there.</p><p>The next step was to see if I could make GPT-3 create a custom title for my blog post.</p><h2 id="generating-custom-titles">Generating custom titles</h2><h3 id="1-changing-the-method">1. Changing the method</h3><p>To make GPT-3 generate custom titles, I needed to change my approach. I was no longer exploring new, potentially interesting headlines but figuring out how to make a good one for a post that was already written. To do that, I couldn’t just tell the API, “hey, generate me a good one.” I needed to show what a good one actually is and give GPT-3 some idea of what the post is about.</p><p>The first thing I changed is the prompt. This was relatively easy because I applied the same model of thinking again – “What would I tell a human assistant if I had to delegate this problem?”</p><p>Here’s a prompt that I used:</p><blockquote>Write a short, thought-provoking, and eye-catching post title for Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/) submission based on a blog post’s provided description.</blockquote><p>One unexpected benefit from tinkering with the prompt is the clarity of thought. When you’re dealing with GPT-3, there’s no way to make it work if you don’t know what you’re doing. You need to express your thought in clear terms. It’s a brilliant natural constraint and one of the most underrated benefits of GPT-3: when you must state clearly what you want to do, you begin to better understand the problem.</p><h3 id="2-updating-the-data">2. Updating the data</h3><p>After I designed a new prompt, I had to update my data set. I went back to my previous experiment, selected five titles from the list of most favorited posts of all time, and wrote a clear and concise description for each of them. Lastly, I wrote a description of my own work that I wanted to generate the title for. I left the title field blank and hit “Generate.”</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Updated data set for generating custom HN titles.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="3-experimenting-with-titles">3. Experimenting with titles</h3><p>This time, the completions were shockingly good.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>
On Monday I launched my newsletter on Substack, <a href="https://mvpsprint.substack.com/">The MVP Sprint</a>. I'm chronicling my journey to validate an idea and build an MVP - adapting the popular <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">Design Sprint</a> methodology to the startup launch process.
</p>

<p>
Going into it, I didn't know what to expect. I've never built in public like this before. I've shared articles in the past that were met with nothing but crickets. But this one was different.
</p>

<p>
<b>I've gained 108 subscribers in the first 48 hours since launch</b>.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to share the blueprint I followed and the metrics it produced to help out future newsletter newbs like myself.
</p>

<h3>Where did I share it?</h3>
<p>Everywhere I could think of! Here's some details on individual channels:</p>

<h4>Indie Hackers</h4>
<p>
I shared <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/after-4-brain-surgeries-i-left-my-6-figure-tech-job-now-i-m-launching-a-startup-in-public-87e569e566">this post</a> in the "Building in Public" group. This seemed like the most relevant place to share it, but with 359 members, I wasn't sure if it would get many eyeballs.
</p>

<p>
As of right now, it has 34 upvotes, 26 comments, and 811 views. Not bad! It started off quite slow, seemed to pick up steam after the IH email newsletter went out, and then picked up a lot more after  <a href="https://twitter.com/IndieHackers/status/1320899528862633985">this shoutout from the @IndieHackers Twitter account</a>.
</p>

<h4>Twitter</h4>
<p>
I shared <a href="https://twitter.com/AnotherTimJones/status/1320801476491595780?s=20">a tweet storm from my personal twitter account</a> to my modest group of &lt;300 followers (at the time). A few of my friends gave me Twitter shoutouts and retweeted me.
</p>

<h4>Linkedin</h4>
<p>
I shared a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjones4413/">my personal Linkedin</a>. It currently has 72 reactions, 20 comments, and 3,318 views within the news feed.
</p>

<p>
I also tried out the new Linkedin stories, but had &lt;15 views in the first 24 hours. I probably won't do this again. 
</p>

<h4>Reddit</h4>
<p>
I posted in the following subreddits:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jie5an/how_do_you_come_up_with_ideas_for_tech_startups/">r/startups</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/jie8l1/a_startup_idea_is_just_a_recipe/">r/startup_ideas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/jielur/after_4_brain_surgeries_i_left_my_6figure_tech/">r/EntrepreneurRideAlong</a> - This one did particularly well with &gt;180 upvotes and 54 comments.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I did my best to give as much value as possible within the posts themselves - only with a modest link at the end to the newsletter. And I tweaked the content for each subreddit to make it more relevant.
</p>

<p>
Outside of a few haters, folks on Reddit were super supportive. I received lots of friendly DM's and emails from people saying they loved the story and even wanted to help out.
</p>

<h4>Instagram</h4>
<p>
I threw together some images on Figma and shared a 2-part story on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anothertimjones/">my personal Instagram</a> where I have 585 followers. Outside of a few supportive messages from friends, I can't really pull out the IG contribution to subscriber count.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p><i>These are the same assets I used for my Linkedin story.</i></p>

<h4>Medium</h4>
<p>
I tried <a href="https://themvpsprint.medium.com/cooking-up-a-recipe-in-the-startup-kitchen-3597cdcd5f4b">syndicating my first article to Medium</a>. So far it has 12 views and 3 "reads". Not sure if I'll continue this or not. Long-term I'll want to harness the SEO benefits on my own domain and syndicated content without a canonical tag won't do me any favors there.
</p>

<h4>Substack Stats</h4>
<h5>Engagement on <a href="https://mvpsprint.substack.com/p/choose-a-problem">the first article </a>:</h5>
<p><img alt="Article 1 stats" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/do0vbqz18/image/upload/v1603899472/MVP%20Sprint/article%201%20stats.png">
</p>

<p>
The view count feels accurate, but I'm not reading much into the "40 free signups after reading this". Maybe this means lots of people subscribed without reading?
</p>

<h5>Here's the breakdown of visits and and signups by channel:</h5>
<p><img alt="Article 1 stats" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/do0vbqz18/image/upload/v1603899619/MVP%20Sprint/substack%20stats.png">
</p>

<p>
<b>A few thoughts:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm guessing that "direct" visitors was actually less than 343. I suspect that some of these are from Instagram (where I didn't include a direct link) and some from users where the referral header wasn't set.</li>
<li>The signup column doesn't add up to even half of my total subscribers, so I'm not reading much into that.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Future Channels</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Twitter</b> - I'm new to using Twitter in a professional sense, but it's no secret that this <i>could</i> and <i>should</i> be a great channel for me moving forward. I just have to invest in it and find my voice.
</li><li><b>Reddit</b> - Reddit feels like it could be a great tool, but I'll have to experiment with how to consistently engage in a way that drives value and doesn't feel spammy. 
</li><li><b>Linkedin</b> - I have a pretty deep Linkedin network so I'll keep tapping into that.
</li><li><b>Product Hunt</b> - After I have maybe 5-10 articles, I'm planning on spinning up my own landing page and newsletter "stack". At that point, I'll probably throw it up on Product Hunt.
</li></ol>

<h3>Some closing thoughts</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>People want to support you</b> (if you give them the chance) - I sometimes feel awkward asking for help. Maybe some of you are the same. But I realized from this experience that not only can be people be extremely helpful, but they <b>thoroughly enjoy helping</b>, maybe even a bit of  living vicariously through the startup journey.
</li><li><b>Reply to everyone</b> -  I did my best to reply to almost everyone that commented on a post. Not only does this cultivate a deeper connection with readers, but I think it helps to boost the engagement flywheel.
</li></ul>

<p>
That's it! Any advice for me moving forward? <a href="https://twitter.com/anothertimjones">Shoot me a DM on Twitter!</a>

To continue the analogy of business partnership being like marriage, I'd married someone that I'd only been on a few dates with and barely knew. I partnered out of insecurity with someone who talked a good game and seemed strong in the areas I felt weak.This insecurity cost me $$$</p><figure id="w-node-76af6d16a676-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f8750eb6f143d07b654067a_partnership-2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We met through an entrepreneurship course online and became accountability partners soon after. With him being in New Jersey and me in NYC, we were close enough to be able to meet in person once every few months.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Through being accountability partners we became aware of each other's strengths and complementary skill sets, him with marketing and me with product design and branding.<br></p><p>As background, before <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a> was born I had another Shopify store selling graphic design products that was paying all my bills and generating a good living. I considered that business my ‘Freedom vehicle’ as it allowed me to quit my Architecture job but I wasn’t passionate about doing it long-term.<br></p><p>I <em>was</em> deeply passionate about personal development during this time and was always reading and finding ways to upgrade my skills and productivity. I felt like I’d found the cheat code to life and wished I’d been introduced to it sooner. Before I quit my architecture job, I set myself a task to <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/the-22-books-that-helped-me-quit-my-job" target="_blank">read 22 books around specific topics so I would be ready for the world of entrepreneurship.</a><br></p><p>The <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/journal" target="_blank">Self Journal</a> was later born from my personal struggle for years of finding a planner that would both keep me organized and also help me reach my most important goals.<br></p><p>I decided I wanted to turn the journal I built for myself into a product to sell, because it seemed whenever I showed it to someone they wanted to buy it.&nbsp; I didn’t think this product would be the start of something bigger, I just wanted to bring this product to life.</p><p>It was then I thought having someone who knew sales and marketing would be beneficial so I asked ‘A’ to partner with me on it. He also had his own journaling structure&nbsp; so I felt it was a common interest.<br></p><p><strong>In retrospect, I partnered out of my insecurities around marketing and selling myself. </strong></p><h6>Most entrepreneurs don't have business problems, they have emotional problems disguised as business problems —<strong> and so I disguised my fear of putting myself out there with a business partner.&nbsp;</strong><br></h6><p>And so it began.<br></p><p>The original name we came up with for the company was “Self Improvement Labs”... but I <em>hated</em> it. One weekend when ‘A’ was gone I knew I had to come up with something better to replace it with<em>.</em></p><p><em>(because I don’t like when people criticize something without giving a reasonable alternative).</em><br></p><p>In those 2 days I came up with the idea for <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a>, bought the domain BestSelf.co and created a whole branding package. Thankfully there was no pushback, ‘A’ agreed it was a better name and we moved forward.<br></p><p>We launched the Kickstarter campaign in August 2015. I had experience with launching Kickstarter campaigns in the past and so I had a formula for how to do it which helped us a lot. You can read how we did it <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/kickstarter-step-by-step" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></p><p><strong>We funded in 28 hours and over the course of 34 days we raised over $322,000 which was enough to both create the product for backers and launch the entire business.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5ea0cb1d0f854b10467cf739_5e2a2251be4a7438101d60a6_image.png" alt="funding progress graph"></p></figure><p>We launched our online store in January 2016 and the business continued to grow.

Then the pandemic starts and you find out what your relationship is really made of.<br></p><p>By late 2016, while professionally things were still good with the business, cracks began appearing in our personal relationship… the 2016 election was a definite factor here. That was the first time it became clear how differently we saw the world and how opposite our backgrounds were.<br></p><p>In 2017, we’d hired out the majority of his role in marketing and by April 2018 he had stepped away from all business operations - informally anyway.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By informally I mean there was never a discussion of him passing the baton and stepping out, he just suddenly was no longer there. But he was still taking as much money out of the company as I was -- or more.<br></p><p><strong>As you can imagine being a 50/50 partner where one partner is working full-time and the other is completely disconnected is tough — really tough. I was essentially hamstrung on big decisions and company direction. </strong></p><p>And anything I could decide could be overwritten or debated even after I thought it was settled. The same went for team members, as every now and again he'd jump on calls, start giving advice or instruction (without knowing what was even happening) and cause frustration and confusion with team members. </p><p>By early 2019, I was becoming resentful as our distributions were still 50/50 <strong>but I wasn’t getting any salary for the 60+ hour weeks of time I was putting in. </strong>When I brought it up to him, as if he were my boss, he would say <em>“I don’t equate time with value,”</em> yet he wasn’t giving either to the company.<br></p><p>At the same time as he would reject my salary request, he’d post stuff like this on his Instagram:</p><figure id="w-node-be8cd5eaae18-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f873b98bd121731d6cf0d21_3-hour-week.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h6>Here's a tip, if someone’s telling you running a business is easy — they’re either lying, or trying to <strong>sell</strong> you something.<br></h6><p>In the case of ‘A’, it was both.<br></p><p>Each video “guru” post he’d share taking credit for work that wasn’t his &nbsp;felt like a slap in the face — not just to me but,&nbsp; more importantly, to the team. <strong>Being under-paid (or not paid at all) is one thing, but having my value be dismissed on top of that was actually the bigger issue -- and was the beginning of the end.</strong><br></p><p>I ended up removing him on all social media platforms in mid 2019 because posts like the one above were triggering me.<br></p><p>By July 2019, we finally agreed on a modest salary for me in lieu of taking distributions which I would be made up for later.

We will compare the two at the end and see how performant each and when we can use one and not the other in terms of speed especially if we’re processing a large CSV file. In the last blog post, we talked about <a href="https://www.ezzeddinabdullah.com/posts/how-to-clean-text-data-at-the-command-line" target="_blank">how to clean text data at the command line</a> that I recommend to have a look at.</p><h2>Downloading COVID&nbsp;data from covidtracking</h2><p>Let's first download recent coronavirus data across the United States from <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/download">COVID Tracking Project</a> which is a volunteer organization dedicated to collecting and publishing the data required to understand the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. Btw, The data is published under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons CC BY 4.0</a> license.</p><p>Let's do this by downloading the <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv">CSV&nbsp;file manually</a> or using <em>curl</em>:</p><div><pre>$ curl -LO https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv
</pre></div><p><strong>-LO </strong>is a combination of <strong>-L&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>-O</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>-L </strong>is used to make sure if the URL&nbsp;has changed to another location, <em>curl</em> will redo the request on the new redirection link</li><li><strong>-O </strong>this option is used to create an output file of the same name of the requested file name which is <strong>all-states-history.csv </strong>here</li></ul><h2>Printing the CSV&nbsp;file headers</h2><p>Let's first print what column names we have for this <em>all-states.history.csv </em>file:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -n all-states-history.csv

</pre></div><p>As you can see, using <strong>csvcut </strong>with the option <strong>-n </strong>can list all the headers we have with their associated order which can help us select some specific columns that we're interested in.</p><h2>Selecting specific columns</h2><p>In this tutorial, we're interested in four columns and these are their descriptions as reported by the COVID&nbsp;Tracking&nbsp;Project:</p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>data:&nbsp;Date on which data was collected by The COVID Tracking Project.</li><li>state: Two-letter abbreviation for the state or territory.</li><li>positive: Total number of <strong>confirmed plus probable cases</strong> of COVID-19 reported by the state or territory</li><li>death:&nbsp;Total <strong>fatalities with confirmed OR probable COVID-19 case diagnosis</strong><br></li></ol><p>Let's see how we can get the first 10 lines of these 4 columns in our CSV&nbsp;file at the command line:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c date,state,positive,death all-states-history.csv | head | csvlook 
|       date | state | positive |  death |
| ---------- | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| 2020-10-26 | AK    |   14,413 |     68 |
| 2020-10-26 | AL    |  185,322 |  2,866 |
| 2020-10-26 | AR    |  106,727 |  1,833 |
| 2020-10-26 | AS    |        0 |      0 |

| 2020-10-26 | DC    |   16,812 |    642 |
</pre></div><p>So <strong>csvcut </strong>with the option <strong>-c </strong>is used here to select the upcoming columns separated by commas. These 10 lines look better aligned with <strong>csvlook</strong></p><p>Note that we could've done that with either of the following commands:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c 1,2,22,4 all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m CA |head | csvlook
$ csvcut -c 1-2,22,4 all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m CA |head | csvlook
$ csvcut -c 1-2,positive,4 all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m CA |head | csvlook
</pre></div><p>Meaning you can select the columns with their numbers or ranges or a combination of numbers and column names as strings.</p><p>Take care that this CSV&nbsp;data may differ from yours if you're using the recent data from the COVID&nbsp;Tracking Project on another day than the day this tutorial was written.</p><h2>Filtering information</h2><p>Let's now filter out COVID&nbsp;data at California state:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c date,state,positive,death all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m AL | head | csvlook

</pre></div><p>We used here <strong>csvgrep</strong> with the option <strong>-c </strong>to select the column that we’re filtering which is the <em>state </em>here to match <em>AL</em> using <strong>-m </strong>option that matches the pattern we search for.</p><p>I'd like to make sure of this data, so I&nbsp;went to Google and asked how many cases we have at Alabama and this is the answer:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f988fc5968f41509e41fbfe_Screen%20Shot%202020-10-27%20at%2011.22.07%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image by the Author</figcaption></figure><p>Looks like the data reported by the COVID Tracking Project is close to what Google is reporting having 186K positive cases and 2892 fatalities.</p><p>If you also put another column to show the increase in the positive cases from the previous day, you'd find:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c date,state,positive,24,death all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m AL | head | csvlook

<p>As part of a continued series of blog posts themed about “Relational databases and NoSQL”,
Dr. Michael Stonebraker and I co-authored a new blog post just published on
<a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/universal-relation-data-modelling-considered-harmful">EnterpriseDB’s blog</a>.</p>
<p>This post discusses the “Universal Relation” data model, which has become trendier recently under
the name of “Single Table Design”, and is frequently used and recommended in DynamoDB. We discuss a sample
DynamoDB application, and run a benchmark analyzing potential conflicts with DynamoDB transactions.

<div><p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> All right, so, it’s my pleasure today to sit down and have a conversation with Dominick LoBraico about email. In particular, we’re going to talk about a system that Dominick architected and led the development of called Mailcore, which is Jane Street’s own homegrown mail server. </p><p> And I think this is interesting on its own because email is an interesting topic and the whole architecture behind it, but I think it’s also a lens into some interesting questions about software design and how you manage infrastructure, some questions about how you make this choice of when you build your own thing and when you use standard, existing tools, and also some interesting questions about how programming language plays a role in systems design.</p></div>

<h2 id="000048">00:00:48</h2>

<p>Hi, Ron.</p>

<h2 id="000049">00:00:49</h2>

<p>Hey, DLo. So, to get started, can you tell us a little bit about how email works?</p>

<h2 id="000054">00:00:54</h2>

<div><p>Sure. Yeah. So email is based on an old and venerable protocol on the Internet called the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, SMTP, and SMTP… you can kind of think of it as playing the role that the Postal Service plays in delivering regular mail. It is a way for one server that wants to deliver a message somewhere, to hand that message off to another party, who can get it to its final destination, whether that is the eventual destination server itself or some intermediary who can help you get a little bit closer.
</p><p>Email itself came into fruition, as we know today, in the early days of the Internet, and the protocol itself is very simple. You basically have the actual body of the message itself, which has its own separate format and specification, and then you have a set of instructions for expressing who that message is destined for and who it’s coming from, and so one server connects to another.
</p><p>And it says, “I’ve got a message. It’s coming from so and so, and it’s meant to be delivered to some other person. Here’s the body of the message,” and the receiving server can do with that what it will. It can either say, “Great, I’ll take that, and I’ll be responsible for it from here on out.” It can say, “No, I don’t know anything about that person. You have to find somebody else to deliver that to” or reject it for any number of other reasons, like, “This looks like it has a virus,” or “You’re not allowed to connect to me,” or “I’m not available for receiving mail right now.”</p></div>

<h2 id="000217">00:02:17</h2>

<p>And one thing that always strikes me about email is it’s this kind of wondrous artifact from the early Internet, which is a <em>truly</em> open social network. There’s lots of things that people talk about, right? Could we make existing social networks better and more open and all of that, and email, just <em>is</em> from its initial design; and its complete history has been this very open thing, and as you point out, the core protocols and transports are relatively simple, although there is actually a surprising amount of complexity in the RFCs that tell you how to parse a particular email. The overall system is pretty simple, but there’s a lot of complexity in all of the different players who build systems that actually manage and transfer email around and how they deal with the various problems that happen, like spam and people attacking systems via email and all of that. So the foundations are relatively simple, but the emergent complexity of the system is actually pretty high.</p>

<h2 id="000310">00:03:10</h2>

<p>Like with many protocols of the old Internet, it was designed in a time where the world was much simpler than it is today, especially the Internet-connected world. You know, there were probably 50 institutions that had Internet connections or ARPANET connections at the time, and you didn’t really have to worry that anybody was going to be spamming because barely anybody even know what email was in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="000330">00:03:30</h2>

<div><p>When you start and build a new thing, the early properties of the thing that you build can often be really sticky and really matter in a way that’s kind of hard to predict. So this one early property of being open has stayed there. Email is a thing that anyone can participate in. Organizations can build their own infrastructure to connect to it, and through all the rather large transformations that the email system has gone through, that openness remains as a core property.
</p><p>This is the horrible thing about designing to build a new thing,  when you want to design something new, you have to make a bunch of choices, and clearly, you shouldn’t worry about them that much, because probably the thing you build is going to fail and isn’t going to work out, and even if it does, you’re going to learn more about the problem later, and so you shouldn’t worry too much about the early decisions. But also, some of the early decisions, you don’t know which ones are going to turn out to be very hard to change.</p></div>

<h2 id="000413">00:04:13</h2>

<p>That’s right.</p>

<h2 id="000414">00:04:14</h2>

<p>And you’ll be stuck with them until the end of time.</p>

<h2 id="000416">00:04:16</h2>

<p>And in fact, you know, the big players in email today – obviously Google and Gmail, are a really large percentage of the email sending and receiving on the Internet – but they’re still wrestling with some of those early decisions and some of that openness that are architected in, as they try to figure out how they can make email more secure and how they can protect their users and rein in some of the malicious actors on the Internet, and that’s just a hard thing to do while trying to maintain the existing openness that email has; it cuts both ways I guess.</p>

<h2 id="000445">00:04:45</h2>

<p>That openness, in the end, has a lot of value.</p>

<h2 id="000446">00:04:46</h2>

<p>Absolutely. Yeah.</p>

<h2 id="000448">00:04:48</h2>

<p>So the story here is about how you ended up building the system called Mailcore. What did email at Jane Street look like when you first ran into the problem?</p>

<h2 id="000456">00:04:56</h2>

<div><p>So you might think that there’s really not much special about the way Jane Street uses email compared to any other company, and largely, that’s true. I think we have a few special requirements by dint of the fact that we are in a regulated industry, so we have some requirements around logging for compliance purposes every message that is sent or received by somebody at Jane Street.
</p><p>But other than that, our email system looks pretty similar, or has looked, in the past, pretty similar, to the way an email system in any organization might look, and the rough summary is we have some mail gateways that sit on the outside of our network for receiving email from foreign servers, you know, from external parties, and then we have some mail server, or a set of servers, inside of our network that handle all of the complicated business logic around what to do with those messages.
</p><p>So, in some cases, it’s as simple as receive the message and deliver it into the mailbox of the user if we are the intended recipient. In other cases, it is apply filtering for things like spam and viruses and other things that we might want to extract from messages before we deliver them, do expansion for mailing lists. So if you send an email to some group at Jane Street, you want to be able to expand that group name to the actual list of recipient mailboxes to make sure that it actually ends up in the inboxes of the recipients who it’s destined for. And then this extra compliance implication of making sure that we’re logging all of the right messages with all of the right metadata. </p><p>And at the time that I started, the mail infrastructure here was all based on an open source mail server that has its own config language and is pretty widely used on the Internet at large, and we had about 400 or 500 lines of configuration in the most complex case, I think, for this system to get it to do all of these different things that we wanted it to be able to do.</p></div>

<h2 id="000644">00:06:44</h2>

<p>Great. So that sounds like a reasonable approach in terms of how to build oneself a mail system. What problems did we run into with it?</p>

<h2 id="000650">00:06:50</h2>

<div><p>Yeah, so the biggest problem here, at the end of the day, was the complexity required for configuring this system to do all of the things that we needed it to do. So, now, I said 400 or 500 lines of configuration – that probably doesn’t sound like a huge number, but when it’s in a kind of bespoke configuration language that’s unlike the configuration of any other system and unlike any programming language that a developer or engineer at Jane Street would be familiar with, the complexity of 400 or 500 lines in a foreign language is pretty large and can be a little bit imposing to deal with.
</p><p>In particular, we had some scary near-misses where we realized that we had done the wrong thing in terms of archiving some email for compliance purposes that we were supposed to archive, and luckily, in each of those cases, there were mitigating factors such that it didn’t end up being a big deal, but that near-miss gave us a little bit of a scare because we went and looked at the configuration and wanted to understand how we had gotten ourselves into this position, and it was harder than it felt like it should be to understand what had gone wrong and how to fix it.</p></div>

<h2 id="000750">00:07:50</h2>

<p>It’s maybe also worth mentioning that the problem of logging all of your messages for compliance purposes may sound easy, but it’s made more complicated by the fact that Jane Street is a company that operates in lots of different regulatory regimes and has actually different rules for some of the different places it operates. So even the sort of seemingly simple, “Let’s just write everything down” is more complicated than it might appear at first.</p>

<h2 id="000811">00:08:11</h2>

<p>That’s right, yeah. We have different requirements in terms of what has to be written down and what kinds of metadata we need to store and where the extra copies need to be physically located around the world and things like that, which are reasonable sounding when you think about the human aspects of it, you know, when you reason about, okay, yeah, you need a copy for this and a …</p></div></div>

Since then, we’ve gone from a deck and a provisional patent to a team of 12+, a lead drug, and a head brimming with new knowledge and experiences. These are some of my biggest learnings in the last year. </p><h3>Small decisions compound exponentially, especially around team &amp; culture</h3><p>One of the most important things I ever did for our culture was a mistake. The week before a key proof-of-concept study, I decided to completely rework the study design and re-question all of our assumptions. This delayed our timelines and made most of our previous work moot. It also saved the study. </p><p>That was a show not tell moment with our values - it showed the team that truth seeking is the most important thing, and no one has to be scared to tell me if they want to change up something last minute (because I did it myself!). This paved the way to many other close saves. </p><h3>For key relationships, make sure motivations are aligned</h3><p>From investors and advisors to contractors and employees, taking time to understand to fully empathize with their priorities and worries, and not automatically assuming that their motivations are the same as yours, was a hard lesson to embody. As a stereotypical bombastic founder, it was hard for me to comprehend someone <em>not </em>being mission-motivated and not wanting this in the world as badly as I do.</p><p>In hiring, I’ve found that even the most talented person will not perform well if they don’t deeply and truly care about your mission (at least at this stage of the company). In professional relationships, it’s unlikely their motivation is the same as yours, but often motivations can be complimentary. Everything is so much easier when they are. </p><h3>Most catchy startup advice has layers of nuance and conditionals that you wont realize until you’re in the thick of it</h3><p>I hit this one a lot this year, a likely consequence from listening to a few too many startup podcasts. A good example is ‘hire fast, fire fast’. Generally good advice, in my opinion. But no one tells you how difficult it is to execute on that advice, the accusations you’ll face from the person or others, the emotional toll of making a decision that affects someone’s wellbeing, and the ripple effects a firing, even if necessary, can have on the team and how to deal with that. Correct advice? Totally. But far from the full picture. One of my biggest learnings this year was becoming aware of and starting to learn how to predict the nuance and conditionals around things that seem simple from the outside. </p><h3>The line between optimism and naïveté is a wide as a hair </h3><p>To do novel hard things requires optimism that you have some key insight or ability that means you can achieve what others haven’t. You need to be optimistic to trudge through the sludge and to recruit others to your crazy idea long before it’s proven. Naive optimism is so important for building a company and telling a story. But you also need to be paranoid and see around corners. </p><p>Balancing these is difficult - too optimistic and you’ll fall into a trap, too paranoid and you’ll never make a decision. Over the last year, I’ve gained a healthy respect for the challenges ahead of us, moving my natural tendency of optimism a few inches closer to paranoia. I think this will serve us well on this next stage of our journey. </p><p>For me, the hardest part of this was realizing that the optimal balance between optimism and realism differs depending on the situation; what works when facing investors doesn’t work when recruiting, and these two situations differ significantly to the balance you need to hold internally. </p></div></div></div></div></div>

    <p>
      Proposition 24 is a 52-page law that overhauls privacy laws in California. It's so complex that it has split the privacy community, and experts disagree about what it would mean for Californians. Most voices agree Prop 24 has some changes to love, and some to reject. The typical voter is probably very uncertain about whether to vote "Yes" or "No".
    </p>
    <p>
      We are <strong>San Diego Privacy</strong>, a small group of privacy advocates in San Diego, and we'd like to help by offering a neutral analysis. Below you'll find 10 of the biggest issues with Prop 24, along with the main points supporters (the "Yes" side) and opponents (the "No" side) make about that issue.
    </p>
    <p>We suggest you first pick the issues in purple that jump out to you the most. Then, keep count of whether you find the Yes side or the No side more compelling, for the issues you've picked. Last, total up your counts.</p>
    <p>Then, as always, go vote your values.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Update</i></strong>: When you pick the issues below that matter to you, consider <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSWtcqBEbe-SOUUWZ9d7j_M3Ft1ap5CR?usp=sharing" target="_blank">downloading a shareable image</a> of that issue as well, and posting it on social media to generate discussion.</p>

                <strong>Pay for Privacy</strong> means that if you demand privacy, companies can charge you more for goods and services.

        Authors' Note: This is a good place to note that many privacy advocates believe all efforts to collect your data should require affirmative consent from you, rather than using the "opt-out" model where companies collect your data first, and then require you to ask it be deleted or not collected.

            <p>I'm concerned about privacy law <strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                Current privacy laws in California are rarely <strong>enforced.</strong> Only the California Attorney General can enforce California's privacy laws.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>California previous privacy agency was previously closed during budget cuts.</li>
                <li>The California attorney general has signaled that they don't have enough resources for enforcement.</li>
                <li>The California attorney general has asked the legislature to allow individuals the right to sue to enforce their privacy.</li>
              </ul>

                <li>Argues individuals should be able to sue companies to enforce their privacy choices, but Prop 24 left that out.</li>
                  <li>Believes the new enforcement agency established by Prop 24 would be underfunded and ineffective.</li>

              <div>
                <p>
                    Private right of action (the right for individuals to sue) is desired by many privacy organizations, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/why-eff-doesnt-support-cal-prop-24#:~:text=no%20enforcement%20by%20consumers" target="_blank">including the EFF</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Opponents stated their objection to Prop 24's new enforcement agency in <a href="https://youtu.be/DuWspeTzOA0?t=780" target="_blank">their video interview</a> with the Union-Tribune.

        Authors' Note: Privacy advocates feel very strongly that Californians should have the "private right of action," or the right to sue companies to enforce privacy law. It seems to us unlikely that privacy organizations will support overhauls to California's privacy laws without that private right of action being included.

            <p>I'm concerned about <strong>How Prop 24 Was Created</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                Prop 24 is a 52-page law with so much complexity that even experts disagree on its meaning. It was written privately and then submitted directly to voters.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Alastair Mactaggart wrote Prop 24. It has not been reviewed by the legislature.</li>
                <li>Mactaggart invited some industries to provide changes to Prop 24 as it was drafted.</li>
                <li>Mactaggart helped get California's existing CCPA privacy law passed through the legislature.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p><a>What's the deal with Prop 24's origins?</a>

                <p>Yes Side Says:</p>
                <li>Argues privacy laws are under assault by lobbyists, and Prop 24 is the fastest way to stop that.</li>
                  <li>Warns that there isn't enough enforcement of existing privacy laws, and that Prop 24 provides more enforcement.</li>

                <p>No Side Says:</p>
                <li>Argues existing privacy laws only started to be enforced three months ago, and that it's too soon to overhaul those privacy laws.</li>
                  <li>Believes the legislature should write and pass future privacy laws, not private parties.</li>
                  <li>Warns that privacy organizations were excluded from writing Prop 24, but that industries were invited.</li>

      <p>
        Authors' Note: Due to the way this law is being proposed directly to voters, rather than going through the long process of the legislature, there are a lot of experts disagreeing with each other regarding Prop 24's implications.

            <div>
              <p>
                Prop 24 classifies some types of data as "sensitive," such as race, sexual orientation and precise GPS coordinates, and restricts how companies can use them.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Prop 24 sets up a new class of information called Sensitive Information.</li>
                <li>Sensitive information includes: precise geolocation; race; ethnicity; religion; genetic data; private communications; sexual orientation; and specified health information.</li>
                <li>Fines are tripled for violations of the law for children under the age of 16.</li>

		<p>Since I live in a different town from my family, the holidays are the majority of the time I get to spend with my twelve year-old brother (we have a 17 year age gap).</p>
<p>Now that he’s nearly a teenager, he’s almost the age I was when I started thinking independently from family and friends. For me, a big part of that was discovering Paul Graham’s essays. Hopefully one day my brother reads through them (but I won’t force him).</p>
<p>This got me thinking: if I were to recommend them to him, would I want him to read them chronologically? Or should I point him to specific essays based on his interests?</p>
<p>Alternatively, if one were to compile all of Paul’s essays into a collection or a <i>Hackers and Painters</i> sequel, how would it be organized?</p>
<p>So below is my attempt at tagging Paul Graham’s essays by subject matter.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/675336d96deabd0007621a71180bcfb57edb6b11/805fd/images/2020-04-04-porsche_classifier/718.jpg" alt="porsche-718"></p>

<p>Trained using <a href="https://fast.ai/">fastai-v3</a>, <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch</a> and <a href="https://gradient.paperspace.com/">Gradient</a>.
Uses <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/resnet50.html">resnet50</a> and trained on a <a href="https://images.nvidia.com/content/pdf/quadro/data-sheets/192195-DS-NV-Quadro-P5000-US-12Sept-NV-FNL-WEB.pdf">Nvidia Quadro P5000</a>.
Built on <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/app-service/web/">Microsoft Azure Web Services</a>.
Trained on a dataset of publicly sourced images containing 30000 Porsche car models of varying degree of quality.
Porsche cars, specially the latest generations of the Panamera/Taycan, Macan/Cayenne &amp; 911 / 718 can be pretty tricky to tell apart for a layman who isn’t paying very close attention, which is why I wanted to test out what kind of features this deep learning model would pick up.</p>

<h3 id="creating-your-own-dataset-from-google-images">Creating your own dataset from Google Images</h3>

<p>In this tutorial we will see how to easily create an image dataset through Google Images. Note: You will have to repeat these steps for any new category you want to Google (e.g once for dogs and once for cats).</p>
<div><pre>```python
from fastai.vision import *
```</pre></div>
<h4 id="get-a-list-of-urls">Get a list of URLs</h4>

<h5 id="search-and-scroll">Search and scroll</h5>

<p>Go to Google Images and search for the images you are interested in. The more specific you are in your Google Search, the better the results and the less manual pruning you will have to do.</p>

<p>Scroll down until you’ve seen all the images you want to download, or until you see a button that says ‘Show more results’. All the images you scrolled past are now available to download. To get more, click on the button, and continue scrolling. The maximum number of images Google Images shows is 700.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to put things you want to exclude into the search query, for instance if you are searching for the Eurasian wolf, “canis lupus lupus”, it might be a good idea to exclude other variants:</p>

<p>“canis lupus lupus” -dog -arctos -familiaris -baileyi -occidentalis</p>

<p>You can also limit your results to show only photos by clicking on Tools and selecting Photos from the Type dropdown.</p>

<h3 id="download-into-file">Download into file</h3>

<p>Now you must run some Javascript code in your browser which will save the URLs of all the images you want for you dataset.</p>

<p>In Google Chrome press CtrlShiftj on Windows/Linux and CmdOptj on macOS, and a small window the javascript ‘Console’ will appear. In Firefox press CtrlShiftk on Windows/Linux or CmdOptk on macOS. That is where you will paste the JavaScript commands.</p>

<p>You will need to get the urls of each of the images. Before running the following commands, you may want to disable ad blocking extensions (uBlock, AdBlockPlus etc.) in Chrome. Otherwise the window.open() command doesn’t work. Then you can run the following commands:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">urls<span>=</span>Array<span>.</span>from(document<span>.</span>querySelectorAll(<span>'.rg_i'</span>))<span>.</span><span>map</span>(el<span>=&gt;</span> el<span>.</span>hasAttribute(<span>'data-src'</span>)?el<span>.</span>getAttribute(<span>'data-src'</span>):el<span>.</span>getAttribute(<span>'data-iurl'</span>));
window<span>.</span><span>open</span>(<span>'data:text/csv;charset=utf-8,'</span> <span>+</span> escape(urls<span>.</span>join(<span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)));</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="create-directory-and-upload-urls-file-into-your-server">Create directory and upload urls file into your server</h3>

<p>Choose an appropriate name for your labeled images. You can run these steps multiple times to create different labels.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'718'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'718.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'911'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'911.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'cayenne'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'cayenne.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'macan'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'macan.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'taycan'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'taycan.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'panamera'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'panamera.csv'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will need to run this cell once per each category.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    In [<span>0</span>]:
    path <span>=</span> Path(<span>'data/porsche'</span>)
    dest <span>=</span> path<span>/</span>folder
    dest<span>.</span>mkdir(parents<span>=</span><span>True</span>, exist_ok<span>=</span><span>True</span>)
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    path<span>.</span>ls()
    Out[<span>0</span>]:
    [PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/cayenne'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/panamera.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/cayenne.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/panamera'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/taycan'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/911.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/taycan.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/911'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/macan.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/718'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/718.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/macan'</span>)]</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, upload your urls file. You just need to press ‘Upload’ in your working directory and select your file, then click ‘Upload’ for each of the displayed files.</p>

<p><code>uploaded file</code></p>

<h3 id="download-images">Download images</h3>

<p>Now you will need to download your images from their respective urls.</p>

<p>fast.ai has a function that allows you to do just that. You just have to specify the urls filename as well as the destination folder and this function will download and save all images that can be opened. If they have some problem in being opened, they will not be saved.</p>

<p>Let’s download our images! Notice you can choose a maximum number of images to be downloaded. In this case we will not download all the urls.</p>

<p>You will need to run this line once for every category.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">In [<span>0</span>]:
classes <span>=</span> [<span>'taycan'</span>,<span>'panamera'</span>,<span>'macan'</span>,<span>'cayenne'</span>,<span>'718'</span>,<span>'911'</span>]
In [<span>0</span>]:
download_images(path<span>/</span><span>file</span>, dest, max_pics<span>=</span><span>500</span>)

    In [<span>0</span>]:
    <span># If you have problems download, try with `max_workers=0` to see exceptions:</span>
    download_images(path<span>/</span><span>file</span>, dest, max_pics<span>=</span><span>20</span>, max_workers<span>=</span><span>0</span>)
    <span>``</span>`

Then we can remove <span>any</span> images that can<span>'t be opened:</span>
<span>`python In [0]: for c in classes: print(c) verify_images(path/c, delete=True, max_size=500) taycan panamera macan cayenne 718 911`</span>

<span>### View data</span>

<span>    ```python</span>
<span>    In [0]:</span>
<span>    np.random.seed(42)</span>
<span>    data = ImageDataBunch.from_folder(path, train=".", valid_pct=0.2,</span>
<span>            ds_tfms=get_transforms(), size=224, num_workers=4).normalize(imagenet_stats)</span>

<span>    In [0]:</span>
<span>    #If you already cleaned your data, run this cell instead of the one before</span>
<span>     np.random.seed(42)</span>
<span>     data = ImageDataBunch.from_csv(path, folder=".", valid_pct=0.2, csv_labels='</span>cleaned<span>.</span>csv<span>',</span>
<span>             ds_tfms=get_transforms(), size=224, num_workers=4).normalize(imagenet_stats)</span>
<span>    ```</span>

<span>Good! Let'</span>s take a look at some of our pictures then<span>.</span>
<span>``</span>`python

Some of our top losses aren<span>'t due to bad performance by our model. There are images in our data set that shouldn'</span>t be<span>.</span>

Using the ImageCleaner widget <span>from</span> fastai.widgets we can prune our top losses, removing photos that don<span>'t belong.</span>

<span>```</span>

<span>In [0]:</span>
<span>from fastai.widgets import \*</span>

<span>```</span>
<span>First we need to get the file paths from our top_losses. We can do this with .from_toplosses. We then feed the top losses indexes and corresponding dataset to ImageCleaner.</span>

<span>Notice that the widget will not delete images directly from disk but it will create a new csv file cleaned.csv from where you can create a new ImageDataBunch with the corrected labels to continue training your model.</span>
<span>```</span>

<span>In [0]:</span>
<span>db = (ImageList.from_folder(path)</span>
<span>.split_none()</span>
<span>.label_from_folder()</span>
<span>.transform(get_transforms(), size=224)</span>
<span>.databunch()</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>In [0]:</span>

<span># If you already cleaned your data using indexes from `from_toplosses`,</span>

<span># run this cell instead of the one before to proceed with removing duplicates.</span>

<span># Otherwise all the results of the previous step would be overwritten by</span>

<span># the new run of `ImageCleaner`.</span>

<span>db = (ImageList.from_csv(path, '</span>cleaned<span>.</span>csv<span>', folder='</span><span>.</span><span>')</span>
<span>.split_none()</span>
<span>.label_from_df()</span>
<span>.transform(get_transforms(), size=224)</span>
<span>.databunch()</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>```</span>
<span>Then we create a new learner to use our new databunch with all the images.</span>

    <article>

        

        <section>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>This post is a bundle of thoughts on the near future of Augmented Reality implementations, ways of integration, and introducing new layers of cognition. We are going to talk about AR as a way of enabling transhumanism by broadening the human cognitive and sensory toolbox.<br>
We are not going to be concerned with what is and what is not technologically possible at the moment.</p>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Have you ever taken a walk and thought about all the accessible information on animals, plants, objects, or even people? How much information is available on the internet? How many facts have you encountered and already forgotten?</p>
<p>Ancient Greeks put an active effort into training and maintaining their memorizing capabilities, and already at this stage of progress, human memory is shifting – or has shifted from remembering facts to remembering how and where to find facts. We are keeping less and less information hardcoded in our permanent memory and are in turn learning how to<br>
consume, process, and find useful data in an endless stream of information and misinformation.</p>
<p>A technologically proficient user has access to a vast volume and spectrum of data at his/her disposal, sitting right in the pocket. The human approach to holding knowledge is evolving as we speak. Heck, it started evolving with the invention of speech. But another significant<br>
change is on the cusp of happening. Our mobile phone interfaces, while serving all the information we need, are still detached from us, having considerable latency when we need to find, show, or input data. With the introduction of AR, AI, and human-computer interfaces, everything is about to change. AR or human augmentation in general will make that data<br>
more accessible and drastically lessen the latency needed for the interaction, making the tools feel more and more as part of ourselves.</p>
<p>Imagine walking down the street. You look around to observe people on the street and notifications start popping up alongside people’s heads. For one person the message says:<br>
"You have seen this person three times this week already"; for another one it states:<br>
"You have five mutual connections and common interests".<br>
Those notifications could also tell you if the person is willing to make new connections, based on previously shared data or facial microexpression analysis. Maybe we have gone too far down the rabbit hole for now, but you<br>
get the idea.</p>
<h3 id="definingarandtranshumanism">Defining AR and Transhumanism</h3>
<p>Merriam-Webster defines Augmented Reality as "an enhanced version of reality created by the use of technology to overlay digital information on an image of something being viewed through a device (such as a smartphone camera)". For the purposes of this post, I would like us not to limit reality to human vision alone.</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster has no definition for Transhumanism, but Wikipedia defines it as a philosophical movement that advocates for the transformation of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology.</p>
<p>The two are getting more and more intertwined as technology advances, so I would like us to redefine AR, if only for this post, as "any technology that enhances or expands the human experience of reality", or maybe even as "practical transhumanism".</p>
<h3 id="augmentationtechnologymilestones">Augmentation technology milestones</h3>
<p>These are some freely set milestones for AR technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>LVL 0 – environment emulation via VR – for developmental fast-tracking</li>
<li>LVL 1 – external IO devices – headsets, glasses, gloves</li>
<li>LVL 2 – embedded IO devices – lenses, external neural signal readers</li>
<li>LVL 3 – tapping into existing sensory and neural networks</li>
<li>LVL 4 – registering new input/output devices in neural networks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="degreesofaugmentation">Degrees of augmentation</h3>
<p>For the time being, and at least until we master the LVL 4 milestone described above, we are not creating new sensory or actuation systems, we are only hijacking the existing ones. Hi, Neuralink ;). This means that with every bit of information we gain, we are blocking the bandwidth and use for our existing IO mechanisms.In all fairness, people recovering mobility after a severe head trauma are evidence that the brain could possess enough plasticity to use whatever is thrown at it, given we connect the right dots, have enough time and practice. User age could also be a part of the equation.<br>
Sounds easier than it is, I know.</p>
<p>So, the more we augment our existing senses, the more we obstruct our basic physical-world data flow, the need to set some design restriction guidelines will grow. We still have accidents while using mobile phones or headphones, so the question arises: how could we manage a society full of people that overlap and fully cover their field of vision and hearing?<br>
Some safety rules integrated into the tech would be quite handy. Here is an example of defining degrees of augmentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>No augmentation</li>
<li>Info - can be an overlay, but should not block much sensory bandwidth</li>
<li>Safe communication – headset equivalent</li>
<li>Immersive experience – not safe for driving, safe for outdoors</li>
<li>Fully overlaying sensory input with enabled alerts – public safe zones</li>
<li>Fully overlaying sensory input – only for safe zones at home</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="augmentationusagecategories">Augmentation usage categories</h3>
<h4 id="knowledgemanagement">Knowledge management</h4>
<p>At some point, AR should enable access to data from the internet, which should be retrieved and presented without too much user effort, based on surrounding situations and context. Also, the useful data should be categorized and stored for retrieval at a later time.<br>
The interface should be able to combine relevant data and present solutions, statistics, and probabilities.</p>
<p>This could also enable saving verifiable event recordings, snapshots, and transcripts, real-time language translation, or seeing blueprints and instructions while fixing devices.</p>
<h4 id="extendingsensoryreach">Extending sensory reach</h4>
<p>The human sensory reach is already drastically extended with the use of IoT and the internet in general, but there is so much more of existing tech to be integrated into an AR system to extend human senses. Users could see and feel if their home or possessions are safe, or more generally, sense physical-world information streams in real-time.<br>
For example, physical-world data can be processed in parallel with the user experiencing the immediate surroundings. Thus, the user would, for instance, return home and detect certain objects have been moved, etc.</p>
<h4 id="extendingphysicalactuationactionreach">Extending physical actuation/action reach</h4>
<p>Besides our physical reach, most of us have already experienced controlling or affecting the physical-world at a distance. AR could help make the world around us feel more like an extension of our physical bodies.<br>
We could run automated processes upon visual triggers, i.e. unlock the front door without thinking, or control devices, drones, and robotics with ease.</p>
<h4 id="communicationandindividuality">Communication and individuality</h4>
<p>Communication could also be streamlined. We could have an instant connection with anyone around the world, almost as if standing side by side. Communication could play out on several levels, depending on the level of technological advancement, and could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restrained – messages and recordings with a delay and opportunity for curation</li>
<li>Unrestrained – conservative – real-time audio-visual communication</li>
<li>Unrestrained – progressive – direct thought transfer in a Neuralink-like brain-computer interface manner</li>
</ul>
<p>We could socialize, play games, or work like never before:<br>
imagine coding while sharing your thought process with a colleague, and also having an "AI" assisted IDE.</p>
<h4 id="extendingthecognitiontoolbox">Extending the cognition toolbox</h4>
<p>Given having a portable AR system and a smart enough underlying OS that replicates our surroundings and anticipates our needs OR an efficient enough way of selecting and using computational tools, we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>see object trajectories</li>
<li>have perfect math at our disposal</li>
<li>know objects, plant life, animals, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI or General AI could, if available, also be used as an intermediary to the available cognition toolbox, to serve the necessary tools and results to the end-user.</p>
<h4 id="pastimeandentertainment">Pastime and entertainment</h4>
<p>I won’t go into great detail here, VR games are already immersive and fun, but try to imagine what they would be like if some freedom is added to the mix. As games and entertainment are presumably most likely to require as much immersion as possible, it will be necessary to consider immersion safety.</p>
<h5 id="vrgamesandapsfullyoverlayingsensoryinput">VR games and APS - fully overlaying sensory input</h5>
<p>Cars, stairs, sudden drops, and obstacles are here to stay, so for any device that can write over your sensory input, a way to risk mitigation must be in place.</p>
<h5 id="endusersafetyzonecalibration">End user safety zone calibration</h5>
<p>Imagine you want to play a full-on VR game somewhere. How could you stay safe and not trip over something or fall over some curb? It is simple, you could just walk around your playground to define its contours and limits. A certain amount of space can even be taken out of the outer limits of the playground, any obstacles are reproduced in-game so you can navigate past them. You start the game and play, and in case you move to the outer limits, the game simply starts to fade away.</p>
<h5 id="safesurfaces">Safe surfaces</h5>
<p>OK, but where else could you use 100% augmentation opacity in the real world? The first thing that comes to mind as safe would be walls. You can project stuff in front of almost any wall and be sure that nothing you can’t see will hit you from that direction, or at least as sure as you are now.</p>
<h5 id="contentkillswitch">Content killswitch</h5>
<p>Another useful feature would be to have the immersive content stop when quiet time or rest is needed, as well as if stress levels are critical.</p>
<h3 id="pitfallsofarandhumanaugmentation">Pitfalls of AR and Human augmentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Having no signal or battery</li>
<li>Developing a dependence on AR in everyday life</li>
<li>Losing sense of the physical self</li>
<li>Losing individuality</li>
<li>Identifying the AR OS as a part of the personality</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wecanworkondevelopingartoday">We can work on developing AR today</h3>
<p>I guess we are all well aware of the current limitations of the AR systems, but looking past the non-existing or low tech ways of input and output that we nowadays possess, by emulating non-existing augmentation pathways and …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>Pittsburgh, PA — This has been a painful journey. After years of impotent performance and correctness checks in the <a href="https://pelotondb.io/">Peloton</a> database project, we found ourselves in a morass of despair and unmaintainable system code. Previous attempts to rectify the many issues with the system proved to be feckless, even with the most brilliant database students and engineers. Rather than continue on with the desiccated husk of a system on life support, we decided to sacrifice our beloved DBMS on the altar of the database gods and start over. It does not help that a certain bike company was able to capture distilled misogyny in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/business/peloton-bike-ad-stock.html">30 second commercial</a> and thus forever ruining a good name for a DBMS.</p>
<p>Two years have passed since then. We now find ourselves in a new world plagued by a pestilence that feeds on imbecilic apathy and stupidity. Despite this setback, we have persevered and continue forward with our research fueled by our unwavering desire to pursue science. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon Database Group</a> is pleased to announce the first page of the <b>NoisePage</b> database management system. This release is still experimental code and thus should <u>not</u> be used in production environments.</p>
<p>There is currently <u>no</u> support for self-driving operations in this release; it does contain the offline <a href="https://github.com/cmu-db/noisepage/tree/master/benchmark/runner">training data collection framework</a> that is needed to train the DBMS’s internal <i>operating unit</i> models.</p>

		<p><b><span size="+1">Introduction</span></b></p>
		<p>It is now 2018, and I really need to rewrite the introduction to this page. I'm currently looking to reduce my reliance at home on vintage hardware, and to lower my electricity bill. I've started using SIMH/VAX heavily, and would love an Alpha emulator for the Apps that I can't move over to SIMH/VAX. Plus from what I'm seeing, current Intel-based systems can emulate an Alpha-Based system faster than the fastest Alpha.</p>
		<p>At this point I don't know why anyone would want to emulate an Alpha.  If you are a hobbyist looking to run OpenVMS, take a look at the <a href="http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/decemulation/vax.html">VAX</a> emulation available, or buy an inexpensive used Alpha.  Having said this I've been watching the ES40 emulator with great interest as at some point this will no longer be true, and at this point it is the emulator with the greatest promise for Hobbyists.</p>
		<p>If you are a commercial user I would seriously recommend looking at an upgrade to Itanium if your applications will run there.  If not I would recommend looking at one of the newer models of Alpha that are still available.  </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>At Human Jobs, we are obsessed with building skills. Not only is continual learning a key driver for career success, it can also be a source of enormous intellectual satisfaction. There are so many quality resources available online, but today we start with our top 5 online courses for building job skills. They cover a variety of subjects, but all are well-taught and will deliver tangible skills you can use in the real world.</p>
<h4>1. <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-tll-005-how-to-speak-january-iap-2018/index.htm"><em>How to Speak</em> </a>from MIT</h4>
<p>This is a legendary course from MIT focused on public speaking skills for job interviews, lectures, and much more. The professor, Patrick Winston is a charismatic speaker himself – I mean, he ought to be if he is teaching the course. Although geared toward an MIT audience, it is packed with useful tips for people of any educational background.</p>
<p>This “course” is technically just one video, so if you don’t have much free time, an hour with Patrick Winston is an hour well-spent. In his own words: “By the end of the next 60 minutes you will have been exposed to a lot of ideas, some of which you will incorporate into your own repertoire, and they will ensure that you get the maximum opportunity to have your ideas valued and accepted by the people you speak with.” The lectures is freely available on MIT Open Courseware.</p>
<p>Don’t go into another job interview without watching <em>How to Speak </em>first.&nbsp;Check it out <strong><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-tll-005-how-to-speak-january-iap-2018/index.htm">here.</a></strong></p>
<h4>2. <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/"><em>Startup School</em></a> from Y Combinator</h4>
<p>If you are thinking of starting a business, <em>Startup School</em> from Y Combinator (YC) will give you the skills and frameworks for evaluating and growing your idea. YC is the top startup accelerator in the US, which means they know what it takes for a clever idea to become a successful business.</p>
<p><em>Startup School</em> is a great introduction to entrepreneurship, and business more generally, because it forces you to think critically about why some startups succeed and others fail. For people with little background in this area, the lectures are very accessible, use little jargon, and are a great entry-point into the space. The lecturers are really candid, and I found it very refreshing for some frank and pointed views on the startup world.</p>
<p><em>Startup School</em> is free, so check it out <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>3. <a href="https://justiceharvard.org/"><em>Justice</em></a> from Harvard</h4>
<p>Michael Sandel is the professor who turns probing moral inquiry into a thrill-ride. <em>Justice</em> offers a whistle-stop tour of different ethical and moral philosophies ranging from the ancients to contemporary philosophers. The course is honestly addictive and always spurred vigorous debate between me ad my friends while watching.</p>
<p>Sandel is a champion of the Socratic method, and his questioning models the kind of critical thought that is so celebrated by humanities students. If sharpening your reasoning skills isn’t enough, then take <em>Justice</em> to challenge your own moral and ethical convictions. Whether you are targeting writing jobs, tutoring jobs, or a career in finance, you will become more analytically and ethically robust after a few lectures of <em>Justice</em>.</p>
<p>Lectures are free from the course website and on YouTube. Check out the course website <a href="https://justiceharvard.org/"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>4. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-2016-essential-training/welcome"><em>Excel Essential Training</em></a> from LinkedIn</h4>
<p>You cannot deny the importance of Excel within the modern economy. Microsoft’s interactive spreadsheet software is everywhere and facility with the program is a huge selling point in job applications. This course from LinkedIn is a thorough introduction to the subjects and it provides a nice interactive format for practicing new techniques. No prior knowledge is necessary, and even people with intermediate Excel skills will benefit.</p>
<p>When I took the course, my Excel skills were reasonably advanced, but I benefitted tremendously from a more detailed understanding of the program. The small tips and best practices I learned have saved me a lot of time and many headaches since finishing the course. Knowledge of Excel will serve you in many different professions, so it is worth committing the hours to become a power user.</p>
<p>Available on LinkedIn Learning <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-2016-essential-training/welcome"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>5. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science"><em>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</em></a> from Harvard/edX</h4>
<p>If you want to learn to code, CS50 is the place to start. This course from Harvard comes with everything: a dynamic professor, extensive resources, logistical help, problem sets with automatic grading, supplementary lectures from teaching fellows, a user-friendly coding environment, and more.</p>
<p>There is a reason CS50 has a cult following among Harvard undergraduates, many of whom take CS50 as their first computer science course. I took CS50 online and found it absolutely exhilarating. It was challenging, but the course structure and resources made it easy to start. At the outset of a programming course, the number of new tools and concepts is often overwhelming for beginners. In my experience, CS50 does the best job at easing you into the field and building some momentum right from the start.</p>
<p>Knowing how to code is an invaluable skill for anyone on the job market, so it should be high on your list of skills to acquire. If you need to be convinced, we have an entire <strong><a href="https://human-jobs.com/2020/10/07/learn-to-code/">blogpost</a></strong> dedicated to coding for humanities people. Taking CS50 is a commitment, but you will not regret it. Free and paid versions are available from edX, so check it out <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>6. Bonus Fun/Learning Resource: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9RM-iSvTu1uPJb8X5yp3EQ">Wendover Productions</a> on YouTube</h4>
<p>This isn’t a course, but rather a YouTube channel that offers super high-quality “mini-documentaries” on really interesting topics. Wendover’s videos are pithy and jam-packed with interesting insights. Ever wonder how overnight shipping works? Check out this <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qfeoqErtY">video</a></strong>. Curious about how humans conceptualize risk? Wendover has got you covered <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtX-Ibi21tU">here</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I watch Wendover to understand how the world works, and I always come away with a new insight into the unseen forces that shape our lives. Highly recommended for some fun and educational time on YouTube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9RM-iSvTu1uPJb8X5yp3EQ"><strong>Here</strong></a> is&nbsp;the channel link.</p>
<h3>Never stop learning – build job skills every day</h3>
<p>Learning new things and building skills is a major motivator in my life. I do it for fun, and I do it for the career opportunities that an expanded skillset affords. Tell me in the comments: what skills do you want to build? Do you have any amazing online resources that others should check out?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <blockquote>
<p>This article is in a series of code review articles that take a
deep look at a popular module and discuss its merits, flaws, and
overall fitness for a task.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios</a> is a solid, battle-tested, replacement for the deprecated <code>require.js</code>. I
recommend it despite the imperfections that I have summarized in this article.</p>
<p>The logic in this package is well thought out and meets my standards. Some of
the more complex functions are arduous to read. This makes collaboration from
the development community difficult and undermines the overall effectiveness of
the project.</p>
<p>The interceptor system is a workable solution for extending the package
functions. Personally, I have wrapped request/response to extend error reporting
and the updates felt natural and a seamless transition.</p>
<p>There are two test runners in the project: Mocha (for node.js) and Jasmine/Karma
(for browser testing). This is unnecessary as both test packages can run both
platforms. A large number of the tests are written for jasmine and will not
run, without modification in the mocha test suite. This prevents me from
showing full code coverage without hacking on the tests (more on this later). </p>
<p>Running <code>npm test</code> takes many minutes and fails, by default, if the developer
does not have the Opera browser installed. I can understand that an exhaustive
integration run in a multi-target package is a long process. Fleshing out the
Mocha test suite to run on the command line in a second npm script would
encourage test-driven refactoring and make many of the improvements I outline
much simpler and safer. Iterative, refactoring tests must be fast, sane, and
meaningful. They need not be exhaustive. The exhaustive testing can be saved
for pre-release and proofing pull-requests.</p>
<p>The current version is <code>0.20.0</code>. There is no explicit roadmap for the project;
however, I do not see a reason for the delay in assigning version <code>1.0.0</code> to this
release.</p>

<p>That is an extremely old version of <code>ws</code>. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/550">It has been

<p>I love <code>lodash</code> for the creativity of its codebase, the way the developers
step up to the challenge of being faster than native, but never user it. NPM
awards <code>lodash</code>‘s prototype pollution (actually polyfills) a <code>High</code> level alert.</p>
<p><code>karma</code> also depends on an old version of <code>chokidar</code>, but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://paulmillr.com/posts/chokidar-3-save-32tb-of-traffic/">new chokidar is way

<p>I went into all the depth here because it is important to note that while all of
these dependencies are dev only, they are eliminated by just updating the

<p>It is interesting to note that karma detected immediately that I do not have

<p>We’re very excited to release Pyston v2, a faster and highly compatible implementation of the Python programming language.  Version 2 is 20% faster than stock Python 3.8 on our macrobenchmarks.  More importantly, it is likely to be faster on your code.  Pyston v2 can reduce server costs, reduce user latencies, and improve developer productivity.</p>



<p>Pyston v2 is easy to deploy, so if you’re looking for better Python performance, we encourage you to take five minutes and <a href="#availability">try Pyston</a>. Doing so is one of the easiest ways to speed up your project.</p>



<h2>Performance</h2>



<p>Pyston v2 provides a noticeable speedup on many workloads while having few drawbacks.  Our focus has been on web serving workloads, but Pyston v2 is also faster on other workloads and popular benchmarks.</p>



<p>Our team put together a new <a href="https://github.com/pyston/python-macrobenchmarks/">public Python macrobenchmark suite</a> that measures the performance of several commonly-used Python projects.  The benchmarks in this suite are larger than those found in other Python suites, making them more likely to be representative of real-world applications.  Even though this gives us a lower headline number than other projects, we believe it translates to better speedups for real use cases.  Pyston v2 still shows sped-up performance on microbenchmarks, being twice as fast as standard Python on tests like chaos.py and nbody.py.</p>



<p>Here are our performance results:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>CPython 3.8.5</td><td>Pyston 2.0</td><td>PyPy 7.3.2</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging warmup time [1]</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>85s</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging mean latency</td><td>5.1ms</td><td>4.1ms</td><td>2.5ms</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging p99 latency</td><td>6.3ms</td><td>5.2ms</td><td>5.8ms</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging memory usage</td><td>47MB</td><td>54MB</td><td>228MB</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms warmup time [1]</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>105s</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms mean latency</td><td>14.1ms</td><td>11.8ms</td><td>15.9ms</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms p99 latency</td><td>15.0ms</td><td>12.8ms</td><td>179ms</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms memory usage</td><td>84MB</td><td>91MB</td><td>279MB</td></tr><tr><td>Pylint speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.16x</td><td>0.50x</td></tr><tr><td>mypy speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.07x [2]</td><td>unsupported</td></tr><tr><td>PyTorch speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.00x [2]</td><td>unsupported</td></tr><tr><td>PyPy benchmark suite [3]</td><td>1x</td><td>1.36x</td><td>2.48x</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Results were collected on an m5.large EC2 instance running Ubuntu 20.04</figcaption></figure>



<p>[1] Warmup time is defined as time until the benchmark reached 95% of peak performance; if it was not distinguishable from noise it is marked “n/a”.  Only post-warmup behavior is considered for latency measurement.<br>[2] mypy and PyTorch don’t support automatically building their C extensions from source, so these Pyston numbers use our unsafe compatibility mode<br>[3] The PyPy benchmark suite was modified to only run the benchmarks that are compatible with Python 3.8</p>



<h2>Results analysis</h2>



<p>In our targeted benchmarks (djangocms + flaskblogging), Pyston v2 provides an average 1.22x speedup for mean latency and an 1.18x improvement for p99 latency while using a just few more megabytes per process.  We have not yet invested time in optimizing the other benchmarks.</p>



<p>“p99 latency” is the upper 99th percentile of the response-time distribution, and is a common metric used in web serving contexts since it can provide insight into user experience that is lost by taking an average.  PyPy’s high p99 latency on djangocms comes from periodic latency spikes, presumably from garbage collection pauses.  CPython and Pyston both exhibit periodic spikes, presumably from their cycle collectors, but they are both less frequent and much smaller in magnitude.</p>



<p>The mypy and PyTorch benchmarks show a natural boundary of Pyston v2. These benchmarks both do the bulk of their work in C extensions which are unaffected by our Python speedups.  We natively support the C API and do not have an emulation layer, so we are still able to provide a small boost to mypy performance and do not degrade pytorch or numpy performance.  Your benefit will depend on your mix of Python and C extension work.</p>



<h2>Technical approach</h2>



<p>We’re planning on going into more detail in future blog posts, but some of the techniques we use in Pyston v2 include:</p>



<ul><li>A very-low-overhead JIT using <a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM</a></li><li><a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue14757">Quickening</a></li><li>General CPython optimizations</li><li>Build process improvements</li></ul>



<h2>Compatibility</h2>



<p>Since Pyston is a fork of CPython, we believe it is one of the most compatible alternative Python implementations available today.  It supports all the same features and C API that CPython does.</p>



<p>While Pyston is identically functional in theory, in practice there are some temporary compatibility hurdles for any new Python implementation.  Please see <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/wiki">our wiki</a> for details.</p>



<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>



<p>Pyston v2.0 is <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/releases">immediately available</a> as a pre-built package.  Currently, we have packages for Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 x86_64.  If you would like support for a different OS, let us know by filing an issue in our <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>



<p>Trying out Pyston is as simple as installing our package, replacing <code>python3</code> with <code>pyston3</code>, and reinstalling your dependencies with <code>pip-pyston3 install</code> (though see our <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/wiki">wiki</a> for a known issue about setuptools). If you already have an automated build set up, the change should be just a few lines.</p>



<p>Our plan is to open-source the code in the future, but since compiler projects are expensive and we no longer have benevolent corporate sponsorship, it is currently closed-source while we iron out our business model.</p>



<h2>Reaching us</h2>



<p>We are designing Pyston for developers and love to hear about your needs and experiences.  So, we’ve set up a <a href="https://discord.gg/S7gsqnb">Discord server</a> where you can chat with us.  If you’d like a commercially-supported version of Pyston, please <a href="mailto:business@pyston.org">send us an email</a>.</p>



<p>We’ve optimized Pyston for several use cases but are eager to hear about new ones so that we can make it even more beneficial.  If you run into any problems or instances where Pyston does not help as much as expected, please let us know!</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>We designed Pyston v1 at Dropbox to speed up Python for its web serving workloads.  After the project ended, some of us from the team brainstormed how we would do it differently if we were to do it again.  In early 2020, enough pieces were in place for us to start a company and work on Pyston full-time.</p>



<p>Pyston v2 is inspired by but is technically unrelated to the original Pyston v1 effort.</p>



<h2>Moving forward</h2>



<p>We’re on a mission to make Python faster and have plenty of ideas to do so.  That means we’re actively looking for people to join the team.  <a href="https://discord.gg/S7gsqnb">Let us know</a> if you’d like to get involved.  Otherwise stay tuned for future releases and reach out if you have any questions!</p>

<h2><a href="https://chrisseaton.com/">Chris Seaton</a>, 28 October 2020</h2>


</header>

<p>There’s a proposal to add <em>Software Transactional Memory</em>, or <em>STM</em>, to the Ruby programming language. This is part of a wider effort to add better support for concurrency and parallelism in Ruby, and in particular the idea of <em>ractors</em>. A concept has been <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/3652">implemented</a> by Koichi Sasada.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/ruby-stm/testBoard.gif" width="50%">
<figcaption>An animation of the algorithm we're going to use as an example of STM - we'll explain this later on</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This article gives some context on what STM is, how you use it, and why you might want to use it. We’ll show an application which is well-suited to STM and we’ll use this to talk about the benefits, issues, and some open questions.</p>

<p>We’ll finish by setting a challenge for STM in Ruby.</p>

<p>I wrote the first half of my PhD on STM, and the second half on Ruby, so I’ve got quite a bit of experience with both and the idea of their combination is very interesting to me.</p>

<h2 id="why-might-we-want-an-stm">Why might we want an STM?</h2>

<p>Let’s say we’re a bank managing many bank accounts. Each account has a total. We get a never-ending stream of requests to move a sum of money <code>m</code> from an account <code>a</code> to account <code>b</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>

  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Something not everyone may know about Ruby is that <code>x += y</code> is equivalent to writing <code>t = x; x = t + y</code>. We’ll write that out in full to make that clear to ourselves.</p>

<p>We’ve got a lot of transfers to run through, so we’ll have multiple threads processing these transfers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>

<p>We’ve got a few problems here now. With all these threads running at the same time, what happens if two threads are putting money into your account concurrently?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>100</span>

<span># thread 1                        # thread 2</span>
<span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
  <span># balance = 100</span>
                                  <span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
                                    <span># balance = 100</span>
<span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
  <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
                                  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
                                    <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two transfers have run, but your balance is 110. The other 10 has been lost - this is called a <em>lost update</em>, meaning it’s as if the update was never made.</p>

<p>Also consider what happens if the thread crashes after taking money from <code>a</code> but before putting it into <code>b</code>? The transfer would be applied partially and again we’d lose money.</p>

<p>We need to use some kind of <em>synchronization</em> on our accounts. Ruby has <em>mutual exclusion locks</em> or <em>mutexes</em>, so we can try using those.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Does this work? What if we process a transfer from account 1001 to account 1002 on one thread at the same time as processing a transfer from account 1002 to 1001, so the other way around, at the same time?</p>

<p>The first thread will try to lock 1001 and then 1002. The second thread will try to lock 1002 and then 1001. If the first thread gets as far as locking 1001, and the second as far as locking 1002, then both will be waiting for the opposite lock and will never release the lock they already have. We will be in <em>deadlock</em>.</p>

<p>If we always acquired locks in the same order, by collecting them up first and sorting them, we could fix this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>].</span><span>sort</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>y</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now in both transfers account 1001 is locked first and 1002 is locked second. That will work.</p>

<p>We have to make up a somewhat artificial requirement to explain the next issue, but consider if for some good reason we wanted to transfer to one account if we had a lot of money, and a different account if we only had a little money. Maybe if we’re rich this month we donate to charity, otherwise we unfortunately need to save for ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if account balance &gt; 1000
  transfer 10 to charity
else
  transfer 10 to savings
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll talk about accounts <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, now, and a threshold of money <code>t</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>

<p>It’s starting to get very complicated. And this locks more than it needs to - it locks both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> but then only uses one of them. If you use <code>b</code> in the end, ideally another thread could be serving a transfer to <code>c</code> at the same time, but you’ve locked it and it can’t. Imagine if instead of two potential accounts it was thousands and you had to lock them all. Imagine if you couldn’t work out at all which account you’d be transferring to until you started the transfer - then you’d never be able to process two transfers at the same time.</p>

<p>At this point as well we’re likely to start to make errors trying to do all this locking and ordering of locks and things.</p>

<p>Stepping back and taking it all in, we can draw up some requirements for what we need.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>atomicity</em> - that all writes in the transfer are applied or none are applied</li>
  <li><em>consistency</em> - meaning that our data structures are always valid - the total sum of money never changes</li>
  <li><em>isolation</em> - meaning one transfer does not interfere with another</li>
  <li><em>durability</em> - meaning that when applied the transfer is available to all subsequent transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally a library or the language could do this all for us. We’d like to be able to write almost what we originally wrote, but with just an annotation to make the code inside a block atomic, consistent, isolated, and the result durable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>atomically</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is what a <em>transactional</em> memory can let us do. It will automatically monitor what you read and write inside the <code>atomically</code> block, which is a <em>transaction</em>, and will make sure it is either applied fully or not, that the balance of the whole system is always consistent, that transactions do not see the result of each other partially applied, and that writes appear and stay.</p>

<p>It may be implemented using the code we eventually arrived at ourselves, or it could do something else instead. In practice how it is often implemented is that
reads and writes are stored in a log, then at the end the transaction works out if anyone else has written locations that you’ve read. If they have then the values you read are no longer valid, so your transaction <em>conflicts</em> with another, is <em>aborted</em> and retries, reading the locations again. When it eventually does not conflict with any other transactions it is <em>committed</em> and succeeds. This means you don’t need to lock everything up-front, which means you avoid the problem of what happens if you may potentially need every account. Locking everything up-front is called <em>pessimistic locking</em>. We’re moving to <em>optimistic locking</em></p>

<h2 id="the-proposed-stm">The proposed STM</h2>

<p>Koichi’s <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> STM for Ruby, in combination with his proposed <em>ractors</em> (similar to <em>actors</em>) would look like this.</p>

  <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>*</span><span>accounts</span> <span>do</span> <span>|*</span><span>accounts</span><span>|</span>

      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>He’s using a <code>Ractor</code> but you can think of it as a thread for the purposes of this article. Instead of an array of account balances, we now have an array of <code>TVar</code> objects that contain values. A <code>TVar</code> is a <em>transactional variable</em>. Only these variables are transactional - not any other Ruby value you read or write. His design requires that the <code>TVar</code> objects you’re going to use are passed into the <code>Ractor</code>, due to rules about sharing that aren’t relevant for this article.</p>

<p>This looks good, doesn’t it!</p>

<h2 id="a-more-complex-application">A more complex application</h2>

<p>Let’s consider a larger application, in order to illustrate further and to talk about some issues and open questions. The <a href="https://github.com/chrisseaton/ruby-stm-lee-demo">code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s say it’s our job to lay out the wires on a circuit board. We get a board with <em>pads</em> (connections to components mounted on the board) and a list of <em>routes</em> that we need to draw between these pads. There are a great many pads and routes, there isn’t much space on the tiny board, and another catch is that it’s very expensive to have wires crossing each other. Let’s say it’s exponentially more expensive for more deeply stacked wires.</p>

<p>In this minimal example we we can see two routes, and how they have to cross each other.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Most people don’t practice taking ideas seriously. I think it’s because most people don’t know how to. I didn’t either, until I stumbled upon an implication.</p>

<p>For example, what would it mean to take compounding seriously?</p>

<p>Ugh. I can feel your aversion. You’ve already heard so much about compounding, how it works, how it’s the eight wonder of the world, etc. etc.</p>

<p>But, familiarity is not the same as taking it seriously.</p>

<p>Say you start with $100, and every year, make 10% more. This compounds, since the extra money is a function of how much you already have. The more you have, the more you get. It’s a positive loop that keeps on increasing.</p>

<p>That’s the familiar interpretation. The earlier you start, the more money you’ll make.</p>

<p>To take this interpretation seriously would mean investing your earnings for a similar return. <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>, and sometimes assumptions break. You don’t make 10% - which means you need to balance your investments somehow. That makes things complicated. However, this complication is not related to compounding.</p>

<p>Taking compounding seriously means taking it a step further. Your net worth is just one implication. What else compounds?</p>

<p>Your life experiences and knowledge. What would it mean to leverage compounding here?</p>

<p>If you’re taking compounding seriously, you’d learn the skills with the greatest return first. That means learning the broadest applicable skills you’d apply throughout your life first. That means learning how to think well - before learning the new fancy tech you want to learn.</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes you need a medium to learn the skill better. That makes sense: learn to think well via this new tech you wanted to learn. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3HyeNiEpvbQQaqeoH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purposes are fragile</a> though, and it’s easy to get lost in the tool, instead of the overall goal.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>What makes this example so good is that you’re probably very familiar with compounding. What else are you familiar with, but haven’t realised you’re not taking seriously?</p>

<p>A good way to practice this is to ask this question: What are the implications of (idea) in (field of interest)?</p>

<p>For example, asking myself What are the implications of compounding for my self-directed knowledge base led to the above insight of learning broader skills first.</p>

<p>Here at <a href="https://nextlinklabs.com/">NextLink Labs</a>, we couldn't be more excited about this security-minded offering. Being a company located at the heart between <a href="https://nextlinklabs.com/how-we-work">DevOps and Security</a>, we often encounter problems that, up until the release of  Boundary, required much more complicated tools and processes to solve. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/why-we-built-hashicorp-boundary">Boundary is a tool built to make it simple to grant and maintain access to infrastructure</a>. In true HashiCorp fashion, Boundary accomplishes this in a way that can target any sort of infrastructure, including all the major cloud providers, Kubernetes, and on premise infrastructure. </p>
<p>Specifically, this tool enables access from a public user to many types of hosts and services located in a private network, and integrates with many existing Identity Providers such as Okta, Active Directory Federation Services, Active Directory, and more. </p>

<p>Most modern systems have resources located on a private network for which are going to need to be accessed by end users on a public network.  Examples are vast but a few simple ones are databases, web service hosts, kubernetes nodes, or something similar. </p>
<p>In order to grant users outside the network access to these resources, three things need to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>A VPN or Bastion host needs set up as a gateway to bridge connections onto the resources</li>
<li>The connection must be restricted via firewall rules or similar so when you give a user access to the VPN or Bastion host they only have access to the resources they need and not the entire network</li>
<li>Individual credentials for each resource must be shared (DB credentials, ssh keys, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing things this way brings up a few issues with their own challenges that require solving: </p>
<p><strong>Issues with Onboarding and Offboarding Users</strong></p>
<p>Users must be granted a series of credentials and keys at different layers of the system. Not only is this difficult in and of itself, but when you throw in best practices around key rotations, static credentials, and how you handle dynamic infrastructure like auto scaling groups and kubernetes services, it can quickly become too much to handle.</p>
<p><strong>Problematic, Unclear Visibility into Connections</strong></p>
<p>We consider it a security best practice (and oftentimes a compliance requirement) to have visibility into what users and systems are connected where. This sort of access control record needs to be available in logs for security personnel to review.</p>
<p><strong>Difficult Integration and Tooling</strong></p>
<p>Users may need managed in multiple Identity Providers and other systems. Power users who are attempting to use command line tools or other tooling may find it difficult to work within the constraints of the VPN or bastion host setup</p>
<p>Boundary <strong>solves these issues</strong> by abstracting away much of the complexity and changing the way you think about access to system resources.</p>
<h3>How Boundary Makes it Work</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, HashiCorp Boundary was built to make it easy to grant and maintain access to infrastructure. </p>
<p>So what does that look like in practice? </p>
<p>In initiating a boundary connection, 3 things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Boundary replaces individual Ssh keys and credentials with SSO via OpenID Connect. So the first step is to authenticate a user against an existing IDP (Identity Provider) such as Okta or ADFS.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Boundary checks its list of role based access controls to see if the authenticated user has access to the desired resource.</li>
<li><strong>Connection:</strong> Boundary initiates a connection to this resource. It does so via a client side agent that exposes this connection via localhost. Allowing a seamless experience with existing tools as you can work as if the connection is just a localhost connection. For many types of tools, this can also handle the credentials aspect of using a service so your end user never needs to be shared static credentials that may leak or be exposed.</li>
</ol>

<p>To the end user, they are able to use boundary in several different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>CLI</li>
<li>SDK</li>
<li>REST API</li>
<li>User Interface</li>
<li>Desktop application <strong>(coming soon!)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With options for using Boundary that should appeal to both power users and less technical users, Boundary should provide a great user experience that will not only make your operations and security folks happy, but also provide tremendous value to end users.</p>

<h3>The Key Advantages to Boundary</h3>
<p>We think HashiCorp Boundary is a gamechanger for many organizations. </p>
<p>It is truly a tool set up for the future as it’s architecture supports modern cloud architectures. </p>
<p>HashiCorp says that in solving this common problem their users were experiencing (access to resources in a private network from a public network), they fundamentally changed how they think about solving the problem. </p>
<p>Boundary has many advantages over other ways of handling the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access rules</strong> can be setup and handled as code via their <strong>Terraform provider</strong> (provides all the other benefits of Infrastructure as Code)</li>
<li><strong>Policy</strong> is thought of as “which set of users needs access to which set of services” as opposed to IP based access control  - which is brittle, especially in today’s increasingly ephemeral environments</li>
<li><strong>Access to Session Visibility:</strong> Security Administrators are able to monitor and manage privileged sessions and export the session logs into analytics tooling</li>
<li>Promotes a <strong>zero-trust network security model</strong> as it does not trust the private network and does not give unnecessary access to the private network</li>
<li><strong>Makes onboarding and offboarding users a breeze</strong>. You only need to add or remove users to your Identity Provider. You don’t need to set up VPN or SSH access. You don’t need to grant individual user credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrap up</p>
<p>In summary, we believe HashiCorp Boundary to be an excellent addition to many companies' toolchains. It does an excellent job of automating the setup and access of resources, identities, and access controls as code with Boundary’s Terraform Provider, REST API, CLI, and SDK. We think Boundary solves a common problem most organizations have in a way that enables simplicity for its users and operators while keeping security top of mind.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/data-warehousing-glossary/data-enrichment/">Data enrichment</a> is a powerful technique for adding valuable context to your customer data, and it’s simple in theory – given a bit of data about a record (e.g. a user's email or the IP of a web session), tell me more information about it so I can take effective action (e.g. map the email domain to a company or map the IP to a geolocation). In practice, however, it can be difficult to integrate a data enrichment process into an existing ELT pipeline, for a few reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Maintaining Freshness: </strong>How recent are the results being correlated with my data? This may be a function of how often external datasets are loaded or how up-to-date your third-party data provider’s information is.</li><li><strong>Ensuring Consistency: </strong>Once data is enriched with new attributes, can I easily push those attributes to my warehouse and SaaS tools to maintain a synchronized data model?</li><li><strong>Limiting Resource Usage: </strong>Enrichment processes can be expensive in storage costs (to maintain huge third-party data sets), processing time, and API quota usage for paid enrichment services. And enrichment processes shouldn’t unnecessarily repeat the same work over and over again.</li></ul><p>In this post, I’ll share our recipe for enriching our own customer data at Census using the <a href="https://clearbit.com/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Clearbit</a> API, Snowflake External Functions, and <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/product/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">dbt</a> to enrich data correctly and efficiently over large data sets.</p><p>One note before we begin, if you’re new to data enrichment: there’s a key difference between enriching using a dataset and enriching using an API. Some enrichment pipelines make use of third party datasets that can be purchased in their entirety – you can see many examples of these in the <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/data-marketplace/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Snowflake Data Marketplace</a>. This kind of data can be easier to work with because you can rely on your warehouse to efficiently <code>LEFT JOIN</code> to these datasets and materialize the result on a schedule. However, an enrichment API doesn’t give you the full dataset to work with; it replies to your queries (one at a time or in bulk) in a request-reply style to tell you if the API has additional data for the company or person in question. These are more challenging to work with in a data warehousing context, and we built this pipeline so that we can perform both types of enrichment without leaving the comfort of our warehouse SQL environment.</p><h3 id="snowflake-s-external-functions">Snowflake's External Functions</h3><p>External functions are a recentaddition in modern data warehouses. An external function is like a traditional <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/user-defined-functions.html">user-defined function (UDF)</a>, but it allows you to break free of the database sandbox by calling an external handler to calculate results. For example, Redshift has basic support for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_FUNCTION.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">external functions</a> that call Lambda functions to compute their results.</p><p>Snowflake's <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions-introduction.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">external functions</a> call out to an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">AWS API Gateway</a> endpoint to retrieve results, which allows us to connect many different handlers, including Lambda functions. Calls from SQL will be batched into JSON HTTP requests and proxied to the configured handler, which needs to unwrap the batch items, calculate appropriate values, and then return a batch of results as JSON. Setting up a gateway and handlers in AWS for the first time isn’t trivial, but the design allows a lot of flexibility. I won't go through that process in this post but you can read about it in Snowflake's <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions-creating-aws.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">documentation</a>. We automate this using a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Terraform</a> module, which we hope to open source soon.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="main_content">
          <h3>
ChessCaptcha.</h3>

<p>This is a captcha system where the user either recreates the position of the pieces on the board - <em>non chess savvy users</em> - or she solves a mate-in-one puzzle by putting the piece on the square where it gives the checkmate - <em>chess savvy users only</em>. There is also a no-js fallback that exists mostly as a placeholder for future iterations; don't use it.</p>
        </section><section id="usage">
          <h3>
Usage.</h3>

<h4>Copy the position mode. - Default</h4>
<p>
  In this mode which happens to be the one where the user needs no chess knowledge at all to use, he simply drags the pieces
  into the board trying to replicate the position shown in the image.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://elioair.github.io/chesscaptcha/images/chesscaptchausage.gif">
</p>
<h4>Mate in One mode</h4>
<p>
  Here the user is given a position and where he has to move a piece to create a mating position on the board.
  Only chess players -and maybe computer engines. cough..!- will be able to solve this. It can be used for example in chess sites
  to determine if the user is really a chess player or a simple spammer.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://elioair.github.io/chesscaptcha/images/chesscaptchamatemode.gif">
</p>
<h4>Color Tolerance</h4>
<p>
  If needed you can turn on color tolerance. In this case the validation will be color agnostic and for example the white king will be 
  considered equal to the black king.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, I <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">wrote an article about how the SPA pattern has failed to simplify web development</a>. The <em>SPA pattern</em> (Single-Page Apps), I tried to define, was about the React model, which also covers, to a large extent, the model of Vue, Angular, and other frontend frameworks.</p><p>Like any critique, it begs for a prescription and I didn’t give one, other than gesturing toward server-side frameworks like Rails and Django. But I think there are some trends starting to form. I had queued up some time to <em>really dive into the frameworks</em>, but things like <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/12/holly-park.html">walking in parks</a> have taken priority, so here’s just a grand tour.</p><h3 id="opinionated-full-stack-javascript-frameworks">Opinionated full-stack JavaScript frameworks</h3><p>Primarily I’m talking about <a href="https://remix.run/features">Remix</a>, <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/">RedwoodJS</a>, and <a href="https://blitzjs.com/">Blitz.js</a>, though I’m sure there are similar efforts in the non-React world that are relevant. <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> <em>almost</em> falls into this category, but as far as I can tell, it’s still unopinionated about the data layer and most sites that use Next.js are still going to use a separate API stack. But that’s subject to change, because all of these are moving fast.</p><p>It’s interesting to note that Remix, Redwood, and Next are all backed by companies or foundations, and that Blitz is aiming early on to be a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/blitz-js">sponsor-funded project</a>. These projects, I think, are trying to sidestep the “tragedy of the commons” failures of earlier open source, wherein overworked and unpaid maintainers service a large userbase and eventually burn out and abandon the project.</p><p>To take Remix as an example, it re-ties data loading with routes, and then gives the pretty amazing promise of <em>no client side data fetching by default</em>. These frameworks are also <em>opinionated about status codes and caching strategies</em>. RedwoodJS automatically creates an <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial/side-quest-how-redwood-works-with-data">ORM-like interface using GraphQL and Prisma</a>.</p><p>As context, Remix is backed by the folks from <a href="https://reacttraining.com/">React Training</a>, who are also the folks from <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">React Router</a>, which is as much React pedigree as you can get without joining the team at Facebook. Redwood is run by <a href="https://prestonwernerventures.com/">Preston-Werner Ventures</a>, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, a GitHub founder. Next.js is sponsored and heavily promoted by <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, née Zeit.</p><h3 id="turbolinks">Turbolinks</h3><p>It’s worthwhile to just mention <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>. I didn’t use it until this year, and apparently there were issues with it before, but the pitch for Turbolinks 5 is: <em>what is the bare minimum you need to do to get the SPA experience without any cooperation from your application?</em></p><p>So it’s a tiny JavaScript library that sits on top of an existing server-rendered application and replaces full pageloads with SPA-like partial pageloads. Instead of loading a page from scratch, pages are loaded with AJAX, page contents are replaced, and client-side navigation updates your URLs. Basically, it prevents the ‘blink’ of real page transitions and saves on all othe sorts of costs of fully loading a new page. Turbolinks was spawned from the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> project, and works great with Rails but doesn’t require it.</p><p>In terms of power-to-weight for user experience improvements, Turbolinks is a standout: it adds very little complexity and a tiny size impact for a big user experience improvement.</p><h3 id="server-side-state-frameworks">Server-side-state frameworks</h3><p>These are the spiciest new solution. The main contenders are <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Laravel Livewire</a> (in PHP), <a href="https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/">Stimulus Reflex</a> (for Ruby on Rails), and <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> (on Phoenix, in Elixir).</p><p>The pitch here is: <em>what if you didn’t have to write any JavaScript?</em> It sort of hearkens back to the critique of JavaScript in <a href="https://vimeo.com/5047563">_why’s ART &amp;&amp; CODE talk</a>, that web development is the only kind where you normally have to write in three (or more) languages. These languages also most remnants of “client-side” logic, putting it all on the server side.</p><p>How do they do this? Well, a lot of WebSockets, in the case of Reflex and LiveView, as well as very tightly coupled server interactions. As you can see in the <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">LiveView demo</a>, which I highly recommend, these frameworks tend to operate sort of like reactive DOM libraries on the front end – in which the framework figures out minimal steps to transform from one state to another - except those steps are computed on the server side and then generically applied on the client side. They also do a lot more data storage &amp; state management on the server-side, because a lot of those interactions which wouldn’t be persisted to the server are now at least communicated to the server.</p><p>These frameworks are exciting, and also extremely contrarian, because they are the polar opposite of the “frontend plus agnostic API layer” pattern, and they also wholeheartedly embrace the thing everyone tries to avoid: mutable state on the server.</p><h3 id="modest-progressive-enhancement-javascript-frameworks">Modest progressive-enhancement JavaScript frameworks</h3><p>These are typically used “in addition” to the above, but they certainly deserve a shout-out because I think a wide swath of frontend-programming concerns actually only need a tiny hint of JavaScript. But the main caveat is that <em>they assume that you know JavaScript and the DOM</em>, which are not necessarily universal skills anymore. A lot of developers growing up on React have acquired a real blind spot for native browser APIs.</p><p>The main ones I’ve looked at are <a href="https://stimulusjs.org/">Stimulus</a> (out of the Ruby on Rails camp), <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/">Alpine</a>, and <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmlx</a>. They’re all tiny, and work great in <em>existing pages</em>. I think – and here come the flames – <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components</a> also fit into this sphere of progressive enhancement! If you just use good web components - <a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aweb-components+org%3Agithub&amp;type=Repositories">only ones that GitHub writes is a good rule of thumb</a> - then they can fit the role of just improving an existing static UI. It’s where you start to use Web Components as an apples-to-apples replacement for full-fledged frontend frameworks is where things seem to get dicey.</p><p>These frameworks have the luxury of operating on a deeply improved web stack, one with fundamental components like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch()</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver">MutationObserver</a>. These things were previously at the core of the utility of progressive enhancement frameworks, and now they can just be the utilities that those frameworks build on.</p><hr><p>I’m sure that there are additional patterns out there! But these currents all seem strong right now, and it’s fascinating to see some really divergent and adventurous – and common-sense – approaches start to crop up.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Zoom recently announced that they were going to make end-to-end encryption available to all of their users–not just customers.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>This is a good move, especially for people living in countries with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/02/how-and-why-america-was-hit-so-hard-by-covid-19/">inept leadership that failed to address the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and therefore need to conduct their work and schooling remotely through software like Zoom. I enthusiastically applaud them for making this change.</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The end-to-end encryption capability arrives on the heels of their acquisition of <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> in earlier this year. Hiring a team of security experts and cryptography engineers seems like a good move overall.</p>



<p>Upon hearing this news, I decided to be a good neighbor and take a look at their source code, with the reasoning, “If so many people’s privacy is going to be dependent on Zoom’s security, I might as well make sure they’re not doing something ridiculously bad.”</p>



<p>Except I couldn’t find their source code anywhere online. But they did publish <a href="https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper">a white paper on Github</a>…</p>







<h2>Disclaimers</h2>



<p>What follows is the opinion of some guy on the Internet with a fursona–so whether or not you choose to take it seriously should be informed by this context. It is not the opinion of anyone’s employer, nor is it endorsed by Zoom, etc. Tell your lawyers to calm their nips.</p>



<p>More importantly, I’m not here to hate on Zoom for doing a good thing, nor on the security experts that worked hard on making Zoom better for their users. The responsibility of security professionals is to the users, after all.</p>



<p>Also, these aren’t zero-days, so don’t try to lecture me about “responsible” disclosure. (That term is also <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2015/11/19/responsible-disclosure-is-wrong/">problematic</a>, by the way.)</p>



<p>Got it? Good. Let’s move on.</p>







<h2>Bizarre Design Choices in Version 2.3 of Zoom’s E2E White Paper</h2>



<p>Note: I’ve altered the screenshots to be white text on a black background, since my blog’s color scheme is darker than a typical academic PDF. You can find the source <a href="https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper/blob/d3be2a5a3e16be04f1199b92630f180ba79cb51c/zoom_e2e.pdf">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Cryptographic Algorithms</h3>

<p>It’s a little weird that they’re calculating a signature over SHA256(Context) || SHA256(M), considering Ed25519 uses SHA512 internally.</p>



<p>It would make just as much sense to sign Context || M directly–or, if pre-hashing large streams is needed, SHA512(Context || M).</p>

<p>At the top of this section, it says it uses libsodium’s <code>crypto_box</code> interface. But then they go onto… not actually use it.</p>



<p>Instead, they wrote their own protocol using HKDF, two SHA256 hashes, and XChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>



<p>While secure, this isn’t <em>really</em> using the crypto_box interface.</p>



<p>The only part of the libsodium interface that’s being used is <code><a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/927dfe8e2eaa86160d3ba12a7e3258fbc322909c/src/libsodium/crypto_box/curve25519xsalsa20poly1305/box_curve25519xsalsa20poly1305.c#L35-L46">crypto_box_beforenm()</a></code>, which could easily have been a call to <code>crypto_scalarmult()</code>instead (since they’re passing the output of the scalar multiplication to HKDF anyway).</p>







<p>Also, the SHA256(a) || SHA256(b) pattern returns. Zoom’s engineers must love SHA256 for some reason.</p>



<p>This time, it’s in the additional associated data for the XChaCha20-Poly1305. </p>



<p>Binding the ciphertext and the signature to the same context string is a sensible thing to do, it’s just the concatenation of SHA256 hashes is a bit weird when SHA512 exists.</p>



<h3>Meeting Leader Security Code</h3>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1746" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-03/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png" data-orig-size="760,733" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-03" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Here we see Zoom using the a SHA256 of a constant string (“<code>Zoombase-1-ClientOnly-MAC-SecurityCode</code>“) in a construction that tries but fails to be HMAC.</p>



<p>And then they concatenate it with the SHA256 hash of the public key (which is already a 256-bit value), and then they hash the whole thing again.</p>



<p>It’s redundant SHA256 all the way down. The redundancy of “MAC” and “SecurityCode” in their constant string is, at least, consistent with the rest of their design philosophy.</p>



<p>It would be a real shame if double-hashing carried the risk of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/382">invalidating security proofs</a>, or if <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/kmd5.pdf">the security proof for HMAC</a> required a high Hamming distance of padding constants and this design decision also later <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/684.pdf">saved HMAC from related-key attacks</a>.</p>

<p>Wait, you’re telling me Zoom was aware of HMAC’s existence this whole time?</p>

<h2>Enough Pointless Dunking, What’s the Takeaway?</h2>



<p>None of the design decisions Zoom made that I’ve criticized here are security vulnerabilities, but they do demonstrate an early lack of cryptography expertise in their product design.</p>



<p>After all, the weirdness is almost entirely contained in section 3 of their white paper, which describes the “Phase I” of their rollout. So what I’ve pointed out here appears to be mostly legacy cruft that wasn’t risky enough to bother changing in their final design.</p>



<p>The rest of their paper is pretty straightforward and pleasant to read. Their design makes sense in general, and each phase includes an “Areas to Improve” section.</p>



<p>All in all, if you’re worried about the security of Zoom’s E2EE feature, the only thing they can really do better is to publish the source code (and link to it from the whitepaper repository for ease-of-discovery) for this feature so independent experts can publicly review it.</p>



<p>However, they seem to be getting a lot of mileage out of the experts on their payroll, so I wouldn’t count on that happening.</p>

The team consists of ex-employees of Uber, Airbnb, Slack, Coinbase, and Microsoft, and collaborates with their Slack community of 900+ members.</p><p>Tuomas is co-founder of Linear, an engineer and experienced entrepreneur with a strong passion for UX. He previously worked at Uber and helped scale mobile engineering from 15 to 400 engineers. Today, Tuomas explains why the team chooses to build community-first.</p><h2>At what stage of the company did you start an online community and why?</h2><p>We started our online community very early, right about when we launched a private alpha. <strong>We don’t want to build our product in isolation</strong> but want to make sure that we’re as close and aligned with our users as possible. Our belief is that <strong>everyone in our team should be exposed to feedback from our users</strong>. Therefore it was critical to have as many channels of communication as possible to ensure this.</p><blockquote><p>Without a continuous feedback channel like the Slack community, we would probably build the wrong things.</p></blockquote><p>Without a continuous feedback channel like the Slack community, we would probably build the wrong things. <strong>Most of the direction comes from our customers</strong> and the chats that we have with them. If we wouldn’t have the community, we’d still go through a customer list and have daily calls with them to get an idea of what they need and what they're after. But it would certainly be slower, and you wouldn't be able to get a quick overview of what people want. </p><p>I think that <strong>the Slack community is a very fast</strong>-<strong>paced feedback mechanism</strong> for the entire team to get a grasp on what's going on, what's working, and what’s not.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab27779f-a23c-46aa-9109-aaa453f9aa77_972x485.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab27779f-a23c-46aa-9109-aaa453f9aa77_972x485.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab27779f-a23c-46aa-9109-aaa453f9aa77_972x485.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:485,&quot;width&quot;:972,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:308918,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><h2>What platform do you use to run your online community?</h2><p>We used to run our community on Telegram but quickly switched to Slack. Additionally, a lot of feedback comes from forms within the application and from emails from users, which we manage with Front.&nbsp;</p><p>Slack is a great mechanism for fast-paced feedback and discussions. We also get bug reports and user questions in this way. Glancing over it gives everyone <strong>a good grasp on how our users are using Linear</strong> and what areas we still need to improve on.</p><p>The <strong>real-time and casual feel</strong> of Slack makes it great for the job. Using a forum for instance would probably increase the barrier to connect easily. We do get a lot of repeat questions through our channels, which takes time to answer, but that also tells us that we could do a better job at documenting our functionality.</p><h2>How do people find out about the community?</h2><p>The Slack community is <strong>open for all</strong>, but we don’t really promote it anywhere, except for a mention in our welcome email. We do have a prominent entry point in the main menu inside our application, but we probably should do a bit more to guide users to the community.</p><h2>How do you keep your community lively and positive?</h2><p>Not too long ago, we started with channels where people can <strong>introduce themselves</strong>, <strong>share stories</strong> about how they started using Linear, or learn about <strong>how other companies are using Linear</strong> to drive their software development. Most other channels are about providing feedback and feature requests or asking questions about particular functionality. <strong>Our whole team is active in those channels and we try to respond to each discussion.</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ef2146b-918e-435e-beff-7d37f00f6bb4_1080x720.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ef2146b-918e-435e-beff-7d37f00f6bb4_1080x720.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5ef2146b-918e-435e-beff-7d37f00f6bb4_1080x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:650777,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>So far, the discussion has always remained positive and courteous. If discussions were ever to change to be rude, we would have to think about publishing community guidelines and enforcing them. I do believe that the positivity in the community is tightly coupled with how people experience Linear. If that were to change we would first have to <strong>look at our product and see where we’ve messed up</strong> the user experience.</p><blockquote><p>Any question is literally our problem. If people have to ask how things work, then we haven't done a good job in the product to explain it.</p></blockquote><p>The time it takes to reply to everything is really <strong>the only downside</strong>. Then again, you want to spend time with your customers so I don’t see it as something annoying. Any question is literally our problem. If people have to ask how things work, then we haven't done a good job in the product to explain it.</p><h2>How did engagement change when you grew from the first 50 members to a few hundred members?</h2><p>Nothing much has changed really as we’ve grown. Except for the volume of feedback and questions. As mentioned before, it’s our belief that everybody on the team should be exposed to feedback from our customers. So everybody was just active on the channels and responding to questions. But at some point, we realized that <strong>the team could no longer keep up</strong> with the amount of feedback and that this unstructured approach would not scale much further.</p><p>We did want to continue to provide awesome support, so we started building out a <strong>customer experience function</strong> at Linear. This ensures that all questions get answered quickly. Either directly by our customer experience lead or by someone else on the team who gets looped into the conversation. This helps us to continue learning from our users in a more efficient and controlled manner.</p><h2>How do you involve your community in improving your product?</h2><p>We use the feedback from our community as <strong>signals that help us prioritize</strong> what we’re working on. Receiving a lot of feedback of a certain type will make us re-prioritize our work and look into that particular problem field.</p><p>Often we do get feedback on existing functionality that we feel is just a good improvement (or a straight-up bug report). This kind of feedback we <strong>try to address immediately</strong>, in order to constantly ship smaller improvements to our users.</p><blockquote><p>We try to surprise and delight our users every now and then with a more elegant solution than they could have imagined.</p></blockquote><p>For all the other feedback, it's important to <strong>understand the underlying problem</strong>. It is therefore <strong>necessary to dive deeper</strong> instead of literally building what our users ask. A particular feature request might be an indication of a deeper reaching problem or limitation of our application. Coming up with a solution to that underlying problem might have <strong>further-reaching effects</strong> than implementing individual asks. This way we try to surprise and delight our users every now and then with a more elegant solution than they could have imagined.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb19929c3-8a7c-40d8-9907-fb9147cf468f_2045x1088.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb19929c3-8a7c-40d8-9907-fb9147cf468f_2045x1088.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b19929c3-8a7c-40d8-9907-fb9147cf468f_2045x1088.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:775,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:476511,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>We usually do quarterly planning on these kinds of high-level directions for the application. The planning makes sure that we’re addressing the needs of our customers with more complicated <strong>long-term projects</strong> as well.</p><p>For substantial additions, we <strong>select a few customers</strong> and invite them to a private Slack channel. We let them try it out and provide feedback before we ship it to the rest of our users. Sometimes we involve our customers very early on to provide feedback already in the design phase. This is all to make sure that we’re <strong>building something that our users want</strong>.</p><h2>One piece of advice you would give to anyone that is building out an early community around a software startup</h2><blockquote><p>You’re building something for your users and not for yourself.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Invest the time as soon as possible</strong>. You will be in a place where you’re rapidly iterating on the product and working very hard. At that point, spending a lot of time to build up and engaging with a community might feel like a distraction, but <strong>it’s well worth it</strong>. After all, you’re building something for your users and not yourself.</p><h2>What are your plans for the future, as a company in general and with your community?</h2><p>We’re focused on building out <strong>the best application for managing software product development</strong>. We’ve started small and are continuously increasing the footprint of what Linear can do and what kind of companies it can support. Our biggest user segment consists of other startup-ups and our plan is to <strong>grow with them</strong>, supporting them with new functionality as they grow. This will require <strong>continuous communications and the building of our community</strong>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You didn’t have to be an investor, you just had to be <em>alive</em> over the last few decades to know that the stock market is far from a predictable or even stable thing.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp#:~:text=During%20the%20dotcom%20bubble%2C%20the,the%20years%201995%20and%202000.&amp;text=Even%20the%20share%20prices%20of,than%2080%25%20of%20their%20value." target="_blank">The bursting of the “Dotcom Bubble”</a> saw the Nasdaq index peak and then fall more than 76% from March 2000 to October 2002 thanks to speculative investment in seemingly miraculous new “internet companies” that couldn’t deliver on outlandish expectations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Hot on the heels of that meltdown came another — <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" target="_blank">the Great Recession of 2008</a>, triggered by a general lack of regulation in several corners of the financial industry.<br></p><p>Which brings us to today and the most unique crisis that most of us will ever experience — COVID-19. Now considered the herald of the COVID-19 recession, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash" target="_blank">2020 stock market crash, or “Coronavirus Crash,”</a> was a global stock market crash that ran from February 20, 2020, to April 7, 2020, and was the most damaging since the Wall Street Crash of 1929 that kicked off the Great Depression.<br></p><p>If that brief history of economic instability freaked you out a bit, we can’t blame you. But what we <em>can</em> do is help you improve upon one of the few elements of wealth management that you can control — how you choose to allocate your assets to ward off loss through inevitable market fluctuations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So let’s get started by diving a little deeper into the ins and outs of that term “diversification” that we hear so much about and then explore the alternative investments today’s current or aspiring high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) can turn to in order to protect their portfolios.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Why Modern Investors Are Diversifying Into Alternative Investments</h2><p>If the past 20 years have taught us anything about wealth management, it’s that absolutely no single asset class is immune to failing. That’s exactly why modern investors are looking to alternative investment sources to diversify their investment portfolios beyond simple stocks and bonds.<br></p><p>But what exactly does that mean, “diversify”?&nbsp;<br></p><p>When it comes to wealth management, <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/digital-asset-investment">diversification is the process of investing in different types of assets</a> to shield your portfolio from the losses that come with inevitable ups and downs in the stock market. <br></p><p>Diversification actually works <em>because of</em> these natural fluctuations. While every market will flex, it’s extremely unlikely they’ll all flex the same way at the same time — which puts you at less risk of experiencing dramatic losses and in a good position to catch the gains.<br></p><p>Which leads us to our next point: Effective diversification is done with purpose, not by throwing a dart and picking the first asset you hit.<br></p><div><p>A well-diversified portfolio will contain your own unique selection of assets that align with your risk tolerance which still meeting your goals for growth. If you aren’t sure where you stand with your risk tolerance, <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire" target="_blank">try this quiz from Vanguard to help you decide</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, investors who build long-term, carefully-diversified portfolios have a <em>much</em> easier time generating returns and riding out the losses than the high-stakes gamblers who bet all their money on a single asset and often lose big in the stock market.</p></div><p>Next up: Today’s strongest alternative investment types to look for when building your balanced portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Alternative Investments Worth Considering in a Digital-First World</h2><p>Between technological developments and a growing population of <a href="https://www.mx.com/thought-leadership/the-changing-face-of-wealth" target="_blank">adults who are more financially savvy than their predecessors</a>, actively seeking unconventional sources of income, and excited to manage their wealth digitally; we’re witnessing the birth of a new asset class that is changing the investment world.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/digital-asset-investment"><strong>Digital assets are the alternative investment class of the future</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;<br></p><p>While the term “digital asset” can be used to describe digital tokens that represent traditional and even physical assets, in this case we’re talking about assets that exist only in the digital realm.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While digital assets are still a new idea for many investors, they’re just as powerful as any traditional investment asset. Just ask the Winklevoss twins — <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/people/083016/who-are-top-5-bitcoin-millionaires.asp" target="_blank">the world’s first Bitcoin billionaires</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And according to a recent survey of almost 800 financial professionals across the U.S. and Europe, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200609005138/en/Growing-Number-Institutional-Investors-Digital-Assets-Part" target="_blank">institutional investors are very interested in digital assets</a>.<br></p><figure id="w-node-931cd4d59614-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/5f91241956ac2a548b0f0a9e_01-Image%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The most popular digital asset among these investors? Bitcoin — a type of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With that in mind, let’s talk more about cryptocurrency as well as some other popular digital assets you can use to round out your modern investment portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp" target="_blank">Cryptocurrency is digital currency</a> that is secured using cryptography and “backed” by a distributed network of computers. Its decentralized nature means it exists outside the control of any central authority, which increases its transparency but also its general instability (for now).</p><p>Cryptocurrency — often shorted to “crypto” — exists solely in the digital sphere, and it’s leading the way as far as introducing the masses to digital assets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Fidelity has launched a <a href="http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=Fidelity_Digital_Assets" target="_blank">digital assets subsidiary</a>, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/people/083016/who-are-top-5-bitcoin-millionaires.asp" target="_blank">the crypto-focused investment firm</a> Pantera Capital has delivered a 24,000% return to investors, and investment advisory firm <a href="https://medium.com/@HuttCapital/reflecting-on-cambridge-associates-blockchain-investment-research-piece-d06bc3af0469" target="_blank">Cambridge Associates encouraged investors to try digital assets</a> in their report “Cryptoassets: Venture into the Unknown.”<br></p><p>To get started with crypto, do your research and sign up with a credible exchange that enables you to create a crypto “wallet” and start buying and selling coins. But remember, as easy as it is to dive into crypto, it’s also as easy to mess it up. Learn the lingo and get a running start with this overview from Hacker Noon: “<a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-with-cryptocurrencies-76027bebb1b1" target="_blank">A beginner’s guide to getting started with cryptocurrencies</a>.”<br></p><h3>Websites&nbsp;</h3><p>There are <em>billions</em> of websites online — which makes websites a <em>huge</em> asset class when you think about them as an alternative investment resource for your portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you want to invest in websites without making website management your full-time job, the best approach for you is probably buying, improving (or just holding), and “flipping” — to use real estate lingo — any type of website that generates income. Often, these include blogs, digital publications, and ecommerce stores.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To find established (and, ideally, money-making) websites that are for sale, you’ll want to look at online website marketplaces. <a href="https://flippa.com/websites" target="_blank">Flippa is quite common</a> and a good place to start.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Domain Names&nbsp;</h3><p>A little more specific than websites are the domain names upon which they exist.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A domain name is a unique address people use to access a website. For example, the domain name of the website you’re reading this on is “kubera.com.”<br></p><p>To revisit the real estate metaphor, domain names are kind of like land in the fast-growing city that is the internet. As more people want their own space on the internet, the more valuable domain names become.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For investor Igal Lichtman, for example, <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/what-happens-to-your-domains-when-you-die">the value of his domain names would have amounted to almost $75,000</a> for just a handful of some of his smartest investments — <em>if</em> he had properly prepared his beneficiaries to take ownership of his domains (more on that in the next section!).<br></p><p>While there are several ways to generate income from purchasing domain names — developing a website, displaying ads, etc. — the strategy that makes the most sense for someone who’s interested from an investment standpoint is again a buy/hold/sell approach.&nbsp;<br></p><p>GoDaddy, a recognized domain registrar where you can search for and purchase domain names, has a simple guide that will help you start wrapping your head around <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/5-tried-and-true-tips-for-buying-and-selling-domain-names-for-profit/" target="_blank">the process of buying and selling domain names for profit</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id="w-node-52e775ab4ef0-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/5f9124f817272fdbe88f5353_02-Image%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt="HNWI interest in digital assets"></p></figure><p>Remember that these are just some of the most popular digital assets for investors who are just diving into the alternative realm. There are plenty of other options, including trademarks, SaaS platforms, revenue-generating social media accounts, and tons more. In fact, KPMG estimates that <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/03/wealth-managers-can-adapt-to-digital-assets-and-thrive/" target="_blank">there are more than 2,000 digital assets</a> on the market. So if you didn’t click with any of the digital assets we discussed today, stay tuned as we cover more digital assets on our blog in the future — you’re bound to find a good fit for your portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>How to Manage All of Your Alternative Investments</h2><p>While you might be ready for alternative investments, chances are the traditional portfolio management tools you’re used to aren’t up for the challenge.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When you’re ready for a portfolio manager that’s <em>made</em> for the digital world in which we live, turn to Kubera.&nbsp;<br></p><p>At Kubera, we brought together the <a href="https://www.kubera.com/portfolio-tracker">ease of a spreadsheet with the power of high-tech integrations</a> to enable you to manage and optimize every single one of your assets — from traditional investments like stocks and bonds (<a href="https://www.kubera.com/financial-tracking-app">in any currency!</a>) to <a href="https://www.kubera.com/crypto-tracker">alternative assets like crypto, domain names, websites, and more</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And not only that, but <a href="https://www.kubera.com/beneficiary-management">Kubera’s beneficiary management feature also empowers investors</a> to create a secure and streamlined path for passing their investment portfolio down to a pre-determined heir when the time comes.

<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33517721-the-culture-code">The Culture Code</a> by Daniel Coyle starts out with a fascinating example of a bad apple. Here’s a big quote, but I promise it’s worth it.</p>



<blockquote><p>Meet Nick, a handsome, dark-haired man in his twenties seated comfortably in a wood-paneled conference room in Seattle with three other people. To outward appearances, he is an ordinary participant in an ordinary meeting. This appearance, however, is deceiving. The other people in the room do not know it, but his mission is to sabotage the group’s performance.</p><p>Nick is the key element of an experiment being run by Will Felps, who studies organizational behavior at the University of South Wales in Australia. Felps has brought in Nick to portray three negative archetypes: the Jerk (an aggressive, defiant deviant), the Slacker (a withholder of effort), and the Downer (a depressive Eeyore type). Nick plays these roles inside forty four-person groups tasked with constructing a marketing plan for a start-up. In effect, Felps injects him into the various groups the way a biologist might inject a virus into a body: to see how the system responds. Felps calls it the bad apple experiment.</p><p>Nick is really good at being bad. In almost every group, his behavior reduces the quality of the group’s performance by 30 to 40 percent. The drop-off is consistent whether he plays the Jerk, the Slacker, or the Downer.</p><p>“When Nick is the Downer, everybody comes into the meeting really energized. He acts quiet and tired and at some point puts his head down on his desk,” Felps says. “And then as the time goes by, they all start to behave that way, tired and quiet and low energy. By the end, there are three others with their heads down on their desks like him, all with their arms folded.”</p><p>When Nick plays the Slacker, a similar pattern occurs. “The group quickly picks up on his vibe,” Felps says. “They get done with the project very quickly, and they do a half-assed job. What’s interesting, though, is that when you ask them about it afterward, they’re very positive on the surface. They say, ‘We did a good job, we enjoyed it.’ But it isn’t true. They’d picked up on the attitude that this project really didn’t matter, that it wasn’t worth their time or energy. I’d gone in expecting that someone in the group would get upset with the Slacker or the Downer. But nobody did. They were like, ‘Okay, if that’s how it is, then we’ll be Slackers and Downers too.’ ”</p><cite>Daniel Coyle, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33517721-the-culture-code">The Culture Code</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This was a lightbulb moment for me because I see it all the time but I’ve never realized it. </p>



<p>I’ve been in upbeat meetings that were cruising until a downer joined. And I’ve seen miserable Eeyore meetings turn around when an excited person hopped on. </p>



<p>It only takes one Nick. One downer, or one jerk, or one slacker (which often manifests by <em>multitasking</em>). I don’t want to be the Nick. I can’t be the person that brings the group down. </p>



<p>The book goes on to describe an outlier group. Nick couldn’t bog this group down, because it had Jonathan. Jonathan was so good at encouraging and jelling the team that Nick didn’t have an effect. Nick even found himself being helpful almost against his will.</p>



<p>My resolution is to either be the Jonathan, or leave the meeting. If I can’t help but be the Nick, then I shouldn’t be there. They’re better off without me. Jonathan or bust!</p>

<![CDATA[The On-Demand Communication Fallacy]]>

October 28, 2020 | https://curvedlayer.com/2020/10/20/internal-communication.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://curvedlayer.com/2020/10/20/internal-communication.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Well established communication is the most critical factor for the team to work. Without sharing information, we can’t get anything done.</p>

<p>Poorly designed communication brings more harm than any other inefficient process. Let’s take Slack as an example. Slack made it effortless to ask anyone in the team at your convenience. You don’t know the date of the next release? You’re one question away from knowing it.</p>

<p>Although this is a powerful concept, there are numerous downsides to it. Instead of surfacing relevant information, we “actively query” knowledge from humans on-demand.</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-on-demand-communication">Problems with on-demand communication</h3>
<p>Active Information Seeking is commonly used in social media. With algorithms forming the feed, new and engaging content is always there for you. No matter when you open the app.</p>

<p>Real-time chat apps are using a similar model. Except in the team environment, you don’t need “engaging” content. All you need is painless access to your colleagues.</p>

<h4 id="1--remote-teams">#1 – Remote Teams</h4>
<p>Having the team spread around the world immediately breaks an on-demand information querying model. You can’t rely on people being available whenever you are. You no longer have the luxury to ask people anytime.</p>

<p>A lot of US companies embraced Remote work but only within the US. <span>Limiting communication to a time zone doesn’t solve the fundamental problem. It just removes some symptoms.</span></p>

<p>In the remote environment, communication flow should not depend on individuals. It decreases the overall resilience of the team and slows everyone down.</p>

<h4 id="2--idle-time">#2 – Idle Time</h4>
<p>The time you spend asking people is the time that could be invested better. The time you wait for their response is even more precious. If you value time and speed, on-demand communication should not even be the option.</p>

<p>I’m not even talking about the effects of this model on other people in the team. Every message (information query) sent could break someone else’s flow. And coming back to the flow state would require additional effort + time.</p>

<h4 id="3--pressure--anxiety">#3 – Pressure &amp; Anxiety</h4>
<p>Heavy reliance on real-time communication brings additional emotional pressure. It is especially true for remote teams. There’s no way to know what the person on the other end feels. What might seem like a “friendly question” could be a distraction for others.</p>

<h3 id="passive-consumption--active-seeking">Passive Consumption &gt; Active Seeking</h3>
<p>The opposite of active on-demand communication is passive information consumption. With heavy reliance on systems, passive consumption guarantees relevant information is distributed to the right people at the right time. Setting up passive consumption for a team requires you to look at overall operations on the meta-level. Define who needs what and when.</p>

<p>The marketing team might need to know about the new feature release at least three weeks in advance. Or support engineers might need to know about bug fix deployment right away.</p>

<p>This way, you can set up processes to let relevant information come to people. Instead of people searching for relevant information themselves.</p>

<p>There are a few tools based on this model. For example, <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a> and <a href="http://mailmanhq.com/">Mailman</a> allow choosing the terms for receiving relevant information. No matter when this information became available.</p>

<h3 id="fundamentals-of-information-logistics">Fundamentals of Information Logistics</h3>
<p>The idea of passive information consumption is based on information distribution rules. There are five core principles for information logistics. Each piece of circulating information needs to be examined against them.</p>

<p>It’s important to mention these concepts below aren’t isolated from each other. That means each of them defines the others.</p>

<h4 id="what-kind-of-information">What kind of Information?</h4>
<p>First, it’s important to define the actual knowledge you want to distribute. It can be the date of the upcoming release or feedback from customers, bug reports, etc. Not everything has to be delivered passively.</p>

<h4 id="who-needs-the-information">Who needs the Information?</h4>
<p>When the type of information is defined, it’s time to understand who needs to get it. How to select those people? A good approximation would be answering those questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How motivated are they to get the information?</li>
  <li>How much their duty depends on the information?</li>
  <li>What difference would it make if they won’t get the information?</li>
</ul>

<p>For passive consumption to work, you have to clearly define recipients. But it’s also important not to make the information fully exclusive. There might be other motivated people in the team that you didn’t include.</p>

<h4 id="when-information-is-needed">When Information is needed?</h4>
<p>You have “what” and “who” the next piece is “when”. Different kinds of information should be delivered at different times, depending on the recipient. For example, deploy of the critical bug fix could be delivered instantly. While information about upcoming releases can be delivered in weekly batches.</p>

<p>Determining the right time ensures that the recipient will consume the information. One of the reasons on-demand communication doesn’t work is because the time when the question is asked isn’t comfortable for the person answering.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-right-form-of-information">What’s the right form of Information?</h4>
<p>The form in which you deliver information plays an important role too. Some people prefer information presented visually, while others like long text messages. The same information can be presented as a presentation, visual diagram, text message, charts, etc. It’s another step to ensure the content you share is consumed.</p>

<p>Because sending the long document hoping people read it doesn’t guaranty anything. You can have all the information in the world in one Google Doc, but it would be impossible to read.</p>

<h4 id="what-delivery-channel-to-use">What delivery channel to use?</h4>
<p>Just like the form of information ensures readability, the channel you use to deliver knowledge ensures receivability. Some people prefer Slack messages, emails, or even Issues on GitHub as information delivery channels. It’s up to the recipient to determine which channel would work best for them.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-setup-passive-consumption">How to setup Passive Consumption?</h3>
<p>You can automate pretty much everything with tools like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and recently launched <a href="https://www.ahoyteam.com/">AhoyTeam</a>. Including information distribution at the right time and through comfortable channels.</p>

<p>Actual technical implementation depends a lot on the tools your team uses. For example, do you host your code on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab? Are you using Slack, Twist, or Microsoft Teams? What do you use for Task Management?</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Passive information consumption has many upsides compared to on-demand communication. If you noticed, with the on-demand communication model, there is little or no consideration of other people’s preferences. While in passive consumption, other people’s preference is the only thing that makes the system work.</p>

<p>It takes time to set up, analyze the information flow, define interested people, etc. But the gain is a calmer, more efficient workplace where people do not bother each other for no reason.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-url="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/okrs-vs-kpis-explanation-with-examples-for-engineering-teams" data-title="OKRs vs. KPIs: explanation with examples for Engineering Teams.">
<p><em>OKRs vs. KPIs, what are the differences?</em> That’s a common question I hear from managers of Engineering Teams. KPIs are more straightforward to explain than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR">OKRs</a>, which can be tricky and more complex. They don’t mean the same, although they are connected.</p>



<h2>What are KPIs?</h2>



<p><strong>KPI stands for Key Performance Indicators.</strong> In other words, KPIs are a set of metrics that should give you an overview of the area or team’s performance. They need to be measurable and comparable.</p>



<p>If you look at many KPIs, they’re not fulfilling their purpose. Organizations should select as few as possible so that tracking the progress is possible. Besides, all the significant changes in process and company goals should impact the numbers.</p>



<p>Then, managing an area or a team becomes more tangible: when the KPIs show poor performance, it’s time to act. The actions taken should reflect better numbers; otherwise, managers need to find another strategy and act differently.</p>



<h2>What are OKRs?</h2>



<p><strong>OKRs stands for Objective Key Results</strong>. It’s a managing methodology that is popular in Silicon Valey. It’s been widely adopted by companies and startups at scale. It’s also seen as an alternative or complement for strategic planning.</p>



<p>OKRs’ primary purpose is to define Objectives that must align with the business and a set of Key Results. Each Key Result needs to have a measurable number as the goal and a limit date. The limit date means that the goal should be achieved within that time frame.</p>



<h2>What’s the difference between KPIs and OKRs?</h2>



<p><strong>KPIs provide an overview of the area or team for managers, whereas OKRs must focus on its future.</strong> That said, it becomes clear that KPIs are a controlling tool, and OKRs intend to change an organization’s status quo and keep track of its progress by periodic assessment meetings.</p>



<p>It’s crucial to have that in mind when choosing the KPIs and the OKRs. Otherwise, they become useless and can even play against business goals. Let’s see some examples of them</p>



<h2>Examples of OKRs and KPIs for Engineering Teams</h2>



<p>Below there is a list of KPIs examples. However, you can find more examples in my article&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/software-engineering-kpis-how-to-choose-the-best-fitting-metrics">Software Engineering KPIs: how to choose the best fitting metrics</a>.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Deploy Frequency</strong>: it’s a sum of the <a href="https://thenewstack.io/measuring-engineering-velocity-deploy-frequency-as-a-vital-sign-of-devops-health/">number of deploys made by day</a>, week, or month, depending on the organization’s need.&nbsp;<em>It shows how frequently the team — or area — delivers value to the final user</em>.</li><li><strong>Time to Merge</strong>: it measures the number of days a Pull Request remains open or under review. You can find an average or, as I prefer, see the 75th percentile of all pull requests closed in a given period.&nbsp;<em>It shows how performant is the team</em>.</li><li><strong>Time to Recover</strong>: how much time does the application is inaccessible after an error?&nbsp;<em>This metric tells a lot about how engineering teams respond to failures.</em></li></ul>



<p>When thinking of OKRs, Engineering Teams may consider Objectives such as:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Improving the Time to Market of new features</strong></li><li><strong>Lessen the Churn rate of the product</strong></li></ul>



<p>Here are some possible Key Results for&nbsp;<strong>Improving the Time to Market of new features</strong>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase the Deploy Frequency to 37/week until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. Assuming you deploy less than 37 times a week currently, increasing the frequency means you’re delivering more. Delivering more is crucial to achieving a more competitive Time to Market.</li><li><strong>Reduce the 75th percentile of Time to Merge to 3 days until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. Instead of the Median or Average, I prefer using the 75th percentile for Key Results. In other words, it means that 75% of the Pull Requests must be merged up to 3 days after they were opened. The team can achieve it by opening lighter pull requests or engaging in collaborators’ pull requests instead of working on a new work item.</li></ul>



<p>For the second object,&nbsp;<strong>Lessen the Churn rate of the product</strong>, let’s assume you know the primary source of churn comes due to a high number of errors in the application. Then, the Key Results could include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reduce the number of Technical Debts to 15 until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. Let’s say you have 30 Technical Debts currently. It’s a 50% improvement. There are many chances that improving the codebase will positively affect the churn rate and help in the KR of the previous Objective. The cleaner the code, the better it embraces the changes. It means you can reduce the churn and also achieve better Time to Market by gardening your codebase.</li><li><strong>Reduce the Mean Time to Recover to Recover (MTTR) to 3 minutes until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. The team needs to monitor application outages, connectivity problems, 503 errors, and other failures to ensure end-users’ experience is not impacted with more than 3 minutes of instability.</li></ul>



<h2>In short,</h2>



<p>KPIs and OKRs are not the same. They have different purposes. KPIs aim to give managers an overview of how the team or area is working, whereas OKRs focus on providing the team a direction and then tracking its progress.</p>



<p>I presented some examples of KPIs and OKRs for Engineering Teams to illustrate the difference. SourceLevel provides lots of metrics, which may include your KPIs.

      <article>
  
  <div>
        <p>For the past few months I’ve been thinking about how to persuade some of the top philanthropists, investors and thinkers to work on an idea alongside me.</p><p>These ideas aren’t focused on problems that I’ve typically tried to tackle in the past. They’re focused on some of the most significant problems facing the world today: carbon removal, longevity, artificial intelligence, biotech, battery technology... to name a few.</p><h2 id="why-these-challenges">Why these challenges?</h2><p>Now in my early thirties, I want to focus on what I believe are some of the biggest challenges facing the world today. Using everything that I’ve learned over the past decade of launching startups, building machine learning algorithms, and connecting with people that are much smarter than me.</p><p>Seeing initiatives such as the <a href="https://earthshotprize.org/">Earthshot Prize</a>, <a href="https://schmidtfutures.com/">Schmidt Futures</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1284531841651752960?s=21">Chamath’s ‘climate action’ call</a>, I feel there’s never been a better time to focus on the biggest challenges we face as humanity.</p><p>Over the next few months I’ve set myself the challenge of scoping out a solution to these challenges that is worth exploring, then to partner with a domain expert, and start to raise funding.</p><p>So how should I go about building a compelling case?</p><h2 id="creating-good-ideas-clear-thinking-is-clear-writing">Creating good ideas: clear thinking is clear writing</h2><p>You might have seen my <a href="https://st.im/what-i-learned-reading-every-amazon-shareholder-letter/">recent post</a> on how I read every one of Amazon's shareholder letters.</p><p>I chose Amazon for a reason.</p><p>Founder &amp; CEO, Jeff Bezos, is an excellent storyteller. His writing is concise, articulate and authentic. It's rare to find someone who can convey their thinking, mission and vision as articulately as Bezos can. And he places a high level of importance on the skill at Amazon.</p><p>Bezos has been able to instil, defend and evolve his company's thinking and behaviour for two decades, ever since its founding. The only ideas that can survive for that long are the ones that are packaged memorably enough -- and memorably packaging ideas in just a few choice words has long been one of Bezos' strengths.</p><p>One of the most important takeaways I found whilst reading through his shareholder letters was Amazon's use of 'six-page narratives', alongside their 'no PowerPoint' rule.</p><blockquote><em>We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of “study hall.” Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely. Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum.</em></blockquote><p>Bezos goes onto explain what makes a good memo:</p><blockquote>Here’s what we’ve figured out. Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! They’re trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks, and we’re not coaching them right. The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can’t be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that a great memo probably should take a week or more.</blockquote><p>Writing these narratives, or stories, forces those at Amazon to think through their ideas in high-resolution detail. Instead of wasting time with impromptu brainstorming sessions, writing memos ensures that group discussion is based on the critical review of the relevant ideas, not on hypotheticals.</p><p>Most importantly, it makes it impossible to hide any logical inconsistencies in the ideas that people put out there. By imposing a rigorous, standardised template on the process of idea generation at Amazon, Jeff Bezos raises the bar and raises the quality of his team's thinking.</p><h2 id="stories-have-long-been-fundamental-to-the-human-experience">Stories have long been fundamental to the human experience</h2><p>Stories are vivid, coherent and memorable – and are crucial to how we interact with the world. Although the term ‘story’ conjures images of fairy tales and myths, there is little that occurs in our lives around which we do not attempt to weave a narrative. Stories cater to our need for sense-making and our desire to observe causality. In one form or another, they underpin most human decisions.</p><p>One particular model of decision-making – explanation-based theory – emphasises that in certain conditions, individuals start their decision process by developing a causal model to explain the available evidence. To rationalise it, in other words, and put otherwise potentially abstract data into context. In this model, the story that has been created informs the ultimate decision as much as the standalone evidence.</p><p>Trial jurors are more likely to be persuaded by evidence if it is presented in the order of a logical story than if the same evidence is shown in random order. What’s more, the story each individual develops around the evidence will be unique and dependent on their own characteristics, beliefs and experience.</p><p>The juror example is useful when considering the role of narratives in investment decision making. Explanation-based theory is particularly applicable when decisions are large and complex, as investment decisions often tend to be. In fact, investment decision-making is a domain in which stories assume a particular importance in driving, informing and justifying conclusions.</p><p>There are two key reasons for this:</p><p>Complexity: narratives aid our comprehension There is intricacy and complication even in the simplest of investments, and if we start to consider the innovation and product proliferation that have come to define the industry, many investments can be fairly considered unfathomable. Stories are important in allowing investors to both simplify and justify decisions. </p><p>Uncertainty: startups, by definition, are risky. There are many things founders simply can’t plan for. Our surest means of coping with the discomfort is to manufacture meaning by forging a relationship between the data and an explanation – a story, in other words – of why the data is what it is and how it got that way.</p><p>Most investors won’t make a decision without it being supported by some form of story, and that’s understandable; stories are effective and can be very valuable. Now with the pandemic meaning in-person meetings are on hold, crafting a narrative -- with clear supporting evidence -- seems to be the best way for me to forge a connection with any potential investor.</p><p>Using Amazon’s narrative format, I'm sharing some ‘six-pagers’ that will hopefully start to lay the foundations for the next chapter of my life.</p><p>If you’ve read this blog before, you’ll know I'm a fan of networked thought, using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> on a daily basis.</p><p>They've just rolled out a new feature, Obsidian Publish; which, in essence, is a public notebook. I thought it would probably make most sense to share my own <a href="http://publish.obsidian.md/stim">six-page narratives</a> on there.</p><p>I'm still working on them as we speak, so you're getting a pretty raw insight into my thinking, as well as how I formulate or tackle problems.</p><p>I hope you’ll follow me as I start out on this new journey.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603826118326/xmu8PEoSf.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>I just recently started my graduate role 🥳 at  <a target="_blank" href="https://ampersandcommerce.com/">Ampersand UK</a> and it's been amazing, (PS. That is why I have been MIA from blogging) however, prior to that I was involved in a few extracurricular activities before starting my job. Today I want to talk about a few facts I appreciate knowing before starting my tech career. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ox8sJtZb5lw">Listen to me</a>  read the post to you</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fact number 1</strong>, there is a tech community, that is generous, willing and happy to help, or share their ideas and expertise in a wide variety of non-technical and technical topics. If you are like me and have been under a rock, doing things by yourself and not quite finding a community to encourage you in your journey. This would be particularly relieving to know, because, I don't know what it is about seeing people in positions I aspire to be? But for me, it gives me a sense of hope that I can achieve what I set out to do. It's great to know that I am not in this alone! In irony, I was never 😃, I just decided to stick my head out a little and it's paid off tremendously. </p>

<p><strong>Fact number 2</strong>, Mentors are important! For the most part of my journey, I have had what I would refer to as <em>online mentors</em>. People who I haven't met, but I have spent time with their work. Engaging with it and taking away little gems that have helped me one way or the other. But do you know what would have even been more helpful? Having a physical mentor, that I could have both formal and informal conversations with. Someone who is a friend and mentor, who has way more life and work experience than I have. I really do believe having this sort of relationship in your life is mutually beneficial to both mentor and mentee. If you have one atm you are very lucky!</p>

<p><strong>Okay fact number 3</strong> I did mention at the start that I was involved in some extracurricular activities before I started my job. These included</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteering to teach kids how to code</li>
<li>Contributing to open source projects </li>
<li>Starting a  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mycodinghabits/">technical page</a>  on Instagram </li>
<li>Mentoring and</li>
<li>Technical writing as seen on this blog etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually enjoyed doing all of these extracurricular activities, because It was fulfilling. I was spreading knowledge that was extremely helpful to people that needed the help, support, general information or source of inspiration. It felt purposeful, knowing I was serving others in a way that added value.</p>

<p><strong>Fact number 4</strong> is a bit of a debatable fact! Some say to prove yourself in the workplace you have to go <em> <strong>'Above and beyond'</strong></em>  to impress both your colleagues and employer. Others say it's a <strong><em>9-5 no more no less</em></strong>, I am sure you have also heard <strong><em>work smart not hard</em></strong>, and the debate goes on. I was still on the fence on this one until I read an article by <a href="https://hashnode.com/@victoria">Victoria Lo</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://lo-victoria.com/become-a-better-developer-with-self-care">self-care tips</a>  for developers. And I had an <em>Aha moment</em> 🤓, it made sense. The keyword with the whole idea of work-life balance is the word <strong><em>BALANCE</em></strong>. I believe there are grey areas with this concept and it can't be a sharp contrast between managing both your life and work because sometimes one might require more attention than the other. And as professionals we have to adhere to the different demands accordingly, but in this case do it acknowledging the human also needs to be taken care of in order to perform at their most optimal level.</p>

<p><strong> Finally the money fact </strong> I bet a good number of us did not negotiate the salary offer for your first job? 🙋🏾‍♀️ I didn't as well, not necessarily a bad thing, I bet given better knowledge, circumstance, experience or understanding you could have. But what's great about this fact is I can start doing specific things that would help my chances of getting a raise on the job or better feedback. Someone once said if you don't document it, it never happened, and if it never happened there would not be any strong basis for negotiation or solid feedback that is essential for my growth. So a few things I now know to implement towards this fact is</p>
<ul>
<li>To document my progress on the job and how my work might be improving the business or even helping my team in general.</li>
<li>By doing this, scheduled 1:1s with my team lead would be more practical and intentional. This way, asking for feedback or opportunity for growth would be easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons I love where I work is that, this practice of documenting and organizing 1:1s is done using a platform called  <a target="_blank" href="https://lattice.com/">Lattice</a>. With a tool like this, there is a lot of transparency, and its good practice not only for negotiating your salary, but for adding to your career growth, and also appreciating other peoples work in and outside your team.</p>
<p>Is there any other <strong>fact/advise you would like to share with me?</strong> Please write them in the comment section. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Engage with my post </strong> ==&gt; I promise you it cost nothing</li>
<li><strong> Comment below your thoughts </strong> ==&gt; I would really like to hear them</li>
<li><strong> Share with others </strong> ==&gt; lol don't be stingy!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Software is eating the world, and community is eating software</p>

<p>In no particular order, a few predictions for community in the 2020s.</p>

<p>💪 <strong>Community will continue to be a broad term</strong>, but finally people and companies will fully grasp that an audience does not mean the same thing as a community.</p>

<p>🪑 <strong>Community will finally get a seat at the table</strong>, following in the footsteps of customer success from a decade ago. Community will become its own department within orgs, leading to more Heads of Community, Chief Community Officers, and other community leadership roles.</p>

<p>✨ <strong>Continued specialization of roles in community.</strong> Community Manager will turn into Community Engagement, Community Marketing, Community Support, Community Success, etc.</p>

<p>🙋 <strong>And then we’ll see other roles start to merge under community.</strong> Community, customer support, and customer success will overlap and start to blend together. Traditional CS roles will still exist, but more ‘low-level’ support will be offloaded to communities and community teams.</p>

<p>📈 <strong>More and more companies will invest in community early</strong>, hiring their first community roles in their first 10 or 20 employees. Community will be standard for startups started in the 2020s.</p>

<p>💼 <strong>The unbundling of LinkedIn.</strong> What Dribbble is to designers, we’ll see for nurses, marketers, community managers, and every other career vertical, providing community, ‘portfolios’, and better job hunting experiences tailored to the specific type.</p>

<p>🎁 <strong>The unbundling of Reddit.</strong> Every subreddit will get its own dedicated community app, built specifically to serve the unique needs of that vertical. Vertical specificity will win out over general community platforms.</p>

<p>🚗 <strong>Community-driven versions of existing products</strong> and services will continue to be built, eventually taking over those who built without community. See Public vs Robinhood.</p>

<p>📣 <strong>Interactive audio and audio communities</strong> will continue to grow. Spotify will enter the market with their own offering, or acquire an existing player similarly to when they initially entered podcasting.</p>

<p>🕺 <strong>We’ll see innovation in the community platform space.</strong> Everything right now looks like some form of forum or ‘Slack for community’. We’ll see platforms that rethink the idea of community from the ground up, in less structured ways than ‘forums’.</p>

<p>🌍 The explosion of remote work will continue to drive <strong>a greater need for community at every level, online and offline</strong>, locally and globally. Expect more companies to build verticals in Nextdoor’s space.</p>

<p>🤑 <strong>Companies will continue to acquire communities</strong> as starting points for their own. See Outreach + Saleshacker, Stripe + Indiehackers, and DigitalOcean + Scotch.</p>

<p>💡 <strong>More and more companies will build communities of interest</strong>, rather than just customer &amp; support communities. This will enable their communities to reach a wider audience, and ultimately be seen as revenue generators rather than cost centers.</p>

<p>💬 <strong>A number of independent communities will turn into full-fledged businesses</strong> and media ‘empires’ as they grow beyond the community they started with.</p>

<p>🛠 <strong>Consolidation of tools.</strong> We’re currently in a golden age of community, engagement and event tools, but over the next decade we’ll see major players start to lead, acquire competitors, and ultimately ‘win’. We’ll also see existing companies (Salesforce, Slack, etc) invest more in community by acquiring companies that are being built right now.</p>

<p>🙊 <strong>Increased innovation will occur in the moderation space.</strong> As community gets elevated in organizations, companies will finally want to invest in tools to help make moderation easier and less dependent on pure manpower.</p>

<p>🏢 <strong>Companies will treat their internal teams more like communities</strong>, and there will be an expansion of internal community teams, especially at cos with 1,000+ employees. Remote-first companies will set this trend, needing to be more intentional about fostering internal community.</p>

<p>👋 <strong>Continued normalization of internet friends</strong>, people that you met in online communities rather than in-person. This has been normal for a decade or more in the gaming world, but it will bleed over to professional friends and relationships.</p>

<p>🏃‍♀️ <strong>In-person events will come back quickly post-Covid</strong>, but they will be smaller and more intimate, focusing on genuine connection. It will be a while before we see large 500+ person events and conferences again.</p>

<p>📆 <strong>Companies will continue to invest in online events</strong> and engagement as they realize how much larger of a reach they can achieve for lower cost and overhead. In-person conferences will adopt hybrid models, offering virtual access in addition to their physical locations.</p>

Converting from road to air mode (or vice versa) takes between five and ten minutes.</p><p>The Liberty runs on normal gasoline, and has a range of 1315 km (817 miles) on the road. In the air, it can fly 400 – 500 km (250 – 310 milles), and can remain airborne for 4.3 hours.</p><p>The PAL-V Liberty weighs 664 kg (1464 lbs) when empty. Its fuel tank holds 100 liters. The tank of a Honda Accord, just by way of comparison, holds about 53 liters.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><h2>Already 30 orders for this Dutch flying car</h2><p>According to the company, about thirty Dutch residents have already ordered and paid for the Liberty. The list price is just under €500,000 ($587,000).</p><p>At the moment, the granted permission is only for a single vehicle. That means PAL-V cannot yet put their car into full production.&nbsp;The Netherlands Vehicle Authority first needs to ensure that the company can produce every vehicle according to the same quality standards.</p><p>PAL-V has been working on the Liberty since 2007. The European Aviation Safety Agency is still examining the company’s request to have the vehicles certified to fly. The company expects this permission to arrive in 2022.</p><p>The US state of New Hampshire <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/auto/features/article/this-is-the-first-state-in-us-to-allow-flying-cars-on-public-roads/634621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made it legal to drive flying cars on public roads</a> in August of this year.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>See a video of the PAL-V Liberty driving <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/yIjSaEeO2l0" target="_blank">here</a>, and flying (briefly) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/fFW_0C7yFCI" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1024x512.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-360x180.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1320x660.jpg 1320w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty.jpg 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="537" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1024x537.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-360x189.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1320x693.jpg 1320w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car.jpg 1408w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-1024x538.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-360x189.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>For a weekly summary of the latest psychology news, subscribe to our <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/the-psych-news-weekly-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psych News Weekly newsletter</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Global warming is quite possibly the greatest challenge we have ever faced.</p><p>A solution involves not only understanding most branches of science, but economics, politics and, more generally, human behaviour. </p><p>To date, even with our advanced technologies, planet earth's climate seems to remain beyond our control.</p><p><a href="https://st.im/six-page-narratives-tackling-worlds-biggest-challenges/">Last week I wrote</a> about the fact that I’ve started to spend a lot of time thinking about some of the biggest challenges we face as humanity. My goal being to narrow these challenges and dedicate the next decade of my life toward realising some of the potential solutions. </p><p>To help me kickstart, I’m publicly writing a series of Amazon-style <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/stim/Public+Obsidian/Six-pagers">six-page memos</a> that I will send to investors, philanthropists and potential co-founders with the ultimate goal of seeing if they’d like to partner, and tackle one of these challenges alongside me.</p><p>So how do I go about it? It won’t be easy, especially in fields where I have limited ‘applied’ or academic experience. I’m using these memos as a stepping stone toward real world experiments, hopefully validating some of my hypotheses.</p><p>Today, there’s an abundance of free information. What remains scarce is insight. Choose any non-trivial topic X, and a cursory Google search will give you evidence for both X and NOT (X). </p><p>So how do you find out what’s really true in the world of climate change? </p><p>That’s where <a href="https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/">thinking from first principles</a> comes in. The basic idea behind this is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up. I’ve found it to be one of the best ways to learn to think for myself, unlock creative potential, and move from linear to non-linear results.</p><p>Over the years there’s been so much fake news from vested interests, and well-meaning but conflicting reports about climate change. Couple this with the fact that attempting to solve it is hugely complex, with many interdependencies. Crafting a meaningful solution will mean not only exploring and understanding most branches of science, but economics, politics and, more generally, human behaviour. </p><p>By breaking each of these down to their basic elements it should help me understand them more thoroughly. Allowing me to build my own ground truths, and focus on the right stuff.</p><p>Why have I <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/stim/Public+Obsidian/Climate+Change">started</a> with climate change? </p><p>Simple: time, and the lack of it. </p><p>Scientists are telling us that on current trends by the middle of this century, vast swathes of the world will be experiencing uninhabitable temperatures for weeks on end. In essence, making them no-go zones. &nbsp;This means the next decade is make or break. </p><p>Thankfully, climate change is starting to gain some real attention. </p><p>People are increasingly paying attention to the fact that:</p><ol><li>We’re experiencing unprecedented lethal <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/heatwaves#tab=tab_1">heat waves</a>. It’s simply getting too hot and too humid for humans to be able to survive in many places.</li><li>Our largest physical structures; ice caps, coral reefs, and rainforests are disappearing before our eyes. Sea levels are rising, literally making the habitable world smaller.</li><li>There will be an <a href="https://www.climateforesight.eu/migrations-inequalities/environmental-migrants-up-to-1-billion-by-2050/">estimated 200 million - 1 billion</a> climate refugees in this century alone. This number of people on the move will be hugely destabilising.</li><li>When you factor in the cost of the environmental damage caused by our continued use of fossil fuels, &nbsp;it makes no economic sense to generate power in the way we have historically. The price of a solar panel, for example, has fallen 90 percent.</li></ol><p>The climate sector has also grown dramatically over the last few years. </p><p><a href="https://lowercarboncapital.com/">LowerCarbon Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.primeimpactfund.com/">Prime Impact</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.palebluedotventures.com/">PaleBlueDot</a> all launched. And several corporates have also announced their corporate venture funds tackling decarbonisation. Many more made net zero commitments.</p><p>Initiatives such as the <a href="https://earthshotprize.org/">Earthshot Prize</a> are attracting some of the world’s smartest thinkers. Chamath Palihapitiya also <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1284531841651752960?s=21">announced</a> the allocation of a “few billion” to solve the problem. He <a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/chamath-palihapitiya/">said recently</a> that he believes the world’s first trillionaire will be someone involved in developing technologies to combat climate change.</p><p>When it comes to philanthropy, there is no one better versed than Bill Gates in understanding how to prioritise dollar impact to maximise lives improved or saved. He’s <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/How-to-Avoid-a-Climate-Disaster">just announced</a> a new book ‘<em>How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need’</em>. </p><p>So the foundation of a meaningful climate change ecosystem is already here.</p><p>This enables the “crazy ones”, or “the ones who see things different” to innovate, to think outside of the box, and to find the support and freedom to dedicate themselves to discovering solutions. </p><p>There’s going to be quite a few footnotes in this post. A lot of people who are much smarter than me have spent a lot of time figuring stuff out. I’m hoping that I’ll be able to stand on the shoulders of these giants. With a set of fresh eyes, and the ignorance that only someone new to the space can have. </p><p>Let’s see if I can connect some dots, and pull together a plan. </p><p>In the remainder of this post, I’m going to cover the basics of climate change, as well as how I’m thinking of approaching it — with scenario planning and probabilistic forecasting. Finally we’ll look at the most promising areas of research in 2020. </p><p>If you're interested, I'd recommend bookmarking the <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/stim/Public+Obsidian/Climate+Change">climate change six-pager</a> —over the next couple of weeks I'll be working on it. With the goal of sending it as soon as possible. </p><h2 id="what-factors-determine-earth-s-climate">What factors determine Earth’s climate?</h2><p>The Royal Society has done a <a href="https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/climate-change-evidence-causes/basics-of-climate-change/">great job</a> of introducing the topic, and much of what is written below is learned from their resources.</p><p>The Sun is the primary energy source for Earth’s climate. </p><p>Some of this sunlight is reflected back into space, predominantly by bright surfaces (e.g. ice and clouds) the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. </p><p>Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat. The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy affects the climate. Small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will change this balance.</p><p>If all the heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth’s average surface temperature would be significantly colder than today. </p><p>Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions, keeping Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere warm. </p><p>Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.</p><p>Greenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth’s energy balance and thus its climate. We affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces; for example, by clearing forests for farming. The emission of pollutants also affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.</p><p>Scientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth’s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.</p><h2 id="human-activities-have-added-greenhouse-gases-to-the-atmosphere">Human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. </p><p>In the case of carbon dioxide, the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen from 316 parts per million (ppm) in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more than 411 ppm in 2019. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%.</p><p>More than half of the increase in CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role. </p><p>Scientists have examined greenhouse gases from the past — by examining air trapped inside ice in Antarctica, we now know that the CO2 concentration began to increase significantly in the 19th century. This is after it had stayed in the range of 260 - 280 ppm for the previous 10,000 years. Ice core records extending back 800,000 years show that during that time, CO2 concentrations remained within the range of 170 to 300 ppm throughout many “ice age” cycles - and no concentration above 300 ppm is seen in ice core records until the past 200 years.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This should already be setting off alarm bells. The change in the last 200 years compared to the past 800,000 years. And the impact from humans. Crazy. </p><p>Measurements of the forms of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of “old” carbon coming from the combustion of fossil fuels, as opposed to “newer” carbon coming from living systems. </p><p>Furthermore, it is known that human activities, excluding land use change, currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. </p><p><strong>These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities.</strong></p><h2 id="climate-records-show-a-warming-trend">Climate records show a warming trend</h2><p>Estimating global average surface air temperature increase requires careful analysis of millions of measurements from around the world, including from land stations, ships, and satellites. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Despite the difficulty in collating the data, quite a few independent teams concluded separately (and unanimously) that global average surface air temperature has risen by about 1 degree celsius since 1900. </p><p>Although the record shows several pauses and …</p></div></div>

        <p>The other day I had a bit of a crisis, I was worried that I was starting to have trouble with my memory. Something had to be wrong! I started to notice (increasingly!) my inability to recall trivial things; for example, the action points from a Zoom call, or a quote from a book that I had read a couple of months ago. Surely this can’t be normal?</p><p>Before calling the doctor’s office I did what any decent hypochondriac would do, and started googling. After clicking through a few pages, I began to feel a bit better. It was normal. Short term (or working) memory <em>is</em> inefficient, and unless I revisit the thing I’m trying to remember a few times, I’m most likely going to forget it. And no, it’s not a side effect of turning thirty. Phew.</p><p>It’s a “feature, not a bug” of how our memory systems are designed. </p><p>Our memory is made up of not one, nor two, but three components: 1) a sensory register, 2) working memory, and 3) long-term memory.</p><p>When I look back at my childhood or I remember some basic words from French, I'm drawing on portions of my brain involved in long-term memory. But when I'm trying to hold a few ideas in mind to connect them together so I can understand a concept or solve a problem, I'm using my working memory.</p><p>With my health crisis averted, I got thinking about technology and its impact (positive and negative) on the way the brain, and memory, function. With all the knowledge I could ever need at my fingertips, alongside note taking apps and the smartphones that are now an extension of our physical being -- am I being lazy or efficient, or a mixture of the two? Much like our overactive fight-or-flight response, has evolution not had a chance to adapt or catch-up with the mind of today versus our ancestors’? </p><h3 id="four-chunks-of-information">Four chunks of information</h3><p>We ‘can’t remember’ things because there is a limit to what we can hold in our working memory. Researchers used to think that it could hold around seven items or chunks, but now it’s widely believed that the working memory only holds about four chunks of information.</p><p>If you’re anything like me you’ll have to repeat something to yourself until you have a chance to write it down. Repetitions are needed so that natural dissipating processes don’t suck the memories away. How many times have you found yourself shutting your eyes to keep other things from intruding into the limited slots of your working memory as you concentrate?</p><p>I believe that we need to offload from our working memory as soon as possible.</p><p>With the goal historically being, before computers, to move it to long-term memory. If this didn’t happen -- you’d essentially be waving goodbye to that memory. </p><p>Moving a memory from ‘working’ to ‘long-term’ takes time and practice. </p><p>There’s a steep drop in what you remember, anyway. The ‘forgetting curve’, as it’s called, is steepest during the first twenty-four hours after you learn something. Exactly how much you forget, percentage-wise, varies, but unless you review the material, much of it slips down the drain. What you remember after day one has a good chance of still being retained after thirty. </p><h3 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced repetition</h3><p>To improve retention, spaced repetition is typically used. This technique involves repeating what you're trying to retain, ensuring to space the repetition out. Repeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique for example over a number of days.</p><p>The good news is, our long-term memory has room for billions of items. In fact there can be so many items they can bury each other. It can be difficult for you to find the information you need unless you practice and repeat at least a few times. This allows the synoptic connections in the brain to form and strengthen into a lasting structure.</p><p>Long-term memory is important because it's where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about.</p><p>Having strong foundations in your long-term memory also makes the working memory more efficient, and able to connect dots from wider, more abstract, fields. It gives our thinking ‘richness’ and ‘associative access’. </p><p>Richness refers to the theory that a large number of things we have apparently forgotten all about are still there, somewhere, and add depth to our thinking. Associative access means that your thoughts can be accessed in a number of different ways by semantic or perceptual associations  — memories can be triggered by related words, by category names, by a smell, an old song or photograph, or even seemingly random neural firings that bring them up to consciousness.</p><h3 id="offloading-memory">Offloading memory</h3><p>But now, of course, we don’t bother to do all of the hard work of committing many things to our long-term memory. We have devices -- and the internet -- to remember stuff for us.</p><p>When I think back to when I started journaling on my iPad and laptop, as well as using apps like <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> that are focused on ‘<a href="https://st.im/ive-become-obsessed-with-networked-thought/">networked thought</a>’, it is interesting<strong> </strong>to hypothesise how they have potentially impacted the fundamental chemistry or feedback loops in my brain. </p><p>For me, they have helped reduce my cognitive load by letting me off-load much of what goes on in my brain to an external entity. In this day and age, this recall memory has become less necessary. Recognition memory is more important (i.e. the ability to judge that a currently present object, person, place, or event, has previously been encountered or experienced).</p><p>Research has shown that the internet functions as a sort of externalised memory. “When people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself,” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21764755">as one study puts it</a>. </p><p>If you know that you ‘know’ something, and you know how to retrieve it (thank you Google) that performs pretty much the same function as having a brain stuffed with lots of long-term memories. And the new ‘networked thought’ apps allow us to make interesting connections between these various bits of stored knowledge in much the same way that a well-stocked memory does.</p><h3 id="using-our-second-brain">Using our second brain </h3><p>So I wouldn’t say we are losing our ability to remember, as I posed at the start of this post. I think people (me included) just don’t do enough work to move stuff from our working memory into our long-term memory. </p><p>Our decreased reliance on recall memory and our &nbsp;ever-decreasing attention spans may not be the disaster that I first feared.</p><p>I think that the internet and apps focused on network thinking do assist us. They do act as a second brain. And I think that &nbsp;makes us more efficient.</p><hr><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sarandywestfall_photo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Sarandy Westfall</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/memory?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Thanks to <a href="https://jonathangifford.com/">Jonathan</a> for reading through early drafts of this post.<br>For discussion, check out this post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24917721">Hacker News</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a popular book called “JavaScript: The Good Parts.” And there’s a common meme around the relative size of that book versus “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIf3EJh.jpg"></p><p>Haskell is in my opinion a far more well designed and coherent language than JavaScript. However, it’s also an old language with some historical baggage. And in many ways it’s a bleeding edge research language that sometimes includes… half-baked features. And due to an inconsistent set of rules around backwards compatibility, it sometimes will break code every six months, and sometimes keep strange decisions around for decades.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>True mastery of Haskell comes down to knowing which things in core libraries should be avoided like the plague.</p><p>* foldl<br>* sum/product<br>* Data.Text.IO<br>* Control.Exception.bracket (use unliftio instead, handles interruptible correctly)</p><p>Just as some examples</p></div>— Michael Snoyman (@snoyberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/1321049221697544193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>After a request and some tongue-in-cheek comments in that thread, I decided a longer form blog post was in order. I’m going to start off by expanding on the four examples I gave in that tweet. But there are many, many more examples out there. If there’s more interest in seeing a continuation of this series, please let me know. And if you have pet peeves you’d like me to address, input will be very welcome.</p>
<h2>What is a “bad part”</h2>
<p>Very rarely is there such a thing as a language feature, function, type, or library that is so egregiously bad that it should never, ever be used. Null is of course the billion dollar mistake, but it’s still incredibly useful in some cases. So when I say that something is a “bad part” of Haskell, I mean something along these lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rarely-useful feature has been promoted to a position of prominence</li>
<li>A function has major downsides that are not documented</li>
<li>There’s an unexpected performance implication</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a large tendency in the Haskell community to be overly literal in responding to blog posts. Feel free to do that to your heart’s content. But this caveat serves as a word of warning: I’m not going to caveat each one of these with an explanation of “yes, but there’s this one corner case where it’s actually useful.”</p>
<h2>Why attack Haskell?</h2>
<p>Since I’m a Haskeller and advocate of the language, you may be wondering: why am I attacking Haskell? I don’t see this as an attack. I <em>do</em> wish we could fix these issues, and I think it’s a fair thing to say that the problems I’m listing are warts on the language. But every language has warts. I’m writing this because I’ve seen these kinds of things break real world projects. I’ve seen these failures manifest at runtime, defeating yet again the false claim that “if it compiles it works.” I’ve seen these become nefarious time bombs that disincentivize people from ever working with Haskell in the future.</p>
<p>I hope by calling these out publicly, I can help raise awareness of these problems. And then, either we can fix the problems at their source or, more likely, get more widespread awareness of the issue.</p>
<p>Also, because it feels appropriate, I’m going to take a more jovial tone below. I personally find it easier to beat up on a language I love like that.</p>
<h2>foldl</h2>
<p>Duncan Coutts <a href="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2014/04/fixing-foldl/">already did this one</a>. <code>foldl</code> is broken. It’s a bad function. Left folds are supposed to be strict, not lazy. End of story. Goodbye. Too many space leaks have been caused by this function. We should gut it out entirely.</p>
<p>But wait! A lazy left fold makes perfect sense for a <code>Vector</code>! Yeah, no one ever meant that. And the problem isn’t the fact that this function exists. It’s the <strong>name</strong>. It has taken the hallowed spot of the One True Left Fold. I’m sorry, the One True Left Fold is strict.</p>
<p>Also, side note: we can’t raise linked lists to a position of supreme power within our ecosystem and then pretend like we actually care about vectors. We don’t, we just pay lip service to them. Until we fix the wart which is overuse of lists, <code>foldl</code> is only ever used on lists.</p>
<p>OK, back to this bad left fold. This is all made worse by the fact that the true left fold, <code>foldl'</code>, is not even exported by the <code>Prelude</code>. We Haskellers are a lazy bunch. And if you make me type in <code>import Data.List (foldl')</code>, I just won’t. I’d rather have a space leak than waste precious time typing in those characters.</p>
<p>Alright, so what should you do? Use an alternative prelude that doesn’t export a bad function, and does export a good function. If you really, really want a lazy left fold: add a comment, or use a function named <code>foldlButLazyIReallyMeanIt</code>. Otherwise I’m going to fix your code during my code review.</p>
<h2>sum/product</h2>
<p>The <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> functions are implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>. Well, actually <code>foldMap</code>, but list’s <code>foldMap</code> is implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>, and lists are the only data structure that exist in Haskell. “Oh, but <code>foldr</code> is the good function, right?” Only if you’re folding a function which is lazy in its second argument. <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are both strict in both of their arguments.</p>
<p>If you’re not aware of that terminology: “strict in both arguments” means “in order to evaluate the result of this function/operator, I need to evaluate both of its arguments.” I can’t evaluate <code>x + y</code> without knowing what <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are. On the other hand, <code>:</code> (list cons) is lazy in its second argument. Evaluating <code>x : y</code> doesn’t require evaluating <code>y</code> (or, for that matter, <code>x</code>). (For more information, see <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/all-about-strictness/">all about strictness</a>.)</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say. “What if I have a custom data type with a custom typeclass instance of <code>Num</code> that has a custom <code>+</code> and/or <code>*</code> that is in fact lazy in the second argument! Then <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> are perfect as they are!”</p>
<p>That’s true. Now go off and write your own <code>lazySum</code> and <code>lazyProduct</code>. 99 times out of 100, or more likely 999,999 times out of 1,000,000, we want the fully strict version.</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t matter, GHC will optimize this away.” Maybe. Maybe not. Stop relying on GHC’s optimizer to convert horribly inefficient code into not efficient code. (But I digress, we’ll talk about why the <code>vector</code> package is bad another time.)</p>
<h2>Data.Text.IO</h2>
<p>I’ve already covered this one once before when I told everyone to <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/12/beware-of-readfile">beware of <code>readFile</code></a>. In that blog post, I talk about a bunch of <code>String</code> based I/O functions, especially the titular <code>readFile</code>, which is obnoxiously exported by <code>Prelude</code>. Those are bad, and I’ll reiterate why in a second. But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is arguably far worse. The reason is that there’s pretty good awareness in the community that <code>String</code>-based I/O is bad. Even though the <code>String</code> part is the least of our worries, it does a good job of scaring away the uninitiated.</p>
<p>But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. We’re all told by people who think they can tell people how to write their Haskell code (<em>cough</em> me <em>cough</em>) that we should exorcise <code>String</code> from our codebases and replace it in all cases with <code>Text</code>. Attacking the <code>Text</code> type is a topic for another time. But the problem is that by cloaking itself in the warm embrace of <code>Text</code>, this module claims more legitimacy than it deserves.</p>
<p>The only module worse in this regard is <code>Data.Text.Lazy.IO</code>, which should be buried even deeper.</p>
<p>OK, what exactly am I on about? Locale sensitive file decoding. It’s possible that this has been the number one example of a Haskell bug in the wild I’ve encountered in my entire career. Not the spooky memory leak. Partial functions like <code>head</code> randomly throwing exceptions are up there, but don’t quite rise to prominence.</p>
<p>You see, when you are dealing with file formats, there is typically an actual, defined format. YAML, XML, JSON, and many others give a lot of information about how to serialize data, including character data, into raw bytes. We want to be consistent. We want to write a file in one run of the program, and have it read in a separate run. We want to write the file on a Windows machine and read it on a Linux machine. Or we want to interact with programs in other languages that read or write data in a consistent format.</p>
<p>Locale sensitive file encoding and decoding laughs in our face. When you use <code>Data.Text.IO.readFile</code>, it plays a mind reading game of trying to deduce from clues you don’t care about which character encoding to use. These days, on the vast majority of systems used by native English speakers, this turns out to be UTF-8. So using <code>readFile</code> and <code>writeFile</code> typically “just works.” Using functions from <code>Data.Text.IO</code> looks safe, and can easily get hidden in a large PR or a library dependency.</p>
<p>That’s when all hell breaks loose. You ship this code. You run it in a Docker container. “Oops, you forgot to set the <code>LANG</code> env var, Imma crash.” But it’s worse than that. Typically things will work well for weeks or months, because it can often be a long time before someone tries to encode a non-ASCII character.</p>
<p>The same kind of thing happens regularly to Stack. Someone adds a new feature that writes and reads a file. The code passes all integration tests. And then someone in Russia with a weird Windows code page set and a Cyrillic character in their name files a bug report 2 years later about how they can’t build anything, and we sheepishly tell them to run <code>chcp 65001</code> or build in <code>c:\</code>.</p>
<p>Friends don’t let friends use <code>Data.Text.IO</code>.</p>
<p>“Oh, but <code>putStrLn</code> is fine!” Yeah, maybe. It’s also potentially slow. And it will throw a runtime exception due to character encoding mismatches. Just use a good logging library. That’s why we have one in <code>rio</code>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Since so many people have asked: instead of <code>readFile</code>, I recommend using <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-16.20/rio-0.1.19.0/RIO.html#v:readFileUtf8"><code>readFileUtf8</code></a>, which is available from <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a>.</p>
<h2>Control.Exception.bracket</h2>
<p>This is by far the least objectionable of the bad things in this list. I included it because the entire original tweet was inspired by a coworker telling me about a bug he ran into because of this function.</p>
<p>Async exceptions are subtle. Very, very subtle. Like, super duper subtle. I’ve devoted a large percentage to my Haskell teaching career towards them. Async exceptions are a concept that don’t truly exist in most other languages. They require rewiring the way your brain works for …</p></div></div>

<h2>Different from Chandrayaan 1</h2>



<p>SOFIA detected water on the Moon’s non-polar regions, and in areas of sunlight, making it different from ISRO Chandrayaan 1’s&nbsp;<a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">discovery of water ice</a>&nbsp;inside dark, cold craters on the lunar poles.</p>



<p>The water SOFIA found is locked in the lunar soil and rocks. Interestingly, NASA’s M3 instrument on Chandrayaan 1 had&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120929095219/http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/38_Klima_NLSI_2012.pdf">seen hints</a>&nbsp;of such trapped water in non-polar regions, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/clark1.html">as did Cassini</a>. But unlike SOFIA, those missions couldn’t tell if what they had detected was water or just hydroxyl groups (H2O vs OH).</p>



<p>Chandrayaan 1 dropped an impact probe on the Moon 12 years ago and did&nbsp;<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2010/2430.html">find water</a>, as in H2O. But it too is different from SOFIA’s findings because the probe detected water in the Moon’s thin atmosphere, not on the surface.</p>



<h2>Scientific not exploratory importance</h2>



<p>NASA PR spinned the announcement as the water being a promising source for future missions in creating sustainable habitats. But that’s not the case since this trapped water is in trace amounts, less than even the driest deserts on Earth. However, finding out where this water comes from or how it’s created has implications for understanding&nbsp;<a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">the Moon’s origin</a>, which itself is tied to Earth’s.</p>



<p>The one area where the results have some exploratory relevance is understanding how water is transported on the Moon, so as to get a better handle on where on the Moon such resources are deposited. But the substantially more water ice present on the lunar poles continue to be the prime target for enabling sustainable human presence on the Moon.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3cc0f-water-ice-moon-map-m3.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Illustration showing water ice in eternally dark craters on the Moon’s south pole (left) and north pole (right) as discovered by ISRO’s Chandrayaan 1 spacecraft.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Alongside the SOFIA findings, NASA mentioned&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1198-9#_blank">another result</a>&nbsp;that does have exploratory significance. Researchers using data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have identified several craters smaller than a kilometer which are eternally dark polar and can thus host water ice. The sheer number of such small craters increases the expected amount of water ice on the Moon.</p>



<p>As per previous observations by the Chandrayaan 1 orbiter and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists estimated the Moon’s poles to host&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">more than 600 billion kg</a>&nbsp;of water ice, enough to fill at least 240,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. As the next logical step, Chandrayaan 2 orbiter is&nbsp;<a href="https://jatan.space/chandrayaan-2-is-creating-the-highest-resolution-map-of-the-moon/">quantifying the amount of water ice</a>&nbsp;on the lunar poles and mapping it as we speak, and its findings should include these smaller craters.</p>



<p>Once we have such data, these smaller, dark craters will likely be better targets for future missions as they’d be easier to explore and extract water from than large craters like Shackleton.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> (MCMC) is a powerful class of methods to sample from probability distributions known only up to an (unknown) normalization constant. But before we dive into MCMC, let’s consider why you might want to do sampling in the first place.</p>
<p>The answer to that is: whenever you’re either interested in the samples themselves (for example, inferring unknown parameters in Bayesian inference) or you need them to approximate expected values of functions w.r.t. to a probability distribution (for example, calculating thermodynamic quantities from the distribution of microstates in statistical physics).
Sometimes, only the mode of a probability distribution is of primary interest. In this case, it’s obtained by numerical optimization so full sampling is not necessary.</p>
<p>It turns out that sampling from any but the most basic probability distributions is a difficult task.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">Inverse transform sampling</a> is an elementary method to sample from probability distributions, but requires the cumulative distribution function, which in turn requires knowledge of the, generally unknown, normalization constant.
Now in principle, you could just obtain the normalization constant by numerical integration, but this quickly gets infeasible with an increasing number of dimensions.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling">Rejection sampling</a> does not require a normalized distribution, but efficiently implementing it requires a good deal of knowledge about the distribution of interest, and it suffers strongly from the curse of dimension, meaning that its efficiency decreases rapidly with an increasing number of variables.
That’s when you need a smart way to obtain representative samples from your distribution which doesn’t require knowledge of the normalization constant.</p>
<p>MCMC algorithms are a class of methods which do exactly that.
These methods date back to a <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b3d/c9438227f747e770a6fb6d7d7c01d98725d6.pdf">seminal paper by Metropolis et al.</a>, who developed the first MCMC algorithm, correspondingly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm">Metropolis algorithm</a>, to calculate the equation of state of a two-dimensional system of hard spheres. In reality, they were looking for a general method to calculate expected values occurring in statistical physics.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I introduce the basics of MCMC sampling; in subsequent posts I’ll cover several important, increasingly complex and powerful MCMC algorithms, which all address different difficulties one frequently faces when using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Along the way, you will gain a solid understanding of these challenges and how to address them.
Also, this serves as a reference for MCMC methods in the context of the <a href="https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-09-20-monad-bayes-1.html">monad-bayes</a> series.
Furthermore, I hope the provided notebooks will not only spark your interest in exploring the behavior of MCMC algorithms for various parameters/probability distributions, but also serve as a basis for implementing and understanding useful extensions of the basic versions of the algorithms I present.</p>
<h2>Markov chains</h2>
<p>Now that we know why we want to sample, let’s get to the heart of MCMC: Markov chains.
What is a Markov chain? Without all the technical details, a Markov chain is a random sequence of states in some state space in which the probability of picking a certain state next depends only on the current state in the chain and not on the previous history: it is memory-less.
Under certain conditions, a Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution of states to which it converges after a certain number of states. From that number on, states in the Markov chain are distributed according to the invariant distribution.</p>
<p>In order to sample from a distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, a MCMC algorithm constructs and simulates a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, meaning that, after an initial “burn-in” phase, the states of that Markov chain are distributed according to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
We thus just have to store the states to obtain samples from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>For didactic purposes, let’s for now consider both a discrete state space and discrete “time”.
The key quantity characterizing a Markov chain is the transition operator <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which gives you the probability of being in state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> at time <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i+1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> given that the chain is in state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> at time <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Now just for fun (and for illustration), let’s quickly whip up a Markov chain which has a unique stationary distribution.
We’ll start with some imports and settings for the plots:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>%</span>matplotlib notebook
<span>%</span>matplotlib inline
<span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np
<span>import</span> matplotlib<span>.</span>pyplot <span>as</span> plt
plt<span>.</span>rcParams<span>[</span><span>'figure.figsize'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span>
np<span>.</span>random<span>.</span>seed<span>(</span><span>42</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Markov chain will hop around on a discrete state space which is made up from three weather states:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>state_space <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>"sunny"</span><span>,</span> <span>"cloudy"</span><span>,</span> <span>"rainy"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a discrete state space, the transition operator is just a matrix.
Columns and rows correspond, in our case, to sunny, cloudy, and rainy weather.
We pick more or less sensible values for all transition probabilities:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>transition_matrix <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array<span>(</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>0.6</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                              <span>(</span><span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.4</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                              <span>(</span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rows indicate the states the chain might currently be in and the columns the states the chains might transition to.
If we take one “time” step of the Markov chain as one hour, then, if it’s sunny, there’s a 60% chance it stays sunny in the next hour, a 30% chance that in the next hour we will have cloudy weather, and only a 10% chance of rain immediately after it had been sunny before.
This also means that each row has to sum up to one.</p>
<p>Let’s run our Markov chain for a while:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>n_steps <span>=</span> <span>20000</span>
states <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span>n_steps<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    states<span>.</span>append<span>(</span>np<span>.</span>random<span>.</span>choice<span>(</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> p<span>=</span>transition_matrix<span>[</span>states<span>[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
states <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array<span>(</span>states<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can monitor the convergence of our Markov chain to its stationary distribution by calculating the empirical probability for each of the states as a function of chain length:</p>

<h2>The mother of all MCMC algorithms: Metropolis-Hastings</h2>
<p>So that’s lots of fun, but back to sampling an arbitrary probability distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It could either be discrete, in which case we would keep talking about a transition matrix <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, or be continuous, in which case <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> would be a transition <em>kernel</em>.
From now on, we’re considering continuous distributions, but all concepts presented here transfer to the discrete case.</p>
<p>If we could design the transition kernel in such a way that the next state is already drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, we would be done, as our Markov chain would… well… immediately sample from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
Unfortunately, to do this, we need to be able to sample from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which we can’t.
Otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this, right?</p>
<p>A way around this is to split the transition kernel <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into two parts:
a proposal step and an acceptance/rejection step.
The proposal step features a proposal distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, from which we can sample possible next states of the chain.
In addition to being able to sample from it, we can choose this distribution arbitrarily. But, one should strive to design it such that samples from it are both as little correlated with the current state as possible and have a good chance of being accepted in the acceptance step.
Said acceptance/rejection step is the second part of the transition kernel and corrects for the error introduced by proposal states drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo mathvariant="normal">≠</mo><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q \neq \pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It involves calculating an acceptance probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_\mathrm{acc}(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and accepting the proposal <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> with that probability as the next state in the chain.

<p>All right, now that we know how Metropolis-Hastings works, let’s go ahead and implement it.
First, we set the log-probability of the distribution we want to sample from—without normalization constants, as we pretend we don’t know them. Let’s work for now with a standard normal distribution:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In this article, I want to explore an interesting pattern that I am seeing more and more in JavaScript code which allows you to return multiple values from a function.</p>
<p>You probably know already that JavaScript does not support multiple return values natively, so this article will actually explore some ways to “simulate” this behavior.</p>
<p>One of the most famous usages of this pattern I have seen recently is within <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html">React Hooks</a>, but before delving into that, let’s see what I mean with “multiple return values” by exploring this concept in other languages.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-return-values-in-other-languages"><a href="#multiple-return-values-in-other-languages" aria-label="multiple return values in other languages permalink"></a>Multiple return values in other languages</h2>
<p>Two languages that come to my mind which natively support multiple return values are Lua and Go. Let’s implement a simple <em>integer division</em> function that returns both the <em>quotient</em> and the <em>remainder</em>.</p>
<h3 id="lua"><a href="#lua" aria-label="lua permalink"></a>Lua</h3>
<p>Let’s start with a simple implementation in Lua. It’s definitely worth mentioning that <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/5.1.html">Lua’s official documentation</a> defines multiple return values as <em>“An unconventional, but quite convenient feature”</em>:</p>
<div data-language="lua"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>intDiv</span> <span>(</span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>local</span> quotient <span>=</span> math<span>.</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span>dividend <span>/</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>local</span> remainder <span>=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder
<span>end</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<h3 id="go"><a href="#go" aria-label="go permalink"></a>Go</h3>
<p>Here’s some equivalent code in Go:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> <span>"fmt"</span>

<span>func</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  quotient <span>:=</span> dividend <span>/</span> divisor
  remainder <span>:=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see in these 2 code snippets, functions can return more than 1 value and this can be very convenient in cases where you logically have produce multiple outputs in a computation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: a more realistic implementation in Go, would take into account errors (e.g. division by 0) and add an extra return value to propagate potential errors. We shouldn’t worry too much about this for the sake of this article, but it is definitely worth mentioning that multiple return values in Go shine when it comes to error propagation and error handling. We will touch a bit more on this later in this article to see how this idea can be applied to JavaScript as well, especially in the context of Async/Await.</p>
<h2 id="simulating-multiple-return-values-in-javascript"><a href="#simulating-multiple-return-values-in-javascript" aria-label="simulating multiple return values in javascript permalink"></a>Simulating multiple return values in JavaScript</h2>
<p>So, as we said early on, JavaScript does not natively support a syntax to return more than one value from a function. We can workaround this limitation by using <em>composite values</em> like arrays or objects.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-return-values-with-arrays"><a href="#multiple-return-values-with-arrays" aria-label="multiple return values with arrays permalink"></a>Multiple return values with arrays</h3>
<p>Let’s implement our <code>intDiv</code> in JavaScript by using arrays as return types:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>intDiv</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span>dividend <span>/</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> <span>[</span>quotient<span>,</span> remainder<span>]</span>
<span>}</span>

console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Here we are just printing the result of a division, but let’s assume we want to handle the two return values individually, how do we <em>reference</em> those?</p>
<p>Well, the return value is an array so we can simply access the two elements in the array using the indices <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> result<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
<span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> result<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>This syntax is arguably verbose and definitely not very elegant. Thankfully, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">ES2015 array destructuring assignment</a> can help us here:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>[</span>quotient<span>,</span> remainder<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>This is much nicer to read and we also trimmed away 2 out 3 lines of code, big win!</p>
<p>As nice as it is, this implementation has an important shortcoming: return values are positional, so you need to be careful and respect the order while destructuring.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-return-values-with-objects"><a href="#multiple-return-values-with-objects" aria-label="multiple return values with objects permalink"></a>Multiple return values with objects</h3>
<p>An alternative implementation could use objects as return value, let’s see how:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>intDiv</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span>dividend <span>/</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that here we are using another syntactic sugar from ES2015 (Enhanced object literal syntax) that allows us to define objects very concisely. Prior to ES2015, we would have defined the return statement as <code>{quotient: quotient, remainder: remainder}</code>.</p>
<p>With this approach we will be able to use our <code>intDiv</code> function as follows:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> result<span>.</span>quotient
<span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> result<span>.</span>remainder
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Again, this is a bit too verbose and ES2015 has another fantastic syntactic sugar to make this nicer:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>This syntactic sugar is called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Object_destructuring">Object Destructuring Assignment</a>. With this approach we are now independent from the position of return values (we can swap the position of <code>quotient</code> and <code>remainder</code> without side effects). This syntax also lets you rename the destructured variables, which can very useful to avoid name collisions with other local variables, or just to make variable names shorter or more descriptive as we please. Let’s see how this works:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> remainder<span>:</span> r<span>,</span> quotient<span>:</span> q <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>q<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>r<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Here we are not dependent by values position, but by their names in the returned object. If you are designing an API with multiple return values, it’s up to you to figure out which trade off will be the best to guarantee a proper developer experience.</p>
<p>Ok, now you should have a good idea on how to simulate multiple return values in JavaScript. In the next section we will see some more realistic examples that take advantage of this pattern.</p>
<h2 id="some-more-realistic-use-cases"><a href="#some-more-realistic-use-cases" aria-label="some more realistic use cases permalink"></a>Some more realistic use cases</h2>
<p>As mentioned early on, this technique has been recently popularized by React hooks, so we are gonna explore this use case first. Later we will see other two cases related to Async/Await.</p>
<h3 id="react-hooks"><a href="#react-hooks" aria-label="react hooks permalink"></a>React Hooks</h3>
<p>React hooks are a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html">new feature proposal</a> available from <em>React v16.7.0-alpha</em> that lets you use state and other React features without having to write a class.</p>
<p>The first and most famous React hook present is called <strong>State Hook</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s see how it works with an example, let’s build a CSS color viewer component.</p>
<p>Here’s how our component is going to look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://loige.co/content/4c8fe2a31135971902611822ca2f3df2/css-color-viewer-demo.gif" alt="CssColorViewer React component demo"></p>
<p>And here’s the code used to implement this:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span>

<span>function</span> <span>CssColorViewer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>cssColor<span>,</span> setCssColor<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>'Blue'</span><span>)</span>
  

  <span>const</span> <span>onCssColorChange</span> <span>=</span> <span>e</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setCssColor</span><span>(</span>e<span>.</span>target<span>.</span>value<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>input value<span>=</span><span>{</span>cssColor<span>}</span> onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span>onCssColorChange<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>div
        style<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span>
          width<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span>
          height<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span>
          background<span>:</span> cssColor<span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>}</span>
      <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see this component in action and play with the code on <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/9lzyov54lr">CodeSandbox</a>.</p>
<p>For the sake of this article, we are going to focus only on the <code>useState</code> call, but if you are curious to understand better how the hook itself works internally I really recommend you read the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html">official State Hook documentation</a>. I was personally curious to understand how multiple <code>useState</code> calls could maintain the relationship with the specific state attribute (since there’s no explicit labelling or reference). If you are curious about that too, well you should read the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-does-react-associate-hook-calls-with-components">Hooks FAQ</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889">Dan Abramov’s recent article about Hooks</a>.</p>
<p>Back to the <code>useState</code> call in our example, now!</p>
<p>The <code>useState</code> hook acts like a factory: given a default value for the state property (<code>'Blue'</code> in our case), it will need to instantiate for you 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the current value for the specific state property (<code>cssColor</code> in our case)</li>
<li>a function that allows you to alter the specific property (<code>setCssColor</code> in our case)</li>
</ul>
<p>React developers decided to handle this requirement by simulating multiple return values with an array.</p>
<p>Combining this with array destructuring and proper variable naming, the result is an API that is very nice to read and to use.</p>
<p>This React feature is still very experimental and subject to change at the time of writing, but it already sounds like a big deal for the React community to make the code more expressive and reduce the barrier to entry to start adopting React.</p>
<p>The point I want to make is that, in this specific case, the multiple return values pattern plays a big role towards this goal.</p>
<h3 id="converting-callbacks-api-to-asyncawait"><a href="#converting-callbacks-api-to-asyncawait" aria-label="converting callbacks api to asyncawait permalink"></a>Converting callbacks API to Async/Await</h3>
<p>Recently I found another great use case for the multiple return values pattern while trying to convert a callback oriented API into an equivalent Async/Await API.</p>
<p>To make this part clear, I am going to explain very quickly an approach I use to convert callback based APIs into functions that I can use with Async/Await.</p>
<p>Let’s take this generic example:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>input<span>,</span> callback</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  
  
  <span>callback</span><span>(</span>error<span>,</span> response<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To convert this function into something that can be used with Async/Await we have to essentially <a href="https://loige.co/to-promise-or-to-callback-that-is-the-question/"><em>promisify</em></a> it. There are libraries to do it and, if you are using Node.js you can even use the builtin <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original"><code>util.promisify</code></a>, but that’s something we can do ourselves by just creating a <em>wrapper</em> function like the following one:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>doSomethingPromise</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>resolve<span>,</span> reject</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span>input<span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>error response</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>error<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>reject</span><span>(</span>error<span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>resolve</span><span>(</span>response<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In short, our wrapper function <code>doSomethingPromise</code> is immediately returning a <code>Promise</code>. Inside the body of the promise we are invoking the original <code>doSomething</code> function with a callback that will be resolving or rejecting the promise based on whether there’s an <code>error</code> or not.</p>
<p>Now we can finally take advantage of Async/Await:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> response <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>doSomethingPromise</span><span>(</span>input<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this will throw in case of error, so make sure you have it in a <code>try/catch</code> block to handle the error correctly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are curious about <em>promisifying</em> callback-based functions, I have <a href="https://loige.co/to-promise-or-to-callback-that-is-the-question/">an entire article</a> dedicated to this topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my specific use case, I was using a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter">twitter client</a> library that follows this conventions:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
client<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'statuses/user_timeline'</span><span>,</span> params<span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>callback</span>…</code></pre></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>There’s a reason why change aversion in users is so often spoken about in the world of digital consumerism <span>— </span>human beings love their comfort zones. In the grand scheme of things, we seek out what is familiar to us for a sense of security.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Keeping your software product updated is important, but it’s also important to make sure the perfective changes you make are within the bounds of what your users are familiar and comfortable with.</p>
<p>Now, what kinds of changes might we be referring to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The types of changes that can be introduced in a software product are changes in infrastructure, functionality, and interface. Among them, interface changes incite the biggest reactions from users. That’s because it’s the most forefront part of a product that they see and interact with <span>— layout, tabs, fonts, colors, buttons, animation, etc</span>.</p>
<p><span>When introducing changes in this aspect of your product, both psychology and history say you should take it slow.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Psychology Tells Us&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>To discuss why sudden and major UI changes backfire from a psychological point of view, we have to address change aversion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been many cases where consumers refused to adapt to a new product, even if it was objectively “better”. One good example would be the introduction of the <a href="https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/"><span>Dvorak keyboard</span></a> in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Even&nbsp;though the Dvorak keyboard promoted objectively better physical ergonomics, people refused to move from the QWERTY keyboard <span>—</span> simply because they were used to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<h3><strong>Users Want to Feel Smart</strong></h3>
<p>It’s widely taught by UIUX experts like Rohan Puri and Robert Youmans, that users are aversive to change because “change makes them feel dumb”. When using your product, users want to feel in control, like they know what they’re doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially for neurodivergent users, big and sudden changes in UI can be disorienting. When you change things around all at once, you’re also making your users relearn what they’d previously mastered before <span>— and that takes time and energy. In other words, you’re giving them work to do.</span></p>
<p>If you’re an app or web developer, always remember that your users aren’t sitting next to you, watching you iterate and develop from scratch. Your interface may seem simple to you because you’ve familiarized with it as you worked on it, but that’s not the case for them.</p>
<h3><strong>Value is Invisible</strong></h3>
<p>Confirming many real-life cases, a study by Rosman et al on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262411663_On_user_behaviour_adaptation_under_interface_change"><span>user behaviour adaptation under interface change</span></a> found that it takes many tries for a user to feel comfortable enough with an interface that was initially unfamiliar to them, before they “conﬁdently choose it and realise the potential beneﬁts”.</p>
<p>Because the bulk of your revamp’s value is neither visible nor instantly detectable, more impatient users might poorly estimate the efﬁciency of your improved UI and “prematurely abandon it” in that particular time frame.</p>
<p>After all, if they don’t see an increase in value, why would they like that you changed what was already working for them?</p>
<h2><strong>What History Tells Us</strong></h2>
<p>Negative feedback from a large number of users can spread like wildfire on social media. Needless to say, that can be really detrimental to your brand and product.</p>
<p>If you’re a startup just starting out with a small user base, you have more leeway for major UI redesigns while you figure out your brand and voice. As your product grows, however, so does the need to prioritize your users’ preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some companies with really big user bases learned the hard way so we don’t have to.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What Happened with Digg</strong></h3>
<p>In 2010, Digg, a news aggregate site very much like reddit, launched a redesign that caused them to lose 35% of their users nearly instantly.</p>
<p>In the Digg v4 update, the site was heavily revamped visually and functionally. Among many of the sudden changes, the downvote button was removed, users could no longer save posts to favorites or posts videos,&nbsp; their Upcoming page was gone, and the overall focus was shifted from user-submitted content to publisher-submitted content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This major change didn’t just disorient their users. It took control away from them. With the new system, posts by publishers and sponsors flooded the front page, while posts by regular users were practically invisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result of this? A mass exodus. Users either flooded the site with protest links (many of which were links to Reddit, their biggest competitor) or immediately migrated to Reddit.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What Happened with eBay</strong></h3>
<p>Once, eBay decided to change the background color of many of their site’s pages from bright yellow to white. Even though this change may seem like an obvious aesthetic choice today, it caused a ruckus on the internet (and in the team’s mailbox) when it first happened, forcing them to revert to yellow.</p>
<p>eBay didn’t give up on their vision, though. They came up with a strategy to go subtle, and designed an algorithm that faded the background from yellow to white, one shade at a time, over a few months. This time, the internet was still. The change was taking place so gradually that their users didn’t notice it was happening.</p>
<h2><strong>How Do You Safely Revamp?</strong></h2>
<p>Now that storytime is over, let’s talk about what we can learn from them. How can you revamp your product while being wary of change aversion?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, getting complaints from users doesn’t mean you should stop updating your app or website. <span>M</span>aintenance is necessary for your product to thrive and continue thriving.<span> The secret lies in </span><em><span>how</span></em><span> you execute it.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Change Little and Often</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of giving your users a whole new interface to relearn at one go, introduce a little change at a time. Habits take time to unlearn. Giving users one small redirection at a time is a lot less disorienting and burdensome for them.</p>
<h3><strong>Give Users a Heads-up&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Before you launch your redesign, give users time to prepare for it. This will dampen the impact of the launch and reduce the risk of shocking them into frustration with your product.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Spell Out the Values</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned before, values are invisible. Users don’t always immediately see the benefits of your new interface when they first try it. Instead of waiting for them to figure the maze out on their own, give them the lowdown on how the changes you’ve implemented are designed to solve the problems they face.</p>
<h3><strong>Provide Guidance</strong></h3>
<p>Part of spelling out the values of your redesign is by easing your users’ transition to your new interface. When you provide tutorials and demonstratives, you’re also teaching them how the new design improves their experience on your app or website.</p>
<h3><strong>Provide Options</strong></h3>
<p>It’s always good to give your users the option to switch back to the old interface. Provide them a toggle switch or button to revert to the old version, and place it somewhere easily accessible.</p>
<h3><strong>Welcome Feedback</strong></h3>
<p>Give your users an outlet or channel through which they can directly communicate with your team. Whether it’s a form on your website, or simply an email address they can write to specifically for complaints and feedback, it’s always good to let your users know that you’re listening.</p>

<p><strong>In this article I will introduce you to a new software stack that can be thought of as a spiritual successor to the MEAN or MERN stack. The technologies in the SJGAR stack were carefully combined to create something where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Focus on your customers, on business value and the developer experience. Do more, and keep things simple.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you want to find out why the mix of Serverless, JavaScript, GraphQL, AWS and React could be interesting to you please read on.</strong></p>

<p>I remember writing software in the period roughly between 2005 and 2015 where sometimes it could feel like every week something new was thrown at us. We were transitioning from desktop to the web and then cloud and mobile. We were just getting good at Object-oriented programming when a shift towards Functional Programming required us to rethink our mental models around our code. Cloud scale computing brought us from solely using SQL databases to study and use NoSQL databases. We went from embracing XML and SOAP to transitioning to JSON.</p>
<div><p><h3>Focus on your customers, on business value and the developer experience. Do more, and keep things simple.</h3></p></div>

<p>Looking at JavaScript alone there was also a lot of turmoil. The language started almost as a toy language to glue together simple elements on a web page. Then it slowly but steadily grew into becoming the most widely used programming language on the web. It even moved on beyond the browser and started to conquer the server with Node.js. A realm where Java and .NET were dominant before, now had to create some room for people starting to use JavaScript on the server.</p>
<p>On the web, framework after framework was becoming popular. Much to the point where they are still being refactored away ten years later. I remember moving from jQuery to Backbone or Knockout. I used Ember a bit and then also Angular. All of these seemed to offer some improvements over what was previously there. There were still enough rough edges however. It was clear we were not there yet.</p>

<p>In 2015, I got the chance to work on a corporate startup project that was completely greenfield. We set out to create a platform with web and mobile apps with state-of-the-art user experience, and we wanted to fail or succeed fast. This meant we had to ensure a short time to market. We had to focus on developer experience and productivity. After having tried some pieces of technology on smaller projects, this was the perfect chance to put them together and figure out if they would play nicely together. In theory, it should all work, but previous experience had shown that you really need to start using them for a decent amount of time to figure out if the new advantages will really outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<div><p><h3>It worked. It really worked.</h3></p></div>
<p>We built a web application using React and an accompanying mobile app using React Native. The backend was built using AWS Serverless technologies. We used DynamoDB as the single source of truth for data. The built-in event triggering system was used to run some Node.js code in a Lambda to stream this data to a managed Elasticsearch cluster, so we could support the search and query capabilities we needed. We created a GraphQL API using the reference server implementation graphql-js (Apollo Server and Client weren't a thing back then). Again this was run in Lambda. To make sure the web application was performant enough for our end users we used a Lambda to implement Server Side Rendering (Gatsby and Next.js also weren't a thing back then). We also used the Serverless framework, a bit shaky at that time, to write our infra as code.</p>
<p>With a handful of full stack engineers we were able to deliver this project successfully to production. We could deliver new versions of our microservices independently, and we would do this multiple times a day.</p>
<p>It worked. It really worked.</p>
<p>We started with almost zero costs for infrastructure. The most expensive service was the Elasticsearch service. The other services would easily service our first customers on the free tier. I think we never spent over 100 euros a month. Without Elasticsearch it would probably not have been higher than 10 euros a month. We launched and started running ad campaigns to lure customers to our new offering. For these ad campaigns we were spending over a thousand euros per month. It was clear that we now could go to the business and tell them we could do innovation projects with IT running costs of close to zero.</p>
<p>I remember we were able to move some logic from the web app to the authentication provider (we used Auth0 back then since Cognito was still a bit too new) by just copying some JavaScript code. Similarly, we were able to move code from frontend to backend. More generally we were able to take what we learned in a certain context, and apply it to a different one. JavaScript allowed us to learn a single programming language and write code for the Web, Mobile and Cloud. React allowed us to use a single framework to structure applications and do the state management for both Web and Mobile. Using Flexbox we could even apply the same UI layout system in these apps. With the complex and time-consuming nature of layout work, it was great that we were able to reuse our knowledge and tools to enjoy a great productivity boost.</p>
<p>Going Serverless meant we did not have to spend time on managing servers. The code and the system would just work. No disks filling up, no security patches to be applied, no certificates to be updated. AWS had given us a platform with great performance and stability. Everything would just run.</p>
<p>After running this project in 2015 and 2016, in the end it was shuttered because it did not align with our business goals. Only later I came to realize this set of technologies would stand the test of time, and would do so pretty well.</p>
<div id="okay-this-thing-needs-a-name"><h3><a href="#okay-this-thing-needs-a-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="okay this thing needs a name permalink"></a>Okay. This Thing Needs A Name.</h3></div>
<p>Fast-forward a bit to when I joined my current team and company early 2019. We formed a new innovation department and dreamed of a future where we helped turn our 175-year-old financial company into a fintech. Teaming up with the department that was our business counterpart, in the first year we built and delivered a total of fourteen projects with a relatively common two pizza team. In the previous nineteen years of my career I had never witnessed anything like this. We built smaller projects like landing pages, but also large ones like a new platform to sell houses using data and AI. We also built a fairly complex API to serve as the backend for an IoT driven car insurance. We even managed to surprise ourselves and win a hackathon in our first year with a mobile app for planting trees.</p>
<div><p><h3>Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</h3></p></div>
<p>Many things fell into place to make this a success. For one, it were the amazing people we joined. I consider myself lucky to this day that we met them and were able to make all of these things happen. It was almost as if we started in a performing phase as a team, skipping the forming, norming and storming phases altogether.</p>
<p>Besides the people the technology played an important role here. Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</p>
<p>What was really cool was that we were able to deliver all these different types of applications using basically the same architecture. For the IoT insurance, the API we delivered we implemented a lightweight event sourced system using mainly DynamoDB and Lambda. We later added a future event system where we combined DynamoTTL and Step Functions to combine high and low resolution timers, all of which were inspired by a set of blog posts and a tweet we found on the web.</p>
<p>For the housing platform we combined Cognito, Azure AD, DynamoDB, Lambda, AppSync, S3 and CloudFront to deliver a platform that was highly performant. Gatsby helped us leverage React’s power to build statically rendered, SEO-friendly pages, hosted on S3 and made available to the wide internet using CloudFront and Route53. On the backend we created a GraphQL API to, on the one hand, power the build-time data requirements. On the other hand it also powered the real-time admin panel we needed for providing customers support.</p>
<p>There were many more projects that used very similar architectures. Five years after first having used these technologies we were still able to use them to build modern applications. In our hiring process I remember seeing the smiles on the faces of the engineers when we would mention our tech stack.</p>
<div><p><h3>Which parts are going to be successful for at least the next five years?</h3></p></div>
<p>There was this one thing I noticed though. Whenever I wanted to explain our technology stack, I was summing up this combination of technologies one by one. Time after time saying things like “Our stack is JavaScript based, uses the React ecosystem and runs on AWS Serverless... And oh yeah we use GraphQL as a BFF for our apps.” A couple of days later I would say something like “We build apps using React and use JavaScript/TypeScript. Our APIs are running on AWS Lambda using NodeJS.”. And then many more variations of these sentences.</p>
<p>Okay. This thing needs a name.</p>
<p>Back in the days we had the LAMP stack, and some time after that there was the MEAN stack. Acronyms that became part of our vocabulary to help explain the stack we were using, or even inspired greenfield projects to combine these technologies. People would think, hey, I recently have been hearing a lot of buzz around the MEAN …</p></div></div></div>

      <p>Oct 27, 2020</p>

      <p>
	In my <a href="https://zinascii.com/2020/the-amd64-fbt-handler.html">previous
	post</a> I described how FBT intercepts function calls and
	vectors them into the DTrace framework. That laid the
	foundation for what I want to dicuss in this post: the
	implementation of the <code>stack()</code> action and
	built-in <code>arg</code> variables. These features rely on
	the precise layout of the stack, the details of which I
	touched on previously. In this post I hope to illuminate those
	details a bit more with the help of some visuals, and then
	guide you through the implentation of these two DTrace
	features as they relate to the FBT provider.
      </p>

      <h2>A Correction</h2>

      <p>
	But first I must make a correction to my last post. It turns
	out the FBT handler <b>does not</b> execute on the IST stack.
	It runs on either the thread’s stack or the CPU’s high-level
	interrupt stack depending on the context of the kernel
	function call, but never on the IST.
	Rather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation">KPTI</a>
	uses the IST stack as a scratch space to perform its
	trampoline into the real handler. This little detail is
	important. Functions like <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code>
	have zero chance of working if run with the IST stack, for
	reasons which become obvious later. This also explains why the
	AMD64 handler pulls down the stack
	during <code>pushq&nbsp;%RBP</code> emulation: if it’s working
	on the same stack as the thread/interrupt, then it must make
	room for <code>RBP</code>. I can explain better with a visual.
	First, the diagram from the last post.
      </p>

      <figure>
	  
	  <figcaption><a name="fig1-int3-pre-handler">Figure 1. INT3 thread/interrupt state pre-handler</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	On the left we have a kernel thread, interrupt thread, or
	high-level interrupt running on CPU. On the right we have the
	“interrupt context” of the breakpoint exception, using the
	IST. The image is correct in that there are two different
	stacks in play, but what’s running on the right-hand side is
	not the <code>brktrap</code> handler. The right-hand side is
	running the KPTI trampoline, ensuring a CR3 switch when moving
	between the user/kernel boundary. The trampoline also provides
	a facsimile of the processor frame to the interrupted thread’s
	stack, making it none the wiser that KPTI was ever on the
	scene. So all the action happens on the left side, but what
	does the stack look like as we transition through the #BP
	handler on our way to <code>dtrace_invop()</code>?
      </p>

      <figure>
	  
	  <figcaption><a name="fig2-pre-fbt-stack">Figure 2. stack state from #BP to pre dtrace_invop()</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	In phase ① <code>mac_provider_tx()</code> is
	calling <code>mac_ring_tx()</code> while it is under FBT entry
	instrumentation. The last thing on the thread’s stack is the
	return address, and the CPU is about to execute
	the <code>int3</code> instruction.
      </p>

      <p>
	Phase ② is immediately after the CPU has finished execution of
	the <code>int3</code> instruction. The processor (via the
	spectre of the KPTI trampoline) has pushed a 16-byte aligned
	processor frame on the stack and has vectored into
	the <code>brktrap()</code> handler.
      </p>

      <p>
	Phase ③ is after some amount of execution of
	the <code>brktrp()</code> and <code>invoptrap()</code>
	handlers—remember, the #BP handler for DTrace mimics a #UD.
	This last phase shows the state just before the call
	to <code>dtrace_invop()</code>. At this point we’ve grown an
	entire <code>regs</code> structure on the stack and stashed a
	copy of the return address on top of this. The later used to
	populate <code>cpu_dtrace_caller</code>, a variable which
	becomes important later.
      </p>

      <h2>The stack() Action</h2>

      <p>
	The separation of probes and actions is a vital aspect of
	DTrace’s architecture. A firm boundary between these two makes
	DTrace more powerful than it ever could be if they were
	tightly coupled. Think about it, I can ask for the call stack
	in any probe, not just the probes that deem that information
	useful. The probes give you access to a context, and the
	actions give you access to data in that context. To limit the
	execution of actions to specific probes would limit the
	questions you can ask about the system. With this design the
	number of questions you can ask is virtually endless. And it
	turns out one of the more useful questions to ask is: “what
	the hell is running on my CPU”?
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>stack()</code> action allows you to record the call
	stack that lead to the probe site. In the context of FBT this
	will record the call stack of the kernel thread or interrupt
	executing an entry or return from this kernel function. You
	can also access the userland stack of a thread
	via <code>ustack()</code>, but I don’t cover that here.
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>stack()</code> action is implemented by
	the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code> function. To get there
	from <code>dtrace_invop()</code> requires a couple of more
	calls in the DTrace framework. Ultimately, the call stack to
	get there looks like this.
      </p>

	</div>
	<figcaption>call stack between dtrace_getpcstack() and dtrace_invop()</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	The implementation of <code>stack()</code> really starts
	with <code>DTRACEACT_STACK</code> inside
	of <code>dtrace_probe()</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
	The first argument is the address of the array used to store
	program counter values (aka function pointers). This array
	starts at some offset into the current DTrace buffer. The
	second argument if the size of that array. The third argument
	is the number of “artificial frames” on the stack, more on
	this later. The fourth argument is used to determine if the
	first (topmost) program counter in the call stack is the value
	passed in <code>arg0</code> to <code>dtrace_probe()</code>. An
	“anchored” probe is one that has a function name specified
	when calling <code>dtrace_probe_create()</code>. For example,
	the FBT provider uses the name of the kernel function as the
	probe’s function name, thus it is anchored on the kernel
	function. The profile provider, however, specifies no probe
	function name; it is not anchored and is a bit of a special
	case. I address this at the end of the post.
      </p>

      <p>
	This brings us to the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code>
	function. But first I’ll expand
	on <a href="#fig2-pre-fbt-stack">figure 2</a> to show our
	stack state as of source line 60 of the function.

      <p>
	To build the call stack we first need to be able to walk the
	stack. Luckily, illumos keeps frame pointers in the kernel,
	making this easy. But in this particular situation there is
	more to consider. First, we might have two stacks in play: the
	high-level interrupt’s stack as well as the stack of the
	thread it interrupted. Second, the DTrace framework and FBT
	provider have put their own frames between this code and the
	function that tripped this probe; we must exclude these
	“artificial” frames from the result. Finally, we need to make
	sure not to walk off the stack and into space, both for
	correctness and safety. Speaking of the stack,
	the <code>stacktop</code> variable is pointing to the “top” of
	the stack in terms of memory (on x86 stacks grow downwards).
	Logically speaking, <code>stacktop</code> is the bottom of the
	stack and the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code> frame is the
	top.

      <p>
	Make sure to skip over any artificial frames.
	The <code>aframes</code> value is based on information given
	by the provider at probe creation time
	(<code>dtrace_probe_create()</code>/<code>dtpr_aframes</code>)
	as well as knowledge inherent to the DTrace framework. These
	two know how many frames they have each injected between
	the <code>stack()</code> action and the first real frame; we
	sum the values to know how many total frames to skip.
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>caller</code> variable is a bit more subtle; and

<![CDATA[GitHub should stand up to the RIAA over YouTube-dl]]>

October 27, 2020 | https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/riaa-blitz-takes-down-18-github-projects-used-for-downloading-youtube-videos/">GitHub took down the repository</a> for the youtube-dl project. This came in response to a request from the RIAA—the recording industry’s lobbying and harassment body. youtube-dl is a tool for downloading videos. The RIAA argued that this violates the anticircumvention protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). While GitHub taking down the repository and its forks is true to the principle of minimizing corporate risk, it’s the wrong choice.</p>



<p> Microsoft—currently the world’s second-most valuable company with a market capitalization of $1.64 trillion—owns GitHub. If anyone is in a position to fight back on this, it’s Microsoft. Microsoft’s lawyers should have a one word answer to the RIAA’s request: “no”. <em>(full disclosure: I own a small number of shares of Microsoft)</em></p>



<h2>The procedural argument</h2>



<p>The first reason to tell the RIAA where to stick it is procedural. The RIAA isn’t arguing that youtube-dl is infringing its copyrights or circumventing its protections. It is arguing that youtube-dl infringes YouTube’s protections. So even if it is, that’s YouTube’s problem, not the RIAA’s.</p>



<h2>The factual argument</h2>



<p>I have some sympathy for the anticircumvention argument. I’m not familiar with the specifics of how youtube-dl works, but it’s at least possible that youtube-dl circumvents YouTube’s copy protection. This would be a reasonable basis for YouTube to take action. Again, YouTube, not the RIAA.</p>



<p>I have less sympathy for the infringement argument. youtube-dl doesn’t induce infringement more than a web browser or screen recorder does. There are a variety of uses for youtube-dl that are not infringing. Foremost is the fact that some YouTube videos are under a license that explicitly allows sharing and remixing. Archivers use it to archive content. Some people who have time-variable Internet billing use it to download videos overnight.</p>



<p>So, yes, youtube-dl can be used to infringe the RIAA’s copyrights. It can also be used for non-infringing purposes. The code itself does not infringe. There’s nothing about it that gives the RIAA a justification to take it down.</p>



<h2>youtube-dl isn’t the whole story</h2>



<p>youtube-dl provides a focal point, but there’s more to it. Copyright law is now used to suppress instead of promote creative works. The DMCA, in particular, favors the large rightsholders over smaller developers and creators. It essentially forces sites to act on a “guilty until proven innocent” model. Companies in a position to push back have an obligation to do so. Microsoft has become a supporter of open source, now it’s time to show they mean it.</p>



<p>We should also consider the risks of consolidation. git is a decentralized system. GitHub has essentially centralized it. Sure, many competitors exist, but GitHub has become the default place to host open source code projects. The fact that GitHub’s code is proprietary is immaterial to this point. A FOSS service would pose the same risk if it became the centralized service.</p>



<p>I saw a quote on this discussion (which I can’t find now) that said “code is free, infrastructure is not.” And while projects self-hosting their code repository, issue tracker, etc may be philosophically appealing, that’s not realistic. Software-as-a-Service has lowered the barrier for starting projects, which is a good thing. But it doesn’t come without risk, which we are now seeing.</p>



<p>I don’t know what the right answer is for this. I know the answer won’t be easy. But both this specific case and the general issues they highlight are important for us to think about.</p>

				<h3 id="pants-2-0-0-the-first-stable-release-of-the-pants-v2-open-source-build-system-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0, the first stable release of the Pants v2 open-source build system, is out now!</h3><p>There are so many tools in the Python development ecosystem. You might use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a> to resolve dependencies, <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> to run tests, <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a> and <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a> for lint checks, <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a> and <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/">isort</a> for auto-formatting, <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> for type checking, <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for interactive sessions, <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools</a>, <a href="https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pex</a> or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> for packaging, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a> for code generation, and many more. Not to mention any custom tooling you've built for your repo. </p><p>Installing, configuring and orchestrating the invocation of these tools<strong>—</strong>all while not re-executing work unnecessarily<strong>—</strong>is a hard problem, especially as your codebase grows. The lack of a robust, scalable build system for Python has been a problem for a long time, and this has become even more acute in recent years, with Python codebases increasing in size and complexity. </p><p>Fortunately, there is now a tailor-made (pun intended) solution: <strong>Pants v2</strong>!</p><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is designed from the ground-up for fast, consistent builds. Some noteworthy features include:</p><ul><li>Minimal metadata and boilerplate</li><li>Fine-grained workflow</li><li>Shared result caching</li><li>Concurrent execution</li><li>A responsive, scalable UI</li><li>Unified interface for multiple tools and languages</li><li>Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/render1603750306032.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Pants running multiple linters in parallel</figcaption></figure><p>Read on to learn more about Pants v2, and what it means for your Python codebase.</p><hr><h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2><p>We started the original open-source Pants project back in 2011. At the time, we were frustrated by slow, flaky Scala builds. The leading strategy for scaling was to hand each developer a RAM stick and a screwdriver... Surely this was a problem we could tackle with software! Thus Pants v1 was born. </p><p>Pants v1 was quite successful, and was adopted at cutting-edge tech companies such as Twitter, Foursquare, Square and others. But we still weren't satisfied: The APIs were clunkier than we would have liked, the UI was overly chatty, caching was hard to get right, and concurrent execution had to be special-cased. We knew there were plenty of performance and stability improvements to be had, if we could only unlock them. </p><p>We learned a lot from our years of work on Pants v1, and knew that we could design something new and better, leaning on our experience with v1 while addressing the drawbacks of that system. Luckily, at the same time as we began thinking about this hypothetical next system, a new motivating problem emerged: Python builds.</p><h2 id="python-builds-today">Python builds today</h2><p>As you probably know, Python has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. Not only is it used to build a wide variety of server applications, via frameworks such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, but it's also the language of choice for data scientists, thanks to powerful libraries and tools such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. </p><p>Python hits a sweet spot of simplicity and power, but there is a big problem - there is no truly great scalable build tool for Python, and this is becoming a real pain point as Python repos grow like never before. &nbsp;</p><p>Python builds today involve manually invoking a wide variety of tools. Each tool has to be installed, configured and invoked in just the right way, often while sequencing the output of one tool into input of another. Knowing how to use each tool in a given scenario is complicated and burdensome. </p><p>Sure, you can hack around the problem for a while with some combination of shell scripts, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">Makefiles</a>, <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a>, and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>. But even a small code change might require you to run a huge amount of sequential build work. Re-executing the same processes with the same inputs over and over again is a frustrating waste of time and resources. &nbsp;And these solutions start to break down as your codebase grows.</p><p>Perhaps you experimented with more complex build systems, such as <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> or <a href="https://v1.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v1</a>. &nbsp;But it's laborious to maintain all that BUILD metadata, all for a sub-par experience not optimized for Python. Not to mention the difficulty of implementing your own custom build logic. </p><p>Alternatively, maybe you've been tempted to split up your codebase into multiple interdependent repos, each with their own "smaller" builds. But that creates an even thornier problem, namely how to manage those interdependencies. Having to propagate changes across codebase boundaries can slow development down to a crawl, and leave you with the worst of both worlds - slower processes and a fragmented, unmanageable codebase.</p><p>A great build system for repos - of all sizes - that include Python code would support fine-grained invalidation and caching, so that it only executes the build work actually affected by a change. It would support concurrent local and even remote execution, to greatly speed up work by using all available CPU. It would be easy to adopt in a small repo, but would scale up as your codebase grows. It wouldn't require huge amounts of boilerplate metadata, and it would be easy to extend with custom build logic. </p><p>Well, Pants v2 is that system! </p><h2 id="introducing-pants-v2">Introducing Pants v2</h2><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is a completely new open-source build system, inspired by our work on Pants v1. &nbsp;We've been developing and testing it for the last couple of years, and it's finally ready for prime time!</p><p>A key factor in the design of Pants v2 was a set of lessons we learned from Pants v1 and other existing systems, such as Bazel. Among them: that ease of use and performance matter, boilerplate is annoying, concurrency and caching require hard design work, and most people will need custom logic at some point.</p><h3 id="lesson-1-ease-of-use-and-performance-both-matter">Lesson #1: Ease of use and performance both matter</h3><p>When designing software you often find yourself making tradeoffs between ease of use and performance. But in a build system, both are vital. The Pants v2 execution engine - which is the performance-critical heart of the system - is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, for raw speed. And the domain-specific build logic is written in familiar, easy to work with, type-annotated Python 3. This helps make Pants v2 easy to extend, without compromising performance. </p><p>Pants v2 also runs a daemon that memoizes fine-grained build state in memory, for even faster performance. This daemon watches for changes to your source files and precisely invalidates its state on the fly to ensure that the minimum amount of work happens the next time you build.</p><h3 id="lesson-2-writing-build-metadata-is-a-real-drag">Lesson #2: Writing build metadata is a real drag</h3><p>Some build tools are slow because they don't have enough information about the structure of your code to intelligently perform incremental work. Others have gone too far in the other direction, requiring a huge amount of metadata and boilerplate in BUILD files, especially relating to your code's dependencies. </p><p>Pants v2 offers the best of both worlds - intelligent, fine-grained incremental work, without the boilerplate. It does so by assuming sensible, magic-free defaults, inferring dependencies from the import statements in your code, and supporting plugins for custom inference logic. Stay tuned for an upcoming post on exactly how Pants achieves this!</p><h3 id="lesson-3-design-for-caching-concurrency-and-remoting">Lesson #3: Design for caching, concurrency and remoting </h3><p>Writing build logic that can be cached and executed concurrently and remotely is very hard. You have to be very careful about not producing or consuming side-effects, and it's extremely difficult to tack that on later. And unless you design your APIs with care, supporting these kinds of features often places severe restrictions on what your build logic may safely do. </p><p>In Pants v2, build logic is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a> Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">async coroutines</a>. So a build rule can depend not only on its inputs, but can also await on new data at runtime - all of which is precisely tracked for invalidation and caching. This gives us the best of both worlds: logic that is properly isolated from side-effects, and is therefore amenable to caching, concurrent execution and remoting, while still allowing the use of natural control flow.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/caching.gif" alt=""><figcaption>We run both tests, then add a syntax error to one test and rerun; the unmodified test uses the cache and is isolated from the syntax error.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="lesson-4-almost-everyone-needs-to-customize-their-builds">Lesson #4: Almost everyone needs to customize their builds</h3><p>Most teams have custom build steps, so extensibility is a key feature in any build system. Pants v2 is built around a <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview">plugin architecture</a>. You can write your own rules using the same API as the built-in functionality. So your custom build logic will enjoy the same fine-grained invalidation, caching, concurrency and remote execution abilities as the core Pants code.</p><h2 id="pants-2-0-0-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0 is out now!</h2><p>All this leads me to the happy announcement that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pantsbuild.pants/2.0.0/">Pants 2.0.0</a>, the first stable release of Pants v2, is out now! 2.0.0 is the culmination of years of design and development work, and many months of beta testing at several organizations. So we're really happy, proud (and relieved…) to finally have it ready for general use. </p><p>You can see what Python tools Pants currently supports <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python">here</a>. There are also commands for querying and understanding your dependency graph, and a robust help system. &nbsp;We're adding support for additional tools and features all the time, and it's straightforward to implement your own. Beta users have already written their own logic for Cython and docker, for example. </p><p>Now is a great time to adopt Pants 2.0.0! The team that developed Pants v2 is <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">ready to help you</a> onboard, answer any questions, and even pair with you to help you write any custom build logic. We're also eager to get feedback, bug reports and suggestions for what features we should focus on in the next weeks and months of development.</p><p>Pants v2 is developed by a helpful open source community, is funded by a 501(c)6 non-profit, and has excellent support available. If you have a growing Python codebase, and want to take Pants 2.0.0 for a spin, <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">let us know</a>. We'd love to fit you with some new Pants today!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>A frequently recurring staple of Hacker News is the <em>personal computing rant</em>: modern computers are black boxes, far too locked down.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> We long for our desktop computers, the early-2000s computing paradigm, and we want to take back control of our data.</p> <p>I sympathize greatly with this view. For the past five years, I have exclusively run Arch Linux. I love the early-2000s style of personal computing: text-heavy interfaces, words rather than icons, uniform keyboard shortcuts everywhere. I do nearly all my computing in emacs. It is feature rich, and no product manager is ever going to change the experience, interface, or shortcuts. My workspace allows me to be <em>fast</em>. Contrary to much modern software, emacs responds instantaneously to my keystrokes. Every action has an immediate effect, clear on the page, with no background process ambiguity. This is enormously satisfying. I would characterize this computing environment as a spiritual descendant of the typewriter: on its own, it is a dumb machine, but when you command it, it becomes a powerful extension of you. The user experience is given by speed, smoothness, reliability, and nothing else.</p> <p>On the other hand, you’ve got iPhones and iPads. These are not machines that you command – on the contrary, you might argue that all their notifications command you. With touch interfaces, facial recognition, and voice control, these are machines that are meant to merge with you. Instead of becoming an <em>extension</em> of you, it becomes <em>part</em> of you. Instead of you commanding it, it is meant to anticipate your commands. Where is the data? How does it work? Who knows. They’re total black boxes, effectively indistinguishable from magic, whereas your Linux Desktop is a DIYable simple machine.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p> <p>Many contemporary writers think of personal computing as one paradigm that is gradually evolving. I disagree: I think there are two, deeply different paradigms of personal computing, reflecting deeply different desires.</p> <ul> <li>Machine as extension of the self (your Windows XP Desktop).</li> <li>Machine as part of the self (your iPhone).</li> </ul> <p>Plenty of devices exist in the space in-between. Android phones try to give you some control back over your device, by which they necessarily preclude themselves from truly being <em>part</em> of you. Modern versions of OS X, with the touchbar, Siri, and integrations into all your other Apple devices, are starting to make the leap from extending the self to being part of the self.</p> <p>As a genre, the personal computing rant comes out of the correct view that these are all forms of personal computing, but it fails to recognize that within this broad umbrella, we’ve seen paradigms arise that differ in both intent and the human desire they’re meant to meet. It’s not that one class of devices is replacing the other. They are fundamentally different, and one paradigm succeeds where the other falls short of meeting the consumers’ needs. The terminal never met the needs of those who want Amazon Alexa, and vice-versa.</p> <p>I live in the in-between. I happily imagine a world where my Apple Watch monitors my glucose and blood oxygen, my Eight Sleep quantifies my rest, I mark up documents on giant touchscreens, but I sit on a clacky IBM keyboard to write code and blog posts in a terminal that hasn’t changed in twenty years. While your iPhone might meld with your mind by quantifying and anticipating your every need, my terminal melds with my mind by being fast, constant, and <em>always</em> correct. Each has its place, and I would never trade one for the other.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

  <p>
    Recent work by Dabney et al. suggests that the brain represents reward predictions as probability distributions
    <d-footnote>
      Experiments were conducted on mice using single-unit recordings from the ventral tegmental area.
    </d-footnote><d-cite key="dabney2020distribtionmice"></d-cite>.
    This contrasts against the widely adopted approach in reinforcement learning (RL) of modelling single scalar
    quantities (expected values).
    In fact, by using distributions we are able to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making process.
    Uncertainty is especially important in domains where making a mistake can result in the inability to recover
    <d-footnote>
      Examples of such domains include autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and the financial markets.
    </d-footnote>. Research in risk-aware reinforcement learning has emerged to address such problems
    <d-cite key="morimura2010risksensitive,chow2018riskconstrainedrl"></d-cite>.
    However, another important application of uncertainty, which we focus on in this article, is efficient exploration
    of the state-action space.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The purpose of this article is to clearly explain Q-Learning from the perspective of a Bayesian.
    As such, we use a small grid world and a simple extension of tabular Q-Learning to illustrate the fundamentals.
    Specifically, we show how to extend the deterministic Q-Learning algorithm to model
    the variance of Q-values with Bayes' rule. We focus on a sub-class of problems where it is reasonable to assume that Q-values
    are normally distributed
    and derive insights when this assumption holds true. Lastly, we demonstrate that applying Bayes' rule to update
    Q-values comes with a challenge: it is vulnerable to early exploitation of suboptimal policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    This article is largely based on the seminal work from Dearden et al. <d-cite key="dearden1998bayesianqlearning"></d-cite>.
    Specifically, we expand on the assumption that Q-values are normally distributed and evaluate various Bayesian exploration
    policies. One key distinction is that we model $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, while the
    authors of the original Bayesian Q-Learning paper model a distribution over these parameters. This allows them to quantify
    uncertainty in their parameters as well as the expected return - we only focus on the latter.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty</h4></div>
  <div><p>
    Since Dearden et al. model a distribution over the parameters, they can sample from this distribution and the resulting
    dispersion in Q-values is known as <b>epistemic</b> uncertainty. Essentially, this uncertainty is representative of the
    "knowledge gap" that results from limited data (i.e. limited observations). If we close this gap, then we are left with
    irreducible uncertainty (i.e. inherent randomness in the environment), which is known as <b>aleatoric</b> uncertainty
    </p><d-cite key="kiureghian2007aleatoric"></d-cite><p>.

    </p><p>
    One can argue that the line between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty is rather blurry. The information that
    you feed into your model will determine how much uncertainty can be reduced. The more information you incorporate about
    the underlying mechanics of how the environment operates (i.e. more features), the less aleatoric uncertainty there will be.

    </p><p>

    It is important to note that inductive bias also plays an important role in determining what is categorized as
    epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty for your model.
    </p><p>

    <b>Important Note about Our Simplified Approach:</b></p><p>

    Since we only use $$\sigma^2$$ to represent uncertainty, our approach does not distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

    Given enough interactions, the agent will close the knowledge gap and $$\sigma^2$$ will only represent aleatoric uncertainty. However, the agent still
    uses this uncertainty to explore.

    This is problematic because the whole point of exploration is to gain
    knowledge, which indicates that we should only explore using epistemic uncertainty.
    </p></div>


  

  <p>
    Since we are modelling $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, we begin by evaluating the conditions under which it is appropriate
    to assume Q-values are normally distributed.
  </p>

  <a href="#section-1" id="section-1"></a>
  <h2>When Are Q-Values Normally Distributed?</h2>

  <p>
    The readers who are familiar with Q-Learning can skip over the collapsible box below.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Temporal Difference Learning</h4></div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Temporal Difference (TD) learning is the dominant paradigm used to learn value functions in reinforcement learning
      <d-cite key="sutton1988tempdiff"></d-cite>.
      Below we will quickly summarize a TD learning algorithm for Q-values,
      which is called Q-Learning. First, we will write Q-values as follows <d-cite key="Sutton2017ReinforcementIntroduction"></d-cite>:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \overbrace{Q_\pi(s,a)}^\text{current Q-value} =
      \overbrace{R_s^a}^\text{expected reward for (s,a)} +
      \overbrace{\gamma Q_\pi(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})}^\text{discounted Q-value at next timestep}
    </d-math>

    <p>
      We will precisely define Q-value as the expected value of the total return from taking action $$a$$ in state $$s$$ and following
      policy $$\pi$$ thereafter. The part about $$\pi$$ is important because the agent's view on how good an action is
      depends on the actions it will take in subsequent states. We will discuss this further when analyzing our agent in
      the game environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the Q-Learning algorithm, we sample a reward $$r$$ from the environment, and estimate the Q-value for the current
      state-action pair $$q(s,a)$$ and the next state-action pair $$q(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})$$
      <d-footnote>
        For Q-Learning, the next action $$a^{\prime}$$ is the action with the largest Q-value in that state:
        $$\max_{a^{\prime}} q(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime})$$.
      </d-footnote>. We can represent the sample as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) = r + \gamma q{(s^\prime,a^\prime)}
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The important thing to realize is that the left side of the equation is an estimate (current Q-value), and the right side
      of the equation is a combination of information gathered from the environment (the sampled reward) and another estimate
      (next Q-value). Since the right side of the equation contains more information about the true Q-value than the left side,
      we want to move the value of the left side closer to that of the right side. We accomplish this by minimizing the squared
      Temporal Difference error ($$\delta^2_{TD}$$), where $$\delta_{TD}$$ is defined as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \delta_{TD} = r + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime) - q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The way we do this in a tabular environment, where $$\alpha$$ is the learning rate, is with the following update rule:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) \leftarrow \alpha(r_{t+1} + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime)) + (1 - \alpha) q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      Updating in this manner is called bootstrapping because we are using one Q-value to update another Q-value.
    </p>
  </div>

  

  <p>
    We will use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) as the foundation to understand when Q-values are normally
    distributed. Since Q-values are sample sums, then they should look more and more normally distributed as the sample size
    increases <d-cite key="lecam1986clt"></d-cite>.
    However, the first nuance that we will point out is that rewards must be sampled from distributions with finite variance.
    Thus, if rewards are sampled distributions such as Cauchy or Lévy, then we cannot assume Q-values are normally distributed.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    Otherwise, Q-values are approximately normally distributed when the number of <b><i>effective timesteps</i></b>
    $$\widetilde{N}$$ is large
    <d-footnote>
      We can think of effective timesteps as the number of <b>full</b> samples.
    </d-footnote>.
    This metric is comprised of three factors:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      $$N$$ - <b>Number of timesteps</b>: As $$N$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\xi$$ - <b>Sparsity</b>: We define sparsity as the number of timesteps,
      on average, a reward of zero is deterministically received in between receiving non-zero rewards
      <d-footnote>
        In the Google Colab notebook, we ran simulations to show that $$\xi$$ reduces the effective number of timesteps by $$\frac{1}{\xi + 1}$$:
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/brandinho/bayesian-perspective-q-learning/blob/main/Sparsity.ipynb">
          Experiment in a <span>Notebook</span>
        </a>
      </d-footnote>.
      When sparsity is present, we lose samples (since they are always zero).
      <!-- As sparsity increases, we essentially lose samples since they are always zero. -->
      Therefore, as $$\xi$$ increases, $$\widetilde{N}$$ decreases.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\gamma$$ - <b>Discount Factor</b>:
      As $$\gamma$$ gets smaller, the agent places more weight on immediate rewards relative to distant ones, which means
      that we cannot treat distant rewards as full samples. Therefore, as $$\gamma$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <div><h4>Discount Factor and Mixture Distributions</h4></div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We will define the total return as the sum of discounted future
        rewards, where the discount factor $$\gamma$$ can take on any value between $$0$$ (myopic) and $$1$$ (far-sighted).
        It helps to think of the resulting distribution $$G_t$$ as a weighted mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <d-math block="">
        G_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \gamma^2 r_{t+3} + ... + \gamma^{N-1} r_{t+N}
      </d-math>

      <p>
        When we set $$\gamma \lt 1$$, the mixture weights for the underlying distributions change from equal weight
        to time-weighted, where immediate timesteps have a higher weight. When $$\gamma = 0$$, then this is
        equivalent to sampling from only one timestep and CLT would not hold. Use the slider
        to see the effect $$\gamma$$ has on the mixture weights, and ultimately the mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <div>
        <div>

      </div>

      <p><label for="barGammaMixture">$$\gamma$$ = <span></span></label></p>

  </ul>

  We combine the factors above to formally define the number of effective timesteps:

  <d-math block="">
    \widetilde{N} = \frac{1}{\xi + 1}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\gamma^{i}
  </d-math>

  <p>
    Below we visually demonstrate how each factor affects the normality of Q-values
    <d-footnote>
      We scale the Q-values by $$\widetilde{N}$$ because otherwise the distribution of Q-values
      moves farther and farther to the right as the number of effective timesteps increases, which distorts the visual.

                <p>Take <strong>Uncle Bob's</strong> Clean Architecture and map its correspondences with <strong>Gary Bernhardt's</strong> thin imperative shell around a functional core, and you get an understanding of how to cheaply maintain and scale software!</p>
<p>This is what <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a> did. It's not every day that I find such clear insight.</p>
<p>I am honored to have found his <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/talks/#clean-architecture-python">presentation</a> and <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/slides/2014-07-pyohio/clean-architecture/">slides</a> explaining  <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture</a> and Gary Bernhardt's PyCon talks of <a href="https://archive.org/details/pyvideo_422___units-need-testing-too">2011</a>, <a href="https://pycon-2012-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fast_tests_slow_tests.html">2012</a>, and <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries">2013</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhodes offers such a distilled view, that he can show you these crucial concepts in 3 slides of code. I will go ahead and summarize what he said and add a tiny bit of my insight.</p>
<p>Copyright of all Python code on this page belongs to <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a>, and copyright of the diagram belongs to <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</a>. I use these under (hopefully) fair use (nonprofit and educational).</p>


<p>First of all, we need to be on the same page, in order to be able to understand each other. Here are the words I'll use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function: I use "function" or "pure function" to refer to a Python "function" that only uses its parameters for input, returns a result as output, and does not cause any other side-effects (such as I/O). <ul>
<li>A pure function returns the same output given the same inputs.</li>
<li>A pure function may be called any number of times without changing the system state - it should have no influence on DB, UI, other functions or classes.</li>
<li>This is very similar to a mathematical function: takes you from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> and nothing else happens.</li>
<li>Sadly we can't have only pure functions; software has a <strong>purpose</strong> of causing side-effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedure, Routine, or Subroutine: A piece of code that executes, that may or may not have side effects. This is a "function" in Python, but might not be a "pure function".</li>
<li>Tests: automated unit tests. By "unit" I mean not necessarily just a class, but a behavior. If you want, see more details in <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we have a piece of code that prepares a URL, then gets some data over the network (I/O), then validates the result (a word definition) and returns it.</p>
<p>This is a bit much: a procedure should ideally do one thing only. While this small-ish procedure is quite readable still, it is a metaphor for a more developed system - where it could be arbitrarily long.</p>
<p>The current knee-jerk reaction is to <em>hide</em> the I/O operations somewhere far away. Here is the same code after extracting the I/O lines:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 2</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>

    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>

<span>def</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>):</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>     <span># I/O</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>           <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>data</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Listing #2, the I/O is extracted from the top-level procedure. </p>
<p>The problem is, the code is still <strong>coupled</strong> - <code>call_json_api</code> is called whenever you want to test anything - even the building of the URL or the parsing of the result.</p>
<p><strong>Coupling kills software.</strong></p>
<p>A good rule of thumb to spot coupling is this: Can you test a piece of code without having to mock or dependency inject like Frankenstein?</p>
<p>Here, we can't test <code>find_definition</code> without somehow replacing <code>call_json_api</code> from inside it, in order to avoid making HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Let's find out what a better solution looks like.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 3</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>)</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>  <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?'</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>url</span>

<span>def</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>):</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the procedure at the top (aka. the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> of the program) is handling the I/O, and everything else is moved to <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> (<code>build_url</code>, <code>pluck_definition</code>). The <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> are easily testable by just calling them on made-up data structures; no Frankenstein needed.</p>
<p>This separation into an <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and <span><strong>functional core</strong></span> is an encouraged idea by Functional Programming.</p>
<p>Ideally, though, in a real system, you wouldn't test elements as small as these routines, but integrate more of the system. See <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a> to understand the trade-offs.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture chart</a> (Copyright Robert C. Martin aka. Uncle Bob) :
<img alt="The Clean Architecture" src="https://danuker.go.ro/images/CleanArchitecture.jpg"></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Use Cases</strong></span> and <span><strong>Entities</strong></span> (red and yellow circles of the chart) map to the <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> we saw earlier - <code>build_url</code> and <code>pluck_definition</code> from Listing 3, and the <span><strong>plain objects</strong></span> they receive as parameters and send as outputs. <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Interface Adapters</strong></span> (green circle) map to the top-level <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span>  from earlier - <code>find_definition</code> from Listing 3, handling only I/O to the outside (Web, DB, UI, other frameworks).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jj7ave/the_grand_unified_theory_of_software_architecture/gabst6z/?context=3">Update 2020-10-28</a>: A "Model" object in today's MVC frameworks is a poisoned apple: it is not a <a href="https://khanlou.com/2014/12/pure-objects/">"pure" object</a> or <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Humble%20Object.html">"humble" object</a>, but one that can produce side effects like saving or loading from the database. Their "save" and "read" methods litter your code with untestable side-effects all over. Avoid them, or confine them to the periphery of your system and reduce their influence accordingly (they are actually a hidden <span><strong>Interface Adapter</strong></span>) due to interacting with the DB.</p>
<p>Notice the arrows on the left side of the circles, pointing inwards to more and more abstract parts. These are procedure or function calls. Our code is called by the outside. <strong>This has some exceptions. Whatever you do, the database won't call your app. But the web can, a user can through a UI, the OS can through STDIN, and a timer can, at regular intervals (such as in a game).</strong> <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>The top-level procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>gets the input, </li>
<li>adapts it to simple objects acceptable to the system,</li>
<li>pushes it through the functional core,</li>
<li>gets the returned value from the functional core,</li>
<li>adapts it for the output device,</li>
<li>and pushes it out to the output device.</li>
</ol>
<p>This lets us easily test the functional core. Ideally, most of a production system should be pure-functional.</p>

<p>If you reduce the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and move code into the <span><strong>functional core</strong></span>, each test can verify almost the entire (now-functional) stack, but stopping short of actually performing external actions.</p>
<p>You can then test the imperative shell using <strong>fewer integration tests</strong>: you only need to check that it is <strong>correctly connected</strong> to the functional core.</p>
<p>Having two users for the system - the real user and the unit tests - and listening to both, lets you guide your architecture so as to <strong>minimize coupling</strong> and build a more <strong>flexible system</strong>.</p>
<p>Having a flexible system lets you implement new features and change existing ones <strong>quickly and cheaply</strong>, in order to <strong>stay competitive as a business</strong>.</p>
<p>Comments are much appreciated. I am yet to apply these insights, and I may be missing something!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2020-10-28:</strong> I have tried out this methodology in some small TDD Katas, and together with TDD, it works great. But I am not employed right now, so I can't say I've <em>really</em> tried it.</p>

<p>Posted by admin on 28 October 2020 at 06:15 CET. Latest update on 28 October 2020 at 17:02 CET.</p>
<p>A greedy bunch of bastards calling themselves "Voodoo Bear" sent an <a href="#mail">email</a> to my private email address announcing a DDoS attack aimed at TinyCert to take place, starting Monday 2 November 2020. They seem to be under the impression that there is a large company with deep pockets behind TinyCert, which I suppose is flattering. TinyCert is just a pet project of mine, that I find useful for myself and figured others might find it useful too.</p>
<h3>Ransom demands</h3>
<p>As you can see from the <a href="#mail">email below</a>, they are demanding a "small" $1000 ransom to call off the attack, increasing their demands by $1000 per day they are not met. TinyCert has been up for 6 years now and costs me about $200 per year to run ($1200 thusfar) and the total amount of <a href="https://www.tinycert.org/donate">donations</a> in that time has been $75, as I guess not enough people found it useful enough to consider donating. Thus, even if I <i>could</i> pay the ransom, I would not want to. If the site goes down, so be it, the version I use privately will be unaffected anyway.</p>
<h3>What can I do about it?</h3>
<p>Realistically, nothing. I could change the IP address by moving to another host or hosting provider, so that the attack goes to the wrong place. That would probably not be effective, at least not for very long. Besides, I would much rather the moronic dipshits waste their time and effort by attacking my little pet project rather than going after somebody who might actually pay them. Heck, if anything, they're saving me money if I have to shut down the site.</p>
<h4>Cloudflare?</h4>
<p>Using Cloudflare or similar services is not an option. The dumb idiots indicate they will attack the network directly (most likely the IP address of the server TinyCert is running on, rather than the actual network of my hosting provider). Since it is a very lightweight server, as TinyCert requires very little in terms of server resources, it won't hold up against a proper DDoS attack for any significant length of time. If anything, it will be interesting to see how well it holds up. For Cloudflare's protection to be effective, the IP address would first have to be changed (which in itself is easily done - I guess the criminals overestimate how much work it is to migrate a small website), but the Cloudflare SSL proxy is not suitable in the free tier. This is because the free tier does not allow the use of a custom certificate and TinyCert uses <abbr title="HTTP Public Key Pinning">HPKP</abbr>. There is also no way I could afford the higher tier that allows that.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has <a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1321320999678136325">offered Cloudflare's assistance</a> at no cost if needed. I hope it will not be necessary, but kudos to him and Cloudflare for their work and the kind offer.</p><h4>Open source?</h4>
<p>It has been suggested that I open-source the TinyCert codebase and allow people to have their own local versions, which of course wouldn't be affected. This too is not an option. Parts of the codebase are licensed to me personally and providing the source to them would be a breach of that license. Swapping that out for open source code would be possible, but time consuming and labour intensive and not something I am willing to do.</p>
<h3 id="mail">The actual email received</h3>
<p>Here is a copy of the email, for anybody who is interested.</p>
<div>
	<p>
		From: Robert Clark &lt;robertclark@coronaxy.com&gt;<br>
		Subject: If www.tinycert.org is important to you, you must read this<br>
		Date: Wed, 28 Oct 2020 02:13:37 +0000
	</p>
	<div><p>
		PLEASE FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO SOMEONE IN YOUR COMPANY WHO IS ALLOWED TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS!</p><p>
		==========================================</p><p>
		We are the Voodoo Bear and we have chosen www.tinycert.org as target for our next DDoS attack.<br>
		Please perform a google search for "Voodoo Bear" to have a look at some of our previous work.</p><p>
		Your network will be subject to a DDoS attack starting at 2020 November 2nd (Monday).</p><p>
		THIS IS NOT A HOAX, and to prove it right now we will start a small attack on www.tinycert.org that will last for 30 minutes.<br>
		It will not be heavy attack, and will not cause you any damage so don't worry, at this moment.</p><p>
		This means that your website, e-mail and other connected services will be unavailable for everyone.</p><p>
		We will refrain from attacking your servers for a small fee.<br>
		The current fee is $1000(USD) in bitcoins (BTC). The fee will increase by 1000 USD for each day after deadline that passed without payment.</p><p>
		Please send Bitcoin to the following Bitcoin address (cAsE-SeNsitIve):</p><p>
		[address removed]</p><p>
		You can easily buy bitcoins via several websites or even offline from a Bitcoin-ATM. We suggest you coinmama.com or https://buy.coingate.com/ for buying bitcoins.</p><p>
		Once you have paid we will automatically get informed that it was your payment. Please note that you have to make payment before the deadline or the attack WILL start!</p><p>
		If you decide not to pay, we will start the attack on the indicated date and uphold it until you do, there's no counter measure to this, you will only end up wasting more money trying to find a solution (Cloudflare, Sucuri, Imperva and similar services are useless, because we will hit your network directly).</p><p>
		We will completely destroy your reputation and make sure your services will remain offline until you pay.<br>
		We will also download your database and do as much damage as possible.</p><p>
		Do not reply to this email, don't try to reason or negotiate, we will not read any replies.</p><p>
		Once you have paid we won't start the attack and you will never hear from us again.</p><p>
		Please note that Bitcoin is anonymous and no one will find out that you have complied.</p><p>

<p>I literally laughed out loud at the first sentence, as it indicates how clueless these numbskulls are. Maybe I'll forward the email to my budgerigars, as they are the only other living beings in here, though I'm not sure they're qualified to make any decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> some users have reported receiving similar emails. On the one hand, that is a good thing, as it reduces the likelihood of (persistent) follow-through on the part of these scumbags. On the other hand, the more widespread this is, the more likely it is that somebody will give in and pay up. If you receive a threat like this, do not comply. It will only encourage them that their actions are successful and marks you as being susceptible to caving in to pressure.</p>
<p>So, Mr. "Clark" or "Voodoo Bear", whatever you hilariously pitiable imbeciles call yourselves, you can just fuck off. I have not for a nanosecond considered giving in to your demands, even if I could. You wanna waste your time to take down my pet project? Be my guest. My taking the time and effort to Write this page is the only thing you have "achieved" as you're not getting a penny from me. And thank you for thinking TinyCert something worthy of extortion - that means I must've done something right in creating it.</p>
<p>Well, there you go. It's been fun while it lasted. This is why we can't have nice things.</p>

<p><strong>MulticoreWare is a software development company that works on video compression, ML, heterogeneous computing, and championed the open-source x265 encoder in the past. They are now driving the x266 project to create an open-source VVC (Versatile Video Coding) encoder and use their experience from their UHDKit product to make it the premier open-source VVC encoder.</strong></p>




<h2><span id="Who_is_MulticoreWare"></span><strong>Who is MulticoreWare?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p><a href="https://multicorewareinc.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="MulticoreWare (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MulticoreWare</a> is a multi-faceted company with expertise in different verticals such as high-performance Video Compression, AI &amp; Video Analytics, ADAS (Automated Driver Assistance), etc. A common thread through these verticals is their ability to design and write high-performance code for various computing platforms. MulticoreWare’s background and experience are cool, in my opinion, and how they’ve nurtured and built a strong team in a very complex niche is admirable.</p>



<p>With teams in the US, India, China, and Germany, MulticoreWare is well-placed to don the role of a thought-leader in the open-source video codec world.</p>



<p>Let’s see why and what their plans are!</p>



<h2><span id="The_Road_To_x266_%E2%80%93_An_Open_Source_VVC_Encoder"></span><strong>The Road To x266 – An Open Source VVC Encoder</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG announced three new video codecs – VVC (Versatile Video Coding), EVC (Essential Video Coding), and LCEVC (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding). Of these three, VVC or H.266 is touted as the successor to H.265 (HEVC) and promises 50% more compression efficiency over HEVC but comes at a much higher complexity. Here’s a <a href="https://ottverse.com/vvc-evc-lcevc-mpeg-video-codecs/">brief explanation of all three</a> on OTTVerse.</p>



<p>But, first, let’s take a look at HEVC and the x265 encoder.</p>



<h3><span id="x265_and_HEVC"></span><strong>x265 and HEVC</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>MulticoreWare announced the <a href="https://x265.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">x265 project</a> back in 2013, and it was a success. x265 allowed video compression teams worldwide to get their hands on an efficient, standards-compliant HEVC encoder. x265 was made available under the open-source <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GNU GPL v2 license</a> and also offered by MulticoreWare under Commercial License Agreements.</p>



<p>But, having a good encoder clearly wasn’t enough. Because, fast-forward 7 years, and unfortunately, HEVC is still embroiled in patent-wars that seem destined to give it a “death by a thousand cuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEVC’s situation is rather unfortunate considering that HEVC had interesting features such as the use of quadtree-decomposition, large block sizes, the concept of TU, PU, and CUs, the Sample Adaptive Offset filter, new picture types, and several innovations which made it possible to compress 4K videos quite efficiently (in comparison to H.264/AVC).</p>



<h3><span id="The_x266_Project"></span><strong>The x266 Project</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Riding on the back of their x265 success, MulticoreWare has decided to pioneer the x266 project along the x265 project lines they worked on earlier. x266 will be an open-source project with the MulticoreWare video compression team’s full attention and the backing of an industry-consortium.</p>



<p>As with any new codec, there are always early adopters (both programmers and companies) willing to give it a try, evaluate, file tickets, and contribute code. But, to get the ball rolling, you need a reliable encoder that is not only standards-compliant but also reasonably fast and with enough presets and knobs to make the early-adoption both valuable and exciting (in a geeky-sense!)</p>



<p>I spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivakumarasu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shivakumar Narayanan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shivakumar Narayanan</a>, Senior Director – Marketing and Product Management at MulticoreWare, about the consortium, and this is what he had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Similar to when we did this for x265 consortium, to get key consortium members on board and invest in the development of this codec. These members will be founding partners with benefits when the codec (rather encoder is ready to release for the open-source world). Consortium members being strategic, will also play an important role in the shaping of this codec as well as prioritization of functionalities as it would pertain to their and their customers’ interests.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Industry involvement bodes well for the open-source community because <strong>video encoder implementation is both an art and a science.</strong></p>



<p>It helps to have a proficient team that understands and implements concepts such as wavefront parallelism, multi-threading, intrinsics, etc. to make codec implementations practical and useful. And, of course, people with “golden eyes” to spot issues with video quality as they occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MulticoreWare has such a team, and I feel they’ll bring their experience from x265 to the x266 development.</p>



<h3><span id="Expertise_from_UHDKit"></span><strong>Expertise from UHDKit</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Another product in MulticoreWare’s portfolio is <a href="https://x265.com/uhdkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UHDKit</a>. It is an extended encoding library built on top of the x264 (AVC) encoder and x265 (HEVC) encoder libraries. It has a better performance and feature-set than the vanilla x264, x265, and svt-av1 encoders. UHDKit comes in-built with powerful features such as a “control system for video compression” that dynamically adjusts settings to achieve better video quality based on the computing platform’s spec. </p>



<p>Additional features include fast ABR encoding (to get the bitrate ladder faster!) and high-performance live encoding, all this on software, without any requirement for additional hardware accelerators. It can be used as a standalone encoding library or can be invoked via the FFmpeg framework, which makes it seamlessly integrate into any software encoding/ transcoding pipeline.</p>



<p>I am sure some of this expertise from building UHDKit will rub off on the x266 encoder development.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Do_I_Get_my_hands_on_x266"></span><strong>How Do I Get my hands on x266?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Currently, MulticoreWare is working closely with x266 Consortium members and after a few months, it will be available to them.</p>



<p>Upon enquiring about the open-source implementation, here’s what MCW had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>For the larger open source community, it will be made available when we have reached critical mass required for its first release. As we near readiness, we will update here on how you can get hold of it.</em></p></blockquote>

  <p><span>08 Apr 2020</span></p><p>When you run the Ubuntu installer, there’s an option to dual-boot Ubuntu with an
existing Windows installation. There’s also an option to encrypt your Ubuntu
installation, but <em>only if you erase everything and install ubuntu</em>. There’s no
automatic way to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 with encryption. And while
there are plenty of tutorials for dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows, many of them
are outdated – often referencing an MBR partition table – and almost none of
them seem to address encrypting your Ubuntu partition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dual-booting with encrypted storage should not be this hard in 2020.</p>

  <p>–Me, while figuring out how to do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality, once you figure it out, it’s not that hard. The tricky thing is that
this isn’t well-documented <strong>anywhere</strong>! So I’m hoping to fix that with this
tutorial blog post. Honestly, if you know enough about Ubuntu to set up a
dual-boot with Windows, it’s only a little bit harder to do it with encryption.
I prepared this tutorial on a Dell Latitude e7450, and I fine-tuned it when I
tested it on my Dell Precision 5510. So it should work with almost no
modification on most Dell systems, and with only minor modifications
(particularly around BIOS setup) on most other types of computers.</p>

<h2 id="references">References</h2>

<p>To write this guide, I compiled information from several sources. Here are some
of the most useful references I found:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon/db2c9e5f6cc73bb37812a19a40e137bc">XPS 15 9560 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon">luispabon</a>. I followed these notes pretty
closely, but modified some partition sizes and names based on other guides.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon/221bdb597cf32b46c50ffab96dbec08a">XPS 15 9570 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon">mdziekon</a>, upon which the above is based.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019">Full Disk Encryption HowTo 2019</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is a great resource, but deals with
encryption without dual-booting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ManualFullSystemEncryption">Manual Full System Encryption</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is longer, and isn’t focused on
dual-booting, but provides great details on the way certain things work.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that this method doesn’t encrypt <code>/boot</code>. While there are
valid reasons for encrypting /boot, the graphical installer does not encrypt it
when you do a graphical install with LUKS. As such, I’m matching that precedent,
and keeping the simplicity of an unencrypted /boot partition. Thus, the guide
I’ve compiled below is just about the <strong>simplest way to have a LUKS encryption
with dual-boot.</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-encryption-is-important">Why encryption is important</h2>

<p>I began using encrypted storage on all my personal computers 5 or 6 years ago
after noticing that all the companies I’d worked for required it, and had good
reason to. Laptops get lost and stolen all the time. They’re high-value items
that are small and easy to carry. And when a thief gets your laptop, there’s
tons of valuable information on it that they can use or sell. Even if you use a
password to log in, it’s easy for an attacker to gain access to your data if
your disk isn’t encrypted – for example, by using a live USB stick. And once
they have that data, they might get access to online accounts, bank statements,
emails, and tons of other data. For me, an encrypted hard disk isn’t optional
anymore – its a necessity.</p>

<h2 id="an-overview">An Overview</h2>

<p>So what are we going to do? This tutorial will help you set up a system to
<strong>dual-boot Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10</strong>. (I haven’t tested it, but it should
work with most other modern versions (~16.04+) of Ubuntu or Windows.) The system
will use a GPT hard disk with UEFI (your BIOS must support UEFI). The Ubuntu
partition will be encrypted with LUKS.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The Windows partition can optionally
be encrypted with BitLocker. I’m going to keep the Ubuntu installation as close
to a “default” installation as possible – no fancy tricks like a separate
<code>/home</code> partition, but it should be somewhat easy to add that yourself if you
really want to.</p>

<p>I’m going to start with a blank hard disk, installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu
from scratch. If you already have Windows installed and you want to keep it, you
should be able to shrink your windows partition and join us in phase 3 (though
you might want to skim phases 1 and 2 to understand what we did).</p>

<p>To give you a broad overview of where we’re headed, here’s what we’re going to
do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prepare the installation media and computer</li>
  <li>Install Windows 10</li>
  <li>Create an encrypted partition for Ubuntu</li>
  <li>Install Ubuntu</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, as with any new OS installation, you should back up any important
data before proceeding. <strong>The instructions below will erase all the data on your
hard disk.</strong> Proceed at your own risk; I’m not responsible for any damage or
data loss.</p>



<p>Since we’re installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu from scratch, we’ll need a USB
stick for each. If you don’t already have a computer running Ubuntu or Windows,
making the installation media will be a little harder – but there are tutorials
for that and I’ll let you figure it out on your own.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Windows Installer USB stick.  The easiest way is to use the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/">Windows
10 Media Creation Tool</a> from a
computer that’s already running Windows.</li>
  <li>Create an Ubuntu 20.04 USB stick. The easiest way is to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">download the
ISO</a> and use the Startup Disk Creator on a
computer that’s already running Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Great! We’ve got our USB sticks ready to go! One final thing before we get
started – we need to make sure our BIOS is set up correctly. In particular, we
want to make sure we’re using UEFI to boot our OS.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/dell-bios.jpg" alt="The Dell BIOS"></p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Ensure your computer is running the latest BIOS available. This is important
because an out-of-date BIOS can have bugs, and those bugs sometimes affect
things like UEFI, non-Windows operating systems, or other components we’ll be
touching.</li>
  <li>Edit your BIOS settings. The following names are probably specific to Dell
BIOS, but other manufacturers will have similar settings.
    <ol>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Boot Sequence</code>, make sure your <code>Boot
List Option</code> is set to <code>UEFI</code>.</li>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Advanced Boot Options</code>, I disabled
<code>Legacy Option ROMs</code>. It’s important that both OSes install in UEFI mode.
(You can probably enable this when installation is complete if you care).</li>
      <li>Under <code>Security</code>, <code>TPM Security</code> must be enabled if you
want to easily set up BitLocker in Windows.</li>
      <li>I disabled <code>Secure Boot</code>. I’m not sure if this is absolutely required, and
you can try leaving it on or re-enabling it when you’re done if you want.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that our BIOS is configured for UEFI, we’re going to set up our hard disk.</p>

<div>
<p><b>For this tutorial, your BIOS must support UEFI!</b></p>
<p>Most modern computers support this, but if yours doesn't this tutorial won't
work for you. You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing only Linux with encryption using the graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Installing only Windows with encryption.</li>
  <li>OR Dual-booting Linux and Windows without encryption using Ubuntu's graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Finding another tutorial or figuring out how to do this with an MBR disk.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ol start="5">
  <li><strong>Completely erase</strong> your hard disk and set it up for UEFI by doing the
following.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
    <ol>
      <li>Boot your Ubuntu USB stick and use <code>Try without installing</code>.</li>
      <li>Open a terminal. Make it fullscreen while you’re at it.</li>
      <li>Figure out what your primary hard disk is called. It will probably be
either <code>/dev/sda</code> or <code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>. Importantly, it’s <strong>not</strong> <code>/dev/sda1</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1p1</code> – those are partitions of the disk. One way to figure out what
yours is called is to run <code>lsblk</code> and look at the disk size. Throughout the rest
of this guide, I’m going to refer to <code>/dev/sda</code>. <strong>If yours is not
<code>/dev/sda</code>, replace <code>/dev/sda</code> with your own (perhaps <code>/dev/sdb</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>) for the rest of this guide.</strong></li>
      <li>
        <p>Run the following commands. This will initialize the drive as a GPT drive
and create a 550M EFI system partition formatted as FAT32.</p>

        <div><div><pre><code>$ sudo su
# sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sda
# sgdisk --new=1:0:+550M /dev/sda
# sgdisk --change-name=1:EFI /dev/sda
# sgdisk --typecode=1:ef00 /dev/sda
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>OK, phase 1’s complete. We have our installation media ready to go and the
computer’s BIOS and hard drive is set up correctly. Next, we’ll install Windows.</p>

<h2 id="phase-2-install-windows">Phase 2: Install Windows</h2>

<p>In this phase, we’re going to install Windows. Note that when we do this, we’re
going to leave some unallocated space to install Linux later. This is a good
approach because the Windows installer will mess with our partitions a little
bit, and its easier to let it do so before finalizing our Linux partitions.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/windows-installer.jpg" alt="The Windows installer"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Boot from your Windows Installer USB stick.</li>
  <li>Choose a <code>Custom (advanced)</code> install to get to the Windows partitioning tool.</li>
  <li>Create a new partition. The size of this partition should be the amount of
disk space you want to use for Windows. In this example, I did 80G since the SSD
on my computer is relatively small. If unsure, do about half of your hard
disk.</li>
  <li>Windows will warn you that it is going to create an extra system partition.
This is good.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>Install Windows onto the partition you just made. There’s no need to format
any partitions – the Windows installer will take care of that for you.</li>
  <li>When the Windows installation is finished, log in and enable BitLocker on
drive <code>C:</code>. This will automatically create yet another partition on your disk
(a Windows recovery partition) - which is why we’re doing it before
partitioning for Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, you can start using Windows. But I’d avoid doing too much setup
or personalization yet so you don’t have to do it again if something goes wrong
below. If you want to double check your partitions, this is what you’ll be left
with after installing Windows and enabling BitLocker:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo sgdisk --print /dev/sda
Disk /dev/sda: 500118192 sectors, 238.5 GiB

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048         1128447   550.0 MiB   EF00  EFI
   2         1128448         1161215   16.0 MiB    0C01  Microsoft reserved ...
   3         1161216       167825076   79.5 GiB    0700  Basic data partition
   4       167825408       168900607   525.0 MiB   2700
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="phase-3-partition-the-drive-for-ubuntu">Phase 3: Partition the drive for Ubuntu</h2>

<p>This is the trickiest phase since this is where we need to manually set up our
encrypted disks for Ubuntu. We’re going to make it work very similar to …</p></div></div>

        <p>To talk about what no-code is good for, we need to first take a digression on what makes no-code fundamentally different from “yes-code” software.</p>
<h2 id="the-grain-of-abstractions">The grain of abstractions</h2>
<p>Software – yes-code software – has been around for a while. One of the things we’ve learned as an industry is how to write software <em>that gracefully evolves</em>. We’re not perfect – sad, legacy systems still proliferate – but we as a technical industry have learned how to build and evolve software systems against changing requirements and constraints that span years and decades.</p>
<p>When we first solve a problem with software, we write some code against the constraints of that particular day. We don’t necessarily know how the problem is going to change. Maybe there will be different customers or stakeholders tomorrow, or maybe the product will expand to serve a related, but different, problem space. We need to be able to change software to accommodate changing circumstances without rewriting it, and that is fundamentally what <em>software engineering</em> is: how to change software systems. <em>Change</em> is the name of the game.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten decent at change. We’ve built tools like Git and patterns like continuous integration and code autoformatting to make it easier to change code and remain stable. We’ve learned how to operate large software teams, especially in open source. We’ve also learned to use better abstractions. Abstractions are conceptual wrappers that isolate different parts of a codebase – say, a data source from a user interface – so that one part may change while another doesn’t. In general we have started to figure out how to make the DNA of software systems resilient against the changing tides of time.</p>
<p>No-code seems to reject a lot of those learnings, for better or worse. I haven’t seen any no-code company or product that allows source control (and I’ve seen many no-code companies, but you’re welcome to prove me wrong.) I have yet to find no-code products that allow for natural construction of abstraction between layers of a no-code workflow. No-code software is also scarily ill-prepared for large scale development: we have software systems being worked on by tens of thousands of engineers – what does it look like for a team of 1000 engineers to be working on a set of thousands of no-code workflows? Chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional software has learned the abstractions and patterns that make software resilient and adaptable to change and scale. No-code software is not ready for changing constraints nor development scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite these limitations, I think no-code has a few niches where making tradeoffs in adaptability and scale allows no-code tools to be much, much better. So, given this, <em>when is no-code useful?</em></p>
<h2 id="1-transitionary-ephemeral-software">1. Transitionary, ephemeral software</h2>
<p>The obvious answer, and one I had before our conversation, was <em>transitionary</em> software, software with <em>a defined lifetime</em>. If your software system has a finite, pre-defined lifetime and team, it doesn’t need to worry about changing constraints or team growth. It just needs to worry about solving a problem well, now.</p>
<p>Lots of software has predictably finite lifetime: a product prototype for an early-stage company, a game or app used as a part of an interactive online ad, a quick sketch or solution to patch a particularly urgent problem in a product, an app built for an event or a conference or a recruiting cycle or a quarterly goal tracker… all of these are projects with a pre-defined, maximum lifetime. They don’t need to last or grow or change – they just need to work now, and by giving up some of the adaptability of software abstractions of code, no-code software benefits from way faster prototyping speed. This is a plus.</p>
<p>I think we see lots of finite-time software in transitions. Transitions from having no product to having a product, in a prototype. Transitions in the process of brainstorming a solution and trying multiple designs. Software with a finite shelf life is a good fit for no-code tools.</p>
<h2 id="2-high-churn-code">2. High-churn code</h2>
<p>There’s another category of software for which long-term maintainability matters little – code with high churn.</p>
<p>By high churn, I mean that requirements are changing almost daily, and very little of the code written today will exist in a month or a quarter’s time. If the code you write today doesn’t have to last and evolve, because something new is going to take its place tomorrow, what matters is the speed to build, not resilience to change.</p>
<p>There’s lots of high-churn code in businesses. Marketing websites and landing pages, data pipelines for analytics, e-commerce storefronts, marketing campaigns, payment portals – requirements for these kinds of solutions change quickly enough that code is constantly being rewritten, and if code needs to <em>be replaced</em> more than it needs to <em>last</em>, no-code tools are a great fit.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-same-mistakes">Avoiding the same mistakes</h2>
<p>I think “no-code” is a misnomer. It leads us to think that no-code software is the start of a trend in which general software will involve less coding, and software engineering will become easier. This is not the case. Software engineering is not about building solutions, it’s about evolving them. But change resiliency over time is not the focus of no-code tools, and I think that’s ok.</p>
<p>I think no-code tools are instead an extension of a different trend: <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/text/">reifying workflows</a>. Business processes and workflows used to be documented in Word docs strewn about the office or on a shared folder, or even just passed down by oral tradition in companies. Now, we have tools that allow us to build these workflows, talk about them, edit them, and share them more concretely. This is a huge boon for more repeatable business processes and for getting things done quickly! I think this is the true win of no-code tools: concretizing workflows.</p>
<p>If no-code wants to be a serious competitor against “traditional” software – though I don’t think it should try – no-code needs to learn from the mistakes of early software. No-code tools need to understand that products and software systems need to live on for decades against changing teams and requirements, and against products and companies and standards that die out and get replaced. This requires a cultural shift, a tooling shift, and a new class of abstractions in our toolbelt as no-code engineers. Anytime we try to introduce more tooling and abstraction to no-code, I think no-code gets just a little more “code” in it. And perhaps that’ll bring us right back to where we started, discovering that code is good.</p>
<p>After all, the world is complex. And when we build software against the complexity of the world, that <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/complexity-conservation/">complexity needs to go somewhere</a>. Software is complex, but only as much as the world it attempts to make sense of.</p>
<p>It feels like we’re getting off the edge of a discovery phase of no-code, and into a time when we’re starting to understand what problems no-code tools are great for. I think it’s important that no-code tool builders focus on those strengths, or risk falling into the trap of repeating the software industry’s mistakes from the ground up.</p>

<h2>OfferMarket launched today on Product Hunt, and we failed miserably.</h2>

<div><p>
We tried launching on Product Hunt today, if that's what you'll call it. We half-assed it. We put together our launch post and asked a few friends to upvote.&nbsp;<span>6 hours in and we have 3 referrals to our site from Product Hunt.</span></p><p>

One person we asked for an upvote replied "I just like sold my soul to give you an upvote", here's what they were referring to in the sign up with Twitter authentication flow:
</p></div>

<div>
<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.offermarket.us/uploads/1/3/1/0/131040874/published/twitter-authorize-an-application-copy.jpg?1603845762" alt="Picture"></a></p>
</div>
</div>



<p>
Then we tried to have some people find us on Product Hunt, but they couldn't because their search doesn't work...<br>
</p>

<div>
<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.offermarket.us/uploads/1/3/1/0/131040874/published/producthunt-offermarket-search-no-results.png?1603845954" alt="Picture"></a></p>
</div>
</div>



<div><p>
So that's when we realized we probably were not going to be raising much awareness on Product Hunt this time around. It also made it clear that Product Hunt either has some bugs or performance issues, or the only people whose product launches percolate to the top of the daily rankings do one or both of the following:</p><ul>
<li>know a lot of people already on Product Hunt and build a following on Product Hunt before launch</li>

<li>coerce a lot of friends, family and others for upvotes</li>
</ul><p>
Which doesn't lend much credibility to the platform as a utility for finding valuable tools.</p><p>

Moving on then. We'll try again next time. We hope you enjoyed our post-mortem and how not to launch on Product Hunt.

<h2>Part 1: Introduction</h2>



<h3>Summary</h3>



<p>Game BASIC for Sega Saturn is a homebrew development kit that allows you to program games for the Sega Saturn using the BASIC programming language.&nbsp; If you’re familiar with the PlayStation’s Net Yaroze platform, think of this as the Saturn’s answer to it – just cheaper and easier to get started with.</p>



<p>Game BASIC’s use of the BASIC language makes for a very low barrier to entry in terms of programming skill.&nbsp; Though the Saturn is notoriously difficult to program for, Game BASIC makes it easy to get started and is surprisingly powerful, allowing very easy sprite manipulation and straightforward 3D polygon implementation.&nbsp; It even includes an adapter cable that allows you to communicate with the Saturn from your PC to transfer or save programs and streamline development.  For example, here’s a Pilotwings-esque demo, but in Game BASIC:</p>

</p><figcaption>“Jump” demo, provided with Game BASIC (video courtesy <a href="https://www.satakore.com/sega-saturn-game-basic,,GBSSCD_G_JUMP_A,,GBSS-CD-Jump-Multi-Controller-Version-Bits-Laboratory.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satakore.com</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The caveat?&nbsp; Game BASIC was released only in Japan, so this means a complete setup can be difficult to obtain and all documentation is in Japanese!&nbsp; Moreover, the supporting software that allows you to use your PC for streamlined development was intended for the Windows 95 era and flat out does not install on modern systems. Oh, and the adapter cable that allows you to connect your Saturn to your PC is a 25-pin serial connection!</p>



<p>Who in the world still has both Game BASIC and a Windows 95 PC with a physical serial port? Nobody!&nbsp; (Well, unless you’re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_QU8eaMymo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Vintage Gamer</a>) But if you’re a brave experimenter who’s not afraid to tinker a bit, there are still multiple options to get everything working, even today!&nbsp; You can even do a lot just via emulation.&nbsp; So, let’s head to the Lab and get started…</p>



<h3>What You’ll Need</h3>



<p>There are several options for working with Game BASIC, ranging from quite simple but clunky to work with, to quite powerful and streamlined.&nbsp; Here are the three options:</p>



<h4>The Simple Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A copy of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games (A Japanese or modded console, a Pro Action Replay/<a href="https://ppcenter.webou.net/pskai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pseudo Saturn Kai</a> cartridge, or a Saturn emulator)</li><li>Any Saturn controller</li><li>Plenty of room in the Saturn’s internal memory (if you want to save your programs)</li></ul>



<p>For this option, you’ll run Game BASIC on the Saturn with no PC connection, using only standard Saturn accessories.&nbsp; This is a reasonable choice if you just want to write “Hello, World!”-style programs or play around with the neat games and demos that come with the kit.&nbsp; Theoretically, you can write even the most complex programs this way, but you’ll run into limitations on the size of games you can save to the Saturn’s internal memory.&nbsp; Plus, programming with a virtual keyboard is an absolute pain.&nbsp; Start here if you don’t have the necessary hardware for the other options, or if you just want to poke around a bit and see what this is all about.</p>



<h4>The Enhanced Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>All of the tools from Option 1, PLUS</li><li>Some kind of external expanded memory, such as:<ul><li>A direct-save memory cartridge (e.g., the official Saturn Backup Memory)</li></ul><ul><li>A Sega Saturn Floppy Disk Drive and some 3.5″ floppy disks</li></ul></li><li>A Sega Saturn keyboard OR the NetLink keyboard adapter with a PS/2 keyboard</li><li>Fun peripherals, like the Stunner light gun, 3D Control Pad, multi-tap, and Shuttle Mouse</li></ul>



<p>One of the great things about Game BASIC is how easy it makes it to access the Saturn’s peripherals, including the internal backup RAM, external memory cartridges, and even the Saturn Floppy Disk Drive.&nbsp; With a setup like this, you’ll have plenty of space to save your programs and you can use a real keyboard for text entry.&nbsp; You can even start experimenting with different forms of input, like analog controls and light guns!&nbsp; But without access to the tools a PC provides, it will be difficult to make nice-looking sprites, textures, and 3D models.&nbsp; So, this will still limit what you’re capable of.&nbsp; Regardless, this is a great option for the sheer fun factor of “Hey look! I’m programming with my Saturn!” or if you have no ability to connect your Saturn to a PC.</p>



<p>You can even go this route with a Saturn emulator, giving you easy access to improved keyboard, mouse, and storage options.&nbsp; I’ve confirmed that Mednafen successfully emulates Game BASIC and allows for keyboard and mouse pass-through input, meaning you can do a whole lot of Saturn development with very little barrier to entry.</p>



<h4>The Full Saturn plus PC Setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A complete Game BASIC for Sega Saturn kit, including:<ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Windows 95 Tools disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>The special Saturn-to-PC serial cable adapter</li></ul></li><li>A modern PC with a USB port, capable of running a Virtual Machine (I use VirtualBox)</li><li>A copy of Windows XP SP3 32-bit to install on a VM</li><li>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/USB-Serial-Adapter-Prolific-PL-2303/dp/B003WOWBBW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USB-to-Serial adapter</a> (Must support RS232 with a DB25 connector)</li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games on original hardware (Japanese or modded console, or a Pro Action Replay/Pseudo Saturn Kai cartridge)</li><li>A Saturn controller</li><li>Optionally, any fun Saturn accessories you may want to experiment with (I especially recommend a keyboard or keyboard adapter)</li></ul>



<p>This is the Cadillac option!&nbsp; This is the setup I use, is how Game BASIC was really intended to be used (well, except nobody expected it to be run on a VM, I suppose), and is what the rest of this guide will focus on.&nbsp; With this setup, writing a game is as simple as writing BASIC in a text editor and hitting a couple of buttons to send it to your Saturn, where it immediately shows up on your TV and responds to controller and keyboard input!&nbsp; Seriously, it’s super cool once you get it working…</p>



<p>The Simple and Enhanced Saturn-only setups are extremely straightforward.&nbsp; You just boot Game BASIC like any other Saturn game and get started, so there’s not much configuration to discuss.&nbsp; Regardless of the setup you choose, continue on to Part 2 for a few test programs.&nbsp; But if you want the Full setup, it’s quite a project to get going, so read on to Part 3 for the complete How-To!</p>
