<article>
<p><span>At the beginning of 2019 StorageOS embarked on a significant development effort to build v2.0 of our product. The cloud native landscape had significantly changed since the inception and subsequent release of StorageOS v1.0, with Kubernetes emerging from the container orchestrator battle royale as the clear winner. We observed two key trends amongst our customers and the industry in general.</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, customers wanted to run bigger clusters – in the 10’s or even 100’s of nodes. Secondly, customers wanted to run multiple clusters and for the clusters to interact in various patterns. We designed StorageOS 2.0 to address these trends.</span></p>
<p><span>Given the significant development effort to create StorageOS v2.0, we wanted to ensure the testing toolkit and workflow we used was up to the task of verifying our reliability and scalability. At StorageOS, product testing is undertaken by the Product Reliability Engineering (PRE) team, and we tasked ourselves with engineering a new testing framework and suite of tests to do justice to the product the company was building.</span></p>
<p><span>Our previous testing framework (known internally as ‘vol-test’) was based around a set of libraries and scripting tools that included the ability to provision a variety of environments on a variety of platforms for the tests to run in. Vol-test also included functional, end to end, stress and benchmarking tests for the StorageOS API as well as StorageOS running in Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span>While feature rich, we often found ourselves wanting a more expressive language and toolset. Additionally, the provisioning and testing functions were closely coupled – which made the system inconvenient to work with at times. We staged our own version of the perennial engineering ‘re-write or improve’ debate and settled on separating the testing and provisioning functions and focusing on a better way to write and execute tests. What we ended up with was three systems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>T2Infra – </span><i><span>a provisioning framework for creating reproducible environments quickly</span></i></li>
<li><span>T2 – </span><i><span>a testing framework and suite of tests to verify StorageOS behaviour and API outside of Kubernetes</span></i></li>
<li><span>Kubecover – </span><i><span>a testing framework and suite of tests to run within Kubernetes</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span>A major consideration was what language to create the new testing frameworks in. The two languages that we considered were Python and Golang; the former due to ease of use and our team’s familiarity with it and the latter because Kubernetes and surrounding projects are often written in Golang. Perhaps more importantly, much of StorageOS is written in Golang too.</span></p>
<p><span>The use of a common language between our Reliability Engineers and our Software Engineering colleagues is a great advantage when testing, as it allows for closer collaboration and tightened development cycles. The static typing and easily accomplished concurrency that Golang offered has been extremely welcomed and has helped to drive development of significantly more complex tests at a significantly reduced cost.</span></p>
<p><b>T2Infra – Fast environment provisioning using Ignite/Firecracker</b></p>
<p><span>T2Infra is a provisioning framework that lets us stand up testing environments quickly. We generally run our tests on </span><a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/"><span>Firecracker</span></a> <span>VMs (for more information about Firecracker check out this </span><a href="https://unixism.net/2019/10/how-aws-firecracker-works-a-deep-dive/"><span>blog </span></a><span>by Shuveb Hussain) by leveraging the </span><a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite"><span>Ignite</span></a> <span>project from our good friends at </span><a href="https://www.weave.works/"><span>Weave</span></a><span>. In essence, Ignite provisions Firecracker virtual machines that run StorageOS containers. That seems like a lot of layers of abstraction but this combination of tooling gives us; highly reproducible, quick to provision, isolated environments for running tests.</span></p>
<p><span>These qualities are important to us as a reproducible environment translates directly into more deterministic tests, while fast provisioning times allow us to spin up a fresh environment for every test. Using a new environment per test means that tests do not “cross-contaminate” one another further increasing the reliability of our tests.</span></p>
<p><b>T2 – Testing outside of Kubernetes</b></p>
<p><span>T2 is a testing framework that was created to test and verify the behaviours of StorageOS while driving StorageOS via its API. The framework consists of libraries to access the StorageOS API, to cause various kinds of ‘chaos’, provide test orchestration functions, and of course, the tests themselves.</span></p>
<p><span>Because we are using lightweight VMs, we have familiar tools available to us for introducing controlled disruption into the test environment. For example we leverage </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables"><span>IPTables</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/ipset"><span>IPSet</span></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/tc"><span>TC</span></a> <span>to cause network partitions, inject latency and restrict bandwidth between nodes. These tools are controlled via the T2 framework during test runtime so changes are entirely dynamic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For additional insight into the test environment, it is important to collect both logs and traces from inside our VMs. Running additional containers inside the VMs such as the </span><a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/"><span>Jaeger</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.fluentd.org/"><span>Fluentd</span></a> <span>agents for collecting traces and logs is simple to do with systemd manifests. As each test spins up its own environment it is easy to collect and separate traces and logs from different tests. For more insight into how important tracing is for understanding a distributed system </span><a href="https://dgraph.io/blog/post/solving-jepsen-with-opencensus"><span>Manish Rai Jain from Dgraph</span></a><span> wrote an interesting blog about how he used tracing and Jaeger to squash a bug exposed by </span><a href="https://jepsen.io/"><span>Jepsen</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><b>Kubecover – Adding Kubernetes to the mix</b></p>
<p><span>While T2 is useful for testing StorageOS in a dedicated, predictable environment, the final arbiter of StorageOS as a product is of course how we behave within Kubernetes – since this is how our customers run our product.</span></p>
<p><span>Kubecover is a testing framework written in Golang that uses the </span><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go"><span>Kubernetes </span></a><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go"><span>Golang</span></a> <span>client directly as well as the </span><a href="https://github.com/storageos/go-api/tree/master/v2"><span>StorageOS API</span> <span>Client</span></a> <span>to drive tests of StorageOS within Kubernetes clusters. Our Kubecover framework leverages great work by </span><a href="https://github.com/darkowlzz/"><span>darkowlzz</span></a> <span>to make </span><a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/"><span>Kubernetes in Docker</span></a><span> (Kind) work with Ignite as a backend instead of Docker. The changes allow us to spin up a Kind cluster with each Kind “node” running on a separate Ignite provisioned Firecracker VM. The advantage of using Kind is that we can spin up local and test environments in a matter of seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>Given the many popular Kubernetes distributions that exist we can also use Kubecover binaries in testing pipelines that run against other Kubernetes distributions. For example we routinely run tests against managed Kubernetes services such as AKS and EKS, as well as various versions of upstream Kubernetes running on cloud infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Why have two separate testing frameworks?</b></p>
<p><span>The reason for having two separate test frameworks is separation of concerns. T2 is for end to end testing of the StorageOS container, driven via the StorageOS API, while Kubecover is for testing StorageOS integration with, and behaviours in Kubernetes, driven via the </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/15/container-storage-interface-ga/"><span>CSI</span></a><span> interface. Kubernetes adds layers of abstraction that are not always helpful in the end to end testing of StorageOS, so testing StorageOS behaviour is something we generally handle in T2. Testing of Kubernetes specific behaviours then takes place in Kubecover. In general our approach is to first verify the StorageOS API behaviour before adding testing of behaviours running StorageOS in Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span>For a more specific example of how we make these distinctions, consider testing of volume resize. We first tested volume resize in T2 to verify that the StorageOS API is behaving correctly and the feature works as we expect it to. Once the correct behaviour was verified, we wrote tests in Kubecover to ensure that CSI resize requests were also being handled correctly. The resize requests in Kubernetes are generated by editing the size of a Persistent Volume Claim so requests come via the CSI API.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>How do we spec our tests?</b></p>
<p><span>In order to have a consistent and clear description each test gets its own </span><a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/"><span>Gherkin</span></a> <span>spec, so the test is described in a </span><span>`GIVEN, WHEN, THEN`</span><span> syntax. The test spec should give the reader a clear indication of what the test is going to do and provides context for the test code itself. Having a consistent approach to documenting our tests has made it easy for anyone in our team to triage a test failure and understand what the test is doing. This approach is particularly helpful when it comes to more complex test cases.</span></p>
<p><span>Typically we begin spec’ing out tests by following the “happy path”. For example the “happy path” spec for resizing a volume looks like the below:</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN the volume is resized to size y where y is greater than x</span>

<span>THEN the volume will display its new size</span>

<span>AND the block device size will reflect this size</span>

<span>AND the filesystem will reflect a new larger size</span></pre>
<p><span>The happy path test is important as it proves that the feature works as expected. The next priority is an “unhappy path” test that proves the API is not just accepting and actioning any and all requests, whether valid or not.</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN the volume is resized to size y where y is less than or equal to x</span>

<span>THEN the resize will fail with an easy to understand error</span></pre>
<p><span>Once a happy and unhappy path has been set we investigate cases where failure is assumed. For example in cases of concurrent requests, it is important that we only action the first, and error the rest, as detailed in the following spec:</span></p>
<pre><span>GIVEN an unattached volume of size x</span>

<span>WHEN two concurrent resize requests are made to size y and size z</span>

<span>THEN only one resize will be actioned</span>

<span>AND the other request will receive an error response</span>

</pre>
<p><span>As the StorageOS control plane guarantees linearisable volume updates, one of the concurrent resize requests will fail because each resize request will be using the same volume object version. The first request to reach the API will cause a version bump so the subsequent request will be failed. However there are also linearisable operations that we verify work as intended, such as having </span><a href="https://docs.storageos.com/docs/concepts/replication/#delta-sync"><span>replicas rejoin</span></a> <span>while a resize is occurring. Once the replicas have rejoined they should also reflect the new size of the volume.</span></p>
<p><b>How we run our tests</b></p>
<p><span>We run all of the tests in T2 against development containers throughout the day. …</span></p></article></div></div></div></div>

            <h2>Important &amp; Helpful Notes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Never use a custom domain name - these require some of your personal information when being registered. Even with whois privacy protection, certain law enforcement can demand for these credentials.</li>
                <li>Feel free to use a VPN, though Tor is more than enough for your needs.</li>
                <li>Whenever you boot Tails OS, it will load with a fresh install. To keep files on the USB even when shutdown, look into using <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html">Encrypted Persistent Storage </a>. Please note: <i>this is not recommended</i> for obvious security risks.</li>
                <li>Run your articles through multiple translation converters. Edit minor mistakes afterwards. This avoids engines and tools picking up on your writing style.</li>
                <li>Always backup your articles. The safest bet is to use <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a></li>
                <li>Don't expect to collect revenue with your blog. It is extremely difficult to accept payment without some form of tracking to your personal information. If anything, maybe allow your users to donate to a charity you would like to support.</li>
                <li>WordPress is the suggested blog platform but there are others to choose from:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://write.as/">Write.as</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Try your best to avoid publishing articles on your home or work network. Make a trip to the local coffee shop during busy hours and post it then.</li>
                <li>Randomly select different times to publish articles. Avoid creating a trackable pattern.</li>
                <li>Never work on anything related to your blog unless using the burner laptop and Tails OS. This might seem simple, but one little slip-up is all it takes.</li>

July 10, 2020 | http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/slovianto1.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/slovianto1.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><b>Slovianto</b> is a highly simplified form of Interslavic that allows non-Slavic people to express themselves at a very basic level when visiting Slavic countries or maintaining contact with Slavs via the Internet. Grammar is limited to a bare minimum, and forms that are not strictly necessary are not used at all. Because it does not contain anything that cannot be found in the Slavic languages, the result wil not look or sound too awkward to Slavic speakers, but rather remind them of the kind of language used by small children.</p><p>Slovianto can also be used as a first step in the process of learning the „real” Interslavic language. It has been constructed in such way that it can gradually be expanded with new bits and pieces that occur in more complex versions. Thus, we distinguish three different levels, each of them adding new elements that bring Slovianto closer to Interslavic:
</p><p>The working title <b>Slovianto</b> is a portmanteau word for „Slavic Esperanto”. This name, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, refers to the simplicity of Slovianto: it has no gender, no cases, no aspect, little conjugation and no irregularity. Yet, that is where the similarity to Esperanto ends, because Slovianto's means of simplification are in fact far more similar to those used by Interlingua.</p><p>Slovianto can be written in the Latin alphabet and the Cyrillic alphabet, but we will concentrate on the Latin alphabet here:

</p><p>In the <a href="http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/en-ms.html">Interslavic dictionary</a> you will find other characters as well, like <b>ò</b>, <b>ų</b>, <b>å</b> or <b>ť</b>. You can simply ignore the diacritics and read them as <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>t</b> etc. That goes for <b>ě</b>, too. The only characters that keep their diacritics in Latin orthography are <b>č</b>, <b>š</b> and <b>ž</b>. If you find writing them inconvenient, you can always use <b>cz</b>, <b>sz</b> and <b>zs</b> (or <b>cx</b>, <b>sx</b> and <b>zx</b>) as an alternative.</p><p>Accentuation is fairly free. What matters more is that you speak slowly and clearly. As a general guideline, it would deserve recommendation to put stress on the antepenultimate syllable.</p><div width="90%"><tbody><tr><td>

							<p>PARIS — The French Parliament unanimously agreed on Thursday to introduce a nationwide age verification system for pornography websites, months after President Emmanuel Macron pledged to protect children against such content.</p>
<p>Macron made the protection of children against adult content online a high-profile issue well before the coronavirus crisis hit. In January, tech companies, internet services providers and the adult movies industry <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/les-fournisseurs-d-acces-des-acteurs-du-web-et-marc-dorcel-s-engagent-pour-proteger-les-mineurs-du-porno-20200117" target="_blank">signed a voluntary charter</a>, pledging to roll out tools to help ensure minors don’t have access to pornographic content.</p>
<p>Within a broader law on domestic violence, the Senate decided <a href="https://www.publicsenat.fr/article/parlementaire/porno-le-senat-bloque-l-accessibilite-des-sites-aux-mineurs-183097" target="_blank">in June</a> to introduce an amendment requiring pornography websites to implement an age verification mechanism.</p>
<p>In order to enforce the law, the French audiovisual regulator CSA will be granted new powers to audit and sanction companies that do not comply — sanctions could go as far as blocking access to the websites in France with a court order.</p>
<p>The choice of verification mechanisms will be left up to the platforms. But lawmakers have suggested using credit card verification — a system first adopted by the U.K., which mulled similar plans to control access to pornography but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/16/uk-drops-plans-for-online-pornography-age-verification-system" target="_blank">had to drop them</a> in late 2019 because of technical difficulties and privacy concerns. Italy also approved a <a href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/gu/2020/06/29/162/sg/pdf" target="_blank">similar bill in late June</a>, which raised the same concerns over its feasibility and <a href="https://www.key4biz.it/filtro-anti-porno-nicita-agcom-limiti-tecnici-norma-pillon-a-rischio-disapplicazione/312167/" target="_blank">compliance with the EU laws</a>.</p>
<p>As private actors could implement their own solutions, the new law also highlights the challenges of digital identification. In Brussels, there are growing calls to introduce an EU-wide digital ID system that would allow users to bypass Google and Facebook’s identification ecosystem. For politicians, including French Junior Digital Minister Cédric O, systems of identification online are <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">a matter of digital sovereignty</a>.</p>
<p>The Senate has already voted on the bill. Following an agreement today between senators and lawmakers from the lower house National Assembly, a final vote will be held again in the Senate where the bill is expected to pass.</p>
<p>Senators have also suggested using FranceConnect, a tool developed by the state to help users connect to public services such as tax collection and health insurance.</p>
<p>In the face of skepticism and privacy concerns from campaigners, O has since <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">denied</a> that the national connection tool would be used.</p>
<p>"We voted on one principle, which is to give the CSA the obligation to monitor the protection of minors, but the CSA is free to find the right way for sites to comply with their injunction," the text’s rapporteur in the Senate Marie Mercier told POLITICO.</p>
<h3><strong>Minitel rose</strong></h3>
<p>Key actors from the French porn industry have long called for new measures to modernize a French law which was drafted at the time of the “Minitel rose,” a very popular pornography service in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“[With this law] we can already fine up to 75,000 euros and three years of prison, but no one applies it,” said Mercier.</p>
<p>The conservative politician worked on the amendment after hearings with French pornography producer Marc Dorcel, ex-adult actress-turned-documentary-director Ovidie and child protection NGOs.</p>
<p>“Most of those who abide by the law feel that it’s unfair that the [sites] keep doing their business without restriction," Mercier added.</p>
<p>For years, one of the most difficult tasks for French regulators has been finding a way to enforce local laws on foreign services.</p>
<p>With this new law, if the site does not comply within 15 days after a first warning from the audiovisual regulator CSA, the regulator will be able to ask the Paris Court of Justice to send an order to telecom operators to block the access to these sites from France.</p>

        <p><i>posted on 29 May 2020</i></p><p>Yes, you read it right! Don’t let the feature requests you receive from your customers drive your product roadmap. Instead, let the real problems they are facing do.</p>

<p>Nearly 4 years ago, when I had just transitioned from engineering to product management here is how I used to respond to one of the most important questions that you get asked as a product manager.</p>

<p><a href="https://akshayd.in/2020/05/29/Don-t-let-feature-requests-from-your-customers-drive-your-product-roadmap!/">Read More</a></p>

<!--more-->

<p><span>Question</span> - Why do you think this feature should be on the roadmap? <br>
<span>Answer</span> - Because customers XYZ and ABC have asked for it
</p>
<p>It sounds naive in the hindsight but I’ve cut myself some slack given it was my first time as a product manager.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we as product managers consider the number of customers that have asked for a particular feature as a parameter to add weight to the decision of adding it to the roadmap. However, it is easy to fall prey to this vanity metric by right away acknowledging the feature request as a gap in your offering that needs to be filled without analysing the feature request thoroughly. Analysing your customers’ feature requests in a proper manner will help you identify the right set of problems your customers are facing. Many times, you will realize that the problem does not have to be solved by the exact feature the customers are suggesting.</p>

<p>While there are numerous ways in which one could dissect the feature request , the <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/02/the-5-whys.html"><b>FIVE WHYS framework</b></a> provides a simple and effective way of getting to the core of the problem.  The 5 Whys framework is an iterative interrogation technique to determine the root cause of the problem by repeatedly asking the question -  “Why” . Here is an example of my recent experience of using this framework to address a customer’s feature request.</p>

<div>
<p><span>Customer</span> : We’d like an API endpoint to fetch the loyalty information of users. </p><p>
<span>Me</span>: Could you please let us know why you would want an API endpoint since you already have this information in the members’ report? </p><p>
<span>Customer</span> :   We’d like to build an automated process of getting the information via an API every night and dump that information at an FTP location ?</p><p>
<span>Me</span> : Alright, sounds good. Could you please tell me why you would want to dump this information at an FTP location ?  What happens after you dump it to FTP location.</p><p> 
<span>Customer</span> : We have crons that would read the information and sync the information with the contacts in Hubspot CRM . </p><p>
<span>Me</span> : Okay. Why do you sync the loyalty information in Hubspot ? </p><p>
<span>Customer</span> :  We want to use the loyalty information to be included in the marketing emails that we send.</p><p>
<span>Me</span> : We already have Hubspot integration underway exactly for this use case. Every time the loyalty information of the user changes, the change will be synced with the Hubspot user profile automatically with the integration. You could then set triggers in Hubspot to send out emails with the loyalty information. 
</p></div>

<p>In the above example, although it seemed like a feature request for a new API endpoint, the ultimate job that the customer was looking to get done with this API was to include the loyalty information in the marketing emails sent via Hubspot. The actual problem was unearthed by repeatedly asking the question “Why”. Evidently, the plethora of information this framework gives you as you go deeper layer by layer not only helps you reach to the core of the problem but also gives you holistic insights about it. You may choose any other framework that helps with problem analysis. The bottomline is to ensure that you thoroughly understand the rationale behind the feature request.</p>

<p>Customers will often ask you the world. More often than not, the feature requests your customers raise if considered verbatim, have the potential to derail your product strategy. Tending to such feature requests without peeling the layers of the onion may help you pacify a couple of customers but will harm your product in the long run. For a winning product strategy , it is very imperative to choose solving those problems that align with your product and company goals.</p>

<p>After all , effective product management is not just about solving problems but about choosing  the right set of problems to solve.</p>

<p>This has been an interesting year! When the pandemic came and left us all housebound, I used it as an excuse to do some remedial work I’d been dreading—moving Pinboard onto modern versions of PHP and MySQL. Things had gotten to the point where I couldn’t even run a bug-for-bug identical copy of the site on a modern laptop, and the servers themselves were overdue for system upgrades. 

</p><p>Much of the core code on the site dated back to 2009-2010 and was written by Past Me, a vindictive, inscrutable nemesis who devoted his life to sabotaging Present Me. 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/past_me.jpg">

</p><p><i>Past Me laying his snares in 2009.</i></p>

<p>Doing this on a live system is like performing kidney transplants on a playing mariachi band. The best case is that no one notices a change in the music; you chloroform the players one at a time and try to keep a steady hand while the band plays on.  The worst case scenario is that the music stops and there is no way to unfix what you broke, just an angry mob. It is very scary.

</p><p>But I got it done! It helped in this process that I was in Japan, since I could do most work at night while my US/European customers slept or wept into their phones or whatever it is people do at night nowadays. 

</p><p>The site is now on a 2020 foundation (specifically, it’s on PHP 7 and a current MySQL), and with everything less brittle I can start making bigger changes. One of those is to make the site look okay on mobile phones, now that I’m finally convinced they aren’t a fad. You can see the beginnings of this reworking on the <a href="https://pinboard.in/about/">about page</a> and in other corners of the site.

</p><p>Another is to finish the new API. The current one was designed to be a drop-in replacement for the old Delicious API and lacks important features, like any way to say “show me stuff that has changed since timestamp X”, or interact with Pinboard features that weren’t present in Delicious.

</p><p>Another analogy I’d use for this kind of upgrade work is clearing a disused garden. In the process you may unearth remarkable stuff—an old wagon wheel, a Roman urn—hiding among the weeds. But it’s mostly interesting to you, and not to the people who are waiting in line at your vegetable stand.

</p><p>In my case, I found the skeletons of dead features (remember placemarks?) as well as spectral ghosts of defunct services like Google Reader, Readability, and of course Delicious itself, which now slumbers peacefully while I try to figure out a way to bring it up without dealing with the waves of automated spam still pointed at the site. But I’ll save that for another post.

</p><p>Now that I have a fresher memory of how the site works, and am not so afraid of touching anything, I look forward to doing some long-delayed feature development.
 
</p><p>Meanwhile, thanks to everyone for using the site for another year! Not everyone gets to be around long enough to have to do major upgrades, and I am grateful to be in that position, thanks to all of you.

<p>Another new blog on the internet – aren’t there already enough of
those? <a href="http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs">Some would say
no</a>.
I, for one, am a fan of the open, interoperable, indie web,
even if that seems to stack the cards against you.<sup id="fnref:indie-disadvantage"><a href="#fn:indie-disadvantage">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I’ll keep this introductory post brief. We<sup id="fnref:we"><a href="#fn:we">2</a></sup> want to start a SaaS
product, and while there seem to be awfully many “founder stories”
around of people magically getting 50k downloads, $10k MRR, etc., we
don’t often hear about the long, rocky path to sustainable success.
There’s often scant detail about the initial steps: ideation,
validation, etc. Also, all these whiz-bang success stories suffer
from enormous survivorship bias. Not to mention they leave us normal
folks feeling quite inadequate, when in reality there’s enormous luck
involved, too.<sup id="fnref:luck"><a href="#fn:luck">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, “failure” isn’t sexy. As a result there seem to be few
resources online talking about the things people have tried that
<em>haven’t</em> worked. We want to take a more optimistic view. From each
“failure” we hope to learn things, get better at what we’re trying to
do, so that 10 years from now, looking back, we can point at all the
hustle that goes into trying to Build Something.</p>
<p>We figured we might as well challenge ourselves to get something out
there, right now, instead of waiting until perhaps one day if and/or
when we manage to create something successful. This way, at the very
least we’re keeping ourselves accountable by publicly writing about
what we’re trying, and who knows, we might be able to say something
that someone somewhere finds useful. We’re also very keen for
feedback, so any and all input is more than welcome. Ideas, critique,
links to resources, we want it, our inboxes are open. Have a look at
the <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/contact/">Contact us page</a> if you want to get in touch, or try our
low-budget comments box down below!</p>
<p>We’re just trying to muddle along making our own way here, so we’re
bound to have many a false start, but we are trying something new to
us – <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/mailing-list/">join us for the ride</a>, and we’ll see what happens!</p>

  </div>
</div>


<p>The COVID-19 crisis has put a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/business/economy/coronavirus-inequality.html">spotlight</a> on the dramatic growth of inequality, with the wealthy able to take refuge in holiday homes while many workers living paycheck to paycheck cannot afford to socially isolate. Somewhere in between are middle-class families that have been mostly able to ride out the storm by staying inside but at the same time are becoming increasingly aware of how precarious their security — financial and otherwise — really is.</p>



<p>Over the previous decade, no book has done more than Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” to bring the question of economic inequality back on the public agenda. At the core of Piketty’s argument is the famous formula “r &gt; g,” which he takes to be the central law of capitalism. Now emblazoned on t-shirts and coffee mugs, the formula expresses the idea that, in the absence of remedial state intervention, the return on capital (r) will grow faster than the economy (g).</p>



<p>Piketty tells the story of the runaway (and accelerating) growth of wealth at the very top, which is not in doubt. As governments eased post-World War II financial regulations over the past few decades, unrestrained capitalism created returns on assets that grew at far higher rates than GDP.</p>



<p>Where Piketty’s story is less convincing is in explaining how this trend continues in spite of growing discontent and widespread awareness of its harmful consequences. Piketty claims that the concentration of private wealth has led to the growth of a plutocracy: the concentration of political influence in the hands of the super-wealthy. But this isn’t an explanation; it just raises other questions, like why do electorates keep voting governments into office that facilitate this concentration of wealth? It is strange to see an otherwise politically middle-of-the-road scholar like Piketty embrace what is essentially a crude Marxist understanding of the capitalist state as a plaything in the hands of the wealthy.</p>



<p>The sustained acceleration of wealth at the top in a democratic society is only comprehensible if we recognize that this trend has been embedded in a wider middle-class politics that has come to center on housing and, in particular, property inflation.</p>

      “As other flagship projects of the neoliberal era floundered, the politics of middle-class aspiration came to increasingly revolve around homeownership.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>During the mid-20th century, Anglo-American countries, in particular, managed to promote widespread homeownership through a variety of policies. This <span data-note="John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) was a British economist famous for his theories of government influence on business and the economy; he argued that fiscal regulation is necessary to maintain stable economic growth.">Keynesian</span> model of capitalism brought property ownership into reach for those without access to inherited wealth. Being a wage-earner (someone who, in Marx’s famous phrase, has nothing but his labor-power to sell) was no longer a condition that condemned people to a marginal existence based on getting by from day to day. It was now a social status that could give people a concrete stake in the capitalist social order. Although this state of affairs was characterized by pernicious gender and racial hierarchies, the creation of a broad-based middle class should nonetheless be seen as a unique historic achievement.</p>



<p>The Keynesian model worked on the basis of steady annual wage growth. As the post-war era progressed, this became associated with consumer price inflation that eroded the value of assets. Neoliberalism always had its own, distinctive middle-class politics that centered on the idea of an ownership society. The supply-side doctrine of trickle-down economics was only the crudest expression of an ideology of democratized capital that was integral to the entire project of neoliberal capitalism. Inclusion in the benefits of capitalism was to come not from state protections and the power of unions but from full commitment to the spirit of entrepreneurialism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was among the first to understand the emotional appeal of that prospect when, in the midst of her attacks on unions and the public sector, she offered working-class residents the opportunity to buy the homes they had until then rented from the public sector. This, it was hoped, would serve as a buy-in to the psychology of investment and encourage ordinary people to see themselves as asset-holders rather than workers.</p>

      “In many large cities, it is virtually impossible to break into the property market just on the basis of an average wage.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>The ideology of democratized capital found expression in three key areas: pensions, human capital and housing. The risks associated with pension privatization were never lost on people, but the upward march of stock markets for much of the 1990s refocused attention on the seemingly boundless opportunities offered there. But as stock markets fizzled in the early 2000s, dreams of pension-fund capitalism largely faded along with them. Dreams of human capital too reached their zenith in the 1990s, when <span data-note="“Third way” ideas emphasize moderate social, political and economic policies to reconcile left-wing and right-wing political partisanship. Key “third way” politicians include Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.">“third way”</span> thinking in the context of the <span data-note="The idea of a “new economy” arose during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s to refer to the transition from a manufacturing-based economy to one driven by services and information technology.">“new economy”</span> held out the prospect that highly skilled knowledge workers could monetize their educational assets.</p>



<p>It is really only in the area of housing that the promise of democratized asset ownership found lasting traction. Success in this area derived in large part from the fact that it could build directly on the legacy of democratized homeownership left by the Keynesian era. Liberalizing credit markets appeared to be the most readily available way to push homeownership rates up further. The upward pressure on house prices that this entailed initially led primarily to a democratization of the <span data-note="The “wealth effect” is the change in spending that occurs when people perceive that their wealth has increased.">“wealth effect,”</span> which also became an important source of economic growth.</p>



<p>Over time, it became tempting for governments to respond to each economic slowdown by boosting the housing market, in the process creating an economy that was more and more dependent on stimulus from the wealth effect of asset inflation. As other flagship projects of the neoliberal era floundered, the politics of middle-class aspiration came to increasingly revolve around homeownership.</p>

<p>The home became an asset rather than simply property — an investment that was expected not merely to generate returns but also capital gains. As people with stagnant wages and unstable employment bought houses with large amounts of debt, it became more and more important for those houses to appreciate in value. At least initially, this wealth effect helped to compensate for stagnant wages. The Keynesian household became a <span data-note="Hyman Minsky was an American economist who lived from 1919 to 1996. He is often referred to as a “post-Keynesian” economist, and his work stresses the role of uncertainty, speculation and debt in the economic system.">Minskyan</span> household, increasingly dependent on the speculative returns on its investment. Capitalism itself transitioned to a Minskyan phase, where the continued appreciation of an asset was a precondition for being able to finance it.</p>



<p>But of course, the very logic of credit-driven home purchases pushed prices up to heights where it was increasingly difficult to enter the market. Property inflation benefits the already propertied and excludes aspiring middle-class households from the housing market. In the U.S. as well as in other countries, including the U.K. and Canada, homeownership rates show a particular pattern over the period from 1980 to 2020 — an upward trend followed by a downward trend. Property inflation over time eroded the possibility of buying a home on the basis of a wage alone. In many large cities, it is virtually impossible to break into the property market just on the basis of an average wage.</p>



<p>The crisis of 2007-8 did significant damage to the reputation of housing as a democratic generator of wealth, but things have become significantly worse since then. Defying widespread expectations, housing markets in large urban centers rebounded with a vengeance. This has raised the bar for entry dramatically: The same salary that would have allowed someone to buy into the property market 10 years ago no longer allows that, because in some places, property prices have doubled in the meantime.</p>

    <p>
      “Housing inflation has built a new class structure that revolves around asset ownership instead of employment.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>The post-crisis era has also exposed a generational rift. The consequences of property inflation are felt particularly acutely by millennials. Many members of that generation played by all the rules yet, by their mid-20s, still find themselves without any real prospect of a middle-class existence — unless, of course, they have wealthy parents willing to help. Because property gets passed from one generation to the next, it makes little sense to frame the problem in terms of boomers against millennials. The millennial phenomenon is so important because it is in that age cohort that the fault lines produced by four decades of sustained property inflation are becoming highly visible.</p>



<p>This has hardly gone unnoticed, but widespread concerns have yet to translate into significant policy changes. Policymakers and politicians are increasingly concerned about issues of housing affordability, but any policies designed to address the problem are inevitably double-edged: Measures, like lower interest rates, that bring property ownership into reach for some simultaneously push prices up further. In other words, we face a situation of policy lock-in, whereby policymakers can only improve things in the short term by making them worse in the long term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I see a common pattern with startups and teams I’ve advised or been a part of. I call it the Software Over-specification Death Spiral, or SODS for short.</p>



<p>It looks like this:</p>



<ol><li>Product Manager (or CEO, Engineering Manager, etc) drafts up some sort of specifications or requirements for a new feature or product.</li><li>Product Manager (or CEO, Engineering Manager, etc) drafts up some sort of specifications or requirements for a new feature or product.</li><li>The requirements are handed over to the engineering team to implement.</li><li>The engineering team “implements” it, but gets some things wrong. One bucket of things that are prone to being wrong could be things that were so obvious that the PM thought they weren’t worth making explicit. Another bucket are corner or edge-cases that the PM didn’t think of.</li><li>The PM is surprised at this, and work has to be redone.</li><li>In an effort to prevent this in the future, both the PM and the engineering team agree that requirements need to be more detailed.</li><li>Surprise: despite the increased details in requirements, the engineering team still gets it wrong.</li></ol>



<p>In each iteration of this loop, everyone agrees the requirements just need more details, but every time that happens, things are still wrong. What’s going on?</p>



<h4>Breeding Code&nbsp;Monkeys</h4>



<p>You’re breeding code monkeys, is what’s happening. Software is complex and malleable, and no set of specifications or requirements will ever be complete. There will always be behavior that requires some “filling in the blanks” at implementation time. The person doing the implementation needs to be able to either:</p>



<ul><li>Recognize when they should ask for clarification, or, preferably,</li><li>Be able to fill-in-the-blanks correctly.</li></ul>



<p>Counterintuitively, once you have this problem, the more you try to weed out ambiguity in requirements, the more likely you are cause <em>the opposite</em> effect of what you’ve want. Engineers turn off the part of their brain that they would use to think through product decisions, and become, essentially, “code monkeys” that just do what they’re told.</p>



<h4>A Better&nbsp;Way</h4>



<p>Does that mean you shouldn’t write specifications or requirements, or you should right <em>less? </em>Well, let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater just yet. Specifications are important, but if you’re missing key pieces, they can make your problem worse.</p>



<p>At a high-level, when you’re building software, there are three questions to answer:</p>



<ol><li>What the software does—requirements and behavior</li><li>Why it does what it does—actual problem it solves for its users</li><li>How it does what it does—the actual implementation</li></ol>



<p>These three are all related. SODS occurs when engineers try to do #1 and #3 without understanding #2. As Simon Sinek would say, “you must start with why”.</p>



<p>It’s on both the PM and the engineering team to understand “the why”. A few suggestions for PMs (and engineers):</p>



<ul><li>Hire or worth with engineers who are inclined to understand the product, because they could be users themselves or because they have some other interest in the product space (or, as an engineer, try to help build <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">products that you would use</a> or that you find interesting).</li><li>Make sure you explain <em>why</em> something is worth building (or, as an engineer, make sure you understand that, and if you don’t, ask).</li><li>Push engineers to be involved in <a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-software-engineers-be-involved-in-product-decisions" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">product decisions</a> (or, as an engineer, try to be involved in various pre-implementation parts of the product lifecycle).</li><li>Undertake other activities that help engineers build product intuition. Engineers can spend time with users, spend time understanding your products analytics, etc.</li><li>If you really want to test whether an engineer is thinking about “the why”, have an engineer write the specifications for a feature of reasonable size, and then have the PM review them. If they can’t even attempt that, that’s usually a bad sign (though the worst sign of all is if they absolutely don’t want to even try).</li></ul>



<p>Don’t fall victim to SODS.</p>

<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>2</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><h2>Couples with fertility issues will also see a change in citizenship benefits</h2>



<p>Canadian families are as diverse as Canadians themselves, and everyone deserves the same rights and opportunities, no matter who they love or how they identify.</p>



<p>In recognition of the diversity of <a href="http://citizenship/" target="_blank" aria-label="Canadian  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Canadian </a>families, the Honourable Marco E.&nbsp;L. Mendicino, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, today announced a change in the interpretation of “parent” under the Citizenship Act. The change allows non-biological Canadian parents who are their child’s legal parent at birth to pass down Canadian citizenship to their children born abroad in the first generation.</p>



<p>“I am very happy to announce this historic and positive declaration made by Quebec’s Superior Court. This change by Immigration Refugees and Citizenship <a href="http://citizenship/" target="_blank" aria-label="Canada  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Canada </a>means that non-biological legal parents at birth and biological parents are now viewed equally as a child’s parent for the purposes of citizenship by descent. Canadian LGBTQ2+ families and parents experiencing fertility issues have waited too long for this important day. I know this was a difficult and stressful time for the Caron / van der Ven family, and Canada is grateful to them for the courage and strength they have shown in righting this wrong.”</p>



<p><strong>– The Honourable Marco E.&nbsp;L. Mendicino, P.C., M.P., Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship</strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://www.thedailyscrum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/canadian-citizenship-benefits.jpg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.thedailyscrum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/canadian-citizenship-benefits.jpg"></figure>



<p>This new interpretation helps Canadian parents who have relied on assisted human reproduction to start a family, including members of the LGBTQ2+ community and couples with fertility issues. Until now, a child born abroad was automatically recognized as a citizen at birth only if the child shared a genetic link to the Canadian parent or if the child was born to a Canadian parent in the first generation.</p>



<p>“Getting citizenship for our son was a long, sometimes hurtful and frustrating journey. We are extremely happy and relieved that the court corrected this discriminating policy, not only for our family, but also for many same-sex and non-traditional families around the world who could not get Canadian citizenship for their children. We are very thankful to IRCC for implementing the new changes so quickly, and above all, to our lawyers Olga Redko and Audrey Boctor, without whom we would never have gotten this far. – <strong><em>Laurence Caron and Elsje van der Ven</em></strong></p>



<p>This change is the result of the advocacy of the Caron / van der Ven family, who sought a durable solution through the court system to address situations where some children of parents using assisted human reproduction did not acquire citizenship automatically at birth. The Superior Court of Québec affirmed that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s (IRCC) new interpretation of “parent” recognizes equally biological parents and legal parents at birth, and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects this interpretation under the law.</p>

	<div>
		<div>
			<p>I was such an idiot. I gave up literally $125,000 to do dropshipping.</p>
<p>You see, I quit my $250,000 a year job to go do dropshipping.</p>
<p>I spent 6 months dropshipping, fulltime. That was all I did. The opportunity cost of that was massive.</p>
<p>I also lost $2000 USD after spending $12,000 on Facebook ads and Instagram shoutouts.</p>
<p>And if I had to go back in time to March 2019, I’d yell “Stop!!! Don’t do dropshipping! Do this other thing instead!”</p>
<p>And in fact, as early as May I had read a anti-dropshipping thread that explained why dropshipping was a bad first venture. I should’ve listened. I should’ve paid more attention.</p>
<p>But alas, here we are.</p>
<p>Wait, what is “that other thing” I’d have told myself to do?</p>
<p>Well, I guess you’ll just have to read until the end to find out 🙂</p>
<p>Now don’t let this blog post discourage you, because online business is a worthy goal. But there are other online businesses you should consider that may be cheaper.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can learn something from my $2000 mistake. If this post helps save you some money, then I will consider myself a happy man.</p>



<p>You might be thinking: well, I bet he didn’t spend enough time on it. Or I bet he just didn’t want to spend money (or was too afraid to). Or maybe he didn’t read enough about copywriting / marketing.</p>
<p>Well let me talk a little more about my dropshipping experience so you can know if this post is for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I had a ton of time</strong>. The 6 months I spent dropshipping was basically full-time. I had no job (didn’t need one). I freelanced myself about $2000 for a rate of about $60/hour, plus some credit card signup bonuses ($300 here and there), to fund the dropshipping venture
<ul>
<li>So no, there’s no “laziness” or “not enough effort” excuse. That was a solid 6 months. This venture should’ve “worked” by then. It didn’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I was well read</strong>. I’d read Charlie Munger’s Psychological Checklist. Influence. All the recommended copywriting books, direct response books (e.g. Scientific Advertising, Ogilvy’s stuff). Really. I’d read a lot man. I didn’t slack on this dropshipping venture.</li>
<li><strong>I had a bunch of money</strong>.&nbsp;I had enough savings from my previous job to last me a lifetime (<em>easily</em>). But I’ve never started a business. I really wanted to start a business. And it wasn’t going to be in-person. If I’m gonna start a business, it better be online.
<ul>
<li>What was my previous job? I was a software engineer in Silicon Valley. Living extremely frugally. I had enough money.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, I was dropshipping from Aliexpress. I used Shopify. I watched all the Youtube videos of James Holt, Gabriel St Germain (appears to be the most legit dropshipper there).</p>
<p>OK? So I had everything going for me (theoretically at least). Why did I end up ditching dropshipping?</p>

<p>There’s one main reason: it’s really expensive.</p>
<p>You can learn the same thing for a lot cheaper. And I mean&nbsp;<em>a lot</em> cheaper. And possibly even better too.</p>
<p>Well there are other reasons too:</p>
<ul>
<li>A) It’s really expensive</li>
<li>A2) Split testing is EXPENSIVE in dropshipping</li>
<li>B) The learning curve for dropshipping is extremely steep, due to many skillsets needed to make it work</li>
<li>C) A lot of headaches come with scaling a winner in dropshipping</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="A)_It%E2%80%99s_really_expensive"></span>A) It’s really expensive.<span></span></h2>
<p>How much budget do you need to start a dropshipping business?</p>
<p>Well, the fake gurus out there will tell you only need $300 to start a dropshipping business. “<em>And you too can make $10,000 a month!</em>” Ah, SMH.</p>
<p>It’s true. To&nbsp;<em>start</em>, you only need maybe $100. Shopify subscription, domain name, a couple Shopify plugins, maybe an Instagram shoutout.</p>
<p>But to do it&nbsp;<em>properly</em>, a real marketing venture, you need wayyyy more than $300. And I mean WAY more. I’m talking $10,000 – $15,000 range.</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you mean Muhima? How can it cost that much?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah well I’m talking about&nbsp;<em>testing</em> ads, testing products.</p>
<p>To run all those tests, you need a lot of money. To buy data.</p>
<p>And how many tests will it take to find a winner?</p>
<p>The best dropshippers I’ve watched on Youtube and the best marketers I followed on Twitter all have a hit rate of about 1 in 10. Or 10%.</p>
<p>To test a product, you need to run 3 tests, running different emotional angles. 1 headline/image for each one.</p>
<p>What does each test cost? The rule of thumb is to run the ad to 3x gross margin in loss. For example, if you make $30 gross margin on your product ($40 price point, dropshipped from China for $10 each), then you need to run the test to $90.</p>
<p>So each product you’re testing out costs $270, at minimum.</p>
<p>But wait, lets say you had one promising angle returning -20% ROI (which is good). Then you gotta run 2 more variations off that. Lets say you change up the image/video creative. Boom, that’s another $270.</p>
<p>Ok, now zoom out. Remember the best marketers have a hit rate of 10%. Oh shit. 10 times $270 is how many? $2700 already. Oh shit.</p>
<p>But wait, you’re a newbie. You’re not experienced like those guys. And besides, what if you have a run of bad luck? So your likely hit rate is no better than 5%. To give yourself a margin of safety, ideally you want to have a budget twice that, just in case. How much are we at now? 20*$270 * 2 = $10,000+</p>
<p>Yeah man. It’s expensive to do dropshipping right.</p>
<p>Believe me, there are other internet businesses that don’t require as much starting budget to do right.</p>
<h2><span id="A2)_Split_testing_is_EXPENSIVE_in_dropshipping"></span>A2) Split testing is EXPENSIVE in dropshipping<span></span></h2>
<p>And I mean EXPENSIVE.</p>
<p>True split testing requires statistically significant data (lets say at least 90% statistical significance. Really it should be 95%, but some people relax the standard to 90% in the interest of trying to hit green sooner)</p>
<p>Do you know how many conversions you need to reach statistical significance?</p>
<p>3 conversions ain’t gonna cut it bro. 10 isn’t going to do it either.</p>
<p>I’m talking at least 50-100, if you’re trying to split-test a 20% improvement. I’ve had split-tests run up to 200 conversions.</p>
<p>So lets call it between 100-200 conversions.</p>
<p>It really takes A LOT of data to hit statistical significance.</p>
<blockquote><p>Muhima, What does this mean for dropshipping? How much does it cost to split test in dropshipping?</p></blockquote>
<p>Lets say you’re testing a clothing product for $40. What’s 50 conversions? Oh SHIT. $2000?</p>
<p>HOLY SHIT. You need $2000+ just run ONE split test?</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Are you starting to see why you need a BIG budget to really learn marketing with dropshipping?</p>
<p>You’re only learning marketing if you’re doing split tests — everything else is just throwing shit at the wall. You don’t&nbsp;<em>really</em> know what works. It’s just guesswork.</p>
<h2><span id="B)_The_learning_curve_for_dropshipping_is_extremely_steep,_due_to_many_skills_required_(i_e_many_moving_parts)"></span>B) The learning curve for dropshipping is extremely steep, due to many skills required (i.e. many moving parts)<span></span></h2>
<p>Compared to this other business model I ended up switching to, there are MANY moving parts in dropshipping.</p>
<p>If you’re new to internet marketing, it’s going to be difficult to troubleshoot. As a professional software engineer, oh man. Add just one moving part, and the complexity of your project may have doubled or tripled.</p>
<p>Yes there are people who’ve succeeded with dropshipping, but it’s not easy for a beginner to pickup.</p>
<p>Here’s a running list of skills you need to succeed in dropshipping:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing ads</strong>. You have to know what makes a good image/video. You have to learn how to write click baity titles (since you’re bidding CPM, not CPC). If you want to do a good job, you should learn how to spy on competitor’s ads and how to analyze them.</li>
<li><strong>Writing pre-sales landing page</strong>. Chances are pretty good you’re not writing pre-sales page if you’re a newbie. And no, “product description” does NOT count, SMH guys. I’m talking something like a survey lander, or just a good old sales letter with a headline and some inspirational story “This 95 year old woman feels like a 20 year old doing yoga on this yoga mat!”</li>
<li><strong>Writing the sales funnel</strong>. Are you going to be doing free+shipping or straight up product sale with $20+ margin? How are you going to do upsells? Downsells? Cross sells?</li>
<li><strong>Monetizing backend with emails</strong>. With Facebook CPMs on the rise, I saw a lot of marketers adapt by taking a slight loss on the frontend offer and try to make it up in the backend. LTV man. Well if you’re a newbie – oh man. It’s tough.</li>
<li><strong>Building out a professional, branded-looking website</strong>. Hopefully this is the easier part for you. But there are still many who find the task of building out a Shopify website daunting.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling a winner when you have one</strong>. This is the easier part. But still easy to fuck up if you’re not careful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you a newbie? Take a quick pause and look at what you have to figure out.</p>
<p>There’s like at least 5 variables you have to troubleshoot or test.</p>
<p>Really tough learning curve. Very steep.</p>
<h2><span id="C)_A_lot_of_headaches_come_with_doing_big_sale_numbers_on_dropshipping"></span>C) A lot of headaches come with doing big sale numbers on dropshipping<span></span></h2>
<p>Lets say you’ve got a winner and you’re trying to scale it as hard as you can.</p>
<p>Congrats! That’s an accomplishment! (And also sure to be short-lived — grab as much as you can before competition comes in).</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more challenges!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paypal withholding</strong>. Paypal has a reputation for suddenly closing your account. Just like Stripe, they’re wary of dropshippers.There was a funny joke I read on Reddit about this. Some guy said he had $20,000 in his Paypal and another guy says: “How are your balls so big, I can’t even imagine” LOL.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe will close your account</strong> if they find out you are dropshipping, even if your refund rate is less than 1%. Dropshipping is against their Terms of Service. How will you get another Stripe account? And all the money in the Stripe account goes poof. It’s not yours anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Refunds will come. High refund fees.</strong> You have to pay a $20 chargeback fee&nbsp;<em>in addition</em> to a full refund.</li>
<li><strong>Bad cash flow</strong>. Paypal/Stripe may keep a healthy reserve of your funds, for about 60-90 days. Your FB ads (which is your primary cost) is billed monthly. So this is bad for your cash flow.</li>
<li><strong>Need to hire customer support agency</strong>. Eats into your profit margin. Or else you spend hours each day answering customer support emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>Long story short, it’s tough to make dropshipping a truly passive business. You definitely need to dedicate at least a few hours a day to tending the garden so to speak.</p>

				</header>

				<h2 id="the-common-approach"><a href="#the-common-approach">The Common Approach</a></h2>
				<p>The common approach to JWT authentication seems to be using a short-lived JWT in javascript's memory and a longer-lived JWT in an HTTPOnly cookie for re-issuing the in-memory token after it's expired. The security benefits of this have never made much sense to me since the cookie's token can just be used to retrieve an in-memory token itself. More work with no benefit.</p>

				<p>The longer-lived token for re-issuing the short-lived token generally contains information for invalidating the session. This means session access cannot be <em>guaranteed</em> revoked for however long the short-lived token is potentially active.</p>

				<h2 id="the-best-of-both-worlds-approach"><a href="#the-best-of-both-worlds-approach">The Best of Both Worlds Approach</a></h2>
				<p>This approach allows for fast throughput requests and infrastructure savings by reducing database lookups to "dangerous" actions while allowing session revocation before any dangerous action is performed.</p>

				<p>What's a dangerous action? That's up to you and your app needs to determine. While developing this approach any Create, Update, or Delete action or token re-issue was considered dangerous, while any Read action is safe enough that they're allowed during the short-lived token's window without verification.</p>

				<p>This means any revoked session will have, at most, minutes to view the account, but cannot alter any data associated with it.</p>

                <h2 id="the-basics"><a href="#the-basics">The Basics</a></h2>				<p>This is the basic setup:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Data stored in token:
						<ul>
							<li>Short lived expiration time.</li>
							<li>User ID.</li>
							<li>Session ID.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>JWT stored in HTTPOnly cookie.</li>
					<li>Session ID is a "shared session" stored in user database.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="the-implementation"><a href="#the-implementation">The Implementation:</a></h2>
				<h3 id="jwt-cookie"><a href="#jwt-cookie">JWT Cookie</a></h3>				<p>Storing the JWT in an HTTPOnly cookie allows us to create a persistent, hidden from javascript authentication method. Attaching it as credentials to our requests will mean needing to implement cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, but we won't dive into that here because of the many possible solutions depending on your needs.</p>

				<h3 id="shared-sessions"><a href="#shared-sessions">Shared Sessions</a></h3>				<p>By creating a unique ID session field on each user we eliminate the need to store a separate session database/table that stores multiple sessions for each user depending on device, browser, etc. The shared session ID is deemed a current valid session until it is changed in the database. This is how we'll revoke sessions.</p>

				<p>This means we'll have to revoke all sessions associated with a single account rather than individual sessions, but this is usually the general approach anyways.</p>

				<h3 id="revoking-sessions"><a href="#revoking-sessions">Revoking Sessions</a></h3>				<p>What reasons can we use to revoke sessions? Password changes, compromised account detection, and more. When we need to invalidate a session, we simply need to generate a new session ID for the user in the database. All currently issued tokens will be invalid for re-issue or unsafe actions.</p>

				<h3 id="user-id"><a href="#user-id">User ID</a></h3>                <p>By storing the user's ID in the token we can implicitly trust for any safe action that the user of a valid, unexpired token is who they say they are, and should have access to the account data associated with the ID.</p>
				
				<p>This will save a database lookup for every safe action performed. A possibly large accumulation over time with a speedup for the user on each safe request as well.</p>

				<h3 id="expiration"><a href="#expiration">Expiration</a></h3>				<p>With a short-lived expiration we can re-verify valid sessions as soon as a token expires, limiting the window revoked sessions have to safe actions as well.</p>

				<p>Rather than having a separate token for re-issuing the short-lived token we can just use the expired token + its session ID to verify it should be re-issued.</p>

				<p>We check the database that the session ID is still valid, compare the issued time against a longer window of time and if both are accepted issue a new short-lived cookie token.</p>

				<p>Most JWT implementations (like node-jsonwebtoken) make this easy by throwing an expiration specific error on validation, and then a method for decoding the token while ignoring the expiration:</p>

				<pre><code>
				verify(token, 'secret').catch((err) =&gt; {
					if (err.name === 'TokenExpiredError') {
						// Check against re-issue time window &amp; validate session ID
						return validateSessionAndReissue(token);
					}
				});
				</code></pre>

				<p>This way our single token can "re-issue" itself when needed.</p>

				<h2 id="considerations"><a href="#considerations">Considerations:</a></h2>
				<h3 id="the-jwt-window"><a href="#the-jwt-window">The JWT Window</a></h3>				<p>If you need instantly revocable sessions for all requests and can't deem any safe vs unsafe then a JWT isn't the solution for you at all. Classic sessions stored in a cookie are smaller in size, will use the same number of DB lookups, and are often easier to implement.</p>

				<h3 id="server-side-handling"><a href="#server-side-handling">Server Side Handling</a></h3>				<p>Your server implementation may need to accommodate the approach in several ways. The user's ID will typically be attached to the request as included credentials from the token rather than included as an argument/parameter or REST endpoint. This can be nice since endpoints, graphQL queries, etc. can be simplified.</p>

				<p>Different actions/resources will need to be marked as safe for implicit trust and some for unsafe requiring explicit validated session trust. This may be a higher order function around different routes or resolvers.</p>

                <h3 id="a-single-session"><a href="#a-single-session">A Single Session</a></h3>				<p>If your security needs to track/differentiate between two sessions under a single account then a shared session likely over complicates the fingerprinting you'd want to attach to actions and classic sessions are probably a better choice.</p>

				<h2 id="in-summary"><a href="#in-summary">In Summary</a></h2>				<p>This approach has the same security implications as most JWT implementations, but offers more safety around certain actions giving the performance and infrastructure benefits of the normal JWT approach for all other actions. And the single JWT being responsible for re-issuing itself reduces complexity greatly.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>I’ve spent about a year ramping up on reinforcement learning (RL) and related research topics. Compared to my PhD work at Berkeley, my current research is less focused on publishing and more independent, creating unique challenges and rewards. I want to share some tips for effective self-study and independent research, which are roughly ordered from those targeting early research first to more mature research later.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Write down your goals.</strong> Do you want to publish a paper? Contribute to an open source project? Gain experience for a career change? Do you simply enjoy learning? You can list more than one goal, but sort them and <em>pick one as your primary.</em> When I started, my primary goal was to learn about as many approaches to agent based programs as I could find, and a secondary goal was to build an agent that uses mind-wandering (which led me to build a chat bot).</li>
  <li><strong>Mix learning and practicing.</strong> I learn by reading, watching videos, taking online classes, and participating in study groups. I practice by coding. A 1:1 ratio works well for me. I usually spend days or weeks in one mode before switching to the other.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly read classic papers.</strong> Get to know the history of the field and the key figures. Often what they’ve done is worth trying yourself, or will influence your direction.</li>
  <li><strong>Start or join a reading group.</strong> This helps with motivation and learning. Don’t overdo it: start with one paper or textbook chapter per month, adjust later if necessary. Take notes each time and consider posting them online.</li>
  <li><strong>Write down your research plan.</strong> Don’t overthink it, this is just a starting spot. It doesn’t have to be long. I keep mine in a google doc. I re-read and update it frequently. It starts high-level and aspirational and gets more detailed. Here are some sections my plan contains (yours can be much shorter!):
    <ul>
      <li>One sentence research hypothesis.</li>
      <li>Objectives - one line per each of my 3mo / 6mo / 1yr / 2yr objectives. I review and revise this section every three months.</li>
      <li>Draft abstract + intro of a hypothetical research paper (dissertation?) that I hope to some day write if my research works out.</li>
      <li>Learning plan / courses to take.</li>
      <li>Reading list &amp; related work.</li>
      <li>FAQ. Brainstorm questions that you expect to encounter, both from others and yourself. Since I shifted from lots of structure in my previous role to less structure in my current role, my FAQ includes questions like <em>“why am i doing this?”</em> and <em>“what possible obstacles do I expect?”</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Revisit and evolve your goals.</strong> My high-level goals evolve slowly, but my lower-level ones change a lot. I enjoy looking back and seeing how they’ve changed as I learned new things.</li>
  <li><strong>Conduct self-performance reviews.</strong> Independent work has little intrinsic structure. I force structure on myself: every three months I write down where I can improve the most, and what I’m most proud of. In fact, this blog post is part of my 1yr performance review.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep a research journal.</strong> Try to write daily. I keep my journal at the end of my research plan, and this blog is an experiment in shifting some of my journaling to be public.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t worry about novelty.</strong> It is valuable to implement well known algorithms yourself. Remember to cite the author if you publish your code or anything derivitive.</li>
  <li><strong>Build small projects.</strong> Apply what you’re learning. Spend hours (not days) making a 1-2 page design doc including a 1 sentence summary of the project, 1-3 paragraphs of overview, and a bullet list of the initial features. Spend weeks (not months) building the first prototype of a project, then iterate. Some friends and I spent a couple months <a href="https://github.com/andyk/improved-funicular">implementing 2048 and a bunch of algos to play it</a>; it was motivating and we learned a lot. I also built a chat bot, a small python library of utility functions for writing RL algorithms, and a few other small projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Write up your progress.</strong> When you’ve finished a project or reached a checkpoint, take a few hours to write up your results and some reflections. It doesn’t have to be polished. My friends and I documented some of our results and lessons learned working on 2048 in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oNbpl-4W6jaOg4DefeQPYh77wpbNfZwzI5t86mra3hs/edit">a shared google doc</a>. Now we have the option to come back later and iterate on it, maybe even work towards publishing it somewhere.</li>
  <li><strong>Teach what you learn.</strong> Prepare a short talk, or even better a short hands-on training tutorial. Give it at a meetup or put it on YouTube. If you’re not ready for that, give it for your friends.</li>
  <li><strong>Allow yourself to explore tangents.</strong> But time box them, and if possible, try to synthesize lessons from the tangent back into your research plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Find folks to collaborate with.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Look where you work. For academics, this is straightforward, e.g., PhD students have their advisors and other students. If you’re not an academic, there might already be reading groups or chat channels at your company you can join. Otherwise, attend meetups, post on mailing lists of open source projects, or go to a conference.</li>
      <li>Once you find a collaborator, some of your solo activites can become group activities. I work closely with a friend Nick Jalbert that I met in grad school. We have weekly video chats and occasionally in-person mini-retreats. Here are examples of ways Nick and I collaborate:
        <ul>
          <li>Every few weeks, we read a paper and then meet to discuss it. Nick inspired me to set up this blog when he started posting <a href="https://nickjalbert.github.io/reading">his reading notes</a> online.</li>
          <li>We built a short hands-on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LA-Deep-RL/events/268096321/">Intro to RL tutorial</a> for the LA Deep RL meetup group.</li>
          <li>We are self-studying our way through <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/">Gilbert Strang’s online linear algebra course</a>.</li>
          <li>We write code together. Sometimes we both work on our own separate implementation of an algorithm and then compare, sometimes we review each other’s code or design docs, and sometimes we pair program.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Contact people in the field.</strong> Be bold but humble. Don’t start with the most famous researchers; instead contact folks that are local to your area. Read their recent papers or books first. Get an introduction if you can. Raise a technical topic or question that overlaps with their research. Researchers are generally meritocratic, so they will give you time if you have ideas that are interesting to them. Nonetheless, expect to be rejected or ignored.</li>
  <li><strong>Spend time motivating yourself.</strong> I once read that people overestimate how much progress they can make in a month and underestimate how much they can make in a year;&nbsp;this is my experience with self-study and independent research. Major research accomplishments tend to take years of work (Is this kinda counter to the underestimting progress in a year thing?). Along the way, you should expect to ocassionally feel bored, distracted, hopeless, disillusioned, etc. I don’t wait for these moments to arrive to manage them. Instead, I proactively set aside time for activities that inspire me. For me, this includes reading or watching sci-fi, public speaking, and passionate conversations with friends about RL and AI. And when a bad day comes along, I take a break from work, listen to music or go the gym, talk it out with a friend, or try jumping into a different project. All the while, I remain patient for my sense of excitement to return. And it always does.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have fun and good luck with your research and studying.</p>

<p>To counter a second coronavirus wave, President Aleksandar Vucic announced a new lockdown. Protesters reacted with fury at his inconsistency, amid wider anger over his strongman leadership.</p>
<p>Thousands of Serbs demonstrated for a second consecutive night on Wednesday in response to President Aleksandar Vucic’s management of the coronavirus crisis and wider concerns over the state of democracy in Serbia.</p>
<p>The protests were the first major pandemic-related unrest in Europe since the start of the crisis and were met by a violent police response that some analysts said they had not witnessed in Serbia since the rule of Slobodan Milosevic, who governed Serbia during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Serbs first took to the streets on Tuesday, soon after Mr. Vucic announced that Belgrade would be placed under a new three-day lockdown following the second wave of confirmed coronavirus infections.</p>
<p>But the demonstrations quickly morphed into a wider expression of frustration at Mr. Vucic’s increasing control over policymaking and perceived mismanagement of Serbia’s pandemic response. The protests continued on Wednesday, even after Mr. Vucic suspended his decision to enforce a second shutdown.</p>
<p>Protesters said they were less angry about the re-implementation of the lockdown than the governmental missteps that had created the need for renewed restrictions in the first place. These included decisions to proceed with a general election last week and to restart large public sports events.</p>
<p>“We don’t mind staying home for another three days — that wasn’t the problem,” said Dragana Grncarski, 45, a fashion events manager who protested on both days.</p>
<p>“However, they’re playing with our minds and with the truth,” Ms. Grncarski added. “When it suits them to do elections, there is no corona. They organized football matches and tennis matches, and because of that we have a situation where the hospitals are full.”</p>
<p>After initially enforcing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns in March, Mr. Vucic lifted social restrictions in early May, claiming his government had defeated the coronavirus.</p>
<p>But while other European countries eased their lockdowns gradually, Mr. Vucic opted for a faster process, soon allowing Serbs to gather by the tens of thousands without social distancing at sports matches and to crowd into reopened nightclubs.</p>
<p>“We went from one extreme to another,” said Jelena Vasiljevic, an expert on Balkan protest movements at the University of Belgrade.</p>
<p>Mr. Vucic initially refused to change course on the re-openings, even as the daily number of new cases rose from below 20 to above 300 and investigative news reports suggested that the toll could be even higher.</p>
<p>He pressed ahead with a controversial general election on June 21 that most opposition parties had long planned to boycott, saying they did not want to legitimize a process that they feel is gamed in Mr. Vucic’s favor.</p>
<p>And to Mr. Vucic’s critics, his decision first to ease restrictions ahead of a vote that was certain to increase his power — and then reinstate them soon after — felt like he was playing politics with public health.</p>
<p>“Citizens have been constantly deceived and lied to for political ends,” said Tena Prelec, an expert on politics in Southeast Europe at the University of Oxford.</p>
<p>Analysts said the spontaneous nature of the protests reflected the lack of institutional means to express dissent.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Vucic, the quality of Serbian democracy has fallen from “free” to only “partly free,” according to Freedom House, an independent Washington-based watchdog that makes an annual assessment of each country’s political freedoms.</p>
<p>“The media and state institutions are completely consumed by one party,” said Dr. Vasiljevic.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, some protesters briefly entered the Parliament building before being forced out by police.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials were later filmed beating unarmed protesters with batons, in scenes that some analysts said mirrored police behavior during the rule of Mr. Milosevic, who led Serbia through the Balkan Wars and was later tried for war crimes in The Hague.</p>
<p>“The excessive use of force — we haven’t seen that since Milosevic in 1996 or 1997,” Dr. Vasiljevic said.</p>
<p>Mr. Vucic said police were right to respond with force.</p>
<p>“There were indications of foreign involvement, and some criminal faces were there, too,” Mr. Vucic said, speaking on Wednesday afternoon, before the second night of protests.</p>
<p>“The aim was to damage Serbia’s international image,” he added.</p>
<p>The protests could soon fizzle because of their leaderless nature, the lack of a clear goal, and the strength of Mr. Vucic’s grip on Serbia, Dr. Vasiljevic said.</p>
<p>Similar mass demonstrations dissipated last year without forcing concessions from Mr. Vucic.</p>
<p>“This situation is a bit different,” said Dr. Vasiljevic. “But we still need to have some clear political articulations and a clear political narrative.”</p>

<h3 id="what-does-a-web-server-do">What does a web server do?</h3>

<p>It listens on a TCP port for connections. When someone from somewhere on the internet makes a connection to that port, it happily recieves the “request”, processes it, and sends a “response”.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-modern-web-development">What is “modern” web development?</h3>

<p>Modern web development refers to the prevalent web development practices right now. I’m writing this in 2020, and right now web development revolves around the concepts of “frontend” and “backend”. Let’s rewind a bit.</p>

<p>Long ago, web development was about creating pages in HTML which gets transmitted over the wire to browser which then displays it. People could click and navigate to other pages. But that was mostly it. Everything was static and everyone would see the same things.</p>

<p>Then “dynamic” web came into existence. Here, “web servers” would create HTML pages on the fly depending on the user who is requesting it. “Users” could also add/remove content from these servers. There was a lot of “data” moving around and naturally databases became prominent. Also, languages like PHP which allowed dynamically creating HTML became popular.</p>

<p>Then came the smartphones. With smartphones came “native apps” and also smaller screens. This was a double blow to web development. One, websites now have to be visually attractive on large screens and small screens (responsive design). Two, websites would have to compete with the interactivity offered by native applications. Although responsive design has largely been a successful change in web development, competing with native applications is something web applications are still struggling in. This is partly because native code on Android and iOS simply have more capabilities on the platform. Thus the term “native”.</p>

<p>That is what drives the differentiation between frontend and backend in modern web development. Large organizations have native applications for each platform and web version of their applications. This means that the “backend” server can be the lowest common factor - which is “REST APIs”. And the UI on different platforms are their own codebases. For the web, the UI is called frontend. Large organizations also drive innovation and technology. And therefore most of the popular web technologies we have now is devoted to this frontend-backend divide.</p>

<p>On the frontend javascript is the default choice and that is why popular frontend frameworks like React and Vue are all also javascript frameworks.</p>

<p>But backend can be anything. Javascript itself, python, java, rust, kotlin, go, ruby, php, or even <a href="https://css-tricks.com/wtf-is-a-static-api/">just JSON files</a>. The only requirement for a backend technology, as can be seen from that last example, is that it is able to return strings over a web connection. Most applications would also have to interact with databases, other internet services (APIs), and the filesystem, and also encapsulate “business logic”. And that is where things become interesting.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-javas-role-in-modern-web-development">What is Java’s role in modern web development?</h3>

<p>No matter how much stuff happens on the frontend, centralized services will have a backend with components that I described previously. Even if things are dockerized and deployed on the cloud thus giving rise to multiple “backends”, there is something at the “back”.</p>

<p>Java, over the last few years has been evolving rapidly (compared to its own past) to accomodate the needs of modern web development. Because the JVM is battle tested and because the development paradigms that Java enforces are also useful for large teams to work together, Java is a powerful player in the backend space of modern web development.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-know-about-java-to-understand-modern-web-development-in-java">What should I know about Java to understand modern web development in Java?</h3>

<h4 id="specifications-vs-implementations">Specifications vs Implementations</h4>

<p>The biggest insight I can share is that in Java world <strong>everything has specifications</strong> and implementations. “Specification”/standards are API interfaces (usually), configuration formats, or expected behaviour that are meant to be interoperable. (This plays well with the concept of <code>Interface</code> in Java’s object-oriented paradigm)</p>

<p>What this means is that you could write software that targets a specification and then it could work with any of the implementations of that specification. This is a concept very much alien to javascript developers.</p>

<p>For a concrete example, let us take the case of REST API development. If you are building a framework that simplifies development of REST APIs in javascript, you can build it however the way you want. Then you write documentation on how the user of your framework should write their functions such that it can be hooked into your framework. For example, <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a> developer would want you to write a function like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>h</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>h</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Hello World!</span><span>'</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, <a href="https://hapi.dev/">hapi</a> will ask you to write the same like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>({</span>
        <span>method</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>/</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>handler</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>h</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>return</span> <span>'</span><span>Hello World!</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, as a user, you get locked in to the framework early on.</p>

<p>But in Java, this is not necessarily the case. There is “<a href="https://download.oracle.com/javaee-archive/jax-rs-spec.java.net/jsr339-experts/att-3593/spec.pdf">JAX-RS</a>” [pdf link] specification which talks about how the user will write their classes and methods, how these will be annotated, how the configuration will be specified, and so on. The specification also tells you how your framework should behave when interacting with such user code as well.</p>

<p>So, no matter whether you’re using <a href="https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey/">Jersey</a>, <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/docs/">RESTEasy</a>, or any other JAX-RS compliant framework, your method will be the same:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>HelloWorld</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>@GET</span>
	<span>public</span> <span>String</span> <span>helloWorld</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    	<span>return</span> <span>"Hello World!"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can write this and deploy it with Jersey and it will work. You can then remove Jersey and put something else that implements JAX-RS, it will work. That is what a standard does.</p>

<p>Now, this does not mean that Java is a boring place where everyone writes programs the same way. There are other REST frameworks that do not conform to the JAX-RS specification like <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc">Spring MVC</a>
and they can have their own ways of how to write web resource classes.</p>

<h4 id="did-i-mention-specifications">Did I mention specifications?</h4>

<p>Java has to be understood in its historical context. Java was under Oracle for a long long time. And Oracle used to provide various cloud services that uses Java based technologies. And Oracle used to maintain the specifications in and around Java. And Oracle used to provide proprietary technologies on top of these specifications.</p>

<p>The proliferation of such specifications (which no other programming language seems to have) is good and bad. Bad because it makes a programming language an economic product rather than a language of creative expression. Good because you can move your enterprise from one provider to another, provided they both support the same specifications equally. Enterprises love this promise of not being vendor locked in. It is just an added bonus to them that they can swap developers around constantly because everyone is practically writing the same thing.</p>

<p>So, the story of specifications doesn’t end with specifications. Java also has collections of specifications. There is something called “Standard Edition” (SE), something called “Enterprise Edition” (EE). SE “contains” the basic things that makes it a programming language (like data types, IO, etc.) whereas EE “contains” further things like the JAX-RS specification we mentioned above. Meaning, if you have a cloud provider who implements the Java EE platform, then there are a lot of specifications that they are complying with (almost all the technologies that an enterprise needs).</p>

<p>On the other hand there are also projects like <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile">Eclipse MicroProfile</a> which form useful alternatives to things like Java EE. There are also frameworks like <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring</a>, <a href="https://micronaut.io/">Micronaut</a>, and <a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus</a> which are comprehensive solutions of their own (often with interchangeable parts).</p>

<p>That ends part 1 of this post. Have a coffee now.</p>

<h3 id="tell-me-about-web-development-in-java">Tell me about web development in Java</h3>

<p>I’m sorry it has to be this way. Much of Java is stuck in the past. And without the historical context, you will have great trouble in navigating the Java ecosystem. I’ve spent countless nights doing this. Just show some patience.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-web-development-in-java">History of Web Development in Java</h3>

<p>Java has seen all of it. So we have to start from the very beginning.</p>

<h4 id="servlets">Servlets</h4>

<p>A servlet is very similar to the hello world function in express that we saw earlier.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>ServletHelloWorld</span> <span>extends</span> <span>HttpServlet</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>@Override</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>final</span> <span>ServletConfig</span> <span>config</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>ServletException</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>super</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    
    <span>@Override</span>
    <span>protected</span> <span>void</span> <span>service</span><span>(</span><span>final</span> <span>HttpServletRequest</span> <span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>final</span> <span>HttpServletResponse</span> <span>response</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>ServletException</span><span>,</span> <span>IOException</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>getWriter</span><span>().</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
 
    <span>@Override</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>destroy</span><span>()</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is a hello world servlet.  The request object would have information about path and other info required to form a response.</p>

<p><a href="https://javaee.github.io/servlet-spec/">Java Servlet Specification</a> is the specification that defines how servlets should be.</p>

<h4 id="servlet-containers">Servlet Containers</h4>

<p>These are frameworks which, based on the servlet specification, are designed to run servlets. An example is “Catalina” which is a part of Tomcat.</p>

<h4 id="web-servers">Web servers</h4>

<p><a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a> is a group of technologies which could be considered a complete “web server”. Tomcat includes components like “Coyote” which listens to a port for HTTP connections, and Catalina mentioned above which takes that request and forwards it to a servlet and later takes the response from the servlet and passes it back.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Gartner says hyper-automation is one of the top 10 trends of the year – but what the heck is it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, hyper-automation sounds like yet another buzzword. But analysts say hyper-automation is a thing unto itself, and they suggest businesses pay attention to it. Great. But then, what <em>is</em> it?</p>
<p>One reason that hyper-automation is difficult to recognize is that it has many names. Gartner calls it hyper-automation, and considers it <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the top trends</a> of the year. IDC calls it <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P35141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intelligent Process automation</a> while Forrester dubs the same practices <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/digital-process-automation-an-important-part-of-your-digital-transformation-strategy/%20target=">Digital Process Automation</a>. Still others do not call it by any name at all.</p>
<p>“We created the first of its kind hyper-automation tool for project management. We don’t present it that way because people don’t yet understand and really know about hyper-automation,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorystoos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says Grégory Stoos</a>, a French entrepreneur who founded Portuguese startup <a href="https://planless.io/%20target=">planless.io</a>.</p>
<h3>No clear name, but it’s a real thing</h3>
<p>While the name is still a bit in flux, the definition has already gelled.</p>
<p>According to Gartner, hyper-automation “involves a combination of tools, including <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/rpa-robot-process-automation-how-it-relates-to-intelligent-automation/">robotic process automation</a> (RPA), intelligent business management software (iBPMS) and AI, with a goal of increasingly AI-driven decision making.” The firm further clarifies that “hyper-automation often results in the creation of a digital twin of the organization (DTO)” which in turn enables &nbsp;organizations “to visualize how functions, processes and key performance indicators interact to drive value.”</p>
<p>In short, you can think of hyper-automation as automated automation. It always functions at high speeds and often (though not always) at large scale.</p>
<p>“Hyper-automation enables machines to automate the further implementation of additional automation without the input of human assistance. It is often said that machines running on this type of technology can not only learn 10,000 times faster, they can do so without ever missing it on the next iteration,” says Nate Nead, CEO of <a href="https://dev.co/">DEV.co</a>, a custom software development company.</p>
<p>While it is used in several industries, it is not generally widespread.</p>
<p>“Hyper-automation is yet to become mainstream, but adoption is growing. My observation is based on the fact that even in call centers, despite its usefulness, hyper-automation is yet to become a staple,” said Reuben Yonatan, founder and CEO of <a href="https://getvoip.com/">GetVoIP</a>, an advisor service on cloud communications.</p>
<h3>A few current examples</h3>
<p>Today, use cases are typically in early stages, particularly in contexts where you would expect heavy automation. A common goal is accelerating, streamlining, and even redesigning processes.</p>
<p>“A real-world example of hyper-automation in my industry—cloud communication—is the use of RPA and AI in call centers to automate processes such as mouse clicks and application launch to help an agent quickly pull information about a client from multiple systems,” explains Yonatan.</p>
<p>“When a customer calls in, an agent must aggregate information from various systems to get a complete customer profile. With the hyper-automation tools handling the process, the agent doesn’t have to keep switching between several applications, and the process is faster,” Yonatan adds.</p>
<p>Implementations vary significantly, depending in large part on where and why hyper-automation is used. That is likely to remain true for the foreseeable future too.</p>
<p>“Traditional areas where such AI tools will truly skyrocket in the next decade include database search querying, project automation, CRM, ERP systems, fulfillment and tracking of things like leads, people, processes and packages. As machines learn faster and make less mistakes then humans, it is estimated that most jobs will be automated in 20 years or less,” says Nead.</p>
<p>Wyndham Capital Mortgage, which <a href="https://www.aifoundry.com/newsroom/news/wyndham-capital-mortgage-partners-with-ai-foundry-for-lending-ai-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entered a partnership</a> with AI Foundry in May, is another example of a company using hyper-automation to automate where automation couldn’t go before.</p>
<p>“Wyndham Capital Mortgage’s strategy is to be a leader in the utilization of automation and particularly robotic processing technologies,” said Wyndham Capital Mortgage CEO Jeff Douglas in <a href="https://www.aifoundry.com/newsroom/news/wyndham-capital-mortgage-partners-with-ai-foundry-for-lending-ai-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement</a> to the press. “By implementing [AI Foundry’s] Agile Mortgages’ cognitive robots, we are now able to push deeper into loan processing stages where document and decision complexity limited automation gains.”</p>
<p>In short, Wyndham is accelerating its loan origination process and jacking up scale too. Part of that is achieved by using robots to fetch information from a variety of sources, thereby <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-reasons-why-qa-needs-humans/">eliminating menial work</a> typically done by operations employees.</p>
<p>“Wyndham Capital Mortgage has been utilizing RPA for some time. Integration of AI Foundry’s solutions moves it to hyper-automation,” explains <a href="https://bryan.uncg.edu/faculty-and-staff/kshetri-nir-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nir Kshetri</a>, a professor at University of North Carolina-Greensboro and a research fellow at Kobe University.</p>
<p>The move to hyper-automation was necessary because RPA alone is insufficient to fully automate the loan origination process. Wyndham needed a technological fix for RPA’s gaps and shortcomings.</p>
<p>“RPA perform well in automating predefined steps in which rules define where relevant data can be located on each type of pre-defined document – for example, [tax] form 1040 and statements from some predefined banks. However, RPA may not deliver the automation goals if different customers submit documents in different formats with different contents. By utilizing [machine learning] and machine vision financial institutions such as Wyndham Capital Mortgage can extract relevant information from diverse documents,” Kshetri adds.</p>
<p>Even though it hasn’t gone mainstream yet, hyper-automation is in common enough use that consultancies are already organizing guidance for their clientele.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://theartofservice.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Art of Service</a>, a management consultancy company based in Australia, frequently releases updated and new assessments of hyper-automation based on hundreds of projects and initiatives according to CEO and R&amp;D Director, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerardblokdijk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerard Blokdyk</a>. Gartner, IDC, Forrester and other firms also provide guidance and projections.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of attention for a group of technologies that’s yet to entirely settle on a name. And <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/things-that-are-called-ml-ai-that-really-arent/">at least it’s a real thing</a>. In the meantime, think of hyper-automation as a swiftly laid foundation for businesses keen on future-building rather than future-proofing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Safely storing digital files for a long time turns out to be an expensive and
difficult problem.</p>
<p>Recent advances in filesystems, though, have made this a doable task.</p>
<h2 id="the-old-rule-3-2-1-backups">The old rule: “3-2-1 backups”<a href="#the-old-rule-3-2-1-backups" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>The “3-2-1” backup strategy is perhaps the most common strategy for keeping
files safe.</p>
<p>This strategy suggests that you maintain:</p>
<ul>
<li>at last <strong>three</strong> different copies of every file, with</li>
<li>at least <strong>two</strong> different <em>storage formats</em>, and</li>
<li>at least <strong>one</strong> copy offsite.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-different-storage-formats">Why different storage formats?<a href="#why-different-storage-formats" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>If you store your data on different formats, hopefully the formats will have
different lifespans. When one fails before the other, it gives you time to make
a new copy.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this line of reasoning, though.</p>
<figure>

<p>Optical media: the state of the art (last millennium)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Storage formats available to consumers are typically only hard drives and
optical storage media (CD-R, DVD-R, or BD-R). The latest optical storage
technology is limited to 25GB per disk. Hard drives are regularly in the 1-12TB
range, which is <strong>40-500x bigger</strong>. Backing up a 6TB $100 hard drive on optical
media would be ridiculous: it would take 240 BD-R disks.</p>
<p>There’s a bigger problem with 3-2-1, though: how do you detect any problems with your files in the first place?</p>
<h2 id="why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-the-impact-of-bit-rot">Why 3-2-1 isn’t enough: the impact of “bit rot”<a href="#why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-the-impact-of-bit-rot" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>All commonly available storage formats eventually suffer from “bit rot,” or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">data
degradation</a>.</p>
<p>Your files are comprised of hundreds of thousands or even millions of bits of data.</p>
<p>If a handful of those bits are “flipped” due to storage defects or media
degradation your file can become unreadable.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an image with only a couple bits flipped:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://photostructure.com/img/2020/06/bitrot.jpg" alt="JPEG bitrot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (source)"> <figcaption>
<p>JPEG bitrot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">source</a>)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the rightmost file is 99.999% correct, yet isn’t viewable.</p>
<p>Most likely, hard drives and optical disks that are five years old or older will
have some amount of bit rot.</p>
<p>Many of our older family photos on old hard drives had succumbed to some amount
of bit rot. In discovering this unpleasantness, we updated PhotoStructure to
detect and skip over photos and videos that are corrupt, with the hope that
you’ll have several copies of a given photo, and one of them won’t have bit rot.</p>
<p>But this feature just treats the symptom: this doesn’t fix the underlying
problem.</p>
<h2 id="overcoming-bit-rot">Overcoming bit rot<a href="#overcoming-bit-rot" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Several advanced filesystems, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">Btrfs</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS">XFS</a> all support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scrubbing">data
scrubbing</a>, which detects and
repairs bit rot automatically.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither Windows nor macOS support these filesystems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)">Time
Machine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_and_Restore">Backup and
Restore</a> don’t detect bit rot
either.</p>
<p>So: <em>how do normal people use these fancy new filesystems?</em></p>
<h2 id="nas-to-the-rescue">NAS to the rescue<a href="#nas-to-the-rescue" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">Network-attached
storage</a> (NAS) devices
hold several large hard drives and quietly do their work safely storing your
files. You can keep using your favorite OS, but you don’t have to worry about
bit rot anymore.</p>
<p>Most NAS also support hosting Docker images. PhotoStructure runs under Docker,
and is designed to run smoothly on a NAS.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/series/home">Synology</a> is the most

<li>
<p>If building your own computer is intimidating and you’d like to try FreeNAS,
the <a href="https://www.freenas.org/freenas-mini/">FreeNAS Mini</a> comes pre-assembled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://unraid.net/">unRAID</a>, like FreeNAS, runs on hardware you already

<h2 id="getting-started-with-your-nas">Getting started with your NAS<a href="#getting-started-with-your-nas" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consider getting a NAS that has 4 or more drives to offer redundancy and
support data integrity checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy 50% more storage than you need right now so you have room to grow in the
near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable weekly data scrubbing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable monthly S.M.A.R.T. self-diagnostic runs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up your NAS to either apply security patches automatically or notify you
to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider installing a virus scanner and malware detection package on your
NAS. Synology has a “security audit” tool as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your router has recently-updated firmware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use secure admin and user passwords. Using a password manager like
<a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> makes this easy to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure your NAS to tell you if it has any errors: <strong>you don’t want any
disks dying or backups failing without you knowing it.</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-at-least-3-copies">How to get “at least 3 copies”<a href="#how-to-get-at-least-3-copies" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Satisfy the 2nd or 3rd copy of the “at least 3 copies” rule by copying the
entire contents of your NAS to an external hard drive that normally stays
powered down and offline. Do this quarterly.</p>
<p>Consider storing this drive near your emergency kit so you can grab it as you
leave your house in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>This external drive can also reduce your dataloss if your NAS catastrophically
fails, or if you get hit by malware like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker">cryptolockers</a>.</p>

<p>Satisfy the “at least 1 offsite” rule by setting up your NAS to back up to a
cloud service automatically. <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a> and
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a> are both well-regarded offsite storage
solutions, and both have solutions that work with your new NAS.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to pay for cloud storage, you can set up another NAS (like at
a friend or family member’s house). Both FreeNAS and Synology support NAS-to-NAS
replication.</p>
<p>Make sure you configure the replication job to run in the middle of the night,
and throttle network bandwidth so you don’t make your friends or family grumpy.</p>

from HTML and CSS, but that same approach can also be used with SVG to
build sophisticated custom UI elements.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll give a brief overview of SVG, when to use it
(and when not to), and how to use it effectively in a React
application. We'll also briefly touch on how to integrate with d3
(which comes in very useful when working with SVG).</p>

<p>We relied heavily on SVG to build the charting updates we launched
recently in pganalyze (check out my <a href="https://pganalyze.com/blog/introducing-new-charts-and-date-picker">blog post about
these</a>
if you missed it), and we would like to share how we work with SVG in
React. At the end of the post, we link to a simple but functional
charting example based on our new charting code. We stripped it down
to make it easier to follow, and we think it's a great introduction to
building SVG components in React.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-svg"><a href="#what-is-svg" aria-label="what is svg permalink"></a>What is SVG?</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> is an
XML-based vector graphics format. It is commonly used for icons and
illustrations, but the similarities to HTML make it a great fit to
extend your UI. Like HTML, SVG consists of a DOM tree of elements
which can be styled with CSS, can be scripted and animated, and can
dispatch events on user interaction. SVG is well-supported in modern
browsers, including Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Edge. All of these
support embedding SVG directly in HTML, and React supports using SVG
elements to build your components.</p>
<p>A thorough overview of SVG is beyond the scope of this post, but let's
review the salient features in the context of building UI components.
The actual elements available fall in a few different categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple lines and shapes, like <code>rect</code>, <code>circle</code>, and <code>line</code></li>
<li>more complex lines and shapes, like <code>polygon</code> and <code>path</code> (check out
<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/closer-look-svg-path-data/">Joni Trythall's
post</a> on
everything you can do with the path data attribute!)</li>
<li>text, like the simple <code>text</code>, the fancy <code>textPath</code> (essentially
<code>text</code> along an arbitrary <code>path</code>), and the handy <code>title</code> (for simple
tooltips similar to HTML's <code>title</code> attribute)</li>
<li>special elements to combine and manipulate these, like <code>mask</code>,
<code>clipPath</code>, and <code>pattern</code></li>
<li>other odds and ends, like the familiar anchor (<code>a</code>) from
HTML (with the neat feature that it can conform to whatever shape it
is wrapping, and only that part is interactive).</li>
</ul>
<p>Mozilla's MDN has a good
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">reference</a> to all
the element types available.</p>
<p>The event system is very similar to what you're already used to in
HTML. Some events are different, but many familiar ones like <code>onClick</code>,
<code>onMouseEnter</code>, <code>onFocus</code>, and <code>onKeyUp</code> are there. Registering event
handlers is the same—svg elements expose <code>onEvent</code> attributes and you
can add your callback there. If you're using TypeScript, note that
you'll need to parameterize generic React synthetic event types with
<code>SVGElement</code> or just <code>Element</code> instead of <code>HTMLElement</code>. E.g.:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>const</span> handleClick <span>=</span> <span>(</span>e<span>:</span> React<span>.</span>MouseEvent<span>&lt;</span>Element<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'clicked'</span><span>,</span> e<span>.</span>currentTarget<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="when-to-use-svg"><a href="#when-to-use-svg" aria-label="when to use svg permalink"></a>When to use SVG</h3>
<p>If you think SVG might be a good fit for some section of your UI,
there's a good chance you're right, but you should consider your
options. There are always trade-offs. If you don't go with SVG, your
other likely options in a React app are going to be sticking with
HTML, or using Canvas. You can <a href="https://pattle.github.io/simpsons-in-css/">do a
lot</a> with some plain divs
and CSS, so HTML may be suitable for more than you think. That said,
if you feel like your use case is pushing HTML to the breaking point
(or at least into a cryptic forest of obscure tags and esoteric
styling), maybe it's not the right fit. Remember <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Kernighan's
Law</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in
the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it,
how will you ever debug it?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum there's Canvas. Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics)">immediate
mode</a>
paradigm means it can perform much better with huge datasets, but that
also makes it awkward to work with in React, and harder to script rich
interactivity. SVG (and HTML) have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode">retained
mode</a> model that's better
suited to building UIs.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, if it's reasonable to stick with HTML, <strong>stick
with HTML</strong>. If not, and you expect to work with a <strong>modest number of
data points</strong> (the threshold will vary based on your UX needs and your
performance expectations), <strong>SVG is a good bet</strong>. It will allow you to
build these components in a manner similar to building HTML
components, and to maintain a consistent look and feel with the rest
of your app. Otherwise, consider Canvas or even WebGL.</p>
<h3 id="svg-in-react"><a href="#svg-in-react" aria-label="svg in react permalink"></a>SVG in React</h3>
<p>The mechanics of using SVG elements in React are straightforward: Just
write a standard component and return an SVG tag instead of an HTML
tag. You only need to ensure you're nesting tags correctly and only
putting SVG elements inside an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> tag (just as you should ensure
you're not putting block-level elements in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>). There's no
special class to extend, no extra options to handle.</p>
<p>Here is a trivial SVG component:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Greeting</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>text</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>hello </span><span>{</span>name<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>text</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This uses the SVG <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element instead of the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> you might
expect in an HTML component, but as you can see, it's otherwise
identical to an HTML component. To use this, just wrap it in an
<code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Main</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>g</span> <span>transform</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>translate(20,20)<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
        </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Greeting</span></span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Maciek<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>g</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(Don't worry about the <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element for now; we'll cover that next.)</p>
<h3 id="handling-layout-in-svg"><a href="#handling-layout-in-svg" aria-label="handling layout in svg permalink"></a>Handling Layout in SVG</h3>
<p>A big difference between HTML and SVG is layout: In HTML, the normal
layout flow positions elements on the page automatically according to
a set of <del>simple</del> rules. In SVG, it's up to you to place each
individual element exactly where it's supposed to go. There is <strong>no
built-in positioning</strong> mechanism at all, and the order of the tags
really only determines what gets drawn on top of what (like z-index in
HTML; SVG has no explicit z-index.)</p>
<p>The mechanism for this positioning is a coordinate system that's
standard in computer graphics: The origin is in the upper-left corner,
and positive x and y values move elements to the right and down,
respectively. You can think of it like an HTML document where all
elements are <code>position: absolute</code>, and <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are <code>top</code> and
<code>left</code>. Here's an example:</p>
<p>
  <svg width="800" height="300" viewBox="0 0 800 300"><g transform="translate(120,120)"><rect fill="red" width="30" height="30"></rect></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="hanging" x="60" y="120">x=<!-- -->120</text><path d="M 0,120 L120,120" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon points="120,120 110,115 113,120 110,125" fill="black"></polygon></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="start" dominant-baseline="middle" x="120" y="60">&nbsp;y=<!-- -->120</text><path d="M 120,0 L120,120" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon transform="rotate(90 120,120)" points="120,120 110,115 113,120 110,125" fill="black"></polygon></g><g transform="translate(300,160)"><circle fill="powderblue" r="20"></circle></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="hanging" x="150" y="160">x=<!-- -->300</text><path d="M 0,160 L300,160" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon points="300,160 290,155 293,160 290,165" fill="black"></polygon></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="start" dominant-baseline="middle" x="300" y="80">&nbsp;y=<!-- -->160</text><path d="M 300,0 L300,160" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon transform="rotate(90 300,160)" points="300,160 290,155 293,160 290,165" fill="black"></polygon></g><g transform="translate(520,200)"><text fill="green">some text</text></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="hanging" x="260" y="200">x=<!-- -->520</text><path d="M 0,200 L520,200" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon points="520,200 510,195 513,200 510,205" fill="black"></polygon></g><g opacity="0.4"><text text-anchor="start" dominant-baseline="middle" x="520" y="100">&nbsp;y=<!-- -->200</text><path d="M 520,0 L520,200" stroke-dasharray="4 4" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"></path><polygon transform="rotate(90 520,200)" points="520,200 510,195 513,200 510,205" fill="black"></polygon></g></svg></p>
<p>As you can see, the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> offsets mean slightly different things
for different types of elements. For <code>rect</code>, it's the upper-left
corner. For <code>circle</code> and <code>ellipse</code>, it's the center (in fact, circles
and ellipses use <code>cx</code> and <code>cy</code> attributes instead of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to
make this clearer). For text, it's a reference point, and the text's
placement relative to that point is configurable via attributes like
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/dominant-baseline">dominant-baseline</a>
and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/text-anchor">text-anchor</a>
(by default, the text starts at the x position, with the baseline at
the y position.)</p>
<p>At first blush, this seems like it would make any non-trivial SVG
component a nightmare to put together, but we can use some SVG
features and some conventions to help us build complex modular
components that work well together.</p>
<p>Let's assume we're working with a certain explicit <code>width</code> and
<code>height</code> for our component. This can get tricky if you need your
component to be responsive, but we'll hand-wave around it for now; we
discuss that in more detail below.</p>
<p>In general, we've found a good approach for SVG components is to have
parents size and position their children by subdividing the parent's
own width and height. Parents determine each child's desired <code>width</code>
and <code>height</code> and pass those as props. We could also pass <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
to have children position themselves, but SVG provides a handy element
that simplifies this: the group (<code>&lt;g&gt;</code>). As its name suggests, the
element is a way to apply a set of properties to a group of children.
Most relevant for us is the <code>transform</code> attribute, specifically its
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform#Translate"><code>translate</code></a>
value. This lets us establish a new origin local to the group, offset
from the parent origin (which may be another <code>&lt;g&gt;</code>!) by the specified
x and y values. This is perfect for positioning children, since you
can easily do so in the parent. The children themselves can pretend
they're positioned at the origin, so they only have to worry about
their width and height, and what to render within that space. In fact,
this pattern is so useful, we have a helper component to do this:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Translate</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span>x<span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>y<span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>children<span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>x <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>y<span>)</span> <span>return</span> children<span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>g</span> <span>transform</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span><span>`</span><span>translate(</span><span><span>${</span>x<span>}</span></span><span>,</span><span><span>${</span>y<span>}</span></span><span>)</span><span>`</span></span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>children<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>g</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even though subdividing space like this in SVG component hierarchies
is a good rule of thumb, sometimes it may not be a good fit for some
part of your UI. Since <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> is <strong>not</strong> a bounded container like a
sized <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with <code>overflow: hidden</code>, the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
pattern is just metadata for children to follow as a guideline. If
that pattern gets in the way, you can break the rules and have
children draw outside these bounds (though the result may be harder to
reason about).</p>
<p>Another useful pattern is to have components specify all the sizing
and positioning metadata in constants at the top of the component:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>Chart</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> data <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Design is about constantly closing the gap between what users expect from your product and what it actually does. Product teams try to close this chasm every day, whether by user testing, tracking metrics and behavior, or seeking feedback. In attempts to bridge this user experience communication gap, teams often forget the most important thing — the text.</p>



<p>Product copy, or the text found on user interfaces, is the most under-leveraged part of product development today. Here are a few reasons why.</p>



<h5>Editing copy is your highest ROI lever</h5>



<p>Unlike almost anything else in product development, editing copy doesn’t require any engineering or design lift. Working on copy is about <em>maximizing the utility of your existing feature set</em>.</p>



<p>In many cases, the cheapest and most practical solution to a problem is well-written copy. Rather than committing a team’s time to building an entirely new feature, editing the copy goes a long way in user retention and engagement.</p>



<p>Whether it’s a clearer error state that helps users self-correct or an empty state that helps users get started, editing text can directly affect metrics. [1] It’s easy for the conversation around copy to revolve around marketing copy (thinking about text on a landing page or a marketing email and whether or not it converts), but this conversation around the importance of text needs to shift to product as well.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s no substitute for poor design, but bad copy can make even the best designs ineffective.</p>



<h5>Product copy is your most direct line of communication to users</h5>



<p>As John Maeda expressed with his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/208035080" target="_blank">2017 Design in Tech report</a>, “Words are really important because the graphics don’t make sense sometimes.”</p>



<p>Product copy makes expected user behavior <em>explicit</em>. It’s your chance to communicate intent. In being what your users actually read, the text anchors the user experience and bridges gaps in expectation. As UX writer Ryan Cordell&nbsp;points out:</p>



<div><p>“Microcopy is how your product communicates. It provides answers, feedback, comfort, guidance, encouragement and more. If we fail to design the words we use, this still communicates something to the user. It says we can’t or don’t want to help. It says we don’t care as much as we should. And that’s catastrophic for the customer experience.” [2]</p></div>



<p>Ultimately in building a product, you’re optimizing for user understanding — to surface the value of the features that your team spent so long to build.</p>



<h5>Text is what guides users when they venture off the happy path</h5>



<p>It’s often easy for designers and PM’s to optimize for the happy path: the user experience that most closely aligns with their own expectations of how the product should be used. However, we all know that expectations often exist in isolation from how people actually use your product — and much of the burden of steering users back on track <em>relies on the text</em>.</p>



<p>Copy serves as your product’s guardrails. Whether it’s an error message, a new user experience, or an empty state, it’s often <em>text</em> that guides users when they don’t know what to expect. In a study conducted by Microsoft Azure’s design team, user test errors<em> decreased by 44%</em> after copy changes alone. [3]</p>



<p>It’s in these moments of mismatched expectations that clarity is most critical. This is especially true as the role of software expands. From health-tech to purchasing houses and cars, the sole responsibility of guiding people through complex and important decisions is now carried by the digital experience.</p>



<p>Often times, however, because these non-ideal users journeys don’t get designed, users are greeted with generic text written ad-hoc by the last person that touches it.</p>



<h5>Copy exists from end to end</h5>



<p>Almost every single step of the product development process works in verticals — designers work in design tools and then pass designs off to developers that work in devtools. The same verticalization of tooling and work applies to almost every other step of building a software product with a team.</p>



<p>The <em>exception</em> to this verticalization of product development is the copy, which exists from the very beginning (specs, drafts) all the way to the very end (in the final product) and is touched by everyone from design to engineering to legal to marketing.</p>



<p>Rather than existing as one-offs, the product text works in a system to build trust for users. Like the narrator in a story, copy sets the context and defines the goals. [4] Thinking about copy early means being intentional about the information you convey to users — and drives design decisions like progressive disclosure and information architecture.</p>



<hr>



<p>Let’s be clear: writing good copy is <em>hard</em>. It might not be glanceably flashy the same way a Dribbble post might be. Text often “looks” the same in a design at first- and second-pass, even after edits. Reworking copy can be painstaking — and requires an in-depth understanding of both the product and the user.</p>



<p>But as we want to build and design products that shape how people interact with the world, we shouldn’t overlook the obvious when communicating: the words.</p>



<hr>



















<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>



<div><div>
<div><p>[0] In full disclosure, our belief that text should be first-class in building product has led Jolena and I to building <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://dittowords.com/" target="_blank">Ditto</a>. 🤗</p></div>
</div></div>



<p>[1] Even really simple copy changes change produce enormous ROI. <a href="https://www.directyourbookings.com/blog/marketing/convert-better-with-ux-writing-hotel-case-study-by-google/">One example</a> of many is the 17% increase in engagement when Google Travel replaced “Book a Room” with “Check Availability”.</p>



<p>[2] You can find more great excerpts from Ryan’s post on communication theory and microcopy <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/3-communication-theories-that-will-help-you-write-better-microcopy-and-make-better-products-4df25571ca6f">here</a>.</p>



<p>[3] In addition to decreased user test errors, the metrics-driven insights found by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyliehansen">Kylie Hansen</a>‘s team impacted NPS, customer retention, active users, and more. She goes over some of it <a href="https://ellessmedia.com/csi/kylie-hansen/">here</a>.</p>



<p>[4a] A scenario that often requires high trust is a monetary transaction. Increasing transparency by clearly surfacing what to expect is something that <a href="https://uxplanet.org/this-is-ux-writing-at-its-very-best-2806f3f386e0">both Airbnb and Amazon do well</a>.</p>



<p>[4b] Over coffee, <a href="https://medium.com/@jsaito">John Saito</a> once mentioned to us that the product of Dropbox itself had more words than a Harry Potter novel!</p>

					<p><em><span>Project Post</span></em></p>
<p><span>Today, the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) voted to accept Contour as an incubation-level hosted project.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://projectcontour.io/"><span>Contour</span></a><span> is a high-performance ingress controller for Kubernetes that provides a control plane for </span><a href="https://envoyproxy.io/"><span>Envoy</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>“One of the most important steps for running workloads at scale with Kubernetes is to implement efficient Layer 7 traffic ingress management,” said Matt Klein, software engineer at Lyft and TOC sponsor for Contour. “Contour fills a common operational gap by providing a way for users to access applications within a Kubernetes cluster. As Contour is already integrated with Envoy, it is a natural fit for CNCF, and we look forward to helping the project build its community.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Contour works by deploying Envoy as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Contour supports dynamic configuration updates and multi-team Kubernetes clusters with the ability to limit the Namespaces that may configure virtual hosts and TLS credentials as well as provide advanced load balancing strategies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We believe CNCF can play a big role in shaping the future of ingress controllers, a critical part of any cloud native infrastructure,” said Michael Michael, Contour maintainer, and director of product management at VMware. “We are excited to have a vendor neutral home, encouraging more companies and contributors to join our community, contribute, and help us deliver on the vision of Contour.”</span></p>
<p><span>Contour has been adopted by a number of well-known organizations and enterprises in production, including Adobe, Kinvolk, Kintone, PhishLabs, and Replicated. Adobe has</span><a href="https://youtu.be/39FLsSc2P-Y?t=83"><span> adopted Contour</span></a><span> as its ingress controller for “Project Ethos”, a multi-tenant Kubernetes based platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Main Contour Features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Envoy Inside: Contour is built as the control plane for Envoy, the high performance L7 proxy and load balancer</span></li>
<li><span>Flexible Architecture: Contour can be deployed as either a Kubernetes deployment or daemonset</span></li>
<li><span>Multi-team support: Safely support ingress in multi-team Kubernetes clusters</span></li>
<li><span>TLS Certificate Delegation: Administrators can delegate wildcard certificate access more securely</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Notable Milestones:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>329 Contributors&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>91 Committers</span></li>
<li><span>2.3k GitHub Stars</span></li>
<li><span>375 Forks</span></li>
<li><span>48 Releases</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>“Modern distributed systems rely on networking and connectivity, making ingress controllers for Kubernetes an essential piece of architecture,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Contour is a logical complement to Envoy and makes it easier to consume in a cloud native, multi-team environment. As Envoy is an incredibly popular graduated project, we look forward to seeing what Contour will accomplish as part of CNCF.”</span></p>
<p><span>Contour has an active </span><a href="https://github.com/projectcontour/community/blob/master/ROADMAP.md"><span>roadmap</span></a><span> and plans to add support for </span><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-apis"><span>Kubernetes Service APIs</span></a><span> and for routing services across Kubernetes clusters. The team also plans to enable support for Envoy features like rate limiting, auth, and access log service.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2017 Contour was created at Heptio, which was then acquired by VMware in 2018. The team released v1.0 in November 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a CNCF hosted project, joining incubating technologies like OpenTracing, gRPC, CNI, Notary, NATS, Linkerd, Rook, etcd, OPA, CRI-O, TiKV, CloudEvents, Falco, Argo, Dragonfly, and SPIFFE and SPIRE, Contour is part of a neutral foundation aligned with its technical interests, as well as the larger Linux Foundation, which provides governance, marketing support, and community outreach.</span></p>
<p><span>Every CNCF project has an associated maturity level: sandbox, incubating, or graduated. For more information on maturity requirements for each level, please visit the </span><a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc"><span>CNCF Graduation Criteria</span></a><span>.</span></p>

And from a business perspective, it can let you determine cost based on customer seats instead of unbounded number of calls to a cloud provider.</p><h2 id="demo-application-smart-lighting">Demo Application: Smart Lighting</h2><p>Here is a web demonstration application that uses <a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/porcupine">Porcupine</a> (wake word detection) and <a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/rhino">Rhino</a> (Speech-to-Intent) engines to control smart lights in a home.</p><p><span><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Welcome to the smart home!

You can see more web demos <a href="https://picovoice.ai/demos/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="how-to-embed-voice-ai-in-the-browser">How to embed Voice AI in the browser</h2><p>To achieve offline voice AI, we can use speech technology from Picovoice. Picovoice engines run in modern web browsers via WebAssembly. A typical use case involves providing the engines realtime audio input from the microphone, and receiving events back (e.g. hotword detected).</p><p>The core of running any Picovoice engine in the browser is simply three files: a WebAssembly module, its wrapper, and a binding file. The binding provides a factory method for creating an instance of the engine. The engine fires a callback to signal that the WASM has finished loading, accepts frames of audio, and returns the engine results.</p><p>We will expand on this foundation with additional steps to setup streaming audio, request microphone permission, and downsample audio to the required format. We’ve provided demo code to assist with those tasks.</p><h3 id="web-audio-api-and-microphone-access">Web Audio API and Microphone access</h3><p>Picovoice uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a> to process streaming audio. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices">MediaDevices API</a> is used to access the microphone. The user must explicitly grant permission to access the microphone before any audio processing can occur. This is mandatory due to browsers’ security model. Additionally, the browser requires an HTTPS connection to allow microphone access (for testing locally, HTTP will suffice).</p><h3 id="web-voice-processor">Web Voice Processor</h3><p>Picovoice engines accept industry standard 16KHz audio for speech processing. When accessing microphone audio, we need to downsample it to this format. We also need to ask for permission from the user to access their microphone, and connect the input to the downsampler. To handle these tasks we have provided the <a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/web-voice-processor">Web Voice Processor</a> package. It is also available on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@picovoice/web-voice-processor">npm</a>.</p><h3 id="web-workers">Web Workers</h3><p>Picovoice recommends using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Workers</a> to run the engines in the background. Workers separate the speech processing from the main JavaScript thread.</p><p><img src="https://picovoice.ai/static/callbacks-c8a5873581c231ecd10793ca212b2f8d.svg" alt="Callbacks and Workers"></p><p>The demo code includes Porcupine and Rhino web worker scripts. They communicate with managers in the main thread using <code>postMessage()</code>. In addition, the Web Voice Processor performs downsampling via its own dedicated worker.</p><h3 id="open-source-demo-applications">Open Source Demo Applications</h3><p>We have provided demo code for the Porcupine and Rhino engines (including running both together) that will run in a recent web browser without transpilation required.</p><p>The Porcupine demo allows you to control a smart lamp with always-listening commands.</p><p>The Smart Lighting demo uses Rhino to handle smart home lighting with natural language commands like “dim the living room lights”. There’s also an always listening version of this demo that uses Porcupine as a trigger to wake the smart home lighting and then use the natural language commands.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine/tree/master/demo/javascript">Porcupine Smart Lamp</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/rhino/tree/master/demo/javascript/standalone">Rhino Smart Home Lighting</a> (standalone push-to-talk)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/rhino/tree/master/demo/javascript/always-listening">Rhino Smart Home Lighting</a> (always-listening using Porcupine)</li></ul><p><span><p>The code provided is for demonsration purposes and we do not recommend or support linking to the source code directly.

How do I use this with e.g. Webpack?</h3><p>The JavaScript code provided is fairly conservative and does not use ES6 and newer language features, notably modules (that said, a modern browser is required to work with all of the aforementioned Audio, Worker, and WASM APIs). You may wish to e.g. convert one of the <a href="https://github.com/Picovoice/rhino/blob/master/demo/javascript/shared/ppn_rhn_manager.js">Manager IIFEs</a> to a class and provide a module export which would allow you to elegantly integrate it with a typical Webpack/Babel setup.</p><p>Alternatively, you can simply add the scripts as-is to the HTML document head using something like <a href="https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet">React Helmet</a>, and provide them in a static/public folder with your web application.</p><h3 id="which-picovoice-engines-run-in-the-browser">Which Picovoice Engines run in the browser?</h3><p>All of them.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Engine</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/porcupine/">Porcupine</a></td><td>Wake word detection</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/rhino/">Rhino</a></td><td>Speech-to-intent (NLU)</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/cheetah/">Cheetah</a></td><td>Speech-to-text (realtime; live feedback)</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/cheetah/">Leopard</a></td><td>Speech-to-text (file-based; accuracy boost)</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://picovoice.ai/products/octopus/">Octopus</a></td><td>Speech-to-index (voice search)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="how-do-i-create-custom-wake-words-or-speech-to-intent-contexts-for-the-web">How do I create custom wake words or speech-to-intent contexts for the web?</h3><p>You can use the <a href="https://picovoice.ai/console/">Picovoice Console</a> to create wake words and design and train speech-to-intent contexts.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Art-Guide.jpg" alt="Math Vault — The Definitive Desmos Art Guide to Computational Sketching" width="800" height="480" title="Desmos Art Guide" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Art-Guide.jpg"></p><p>If you’re of the type who enjoys playing around with graphing calculator, then you might be interested in the so-called <strong>Desmos Art</strong>. These are basically&nbsp;<em>pictures</em> and <em>animations</em>&nbsp;created in <a href="https://www.desmos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Desmos</a>&nbsp;primarily through the clever use of <em>equations</em> and <em>inequalities</em> — among other features such as <em>tables</em>, <em>animating sliders</em> and <em>regression&nbsp;models</em>.&nbsp;Indeed, if you go to <a href="https://www.desmos.com/art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this official staff pick page</a>, you&nbsp;should&nbsp;see that a whole bunch of creative artworks were already being created — anything from&nbsp;<em>cartoon characters</em>,&nbsp;<em>landscape</em>&nbsp;to <em>logos</em> and <em>portraits</em>.</p><p>But here’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem: when you reach a Desmos artwork page, you&nbsp;get to see the end-result with all the <em>equations</em> and <em>inequalities</em>, without necessarily having any clue about how the sketching process comes about from the beginning to the end:</p><ul><li>Why does this weird-looking equation pop out from <em>nowhere</em>?</li><li>How did the author know that $3.982$ is the <em>leading coefficient</em> to use?</li><li>And how did those numbers get so precise up to <em>four</em>&nbsp;decimals digits?</li></ul><p>To remedy this situation, we came up with a laborious and&nbsp;interesting solution: we decided to go out there and create a new Desmos sketch from scratch, and work backward to comment a bit on&nbsp;the <em>steps</em>, <em>procedures</em> and <em>reasoning</em> involved&nbsp;in the sketching process —&nbsp;as we go through the different&nbsp;stages and portions&nbsp;of the drawing.</p><p>And with that, let’s proceed straight into our Desmos Art guide in <strong>computational sketching</strong>, which — as you might have guessed — is going to be both fun and informative — even if you have no intention whatsoever of using any graphing calculator in the near future. <span id="more-7609"></span></p><h2 id="s1"><span id="Step_1_Initial_Setup_%E2%80%94_Source_Picture"></span><a href="#toc">Step 1: Initial Setup — Source&nbsp;Picture</a><span></span></h2><p>Unless you are some kind of sketching guru — which we certainly are not — it’s generally better to&nbsp;base the&nbsp;sketching on some underlying model: some picture that you actually want to draw; some picture that&nbsp;you can rely upon in case the&nbsp;sketching derails&nbsp;by a huge&nbsp;margin.</p><p>And in case it’s&nbsp;not clear enough, you should only choose a picture that you really, <em>really</em> enjoy sketching&nbsp;— something that you can derive a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;satisfaction from. This is because unlike ordinary <em>pencil-and-eraser sketching</em>, sketching in Desmos has to be done by&nbsp;filling the command lines with <strong>equations</strong>, <strong>tables</strong> and <strong>inequalities</strong>, so that&nbsp;if you can’t fuel enough passion into a drawing, then the time and effort invested into reproducing it&nbsp;is&nbsp;probably not going to worth it.</p><p>Also, when choosing a picture, take good care to select one that is <em>not</em> too difficult to draw. Otherwise, you might have to regret your decision much later when you’re already, say, 21 hours into the process. Of course, you&nbsp;don’t want to make the picture too easy either, as it might not be much of a gratifying experience if you&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;that&nbsp;way.</p><p>In our case, using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/gold/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit Gold</a>&nbsp;membership recently awarded to us, we went out there and created&nbsp;our first very own&nbsp;signature <em>Reddit alien avatar</em>:</p><div id="attachment_8064"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8064" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Vault-Redditbot.png" alt="Math Vault Snoovtar — Redditlady and Redditdog" width="520" height="520" title="Math Vault Redditbot" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20520%20520'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Vault-Redditbot.png"></p><p id="caption-attachment-8064">Guess who’s in the house? The <strong>Math Vault Snoovtar</strong>! (<em>alien avatar</em> in Redditese)</p></div><p>For the lack of better terms, let’s just call these lovely creatures <em>Math Vault Redditlady</em> and <em>Redditdog</em>, respectively. Now,&nbsp;does this logo make a good choice as a <em>source image</em>? We certainly think it does:</p><ul><li><strong>Passion Level</strong>: Since we only create avatars that we like, channeling energy into recreating the creatures invented in part by ourselves is definitely not an issue.</li><li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Both the Redditlady and the Redditdog have very&nbsp;<em>well-defined </em>borders and colors,&nbsp;making it a formidable&nbsp;challenge that’s not&nbsp;too intimidating.</li></ul><p>And with both criteria passed, we proceed to happily import&nbsp;our avatar image into Desmos. By default, Desmos likes to set the <strong>origin</strong> $(0,0)$ as the <em>center</em> of the image, and that is a good choice for most purposes. However, depending on the size of the&nbsp;source image, sometimes it makes sense to consider rescaling it so that <em>at the default zoom level</em>, the image occupies around 70% of the <strong>graphing grid</strong>&nbsp;either in height or in width. If the image is too small, then it’s hard to appreciate any&nbsp;fine detail, and if it’s too big, then one&nbsp;might&nbsp;have a hard time focusing on the big picture — literally.</p><p>In our case, since the&nbsp;avatar is&nbsp;just about the right size to start with, we decided to keep the <strong>dimension</strong> of the image to the default $10 \times 10$ setting at the end. We also didn’t alter&nbsp;the image’s&nbsp;<strong>aspect ratio</strong>&nbsp;either, which in many cases aren’t really&nbsp;necessary anyway.</p><p>But just to drive the message home a bit, setting up a&nbsp;source image correctly from the get-go is more important than it seems, since the last thing we&nbsp;want to be doing is to, say,&nbsp;<em>rescale</em> the image to an appropriate size after being&nbsp;already halfway through the sketching process.</p><h2 id="s2"><span id="Step_2_Divide_and_Conquer"></span><a href="#toc">Step 2: Divide and Conquer</a><span></span></h2><p>How do you deal with a huge task that seems impossible to complete? You partition the task into smaller subtasks. That is, tasks that are so small that you actually enjoy doing them!</p><p>In particular, when it comes to sketching in Desmos, you want&nbsp;to section the picture into different <strong>portions</strong>, each of which can be&nbsp;finished in a reasonable amount of time, so&nbsp;that when it comes to the time of&nbsp;sketching, you focus on one&nbsp;single portion and one&nbsp;single&nbsp;portion only.</p><p>In our case, since we know that sketching the entire Redditlady and its companion pet can be quite a challenge, instead of resorting to despair, we divide the entire avatar into 6 portions — from the top to the bottom:</p><div><div><ul><li>Hand &amp; Rubik’s Cube</li><li>Skirt</li><li>Redditdog</li></ul></div></div><div><figure><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Folders.jpg" alt="Sketching in Desmos: Using Folder to Organize Command Lines" width="470" height="574" title="Desmos Folders" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20470%20574'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Desmos-Folders.jpg"><figcaption>Math Vault Redditbots&nbsp;cut into 6 pieces. Neat!</figcaption></figure></div><p> By inspection, while we see that most of these portions are&nbsp;relatively simple&nbsp;to implement, we still anticipate some challenges ahead of us when it comes to the&nbsp;Armor portion. In an attempt to make the Armor less intimidating, we proceed to&nbsp;subdivide it&nbsp;further into 7&nbsp;<strong>subportions</strong>:</p><div><div><ul><li>Left Shoulder</li><li>Right Shoulder</li><li>Collar</li><li>Arm</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Chest</li><li>“Lungs”</li><li>“Outer Lungs”</li></ul></div></div><p>With the gist of our&nbsp;organisational structure now settled, we then proceed to create a&nbsp;<strong>Desmos folder</strong>&nbsp;for each of the general portions, all of the while making a mental note that every command line pertaining to a specific&nbsp;portion should&nbsp;be <em>dragged</em> into its&nbsp;associated folder — if it’s not already in there.</p><p>And while Desmos doesn’t really support <em>folder nesting</em> at this point, there’s nothing preventing us from using&nbsp;<strong>comment lines</strong> to provide labels for the subportions. True, while this level of organization could&nbsp;be an <em>overkill</em> for a simple picture, as the complexity&nbsp;of the&nbsp;picture increases, structuring the command lines this way can make&nbsp;<em>line identification</em> and <em>future reference </em>substantially easier.</p><div><figure><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Armor-Subportions.gif" alt="Sketching in Desmos: Using Comment To Label Subportions of the Image" width="414" height="387" title="Armor Subportions" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20414%20387'%3E%3C/svg%3E"><figcaption> A list of command lines under the Armor folder.

We call this <strong>portion crunching</strong>, and&nbsp;is done in part to ensure that the work completed&nbsp;with minimal resistance&nbsp;and mental blocks.

However, since these curve&nbsp;segments&nbsp;tend&nbsp;interact with each other, it would be hard for us to draw these segments <em>sequentially</em>&nbsp;— as would be done in ordinary pencil-and-eraser sketching.&nbsp;<span>Instead, we prefer to resort to the strategy&nbsp;as outlined below:</span></p><blockquote><ol><li>Model a curve segment using an appropriate class of <strong>equations</strong>, and leave its&nbsp;graph&nbsp;with the&nbsp;full domain <em>intact</em>.</li><li>Do the modeling for <em>each</em>&nbsp;of the curve segments in the close figure.</li><li>Cut off the excessive parts of&nbsp;each curve — by imposing <strong>restrictions</strong> on the&nbsp;associated equation.</li></ol></blockquote><p>In particular, we&nbsp;want the curve trimming to&nbsp;happen at the very end, because&nbsp;once the curve modeling are done for each curve segment in&nbsp;a close figure, Desmos will map out all&nbsp;the <strong>intersection points</strong>&nbsp;along with&nbsp;their coordinates — the latter of which provide key information as to where&nbsp;to cut off the&nbsp;curves, and might not be available had&nbsp;we&nbsp;decided to trim the curves off from the get-go.</p><p>In actuality though, we’ll&nbsp;probably spend more time modeling the curve segments rather than trimming&nbsp;them&nbsp;— as there are&nbsp;simply too many&nbsp;curves&nbsp;in too many&nbsp;different shapes and forms.

<p>If you are bootstrapping like us and you can’t burn money on CPC campaigns, you need to find out clever ways to acquire new customers.</p>



<p>For us, it’s even worst because we are in a very crowded market and the live chat keyword has an incredible high bid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have tried several times to purchase live chat keywords on google and other PPC programs like <a href="https://www.capterra.com/p/173977/Customerly/reviews/">Capterra</a>.</p>



<p>We never had a satisfying result from them.</p>



<p>They are very expensive in a range of 20$ per click on google and starting at 2$ per click on Capterra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is we have never had a campaign with a proper return of the investment.</p>



<p>We decided then to focus on channels that always worked for us:</p>



<ul><li>Referrals</li><li>Partnerships</li><li>Integrations</li></ul>



<p>We have grown from 0 to 6000 signups for free thanks to the “powered by” label you can find in our live chat of the basic plan accounts.</p>



<h2>The WordPress Live Chat plugin Integration</h2>



<p>When we decided to help our WordPress customers with an easier integration of the live chat within their WordPress website we never thought it was such an incredible opportunity of growth.</p>



<p>The Live Chat WordPress plugin was quite easy to develop, it’s just a wrapper of the JavaScript code with some tweaks to fetch user’s data automatically for our customers.</p>



<p>People were searching for a quick live chat to use on their websites and we have a solution for them.</p>



<p>The plugin itself took 10 hours of coding. It was very basic and was doing its job quite well in terms of functionalities.</p>



<p>When you installed the first version of the live chat plugin of Customerly you could do an onboarding that redirects you to the Customerly dashboard to complete the customization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you had complete the submission on Customerly you needed to grab the project id and paste it in a small input textbox, save and then the live chat was appearing on your website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magic right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took a while to understand how to optimize the onboarding experience, but before talking about this, let me start on how we have optimized the SEO within the WordPress’ plugin directory.</p>



<p>Follow me from here because I’m going to share with you the exact optimization strategies that I’ve learned by bringing our live chat WordPress plugin from the 33 positions for the<strong>&nbsp;live chat</strong>&nbsp;keyword to the 4 positions. Ranking above HubSpot.</p>

<h2>Choose the right Keywords</h2>



<p>For us it is quite easy, the keyword to focus on are three:</p>



<ul><li>Live Chat</li><li>Free Live Chat</li><li>Live Chat Free</li></ul>



<p>Think about in terms of anything related to your product that can be interesting for someone searching on the directory.</p>



<p>For example, we do offer a <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/email-marketing-newsletter-template-builder?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly">newsletter</a> and <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/visual-marketing-sales-funnel-automation?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funnel</a> service at a smaller cost than MailChimp and it can be integrated easily with MailMunch and Elementor forms.</p>



<p>We decided to use these keywords in the FAQ to let people find the plugin since they are related to what we do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I strongly suggest you focus on one single keyword for the title and the presentation though.</p>



<p>People need a <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/live-chat-software-for-customer-support?utm_campaign=WPplugin&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Live Chat for their website</a>, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where do you go to search for a WordPress plugin?</p>



<p>Google or WordPress directory.</p>



<p>The WordPress directory itself has enormous traffic you can turn into your customer acquisition flow for free.</p>



<p>We cannot know exactly the amount of searches for each keyword on the WordPress plugin directory but we have two ways to understand to which one has more traffic:</p>



<ul><li>The google keyword planner is a good start to understand volumes.</li><li>Check the first 3 plugins that are listed for a specific keyword and analyze their daily downloads.</li></ul>



<p>You can check ANY WordPress plugin performance by adding /advanced/ at the end of the URL like this: https://wordpress.org/plugins/customerly/advanced/</p>



<p>Sum their daily downloads and you will get a sense of the traffic you can get from that keyword.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The Plugin Readme</strong></h2>



<p>When we released the first version I didn’t know the readme was the most important part of the game and was the last thing I’ve focused on.</p>



<p>In fact, that single file alone is the reason why today we have got 13k B2B signups for free.</p>



<p><em>That one plus a few other tricks.</em></p>



<p>I thought it was just a description of the plugin without any importance for ranking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I’ve written a small description on how to install the plugin and link the chat to the website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Very nerdy and not attractive at all.</p>



<p>I started wondering if there was a way to rank on the top 10 and this is my journey to it.</p>



<p>There are very few articles online on how to optimize your WordPress plugin to rank on the directory and no SaaS to keep track of your SEO improvements while optimizing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with my curiosity, I started to AB testing almost everything I could.</p>



<p>And it worked.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>The WordPress Directory Competitor Analysis&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>First of all, I started by analyzing the competitors for the live chat keyword.</p>



<p>I’ve found out a weird behaviour of the ranking algorithm: a bunch of live chat plugins with very few active installs were ranking higher than others with hundreds of thousands of installs.</p>



<p>As you can see from the screenshot above when we ranked above HubSpot we had just 500+ active installs versus 80,000+ active installs of HubSpot.</p>



<p>That’s when I started thinking, we can rank in the top 10 too even if we have just released with very few active installs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But how?</p>



<p>So I started with optimizing the readme in 3 ways:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Adding Keywords in the Title</li><li>Adding Keywords in the small description&nbsp;</li><li>A lot of keywords in the long descriptions</li></ul>



<p>Below you can see how many times we added the keyword live chat in the Readme when we have updated it.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?fit=1024%2C789&amp;ssl=1" alt="WordPress Live Chat plugin Readme" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?w=1542&amp;ssl=1 1542w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=1024%2C789&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=768%2C592&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Plugin_directory_optimization_for_Live_Chat.jpg?resize=1536%2C1183&amp;ssl=1 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>I noticed 2 minutes after the submission of the new readme version we ranked 20 positions higher.</p>



<p>The difference between Google and WordPress ranking is that WordPress is immediately updated.</p>



<p>So you can immediately know if you have done something wrong or good.</p>



<p>I started A/B testing and it worked quite well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were on the first page (top 20 results) and I knew I could do something else to optimize.</p>



<p>We decided to extend the optimization to the FAQ.</p>



<p>So I started adding keywords to the question and within the answer.</p>



<p>It worked great as well! A few minutes later we were ranking in the top 9 positions for the live chat keyword.</p>



<p>Bam!</p>



<p>The day after we saw a spike of installs but the signups were still very few.</p>



<h2><strong>The importance of active install growth&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>At the time, to install the live chat you needed to follow a link to the Customerly dashboard from your WordPress dashboard to signup.</p>



<p>This process was tricky and a lot of WordPress users were abandoning the signup because they felt it was not a WordPress integrated experience.</p>



<p>Since the signup process was long and boring people were installing the plugin and after few days uninstalling it because of that.</p>



<p>This behaviour brought down the active install growth percentage and we started losing a few positions.</p>



<p>This is what we have done to fix this. 👇🏻</p>



<p>The signup process and linking between your WordPress website and the Customerly live chat ID was a 10-step long painful process.</p>



<p>We lowered down this signups process to 2 steps:</p>



<ul><li>Add a password</li><li>Click a button</li></ul>



<p>And you are now ready to go.</p>



<p>We focused on removing all possible frictions.</p>



<p>That was it.</p>



<p>That brought 10 times the installs we had before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So the signups.</p>



<p>“Make it easy” and do not over complicate the process is always the key.</p>

<p>I wasn’t still happy with the rank, I wanted to be in the top 5 positions.</p>



<p>But how?</p>



<h2>WordPress Support Forum</h2>



<p>I discovered that forum’s support requests are public and ranked. I started wondering if they could affect the ranking.</p>



<p>If you think about it, the more support requests related to the keyword you are optimizing you have, the more people might find the right plugin in what you have.</p>



<p>So I thought to send people there to ask for support about the live chat.</p>



<p>After 5 support tickets with the keywords in the question and the answer made the trick.</p>



<p>You can access to the support with this url: <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/</a></p>



<p>We were above HubSpot and just below LiveChat. Boom 💥&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Are Ratings really important?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>I started wondering if ratings might affect the ranking as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was analyzing the positions on the charts, I’ve created a small piece of software to check everyday movements of the plugins, their reviews, average review and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?fit=1024%2C497&amp;ssl=1" alt="WP Live Chat downloads SaaS " srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?w=1256&amp;ssl=1 1256w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?resize=1024%2C497&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wordpress_Live_Chat_downloads.jpg?resize=768%2C373&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>It seemed to be not as important as the support tickets.</p>



<p>But I wanted to give them a try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The strategy here was simple and lean-to implement. I’ve added two ways to ask for reviews:</p>



<ul><li>Customerly Funnels with a Bonus Email (5 minutes)</li><li>Review Links in the plugin (30 minutes of develop time)</li></ul>



<p>The Funnel</p>



<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C626&amp;ssl=1" alt="Funnel for Live Chat WP Reviews" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C626&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C938&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/www.customerly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Customerly_Live_Chat_Plugin_Funnel_for_Reviews-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1251&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>I’ve created a behavioural funnel with <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/visual-marketing-sales-funnel-automation?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Customerly Funnels</a> to deliver an email to all our WordPress amazing users after few days from the install of their Customerly Live Chat on their website.</p>



<div id=""><div><div><div><h3>Get the most out of your SaaS by using Behavioural Funnels</h3><p>Trigger messages or emails based on your customers’ behaviour on your SaaS</p></div></div></div></div>



<p>The email goes straight to the point: if you leave an honest review of the live chat, we will give you the Pro plan for free for 3 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the actual email body:</p>



<div><div>
<p>” Hey {{name}},<br>thank you so much for installing our WordPress plugin 🙏</p>



<p>We have a bonus for you!</p>



<p>🔥 3 months of PRO plan when you drop us a sincere&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/reviews/#new-post">WordPress review.</a></p>



<p>👉 To get the 3 months for free all you need to do is:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customerly/reviews/#new-post">Write a sincere review here</a></li><li>Reply to this email with your username you have used.</li></ul>



<p>Once we receive your email back we will personally send you a coupon code with your 3 months bonus.</p>



<p>Done deal?”</p>








</div></div>



<p>[I’ve crafted and shared with everyone a ready-to-use <a href="https://www.customerly.io/en/visual-marketing-sales-funnel-automation?utm_campaign=wpoptim&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=Customerly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funnel template</a> to ask for reviews]</p>



<p>The funnel email hack worked. We have got immediately 10+ reviews and it was still working in terms of reviews left when we decided to turn it off.</p>

          <p>Some weeks ago I asked a few of the Codelitt team members a simple question:</p><blockquote>“What is UX?”</blockquote><p>I was happy that no one shied away from answering, and the difference in their responses was incredible:</p><p><strong>Engineers</strong> focused their answers in very pragmatic areas that all revolved around <em>friction</em> and how to reduce it. The experience “behind the curtain” that helps make interactions smooth was what they thought of. Things like loading times or making sure that buttons were clickable came to their minds.</p><p><strong>Designers</strong> saw the importance of researching both the users and business who would be investing in the product. They cared about making sure that the brand’s values were enhancing the experience. They wanted the users &amp; customers to know exactly what to expect when interacting with their products.</p><p><strong>Project Managers</strong> focused on understanding and empathizing with the users so that the end product is intuitive and useful to the user.</p><figure><img src="https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/codelitt-user-experience.jpg"></figure><p>Simply put, UX means “User Experience”: it’s the experience that a user has while interacting with a product. UX <em>Design</em> is, by definition, the process by which we determine what that experience will be.</p><p>UX Design always happens. Whether it’s intentional or not, somebody makes the decisions about how the human and the product will interact. <em>Good</em> UX Design happens when we make these decisions in a way that understands and fulfills the needs of both our users and our business.</p><p>UX encompasses so many disciplines that it’s unfair to think of it as a sphere within visual design. Quite the contrary! The building of an interface is a <em>subset</em> of that product’s experience design.</p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/codelitt-ux.jpg"></figure><p><strong>UX happens whenever a human interacts with a product</strong>. Any product. Take a pencil, for example. There’s the way that the wood, plastic or metal feels on your hand, the way it falls on your fingers, the feel of the graphite against the paper. Does it have a rubber end or a button you have to press to get the graphite out? In every case, it’s all been thoroughly thought out and designed, each component a part of the experience of writing with a pencil.</p><p>From the business objective, to the product’s stakeholders, designers, engineers and project managers, the experience encompasses every person working on it. It is the culmination of a multitude of disciplines working together. Every decision we make when building a product shapes that experience. UX is at the heart of everything we do.</p>

July 9, 2020 | https://www.feval.ca/posts/screenr/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.feval.ca/posts/screenr/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    



<p>I tried <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>, the new e-mail service built by Basecamp. It is great, simple, smart. They’ve put a lot of thoughts behind re-inventing email. There are some pretty interesting features but fundamentally what is different is the opinionated workflow on which it operates.</p>

<p>The only mail that lends into the “Imbox” (how they name the important inbox) is from senders the user allowed. The first time they receive an email from someone, it ends in a staging zone, and then the user need to screen senders and decide if they want to receive emails from them, and where they want these email to lend: 1. in the imbox, 2. in a set of “feeds” (email that is casually read), 3. in the “paper trail” (receipts, …).</p>

<p>I liked the overall experience of Hey, and was about to subscribe. However there are two things that are a no-go for me. It doesn’t support custom domains for email addresses (yet)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, and there is no “archive” feature<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. So I decided against that.</p>

<p>But I really liked the workflow, and I figured it shouldn’t be that big of a deal to re-create something similar in a plain-old mailbox.</p>



<p>Here’s what I need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Senders need to be screened for their spam to be allowed in my inbox. I figured this can probably be done by redirecting mail from senders I never screened into a sub-folder and reviewing that occasionally.</li>
  <li>Screening senders need to be dead easy. That’s the beauty of Hey: screening is done by clicking on a thumbs-up or thumbs-down button. That’s why it works, no non-sense of creating or editing rules.</li>
  <li>Support the same kind of classifying structure. I already had a <em>newsletter</em> folder with a few manually created rules, and a <em>reference</em> folder in which I would occasionally put a mail that I wanted to retrieve easily - this is just automating that.</li>
  <li>Works from my computer or my phone, using existing apps. There is no point in starting a multi-month project and implement a working email UI, this needs to fit within my limited evenings and kids naps.</li>
  <li>Low maintenance, for the same reason.</li>
</ol>



<p>So I built <a href="https://github.com/cfe84/screenr">Screenr</a>.</p>

<p>Screenr plugs to an email server<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, monitors email in folders, and classifies email into a set of folders.</p>

<p>Incoming emails from unknown senders (i.e. with an email address that has not been seen yet) are moved to a “For screening” folder. Emails from screened senders are moved based on configuration: either leave in the inbox, or move it to a particular folder.</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	A[Inbound mail] --&gt; B(Inbox)
	B --&gt; C["Sender screened?"]
	C --&gt;|No| D("Move to 'For Screening'")
	C --&gt;|Yes| E(Move to configured folder)
</code></pre>

<p>To configure the tool, I just need to screen emails in the “For screening” folder occasionally, and move them based on where I want these to land: move emails from senders I still want in my inbox to a <em>Screened</em> folder (which then gets moved back into the inbox once Screenr registered the decision). Move emails I want to reject to a <em>Rejected</em> folder. Move emails I barely care about, such as newsletters, promotions, etc. into a <em>newsletter</em> folder. Move receipts, booking confirmations, order tracking info, tax documents, etc. into a <em>Reference</em> folder. If I move a single email between two monitored folder, then Screenr will move all of the mail from that sender into the new folder.</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	A[For screening] --&gt; C[Decide what to do with this sender]
	C --&gt;|Allow in inbox| D("Move to 'Screened'")
	C --&gt;|Ok but classify elsewhere| E(Move to the folder you want)
	C --&gt;|Don't want mail from them| F(Move to 'Rejected')
</code></pre>

<p>Screenr supports two configurations (at the folder level) to classify email: either move the email directly to the target folder, or through an intermediary “classification” folder (like the “Screened” folder for email for inbox). The reason for that is that you might want to occasionally classify email without creating a rule: e.g. if my spouse forwards me a booking confirmation it’s nice to file it into the <em>Reference</em> folder without automatically classifying everything she sends me as reference<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Bonus points: now I can change my default behavior for new email based on where I’m at. I archive email in my inbox - the reduced amount of email there makes inbox 0 much easier to attain - and delete email in the “newsletter” folder. Less thinking, inmore better.</p>



<p>There are 4 folders I’m watching:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/folders.jpg" alt="The folders I'm monitoring"></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Inbox</em> is the email that I (probably) care about. Once I read it, I archive it.</li>
  <li><em>Newsletter</em> is the stuff that I’m occasionally browsing, but it’s mostly composed of automatically sent emails and newsletters and there’s likely no required action. Once I read it, I (most likely) delete it.</li>
  <li><em>Papertrail</em> receives all my order confirmation, plane tickets, vouchers, etc. It usually just stays there. I used to call it <em>Reference</em> but I like Hey’s name better. Some of the mail I manually move there, mostly when my parents send me a scan of a bank record, or my wife sends me some reservation, because I don’t want to classify them there.</li>
  <li><em>For screening</em> is all the mail that I’m receiving from senders I haven’t reviewed yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>When something arrives in <em>For screening</em>, first I get excited because that’s proof that Screenr still does its job. Then I decide what to do with it by moving it in one of the folders:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/screening.jpg" alt="The folders I use for screening"></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Screened</em> is for emails I want in my inbox, like people I know, notifications I care about, etc. Screener registers my decision then move it (and potentially other emails by that sender) back into the inbox</li>
  <li><em>File in papertrail</em> is the same as screened, but for my <em>papertrail</em> folder.</li>
  <li><em>Rejected</em> is for what’s not exactly a spam, but I don’t actually want. Examples are emails from my car dealership, which is mostly spam, but which also sends me service confirmation once in a while, which I then go fishing in that folder and redirect to reference. Or companies who want me to wish them happy birthday:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/spam.jpg" alt="Example of some spammy email"></p>



<p>I wanted reasonable portability, my email provider recently released a bare-bones nodejs hosting and I figured I could give it a shot, so I settled for typescript. That host was hardly controllable, so I ended giving up and re-hosting onto the Kubernetes cluster from which you retrieved this static HTML page in a vastly over-complicated setup instead (more on this in <a href="https://www.feval.ca/posts/k8s-static/">this blog post</a>).</p>

<p>The application itself is decomposed into 4 layers following the onion architecture:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>domain</code>, contains the actual classification logic</li>
  <li><code>contracts</code>, contains interfaces and data exchange structures for the dependencies that the domain will need an implementation for, such as <code>IMailbox</code> which allows retrieving emails or moving them around, <code>Mails</code> which are those mails, or <code>IScreeningStorage</code> which provides interfaces to store screening behavior or retrieve it based on sender.</li>
  <li><code>infrastructure</code>, which are the particular implementations for those dependencies: an <code>IMAPMailbox</code> implementing <code>IMailbox</code> which provides said features for an IMAP server.</li>
  <li><code>application</code> which binds all the stuff together: loads configuration, instantiate infrastructure, inject in domain, then kick off the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the storage of screening results, I settled on a file-based system which stores everything in memory and serializes it back to a file in storage when new rules are detected.</p>

<p>Building the IMAP connector was the most painful. The client libraries in the node ecosystem are not super well maintained and documented<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, I tried two, and diagnosing some issues I was having<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">6</a></sup> was a straight pain that almost made me abandon. In retrospect I would probably pick .Net Core instead, given that the IMAP libraries are much more solid. If I want to make evolutions on that, I don’t exclude a rewrite ; the languages are sufficiently close that this wouldn’t be a big thing to do.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the hosting is done on a k8s cluster. A Helm chart specifies a single deployment with no service, and mounting a file share inside the container to store and retrieve the settings. Here is the extent of the infrastructure:</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	  A[Pod] --&gt; C[File share]
</code></pre>



<p>To run Screenr, you need a computer that can run node ; ideally a server that you don’t turn off.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source is on <a href="https://github.com/cfe84/screenr">GitHub</a> and the Readme explains how to configure it. Clone the repo locally, then run <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm run build</code>. To start it, go with <code>npm run start</code>.</li>
  <li>Compiled version is on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/screenr">npm</a>.</li>
  <li>Docker image is on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/cfe84/screenr">DockerHub</a> (or <code>docker pull cfe84/screenr</code>). Kubernetes Helm Chart are available in the git repo.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are some optimizations that could be done. For starters, this could use IMAP notifications to actually listen for new mail, rather than reconnecting and checking every 20s. I went for the straight forward thing right now, not sure if it’ll be a problem. Also this could be extended to support more rules, but it might require some more UI work which I don’t want to do, so that’s it for now.</p>

  <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Estimating how much you are spending (or wasting) on a particular Kubernetes workload is hard. The good news is that there are some reasonable strategies for estimating how much a given workload costs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In this post, we’ll discuss five major problems that affect cost estimation, and touch upon the strategies we use to overcome these problems in the <a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/insights">Fairwinds Insights</a> cost dashboard. We’ll present a more in-depth review of right sizing in a forthcoming blog.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #1: Bin Packing</strong></h2>
<p>Say we have a Node, which costs us $20/month. Say it has 5GB of memory and 5 CPUs we can put to use. (Note: this isn’t a very realistic node, but it makes the diagrams and math come out nice 🙂)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies.png" alt="Image of squares 2x5 of CPU and Memory"></p>
<p>And here’s a workload, which needs 2 GB of memory, and 2 CPUs in order to run:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-1.png" alt="Image of squares 2x2 of CPU and Memory"></p>

<p>We can fit up to two Pods worth of this workload in a single node:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-3.png" alt="Image of squares 2x5 of CPU and Memory with 2 squares not used"></p>

<p>But if we want to add a third Pod for the workload, there’s not enough space left. So we’ll need to add (and pay for) a new node:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-2.png" alt="Image of squares two 2x5 of CPU and Memory. In the first 2 squares are empty. In the second 6 squares are empty."></p>

<p>Note that there’s a little bit of wasted space on our first node - we’ve got 1GB of memory and 1CPU just sitting there. And our second node is very underutilized - less than half its resources are getting put to use.</p>
<p><strong>This is the first and primary problem of cost estimation</strong>: Kubernetes can’t split up one pod across multiple nodes. So if a whole number of pods don’t fit inside a single node, you’re going to have a certain amount of capacity that’s going to waste.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>One solution here is to “right-size” the nodes. If we used a node with 4GB of memory and 4CPUs, our workload would fit perfectly, and there’d be no capacity going to waste:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-40-46-PM.png" alt="CPU and Memory 2x4 squares completely filled"></p>

<h2><strong>Problem #2: Resource Asymmetry</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s consider a different kind of workload: one that’s very CPU-intensive. It needs 3 CPUs to run, but only 1GB of memory.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-46-96-PM.png" alt="Image of squares. Column 1 is x3 squares, column 2 is 1 square"></p>

<p>Now we can only fit 1 Pod worth of this workload into a single Node (using our 4CPU/4GB example):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-4.png" alt="2 columns of 4 by 2 rows. CPU has three squares filled, 1 memory square filled"></p>

<p>There’s a ton of unused capacity going to waste here - not only 1 CPU, but also 3 GB of memory. We’re only using half the Node, but if we want to spin up a second Pod, we’ll need a second Node, with the same amount of waste!</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Again, we’ll want to right-size our nodes - cloud providers offer CPU-intensive and Memory-intensive nodes to handle exactly this problem.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #3: Cost Attribution</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s say our smaller Node (4 CPUs and 4 GB) costs $16/mo. Using those numbers, we can come up with a rough estimate for how much each CPU and each GB of memory costs us. Say, of that $16, $8 goes to CPU, and $8 goes to memory. We can then infer that we’re paying $2 per CPU, and $2 per GB of memory.</p>
<p>So how much does our original workload cost us per pod?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-40-52-PM.png" alt="2x2 square with 4 boxes"></p>

<p>Based on our math above, we’d say <code>$2/CPU * 2CPUs + $2/GB * 2GBs = $8.</code> Which makes sense - we can fit exactly two of these workloads on a $16 node. For reasons we’ll cover below, we call this <strong>the optimistic method</strong> of cost estimation.</p>
<p>But what about our second workload, the CPU-intensive one?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-46-96-PM.png" alt="Image of squares. Column 1 is x3 squares, column 2 is 1 square"></p>

<p>Let’s do the same math: <code>$2/CPU * 3CPUs + $2/GB * 1GB = $8.</code> So the <strong>optimistic method</strong> says this workload costs us $8. But as we saw above, we can only fit one of them per Node. So in reality, it’s costing us $16/mo, and the optimistic method doesn’t seem so accurate.</p>
<p>Is there another method of cost estimation that might give us a more reasonable answer? There is!</p>
<p>Instead of adding the CPU cost and the memory cost together, we can take the <em>maximum</em> of the two. This helps us account for memory-intensive or CPU-intensive workloads, that might cause extra capacity to go to waste. (Note that we’ll also need to multiply the result by 2, so we count the missing resource as well.)</p>
<p>So the math becomes <code>MAX($2/CPU * 3CPUs, $2/GB * 1GB) * 2 = $12.</code> This is a good deal closer to the $16 target. The remainder is attributable to the fully unused node capacity (i.e. the 1 CPU that is still going to waste, despite the fact that the Node carries a CPU-intensive workload).</p>
<p>We call this <strong>the conservative method</strong> of estimation. It prepares for a worst-case scenario in terms of Kubernetes’ ability to bin-pack workloads onto your Nodes.</p>
<p>For many workloads, the conservative method and the optimistic method will give similar estimates, but they diverge for CPU- or memory-intensive workloads. The basic difference is that the optimistic method assumes optimal bin-packing, while the conservative method assumes there will be some waste. Say, for instance, that we were also running a memory-intensive workload, one that needs only 1 CPU, but 3 GB of memory:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-46-90-PM.png" alt="1 square in column 1, 3 squares in column 2"></p>

<p>Kubernetes is smart enough to pack this together with our CPU-intensive workload, saving us the unused capacity:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.fairwinds.com/hubfs/Blog-Problems%20with%20Kubernetes%20Cost%20Estimation%20Strategies-Jul-09-2020-02-08-40-35-PM.png" alt="CPU intensive workloads combined so 2x4 squares are all used"></p>

<p>The <strong>conservative method</strong> would say that each of these workloads costs $12, for a total cost of $24. But Kubernetes has found a way to pack them into a $16 Node! We’ve overshot. That’s why it’s called <strong>conservative</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>optimistic method</strong> accounts for the clever bin packing, and would say that each of these workloads costs $8, for a total cost of $16, which is a perfect estimate, given that they fit exactly onto one $16 node.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>So which one should you use? The answer is that it depends. If you’ve spent time optimizing your instance types, or if your nodes are much larger than your average workload, there’s a good chance that Kubernetes can find a way to pack workloads together in a cost-efficient way, and you can safely choose the <strong>optimistic</strong> method. Otherwise, we recommend the <strong>conservative</strong> method.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #4: Resource Ranges</strong></h2>
<p>Another issue at hand is the fact that a Kubernetes workload doesn’t just use a fixed amount of CPU and memory. Resource usage can vary from second to second, and Pods may get killed or moved between nodes in response to these fluctuations.</p>
<p>To help with this issue, Kubernetes configuration gives engineers two fields for managing resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>requests</code> set the minimum resource usage of the workload. When a workload gets scheduled on a Node, you can be sure that <em>at least this much</em> is available</li>
<li><code>limits</code> set the maximum resource usage of the workload. When a Pod for the workload tries to use more than this amount, the Pod <em>will get killed</em> and a new one will start.</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual resource usage of a given workload will be somewhere between these two numbers, and will fluctuate heavily from second to second (just look at the Activity Monitor on your macbook to see how much this can vary!).</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong>One way of estimating bottom-line workload cost is to look at that fluctuating number, and take an average over time. Another way of estimating workload cost is to look at <code>requests</code> and <code>limits</code> in order to provide a range of possibilities, or to take an average of the two.</p>
<p>Since Fairwinds Insights is primarily concerned with <a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/insights">configuration validation</a><strong>,</strong> we opt for the second strategy - we want to tell you, <em>given your current configuration</em>, how much you can expect this workload to cost.</p>
<h2><strong>Problem #5: Noisy Neighbors</strong></h2>
<p>Kubernetes can only do its best with the information it's given. This is why it’s so important to specify <code>requests</code> and <code>limits</code> for every single one of your workloads.</p>
<p>For example, if one of your workloads duly requests 1GB of memory, but another workload on the same node hasn’t set <code>requests</code> or <code>limits,</code> the second workload could easily begin to gobble up all the resources available on that Node. This could prevent our original workload from getting all the memory it needs, hurting its performance.</p>
<p>Because it can be tricky to dial these settings in, some teams never set requests or limits at all, while others set them too high during initial testing and then never course correct. To appropriately estimate cost, we need to set the right limits and requests. Fairwinds Insights uses <a href="https://github.com/FairwindsOps/goldilocks/">Goldilocks</a>, a free open source tool, to analyze actual resource usage and recommend settings for <code>requests</code> and <code>limits</code> that are “just right”.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Understanding the financial costs of each of your organization’s applications impact is important, but when they’re all running together in Kubernetes, it can be quite difficult. Fortunately, there are some reasonable ways to solve each of the problems with Kubernetes cost estimation.</p>
<p>By using a combination of right-sizing (more to come on that), adopting the right methods (e.g. conservative vs. optimistic), and employing configuration validation tools like Fairwinds Insights and Goldilocks, you can ensure your Kubernetes deployments run efficiently.</p>

<h2><strong>Highlights from my conversation with Rebecca Sadwick</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Go-to-market strategy basically revolves around getting “people who can benefit from the product to know about it and want to buy it.”</li><li>Long-term momentum should be one of the first and most important considerations of a startup.</li><li>Positioning should be the core of your marketing strategy.</li><li>When creating a product, always remember that when something needs explanation, you’ve already lost.</li><li>Let the market dictate how they like to buy.</li><li>Partnerships are not a substitute for other direct strategies.</li><li>Quantitative data can drive worse decisions than a lack of data altogether.</li></ul>

<p>The Roman roads diagram project is a series of maps driven by an unconventional idea: what if we represented Ancient Rome’s famed road network in the style of a modern transit map?</p>
<p>So far I’ve made five diagrams (below). Click for more information.</p>
<p>You can see how my style has evolved since I made the first map back in 2017. My ultimate goal is to make a book out of these. I’ll probably have to redesign a few of them.

Don't believe me? Why not quickly <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/postgres/postgres-intro">spin up a database</a> and see it for yourself with this query:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> pg_database</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In this post, we'll explore these template databases and see how we can make full use of their potential. We'll even look into creating a template database of our own.</p><h2>template1</h2><p>By default, running:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>simply copies everything from the database <code>template1</code>. We can modify this template database in any way: add a table, insert some data, create new extensions, or install procedural languages. Any of these actions would be propagated to subsequently created databases.</p><p>This, however, is <strong>not</strong> advisable. Removing any one of these modifications would need you to manually uninstall or drop these changes from <code>template1</code>. You do have the option to drop and recreate the entire <code>template1</code> database altogether. This unfortunately comes at the risk of committing a mistake along the way, effectively breaking <code>CREATE DATABASE</code>. It would be better to leave <code>template1</code> alone and create a template database of your own.</p><h2>Custom Template Databases</h2><p>To set an existing database as a template database:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>ALTER</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> template_db_name </span><span>WITH</span><span> is_template </span><span>TRUE</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Doing this allows any user or role with the <code>CREATEDB</code> privilege to utilize it as a template. If not, only superusers or owners of the database would be allowed to do so.</p><p>To create a new database with this template:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name TEMPLATE template_db_name</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>Advantages</h3><ul><li>With this, you can now have customized templates without the need to worry about polluting <code>template1</code>.</li><li>You can safely drop the entire custom template database without the risk of breaking <code>CREATE DATABASE</code>.</li><li>If you wish, you can create multiple template databases for various use cases.</li></ul><h3>Limitations</h3><ul><li>To properly create a database from a custom template database, there should be no other connections present. <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> immediately fails if any connections exist at the start of the query.</li><li>As such, if you are looking to replicate a database while maintaining your connections (eg. a production database), it would be more ideal to use the Postgres utility <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-pgdump.html">pg_dump</a>.</li></ul><h2>template0</h2><p><code>template0</code> contains the same data as <code>template1</code>. We could think of this template database as a fallback if anything irreversible happens to <code>template1</code>. As such, this template database should never be modified in any way as soon as the database cluster has been initialized. To create a database with <code>template0</code> as the template database:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name TEMPLATE template0</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>Applications</h3><ul><li>If anything goes wrong with <code>template1</code>, It can be dropped and recreated with <code>template0</code> as the template database.</li><li>We can also create a clean database that does not contain any modifications present in <code>template1</code>. This would be useful when restoring from pg_dump. Any conflicts brought about by modifications not present in the dump are eliminated.</li><li><code>template0</code> can be used to specify new encodings. As pointed out in this <a href="https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/exploring-the-default-postgres-template-databases#:~:text=we%20can't%20edit%20the%20locale%20or%20encoding%20of%20a%20database%20copied%20from%20template1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>, creating a new database with <code>template1</code> and new encodings would result in an error.</li></ul><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span></span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name TEMPLATE template0 ENCODING </span><span>'SQL_ASCII'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name ENCODING </span><span>'SQL_ASCII'</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To quickly sum things up, we found out that new databases are, by default, created from a template database called <code>template1</code>. <code>template1</code> can be modified in any way we please and the changes would be present in any database created afterward. We can also create custom template databases and base new databases from them instead. If things go awry, <code>template0</code> is always there to help.</p></section><section><a href="http://eepurl.com/gPWkwn">SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER</a></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p id="7416">When I first started building Percy over five years ago, I honestly had no idea where it would go. What I was sure about, though, was that it was a problem I was genuinely interested in solving, and I just wanted to build it.</p><p id="f0da">Fast forward to today, and we have both a product and a team that I am super proud of, passionate users and customers who love Percy, and most importantly, we have successfully made the previously-obscure phrase “visual testing” commonplace in the tech industry and across developer communities. Achieving this was no small feat, and I’m thrilled that Percy has played a pivotal role in making that happen.</p><h2 id="7f25">What’s next</h2><p id="b175">I am excited about all the opportunities that this acquisition will unlock. BrowserStack has spent over nine years building a platform that enables millions of developers and QA engineers worldwide to test across thousands of browsers and devices at scale. Similarly, Percy has spent the last five years focusing on a new category of testing — one that sits at the intersection of design, development, and deployment, with a significant overlap with browser automation and developer workflows.</p><p id="a79a">Though our paths have been adjacent until now, our capabilities fit perfectly together to create a comprehensive testing experience for users.</p><p id="fe68">Percy has invested heavily in the intricacies of visual testing and embedded deeply and easily in the workflows of thousands of developers. Being part of the BrowserStack platform will open many doors for expanding visual testing to a much wider range of testing environments.</p><p id="87c8">On the personal front, I will continue to lead Percy as Director of Product for Visual Testing. I’m very excited about this role and the changes it brings.</p><p id="eff3">It seems like every founder’s acquisition post ends up with this statement at some point, so I’ll get it out of the way — it’s <em>hard </em>to build and run a startup! Though my focus was always the product and team, as co-founder a lot of my time and energy were also spent managing day-to-day business activities. With this acquisition I am happy to be able to get back to my roots in product and engineering.</p><h2 id="f495">Thank you</h2><p id="0d41">I get to be the public face of this change, but we would never have gotten this far or created this powerful new product without the tireless work of the entire Percy team. I want to thank you for all the hard work, passion, and the empathy that you bring to work each day. A special thanks for riding the many rollercoasters of change during the shared tough times that the world is going through right now. I’m thankful to be able to work with each one of you.</p><p id="ba6b">And finally, a big thanks to all our users and customers for your continued support and belief in us. You give us the energy behind everything we do and we will be looking forward to your feedback on how to continue to make Percy better and better.</p><p id="9a2e">You can read more about the acquisition on the <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/blog/browserstack-has-acquired-percy?utm_source=announcement_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=percy_acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrowserStack blog</a>.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<h3><strong>Rule 4.1 of the developer constitution</strong></h3>



<p>It’s the law. Software engineers have to hate meetings. If you’re caught enjoying yourself in a meeting you can get your dev card pulled. So be careful out there. And stay classy, San Diego.</p>







<div><figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ron.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>







<h2><strong>We’re bad at articulating the negative effects of meetings</strong></h2>



<p>I knew right away as a junior developer out of college I was in too many meetings. Even though I had nothing to compare it to. As I took on more visible projects, the number of meetings went up. I felt the pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three years into my career, I got <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promoted from dev to team lead</a> and bam… not only was I in more meetings than ever but my team was also constantly complaining to me they were in too many meetings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I remember being in product strategy meetings for hours. HOURS.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan_2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan_2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan_2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan_2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dan_2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<figure><blockquote><p>Join our mission to end useless status meetings.</p><p><a href="https://linearb.io/status-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here for early access</a> to the dev team dashboard of the future.</p><p>Real-time progress on your features and bugs powered by Git data.</p></blockquote></figure>



<div><p>After I got comfortable with our product leaders and executive team, I would spin my chair around in circles as a (passive aggressive) way of letting them know I was ready to go.</p><p>Looking back on it, I wasn’t addressing the bigger issue. Another long meeting was right around the corner. And I wasn’t doing anything to help other developers in our org avoid meetings that were too long or had no value.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>In general, I was good at <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/being-vp-of-software-development-is-harder-than-being-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">translating between engineers and executives</a>. But for some reason, when it came to meetings, I failed to find the words.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>“Too many meetings” is not a complaint, it’s a cry for help</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://linearb.io/blog/stand-up-2-0-ten-community-insights-from-100-responses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve been asking developers why they don’t like meetings</a> and what specifically they don’t like about them. The more I parse what I’m hearing and compare it to my own experience, the more I think “too many meetings” is a symptom of a bigger issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most developers don’t arbitrarily dislike all meetings. When we say we don’t like meetings what we really mean is:</p>



<ul><li>“I dislike inefficiency”</li><li>“I dislike poorly planned meetings”</li><li>“I dislike poorly executed meetings”</li><li>“I dislike not living up to my promises”</li><li>“I dislike missing our team iteration deadline”</li><li>“I dislike not getting enough time to do my job”</li></ul>







<p>Developers are the most important asset innovative companies have. Instead of dismissing this feedback as “engineers just don’t like meetings”, we need to listen to them.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Maker’s Schedule versus Manager’s Schedule</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul4.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>When it comes to meetings, there is an inherent tension between developers and bosses. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Graham</a> (pictured above), known for his work on LISP and for co-founding Y Combinator, explains the disconnect in his 2009 essay <strong><em>Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a summary:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Bosses (Managers) get stuff done through meetings – changing tasks every 60 minutes.<br></li><li>Developers (Makers) and other creators need 3-4 hour blocks of time to get work done.<br></li><li>Each way of working is perfectly fine by itself but problems arise when the two collide.<br></li><li>For a Maker, a single meeting at the wrong time can disrupt their entire day of work.<br></li><li>Powerful people on a Manager Schedule force Makers to “resonate at their frequency.”&nbsp;</li></ul>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/paul3.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>We’ve all been there. Your VP needs an update on feature XYZ. They “have a call with customer ABC tomorrow” or they’re “presenting to the exec team this afternoon” so they summon you and the team. You share your status update. Or, worse, someone else talks and you just sit there. (Why did I need to be here??) Your boss asks a few questions. You leave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s not just your VP. Your team lead, your product owner, your project manager, your UX designer… they all want your time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s just not just meetings. The support person, the salesperson… they all have a “quick question” and it’s always “kind of urgent”. At least now they can’t walk by your desk when you don’t answer on Slack after 57 seconds. But you want to be helpful so it’s still a distraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your boss goes on to their next meeting. The sales rep goes to their next call. For you, it’s not that easy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You have to start your process all over. “Getting in the zone” takes time. And if you have another meeting in an hour you might not want to start something big or important. So you get up to date in Slack. Maybe pick up a friend’s PR and add some comments. Next thing you know the day is over and you didn’t get enough quality time into your big, important task.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Two failed attempts&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>When I was Director of Engineering (and later VP), I considered myself a “cool” leader. Not one of those out of touch suits. Not some MBA that talked about innovation but didn’t actually know how to code. (Python dice rolling simulator doesn’t count, Conner!) I was an executive but I still understood what it was like to be a developer. After all, I had just been a developer. I got promoted from dev to team lead to Director in a two-year span. I was not out of touch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet I was the cause of many meetings and interruptions. What was my alternative? I needed updates so I could <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/vp-engineering-vp-product-how-to-keep-a-united-front/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communicate with our VP of Product</a> and our CEO. Jira was never up to date. Slack worked sometimes but not always in the timeframe I needed.</p>







<p><strong>PRO TIP FOR MANAGERS:</strong> Beware of how you feel when you leave a meeting with your team. The meeting was for you and you got work done so you’re probably feeling great. Your team probably did not get work done and might not be feeling as great. Don’t allow your feelings to cause your mind to overvalue the meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, I heard enough complaints and tried to do something about it.&nbsp;</p>







<h4><strong>Failed idea #1: No meeting Wednesday</strong></h4>



<p>We looked for a day each week where devs could work uninterrupted. After much negotiation, we picked Wednesday. We would meet up for the daily then no more meetings all day. None. No exceptions. I convinced the CEO and the whole company. Everyone agreed! It lasted about three weeks. By week four the “urgent priority” meeting requests started rolling in again. And by week five my own team had lost their resolve and we were right back to meetings on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>







<h4><strong>Failed idea #2: Brazilian BBQ meat coaster&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>At <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/brazilian-barbecue-history-335804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brazilian BBQ </a>restaurants “Gauchos” bring skewers of meat to your table. If you want some, they cut a few pieces on to your plate. If you don’t want any of that particular meat, no worries. A few minutes later another pair of chaps will be by with a new kind of meat. (It’s amazing.)</p>



<p>How does the gaucho know if you want more meat? Your table has a little cube or coaster on it. Green side up means more meat! Red side up means I have the meat sweats and I’m taking a break. See where I’m going with this?</p>



<p>I gave everyone on our team a little coaster. Green side up meant I’m available to chat. Red side up meant please don’t interrupt. I sent an email to the whole company.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zone.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>What’s worse: meat sweats or meeting sweats?</figcaption></figure>







<p>It lasted a brief time. But eventually, the shoulder tap interruptions resumed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why did these attempts fail? I didn’t explain the problem well enough. The “rules” we implemented seemed arbitrary to everyone else. We had a great relationship with our ecosystem so they bought in initially because they wanted to be helpful. But, in order for change to take hold, people need to understand the “why”. And the “why” in this case has to be more than just devs don’t like meetings and interruptions.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>5 steps for reducing meetings and increasing focus time blocks&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Dev team leads, scrum masters, product leaders, and business leaders can use these ideas to maximize the most valuable “resource” in your company – your developers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developers can use it too. If you’re like me – complaining about meetings but not explaining your “why” very well – this framework will help you articulate yourself better.</p>







<h3><strong>Step 1: Take a meeting inventory and establish a baseline</strong></h3>



<p>Are we really in too many meetings? As we start educating our company about “why” meetings and interruptions are bad for developers, let’s also make sure our premise is correct.</p>



<p>To start, let’s look at the recurring meetings we’re in:</p>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chart-New-alignment.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Most reasonable developers are not proposing to get rid of these so this becomes your baseline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Add up the total number of hours and divide by the total number of hours in your typical iteration. At LinearB, these baseline meetings take up 10% of our typical two-week iteration. Not bad, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now look at your random meetings: update with your product owner for feature XYZ, check-in with the support department, technical design, UX design, emergency production issue, etc. These take up a lot more time if we aren’t careful. So, examine their value closely.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Step 2: Assess the value of your meetings</strong></h3>



<p>Are all of our recurring and random meetings providing value to attendees? It depends on who you ask. They’re definitely valuable for the person scheduling them like the Director, team lead or product owner. But are they valuable for developers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The daily stand-up is our most important, most frequent meeting. And yet many developers don’t think they get value from it.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinearB</a>, we refactored our meetings and created two core tenets:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Everyone in the room must get value – especially developers.&nbsp;</li><li>No status update meetings are allowed.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>For engineering leaders, if you listen to your team, you’ll quickly learn which meetings are not delivering value. But just canceling those meetings may be complicated. Other stakeholders may find them valuable. So, instead of canceling, ask yourself “how can I refactor this meeting to make it more useful to my team?”&nbsp;</p>







<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marketing teams should scale alongside new business revenue. As the company generates new business, the marketing budget gets bigger and the team scales accordingly.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Companies often think about go-to-market (GTM) spend in terms of payback periods - if we put a dollar into the business today, how long will it take to get that dollar back in terms of revenue. For example, if we spent $15m on GTM in 2019 and generated $15m new business ARR in 2019 that would be a 12 month payback period. A 12 month payback is considered great for most SaaS businesses.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When you combine the idea of payback periods along with industry benchmarks for marketing spend you start to get a picture of what marketing budgets look like as you scale. According to <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd3fa7481aab/5f0721b9c8fbf34510ac1da7_image%20(73).png" target="_blank">Keybanc</a>, SaaS companies spend between 15% and 50% of their go-to-market budget on marketing. </p><p>When you map out this percentage spend against payback periods, you start to get a sense of what your marketing budget at different revenue targets should look like.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-5ab1cbc8e47a-32481ab0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd7015481ab4/5f06ab4c328260ba3799a145_marketngteam2.001.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><div><p>The mix is largely determined by the sales motion. Generally, Self-serve SMB businesses require more marketing spend whereas enterprise sales heavy businesses require less marketing.&nbsp;</p></div><p>From here you can start to get a sense of what you can afford and how big your marketing team could be at each point in scale. Generally, marketing teams (full-time-employees) account for 35-40% of your marketing budget.&nbsp;<br></p><div><p>Another helpful datapoint comes from <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd3fa7481aab/5f065bbf2b3d6331272bc36f_Insight_s_SaaS_Marketing_Spend_Benchmarks_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Insight Partners</a>, where they provide benchmarks for new logo bookings per marketing employee (FTE).&nbsp;</p></div><figure id="w-node-41bc96697126-32481ab0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd7015481ab4/5efbd440b708739085e5a3a8_qRW2yCCH9-9IoVtU_Y-tknGhkcROR8xbPL1pOipXzzoNWAsGs6gNpv4ESyzI4tmnSpsPOs-QmT6yTV9i_m7UjJ66d4d7wHRzTCwu6GzT_e-U3IC3iT33pJVrd_J5fNgBMMGu5ApO.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As companies target bigger customers, individual marketers are able to support more revenue scaling from $498k/FTE to $1,238k/FTE. Bigger ACV companies typically have smaller marketing teams as the go-to-market strategy is more outbound sales led, rather than through digital growth marketing tactics.&nbsp;</p><p>By taking these benchmarks and extrapolating them against new business targets, you start to get a clear picture of what your marketing team should look like over time.&nbsp;<br>‍</p><figure id="w-node-b9a4ea7d9877-32481ab0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd7015481ab4/5f06ab6f3dc1fef5342db03a_marketngteam2.002.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>So for example, if I want to generate $9m in new business this year, and most of my customers pay me $50k each, then i’ll want to have a marketing team of around 11 people, but if i mainly focus on SMB customer then i’ll likely need a team of 18 people.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Of course, benchmarks and extrapolations only tell part of the story. Some companies index higher on programs vs. people. The exact mix depends on what you’ve found to work for your business in the past and what you want to experiment with in the future. Additionally,&nbsp; your capital position will naturally change your level of investment.</p><p>From personal experience, I found the above benchmarks to be a bit inflated to how we’ve built the team at Lattice.&nbsp; Historically, we’ve tended to operate a lean team of generalists, hire more contractors and indexed towards more program spend. But as we’ve added more specialization on the team, the numbers start to even out towards the above benchmarks.&nbsp;<br>‍</p><p>Regardless, understanding the relationship between new business targets, size of customer contracts, and go-to-market motion will help you to determine the size of your marketing team as the business grows.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of recent design changes, GitHub has introduced READMEs for profiles. By <a href="https://dev.to/web/design-github-profile-using-readme-md-8al">creating a repo</a> with your name and adding <code>README.md</code> file with markdown to it, you can now add a rich description of yourself.</p><p>Here is an example of how it looks like:</p><p><img alt="Python reference count graph" src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/github_profile.jpg" width="650"></p><p>This feature may not be available to your profile yet. GitHub uses selectively rolling.</p><p>Unlike the old plain-text bio field, the new feature supports external links and images. This is where it gets interesting.</p><h2>Tracking profile views</h2><p>Since Github's markdown can display images from external sources, you can now track and display views of your profile.</p><p>To do so, you need to host an image on your server and display it via Markdown syntax:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>image</span> <span>title</span><span>](</span><span>https</span><span>:</span><span>//rushter.com/counter.svg)</span>
</pre></div><p>On the server-side, each image request can be treated as a view of your profile. The rest of the story is simple — you need to store a counter in the database and return an SVG image with the number of views as a response. Of course, there will be some extra requests from bots, but having such statistics is better than nothing.</p><p>To prevent IP and User Agent leaking, GitHub caches all images via special proxy. To avoid being cached on Github servers after the first image request, your image must specify cache headers or return non-200 response (e.g., an HTTP 404 page).</p><p>Here is the HTTP header that disables caching:</p><div><pre><span></span>Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
</pre></div><p>This is not something new for repositories since they had this ability for a long time, and GitHub allows this kind of use of images for <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/repo-badges#github-repo-hit-counter-">interactive badges</a>. Unlike profiles, repositories have access to traffic statistics too.</p><p>Here is how it can <a href="https://github.com/rushter">look like</a> when you have access to the new feature:</p><p><img alt="Python reference count graph" src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/github_counter.png" width="700"></p><p><br> There are libraries and services that can do <a href="https://github.com/brentvollebregt/hit-counter">this for you</a>. You can also use <a href="https://pipedream.com/@tod/github-profile-view-counter-p_G6CNmN/readme">Pipedream</a> if you want to have more control over the counter logic.</p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p>For a lot of people, allowing external images on their websites sounds like not a big deal. I've been using this technique to track profiles views on various platforms for more than 10 years. I've seen how recruiters constantly refresh my profiles when they need to make a decision :).</p><p>Unlike GitHub, most of them don't even bother proxying the image to hide IP, referrer, and browser agent. If you want to allow external images on your site, you <strong>must</strong> proxy them and hide everything about a person who requested it.</p><p>A person with bad intentions can trick a victim into opening your profile that looks completely legit and detect his IP and a browser. You can also set a cookie to track user visits on other websites, but browsers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox">will soon stop</a> doing it.</p><p>A single-pixel image can provide you a lot of information. This is how the whole AD industry works when it tracks your visits on various websites.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>According to my tests, profile views do not count as repo views, and I hope, in the future, we will be able to see traffic stats in the repository that hosts the README file.</p></div></div>]]>

                <div>
                    <p>All of a sudden, we’re all working from our living rooms and using remote tools and video calls to stay as connected as we can. The once-steady migration to working from home has suddenly leapt to 100% adoption. But in our collective loss of shared physical space, did we also lose all the things that come with it? Things that lead to freer, more organic conversation and <em>feeling</em> more together?</p><p>When we share a physical space, there's hundreds of tiny inter-personal interactions – opportunities for conversations to start – combined with a shared physical context. These give rise to something I call social serendipity: the chance for unstructured and unplanned conversations to take place. This is where people actually get to know each other, and where new ideas are born.</p><p>When designing the offices at Pixar, Steve Jobs asked that the only restrooms be placed in an atrium at the very centre of the office. Why? To quite intentionally force coworkers from across the organisation to bump into each other and mix together, striking up new conversations.</p><p>For social serendipity to really happen, you need a 'safe' environment for people to share thoughts with as little friction and consequence for a 'bad idea' as possible. When physically hanging out with friends, or sitting with coworkers that you have a good relationship with, this just happens naturally, but in a world where we all are physically distanced, something subtle is lost.</p><p><strong><br>There are two main things missing in today’s social apps which are there in a physical workplace: </strong></p><ol><li>A low-friction 'open channel' for conversation to flow (in an office, this is something like passively being near to others)</li><li>Conversation hooks – exposure to things to talk about (in an office, this can be observing something that someone is doing)<br></li></ol><h2 id="open-channels">Open channels</h2><p><br>When you use Slack, email, or WhatsApp, you are effectively posting a letter to somebody. It may be fast to deliver and small in size, but it’s still a letter. This type of communication is a little like playing ping pong in the dark: you know virtually nothing about the other player’s position or current state (with perhaps the only dim lightbulbs in the room being status notifications like ‘read’,'active’, or 'typing’). </p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png 1000w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/ping-pong-in-the-dark.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The ping pong in the dark of messaging</figcaption></figure><div><p>What about voice or video calls? Well, they are little more like fishing: you throw out a line and if there’s a bite, the line is connected. But this can also be quite disruptive… much like how you catch a fish and pull it out from its environment (the river), the recipient of a phone call is pulled out from whatever they were doing. </p><p>Regardless, both of these different types of communication are very intentional, and by that I mean that you need a reason to reach out and start. This 'needing a reason' forms a viscous barrier to free flowing communication. </p><p>In both cases, once a ‘session’ (what I’m calling a natural, active conversation between people) is created, people can talk fairly freely within it. </p></div><p><br>In <em>synchronous</em> communication (so a voice or video call), the session is formal – it has an official connect and disconnect, and everyone knows the status. Within that, people can speak freely – kind of similarly to an in-person conversation… within the bounds of the intent of the session of course, as it’s so disruptive to whatever else that everyone wants to do.</p><div><p>In <em>asynchronous</em> communication (back-and-forth messaging), the session is informal, noncommittal, and doesn’t have a clear beginning or end. There is also a kind of <em>semi-synchronous</em> version that can happen when multiple parties are replying rapidly, but it still doesn’t need any reason to come to an end because it’s non-committal. </p><p><strong>If we were to put these into spatial terms: </strong></p></div><p><br>A video or voice call is like entering a temporary room – you can see who else is there, and everyone else knows you are there. However, that room also demands that you can’t be elsewhere. Because of this, they are only created if they are needed for some purpose. </p><p>With messaging, it’s like each person is inside of their own private room, receiving and sending paper letters at their convenience, each with little knowledge of when the other person will receive it, or their context when they receive it. This also means a lot of messaging is done passively by the user during other activities – there is no demand for exclusivity and so speed is something of an unknown… if you want to get something done fast, messaging is probably not the way. </p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 1000w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 1600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/rooms-of-social-1.png 1631w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The passive nature of messaging means less demand on each party (they’re in their own space after all), but it's also less personal and involves some social friction between each batch of messages, a friction which increases directly if more time passes between batches. As that friction increases, the reason for reaching out needs to be greater and so it ends up pushing out silly, casual or free conversation for stronger reason-based messages.</p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/social-over-time.png" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/social-over-time.png 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/social-over-time.png 1000w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/social-over-time.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>As time passes between messages</figcaption></figure><p>However, neither of these reflect the casual nature of a conversation in an office, a coworking space, or even just hanging out. In those, people are present in a space together and are ‘open’ to conversation i.e. there is a continuous ‘session' going on, even if people don’t have to actively be engaged in it. (Note: Arguably, a more awkward version of this also happens on a conference call whilst waiting for others to join, but is short-lived and more incidental.)</p><p>This open space is fertile ground for social serendipity and natural conversation, but in remote communication, there’s still something missing: a 'conversational hook'</p><h2 id="conversational-hooks"> <br>Conversational hooks</h2><p>A conversational hook is something for another to grab onto and talk about – but when the only way of interacting with another is through very intentional methods, there’s little to no <em>discovery</em> of new hooks… unless actively volunteered by someone, or perhaps something stumbles into frame (e.g. someone’s dog making a surprise appearance during a video call). </p><figure><img src="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/sddefault-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/sddefault-1.jpg 600w, https://johnnymakes.co/content/images/2020/07/sddefault-1.jpg 640w"></figure><div><p><strong>What types of conversation hook are there? </strong></p><p><strong>Depth hooks </strong><br>The more you talk to someone, the more you know about them, and the more conversational hooks you have – simply put, you just know them better and so there’s more to talk about. </p><p><strong>Open channel hooks </strong><br>In a sufficiently low friction, high trust setting, people share voluntarily – they feel comfortable enough to offer these 'hooks' up. The best example of this is just hanging out together.</p><p><strong>Observed context hooks</strong> <br>If two people in a physical space bump into each other when they go to make coffee, that’s something to talk about. The same with the clothes, the weather (sorry, I’m a British cliche), the music they're playing. Our shared context powers conversation. When we aren’t able to see each other and share physical space, we have less shared context.</p></div><p>For consumers, Instagram Stories offers a neat solution by letting users offer up conversational hooks through low-stakes context sharing. Why 'low stakes'? Because stories are ephemeral, there is less pressure for the glossy presentation of a more permanent post so people can be more honest and less worried about their image. After all, the content won't last more than a day – a version of the 'open channel' we looked at earlier. This offers up a conversation starter that friends can latch onto, often spilling into a full chat.</p><p><strong>The role of proximity</strong></p><p>Real world conversation isn’t without a spatial dimension: we use proximity to control who is involved, and who is involved directly determines the type of conversation.</p><p>Conversations vary at different scales because every time we speak, we're adapting our thoughts for the audience. Whenever we speak, we’re thinking of these things:</p><ul><li>Who is the audience?</li><li>What will they think of this?</li><li>Have they understood what I’m saying?</li></ul><p>As the group gets bigger there are more people to please, and so more people to consider how they’ll receive what you’re saying. Scale directly affects how intimate a conversation is. As the number of people listening increases, a topic gets more and more diluted or the conversation becomes more and more generic.</p><p>Effectively, as the audience grows, the soapbox that a speaker at any moment is socially standing on, gets taller and the spotlight gets brighter.</p><p>This is the reason that we often take someone to one side to be able to have a more intimate conversation. Now, this is a solved problem in many social apps because they force users to rigidly define a boundary: WhatsApp groups, Slack channels etc. all have a fixed list of members OR they're totally open (like Twitter), and there's no concept of controlling the audience. </p><p>However, in a social app that offers an open space, setting rigid boundaries on a conversation isn't the natural solution – doing that would be much more equivalent to gathering people in a particular room, and so is more intent-driven. This is fine for a meeting, but the required intent also demands undivided attention during the gathering.</p><p><strong>The role of ephemerality</strong></p><p>In a normal conversation setting, things aren't quite so permanent – whatever is said is heard by the audience but not recorded forever on a server.</p><p>Just imagine two conversations in a real office: one that happens normally with someone you're sitting with, and one where there's also a camera there, recording everything. Simply making that one change to the scene, adding a sense of permanence, completely changes the dynamic. A place can be transformed from a cafe to a stage: more formal, intentional... and less natural.</p><p>Of course, there's benefits to this in the right situation (a paper trail can be useful), but to recreate the organic conversations and truly open environment that allows for social serendipity, communication needs to be able to be 'throw-away' and frivolous. </p><p>This is something that Snapchat nailed for consumer social – by making things impermanent, they are free to be more natural and real. </p>…</div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Every company in the world has to ask questions to its customers.</p>



<p>Combined to data, it’s the best way to really know how they feel, what made them customers, what you should improve in your products, how loyal they are, etc. Those questions (and their answers) became a way to track the performance of companies and to benchmark them to their competitors. Some companies even started to calculate a part of their CEO remuneration based on customers satisfaction. <a href="https://screeb.app/net-promoter-score-nps/net-promoter-score-understanding-and-measuring-your-nps-with-screeb/">Net Promoter Score</a>, <a href="https://screeb.app/customer-effort-score-ces/customer-effort-score-understanding-and-measuring-your-ces-with-screeb/">Customer Effort Score</a>, Customer Satisfaction, <a href="https://screeb.app/product-feedback/how-to-collect-product-feedback-from-your-users-with-screeb/">Product Feedback</a>, Product Market Fit, Market Study… you have tons of occasions to ask questions during your customers’ journey, and tons of good reasons to do it.</p>



<p>Obviously, if it’s that important for companies, other providers already try to solve that issue. The survey industry is a $45B market, when you include all the players operating along the complete funnel (market research firms, software providers like SurveyMonkey or <a href="https://screeb.app/screeb-vs-typeform/">Typeform</a>…). Some Customer Experience suites and some CRM also provides survey features, and that segment is an even bigger market, with a $54B cap.</p>



<p>But existing solutions have major flaws:</p>



<p>1️⃣ They crush your users’ experience, by interrupting them in your app or on your website, or by adding yet another email in their inbox.<br>93% of Internet users say that they feel more online interruptions than 2 or 3 years ago, and 82% of them already left a website or an app because of them.</p>



<p>So instead of helping you better understand your customers, surveys make them leave.</p>



<p>2️⃣ Because of that bad experience, only a small fraction of your customers answer. In average, online survey have a 12% conversion rate. It means that 88% of the people you ask questions to refuse to answer.<br>With that few answers, how can you be sure that the decisions you’ll make from the insights you’ll collect are the right ones?</p>



<p>Increasing the response rate must be a priority to improve your retention.</p>



<p>3️⃣ And if it’s such an effort to answer, those 12% of people answering are, most of the time, really happy or really angry customers. It means that you mostly collect extreme answers and that you miss the more-neutral-but-still-highly-important answers of your customers.<br>That bias is as bad as the low response rate one, because it means that the decisions you’ll take will be based on a non-representative panel of users.</p>



<p><strong>A bad UX, a low response rate and a bias in the answers : the survey experience is broken.</strong></p>

<h2>Social &amp; Messaging DNA</h2>



<p>At Screeb, we come from the social media and messaging industry. Michael, our CEO, worked at Facebook for 7 years. Simon, our Head of Products &amp; Marketing, cofounded Bringr – a leading social media management solution in France – that has been acquired by iAdvize, the European leader of conversational marketing. He worked here for 5 years, including 2 with Michael and Samuel, our CTO.</p>



<p>Social and Messaging is <strong>in our DNA</strong>.</p>



<p>It means that when we started to work on that topic, we brought a fresh eye and we decided to start from scratch, not looking at what the survey industry was doing, but taking our inspiration from Instagram, Messenger or Zenly.,</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://screeb.app/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/illustrations-2.png" alt="" width="526" height="373"></figure></div>



<p>The result? <strong>The beta we are announcing today!</strong> 🎉</p>



<p>We’ve developed a conversational survey designed to increase your retention rate. We worked a lot on how to integrate it as smoothly as possible in your visitors and users journey while increasing your response rate. Our experience and hundreds of hours of conversations with brands from all over the world were crucial to build Screeb. Still, we also wanted to invent a new format and so we decided not to adopt a traditional chatbot/chatbox format to prefer a “layer” one, more nicely integrated on our users’ interface.</p>



<p>So our beta starts today! That’s a invitation-only beta, meaning that you can register right now to be a part of it but we’ll progressively deliver invitations, to closely onboard our first users. We’ve opened a waiting list, and the more you’ll share Screeb to your friends and colleagues, the sooner you’ll get your invitation to our beta.</p>



<p>So, are you ready to increase your retention rate?<br>Are your ready to collect insights in the most efficient way ever?<br>Are you ready for Screeb?</p>



<p>We can’t wait to see how you’ll use it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>On March 30, 2020, the <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2020/march/dl-access-during-covid-19">ACM announced</a> that its digital library would be open access for three months. During that time, every conference paper, journal article and book chapter published by the ACM was free to the general public. They didn’t even require a login. The reason to open the digital library was a good one: most people who use it get access through where they work, either in industry or academia. Because of the global pandemic, most people who use it are now working at home, outside of the network which allows them access.</p>
<p>I hoped it would remain open. I shared URLs to papers on the Digital Library on forums, in emails and even in source repos knowing everyone could access the papers at the moment, and hoping that would continue. I even let myself think it was likely that those making the decisions at the ACM would see that this free access had become a public good. I was wrong. On schedule, the ACM Digital Library closed again on June 30, 2020.</p>
<p>It should have remained open. First, because the global pandemic is not over, and few people who read computer science research papers are back at work. Most people who work in the software industry are still at home, and there is still uncertainty about what will happen in American colleges and universities in the next school year.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the ACM Digital Library should have remained open because the most comprehensive repository of computer science research should be freely available to all.</p>

<p>The Association for Computing Machinery, or ACM, is a non-profit professional organization for the field of computing. Its stated mission is to support “<a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/about-the-acm-organization">educators, researchers and professionals</a>” who work in all forms of computing. In practice, I believe the members are primarily computer science educators and researchers and the efforts of the ACM reflect that.</p>
<p>One of the most important functions of the ACM are its conferences and journals. Researchers in academia and industry publish their work through peer-reviewed conference proceedings and journals. For any given field in computer science, there is usually an ACM conference or journal which is one of the top venues to publish in for that field.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/">Digital Library</a> is the online repository for all of this research. It has papers published this month all the way back to the beginning of the field of computing in the early 1950s. It is, as far as I know, the most comprehensive single source of computer science research in the world.</p>

<p>The ACM is not a for-profit publisher. They are, as said above, a non-profit professional organization. This fact distinguishes them from for-profit publishers like Elsevier. There is a long-standing effort by many in the scientific community to <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/">boycott Elsevier</a> and move to open access publications. This boycott has resulted in many organizations ending contracts including <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/sweden-cancels-agreement-with-elsevier-over-open-access-64405">Dutch</a>, <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/major-german-universities-cancel-elsevier-contracts-31208">German</a> and <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/sweden-cancels-agreement-with-elsevier-over-open-access-64405">Swedish</a> universities, the <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-terminates-subscriptions-worlds-largest-scientific-publisher-push-open-access-publicly">University of California</a> system and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/guided-by-open-access-principles-mit-ends-elsevier-negotiations-0611">MIT</a>.</p>
<p>For Elsevier, this fight for open access is existential. They exist to make a profit on scientific publishing. If Elsevier can’t charge for access to the papers it has published, it has no business model and it will cease to exist. The ACM exists to serve the field of computing and society itself. The purpose of the ACM is laid out clearly in <a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-constitution#article2">Article 2 of its constitution</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Association is an international scientific and educational organization dedicated to advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of information technology, serving both professional and public interests by fostering the open interchange of information and by promoting the highest professional and ethical standards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Opening the ACM Digital Library supports every part of that sentence.</p>
<p>My impression is that practitioners are underrepresented in the ACM. These are the professional software developers, product managers and system administrators who do the majority of the professional computing work in our industry. The ACM has on the order of <a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-history">100,000 members</a>, which is surely a small fraction of the total computing professionals in the world.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/8/177024-acm-and-the-professional-programmer/fulltext">then-president Vint Cerf asked</a> why so many professionals are not members, the closed Digital Library <a href="https://www.itworld.com/article/2697033/why-many-programmers-don-t-bother-joining-the-acm.html">was one of the top answers</a>. Professional organizations exist to serve the profession and the professionals in it—even non-members. The Digital Library should not be a membership perk. It should be the public resource that inspires professionals to become members.</p>

<p>The moment you write something, you own its copyright. In order for the ACM to publish a paper, we have to <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-and-license-forms">transfer copyright</a>. Per that agreement, authors retain the right to publish the paper on their home page (<a href="https://www.scott-a-s.com/publications">which I do</a>). The institutions the authors work at and the agencies that funded the work are also allowed to publish the paper.</p>
<p>Savvy readers without access to the Digital Library know this fact. Most recent papers can be found by simply Googling its title. Occasionally, finding a free copy of a recent paper requires tracking it down directly from authors’ homepages or institutional publication lists.</p>
<p>If most recent papers are available elsewhere, why all the fuss? There are four reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not&nbsp;<em>all</em> recent papers are posted by their authors or institutions. Authors don’t always update their home pages and institutions don’t always post papers. Some authors don’t even have a home page.</li>
<li>Older papers, from before authors routinely had a home page, are not freely available anywhere.</li>
<li>The Digital Library URL for a paper should be the canonical online home for that paper. If the author does not have a home page or the institution they work for ceases to exist, that URL will always be valid. But people are less likely to share that URL if not everyone can access it. Rather, they will point to the versions scattered throughout the internet.</li>
<li>The Digital Library itself is valuable: it is a well-designed network of papers, authors, conferences and journals. If you find an interesting paper, you can then easily look at the other papers published in the same conference. Or other papers published by the same author.</li>
</ol>

<p>Rationally, three months of open access is better than zero, so the current situation is better than before. Yet, instead of giving the ACM credit for those three months, I’m asking for more. I acknowledge that is unfair. I also acknowledge that the ACM has <a href="https://libraries.acm.org/subscriptions-access/acmopen">stated that their eventual goal</a> is general open access. They have several efforts towards this goal: ACM conferences can choose to <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/permanent-access">grant open access</a> to their latest proceedings; authors can <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#hybrid">pay a fixed fee</a> for their paper to be open; and they established entire journals where all articles <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#gold">must pay the fixed fee</a> to be open.</p>
<p>This is progress, and we must grant credit for incremental improvements. But I fear the ACM is still being too conservative: these efforts are ad-hoc, do not apply to historical papers and do not seem to make open access the primary goal.</p>
<p>I freely admit that I do not know what a sustainable model would look like. But I do know it is possible. While they are smaller in scope, there are major computer science conferences and journals that are completely open access, such as <a href="https://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a> and <a href="https://vldb.org/">VLDB</a>.</p>
<p>I am a member of the ACM, and I intend to be a member for the rest of my life. I criticize it not because it is bad, but because I believe it is good. I just want it to be better.</p>

        <p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/python-for-else-statement.jpg?w=640" alt="python for else statement" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>



<p>One of the first things you usually learn when starting a new language is the if-else construct of that language.  <a href="http://theautomatic.net/category/python/">Python</a>, like some other languages, offers an extended variation of this called the “for/else” statement.  Let’s check out a couple examples to see how it works!</p>
<h2><strong>The for/else statement</strong></h2>
<p>The main use case for the for/else statement is when you need to loop through a list with the potential to break out of the loop.  If a break occurs in the loop, the code within the <strong>else</strong> clause will <em>not</em> be executed.  However, if a break does <em>not</em> occur, then the code within the <strong>else</strong> clause <em>will</em> be executed.</p>
<p>For example, in the code below we initialize test = False.  Then we loop through each element in the list, <em>nums</em>.  If an element in <em>nums</em> equals 20, we break out of the loop.  Since no element equals 20,  we never break out of the loop, and therefore, the <strong>else</strong> clause is executed, which changes the value of test to equal True.</p>
<pre title="">

nums = [10, 4, 6, 8, 2]
test = False
for num in nums:
    if num == 20:
        break
else:
    test = True


</pre>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/theautomatic.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/python-search-list.png?w=640" alt="python search list for else statement" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In general, rather than just flagging a variable as True / False, you might want to perform some additional actions based off whether the break occurred.</p>
<pre title="">
nums = [10, 4, 6, 8, 2]
test = False
for num in nums:
    if num == 20:
        # do something here if 20 is found...
        break
else:
    test = True
    # do additional code here in case 20 is never found...

</pre>
<h2><strong>while/else statements</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to for/else statements, <a href="http://theautomatic.net/category/python/">Python</a> also supports while/else statements.  We can modify our code above to use a while/else statement like this:</p>
<pre title="">
nums = [10, 4, 6, 8, 2]
test = False
i = 0
while i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] == 20:
        break
    i += 1
else:
    test = True

</pre>

<![CDATA[The Magical Methods in C#]]>

<p>There’s a certain set of special method signatures in C# which have particular support on the language level.
Methods with those signatures allow for using a special syntax which has several benefits. For example, we can use them to simplify our code or create <code>DSL</code> to express a solution to our domain-specific problem in a much cleaner way. I came across those methods in different places, so I decided to create a blog post to summarize all my discoveries on this subject.</p>

<h2 id="collection-initialization-syntax">Collection initialization syntax<a href="#collection-initialization-syntax" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers#collection-initializers">Collection initializer</a> is a quite old feature, as it exists in the language since version 3 (released in late 2007). Just as a reminder, <code>Collection initializer</code> allows for pre-populating a list by providing elements inside the block statement:</p>

<pre><code>var list = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1, 2, 3};
</code></pre>

<p>This translates simply to the following list of statements:</p>

<pre><code>var list = new List&lt;int&gt;();
list.Add(1);
list.Add(2);
list.Add(3);
</code></pre>

<p><code>Collection initializer</code> is not characteristic only for arrays and collection types from <code>BCL</code> but can be used with any type meeting the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implements <code>IEnumerable</code> interface</li>
<li>Declares method with <code>void Add(T item)</code> signature</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>public class CustomList&lt;T&gt;: IEnumerable
{
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    public void Add(T item) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can add support for <code>Collection initializer</code> to existing types by defining the <code>Add</code> method as an extension method:</p>

<pre><code>public static class ExistingTypeExtensions
{
    public static void Add&lt;T&gt;(ExistingType @this, T item) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This syntax can be also used to insert elements into the collection field without accessible setter in initialization block:</p>

<pre><code>class CustomType
{
    public List&lt;string&gt; CollectionField { get; private set; }  = new List&lt;string&gt;();
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var obj = new CustomType
        {
            CollectionField = 
            {
                "item1",
                "item2"
            }
        };
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p><code>Add</code> method can have more than one parameter:</p>

<pre><code>public class CustomList&lt;T&gt;: IEnumerable
{
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    public void Add(T item, string extraParam1, int extraParam1) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>To use this overload inside the initialization block we need to wrap all parameters in extra pair of curly braces:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
        {"item1", "extraParamVal1", 2 },
        {"item2", "extraParamVal2", 3 }
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p><code>Collection initializer</code> is quite often used to initialize collection with a well known number of items, but we can utilize it to set up collection with a dynamic number of elements. In both cases the syntax is identical:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
       existingItems
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This is possible for types which meet the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implements <code>IEnumerable</code> interface</li>
<li>Declares method with <code>void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items)</code> signature</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>public class CustomList&lt;T&gt;: IEnumerable
{
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    public void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items) =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, array type and collections from <code>BCL</code> don’t implement <code>void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items)</code> method, but we could easily change that by defining an extension method for the existing collection types:</p>

<pre><code>public static class ListExtensions
{
    public static void Add&lt;T&gt;(this List&lt;T&gt; @this, IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items) =&gt; @this.AddRange(items);
}

</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to this extension method it’s now possible to write code which looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
        existingItems.Where(x =&gt; /*Filter items*/) .Select(x =&gt; /*Map items*/) 
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>or even compose the resulting collection from the mix of individual elements and results of multiple <code>enumerables</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = new CustomType
{
    CollectionField = 
    {
        individualElement1,
        individualElement2,
        list1.Where(x =&gt; /*Filter items*/) .Select(x =&gt; /*Map items*/),
        list2.Where(x =&gt; /*Filter items*/) .Select(x =&gt; /*Map items*/),
    }
};

<p>Without this syntax, it would be very hard to achieve a similar result inside the initialization block.</p>

<p>I’ve discovered this language feature by accident while working with mappings for types with collection fields generated from <code>protobuf</code> contracts. For those of you who are not familiar with <code>protobuf</code>, if you are using <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp-generated">grpctools</a> to generate dotnet types from <code>proto</code> files, all collection fields are generated as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[DebuggerNonUserCode]
public RepeatableField&lt;ItemType&gt; SomeCollectionField
{
    get
    {
        return this.someCollectionField_;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, collection fields in generated code don’t have a setter, but a blessing in disguise, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/collections/repeated-field-t-">RepeatableField<t></t></a> implements <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/collections/repeated-field-t-#class_google_1_1_protobuf_1_1_collections_1_1_repeated_field_3_01_t_01_4_1a6d0e9efbac818182068afae48b8d4599">void Add(IEnumerable<t> items)</t></a> so we can still initialize them inside the initialization block:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Adds all of the specified values into this collection. This method is present to
/// allow repeated fields to be constructed from queries within collection initializers.
/// Within non-collection-initializer code, consider using the equivalent &lt;see cref="AddRange"/&gt;
/// method instead for clarity.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="values"&gt;The values to add to this collection.&lt;/param&gt;
public void Add(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; values)
{
    AddRange(values);
}

<h2 id="dictionary-initialization-syntax">Dictionary initialization syntax<a href="#dictionary-initialization-syntax" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>One of the cool features introduced in C# 6 was <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-6#initialize-associative-collections-using-indexers">Index initializers</a> which simplified syntax for dictionary initialization. Thanks to that we can write dictionary init code in a much more readable way:</p>

<pre><code>var errorCodes = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;
{
    [404] = "Page not Found",
    [302] = "Page moved, but left a forwarding address.",
    [500] = "The web server can't come out to play today."
};
</code></pre>

<p>This code is translated to:</p>

<pre><code>var errorCodes = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;();
errorCodes[404] = "Page not Found";    
errorCodes[302] = "Page moved, but left a forwarding address.";    
errorCodes[500] = "The web server can't come out to play today.";    
</code></pre>

<p>It’s not much but it definitely results with a better experience for writing and reading the code.</p>

<p>The best thing about <code>Index initializer</code> is that it is not limited only to <code>Dictionary&lt;&gt;</code> class, it can be used with any type which defines an <code>indexer</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class HttpHeaders
{
    public string this[string key]
    {
        get =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
        set =&gt; throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var headers = new HttpHeaders
        {
            ["access-control-allow-origin"] = "*",
            ["cache-control"] = "max-age=315360000, public, immutable"
        };
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="deconstructors">Deconstructors<a href="#deconstructors" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>In C# 7.0, together with tuples, a deconstructor mechanism has been introduced. Deconstructors allow for “decomposing” a tuple into a set of individual variables as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var point = (5, 7);
// decomposing tuple into separated variables
var (x, y) = point;
</code></pre>

<p>which is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>ValueTuple&lt;int, int&gt; point = new ValueTuple&lt;int, int&gt;(1, 4);
int x = point.Item1;
int y = point.Item2;
</code></pre>

<p>This syntax allows also for switching values of two variables without the need for an explicit declaration of the third variable:</p>

<pre><code>int x = 5, y = 7;
//switch
(x, y) = (y,x);
</code></pre>

<p>… or for a more succinct way of member initialization:</p>

<pre><code>class Point
{
    public int X { get; }
    public int Y { get; }

    public Point(int x, int y)  =&gt; (X, Y) = (x, y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Deconstructors can be used not only with tuples but with custom types too. To allow for deconstructing custom type, it needs to implement a method that obeys the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s named <code>Deconstruct</code></li>
<li>Returns void</li>
<li>Every parameter has to be defined with <code>out</code> modifier</li>
</ul>

<p>For our type <code>Point</code> we can define deconstructor in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>class Point
{
    public int X {get;}
    public int Y {get;}

    public Point(int x, int y) =&gt; (X, Y) = (x, y);
    
    public void Deconstruct(out int x, out int y) =&gt; (x, y) = (X, Y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and sample usage can look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>var point = new Point(2,4);
var (x, y)= point;        
</code></pre>

<p>which under the hood is translated to:</p>

<pre><code>int x;
int y;
new Point(2, 4).Deconstruct(out x, out y);
</code></pre>

<p>Deconstructors can be added to types declared outside the source code by defining them as an extension method:</p>

<pre><code>public static class PointExtensions
{
     public static void Deconstruct(this Point @this, out int x, out int y) =&gt; (x, y) = (@this.X, @this.Y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>One of the most useful examples of deconstructors is the one for <code>KeyValuePair&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;</code>, which allows for easy access to key and value while iterating over a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var (key, value) in new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; { [1] = "val1", [2] = "val2" })
{
    //TODO: Do something
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>KeyValuePair&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;.Deconstruct(TKey, TValue)</code> is available only from <code>netstandard2.1</code>. For previous <code>netstandard</code> versions we need to add it manually using the approach with the extension method.</p>

<h2 id="custom-awaitable-types">Custom awaitable types<a href="#custom-awaitable-types" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>C# 5 (released together with Visual Studio 2012) introduced an <code>async/await</code> mechanism which was a real game-changer in the area of asynchronous programming. Before that, handling invocation of asynchronous methods resulted very often in quite a messy code, especially when there was more than one asynchronous invocation:</p>

<pre><code>void DoSomething()
{
    DoSomethingAsync().ContinueWith((task1) =&gt; {
        if (task1.IsCompletedSuccessfully)
        {
            DoSomethingElse1Async(task1.Result).ContinueWith((task2) =&gt; {
                if (task2.IsCompletedSuccessfully)
                {
                    DoSomethingElse2Async(task2.Result).ContinueWith((task3) =&gt; {
                        //TODO: Do something
                    });
                }
            });

</blockquote>

<p>Deps is a private, hosted, Maven repository. While building it I had a critical decision to make - Where to host it? I evaluated many different hosting services but decided on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I’ve been using it in pre-production and then production for over a year and a half now. I haven’t seen too many experience reports on Google Cloud, so I wanted to share how I’ve found it, what went well, and what still needs improving. I’ve split my thoughts below into good, meh, bad, ugly, and opportunities for improvement. I have compared and contrasted with Amazon Web Services (AWS), the other hosting provider that I have the most experience with, and GCP’s biggest competitor.</p>

<p>A note up front, these are solely my experiences, and it’s quite possible that I’ve misunderstood or misrepresented things here. If I’ve made any mistakes, let me know so I can correct them. I only talk about services that I have experience using. There are a bunch of really good looking services like Google Kubernetes Engine, Google App Engine, and BigQuery, but I haven’t used them enough (or at all) to be able to give a review on them.</p>

<h2 id="permissions">Permissions</h2>

<p>Google Cloud’s permission model is one of its strongest features. AWS IAM permissions are fairly complicated; in practice people often set permissions to <code>s3:*</code> or equivalent to make things work. For this reason (and others) there has become a ‘best-practice’ of running multiple AWS accounts for dev, staging, and prod, and <a href="https://segment.com/blog/secure-access-to-100-aws-accounts/">maybe more environments</a>. AWS seems to be okay with this situation and is leaning into it, offering <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/06/introducing-aws-landing-zone/">AWS Landing Zone</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/">Organisations</a> to help orchestrate multiple accounts. This works, but it seems like it adds a lot of complexity.</p>

<p>In contrast, GCP offers a much simpler starting point: Projects. Every resource you create (I think?) lives in a Project, and Projects live inside your (single) Organisation. By default, resources within a Project are accessible to other resources in that Project (as long as their API is enabled) and are inaccessible to anything outside of the project. For example, if you create a Cloud SQL database and a Cloud Storage bucket, by default a VM inside the project can access both resources, but a VM outside of the project couldn’t. This goes a long way towards setting up safe permission structures. If you need to, you can setup inter-project resource access, but it’s not something you’re likely to need too much. In my experience, I needed it for accessing disk images and DNS records, but everything else for Deps’ production service lives isolated in the production project.</p>

<p>Google’s Organisation management offers <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders">hierarchical folders</a> with cascading permissions. I haven’t needed to use them, but it seems like this would scale well to very large organisations. I wonder if this is modelled on the way Google’s internal permission system works?</p>

<h2 id="product-philosophy">Product Philosophy</h2>

<p>GCP has quite a different product philosophy to AWS. When new GCP features and resources are released into general availability, they are usually very high quality. This is in contrast to AWS where it can sometimes feel like you are the first person to use a feature. A quote I have seen which rings true to me is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17025561">“Google’s Beta is like AWS’s GA”</a>.</p>

<p>GCP also has done well with integrating their different services together. GCP provides a smaller set of core primitives that are global and work well for lots of use cases. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/">Pub/Sub</a> is probably the best example I have for this. In AWS you have SQS, SNS, Amazon MQ, Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, DynamoDB Streams, and maybe another queueing service by the time you read this post. <strong>2019 Update</strong>: Amazon has now released another streaming service: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/msk/">Amazon Managed Streaming Kafka</a>. GCP has Pub/Sub. Pub/Sub seems flexible enough to replace most (all?) of AWS’ various queues. (Disclaimer, I haven’t used Pub/Sub yet, just looked at its documentation).</p>

<p>Google opts for strong consistency by default. Google Cloud Storage, has <a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/02/how-Google-Cloud-Storage-offers-strongly-consistent-object-listing-thanks-to-Spanner.html">consistent</a> lists and gets, Cloud Key Management Service has strong (global) consistent key enablement, and Cloud Spanner is their globe-spanning consistent database. Many AWS services are eventually consistent, which pushes complexity onto the developer.</p>

<p>Even though Google has a smaller set of primitives than AWS, they are often simpler. Rather than having dozens of compute instance types, they offer just four: micro, standard, highmem, and highcpu. In actual fact, these are all just pre-configurations in the design space, and you can size and configure your instances to be just about any combination of memory and CPU.</p>

<p>Another small thing, but one that I appreciated is that GCP’s resource names are often aesthetically prettier. Either you get to name resources yourself (I’m looking at you <code>jfkjfkfjlkjfjfkak.cloudfront.net</code>), or the generated names are short, e.g. <code>&lt;instance-prefix&gt;-cjgh</code>.</p>

<h2 id="global-and-regional-by-default">Global and Regional by default</h2>

<p>One of the nicest things about GCP is that most resources are either global or regional. This includes things like the control panel (you can see all of your project’s VMs on a single screen), disk images, storage buckets (multi-region within a continent), network configuration, global load balancing, Pub/Sub, VPC networks, and probably more I’m forgetting. This contrasts with AWS, where most resources, including the control panel, are either zonal or regional.</p>

<h2 id="compute-engine">Compute Engine</h2>

<p>Google Compute Engine has been very solid for me. I’m only using it for a handful of VMs but I haven’t noticed any issues with it. The instance group managers work well and auto-scaling does what it’s meant to do. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/health-checks">Health checks</a> can be used to destroy unhealthy instances and create new ones without manual intervention (this has pros and cons, as you may lose debugging information). <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/updating-managed-instance-groups">Rolling updates</a> work well for doing deployments. The Rolling Update manager waits for new instances to be healthy before shutting down old instances. This has helped catch a few issues before they hit production. If your instance is unhealthy, GCP provides <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/live-migration">live instance migration</a>. It’s nice, it seems to happen once/twice a week, and I’ve never noticed any issues with it. On AWS, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/maintenance-help/">maintenance events</a> will require a reboot.</p>

<p>Google’s pricing model is much simpler. As mentioned above, you can preconfigure your machines to just about any combination of memory and CPU that makes sense for your application. You can also pick your Intel CPU instance family if you need certain CPU features, or just want the slight performance boost available.</p>

<p>For standard VMs, Google offers <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/sustained-use-discounts">Sustained Use Discounts</a>. If you run a standard VM for more than 25% of a month, Compute Engine automatically discounts your bill. If you run an instance for a full month this ends up to be a 30% discount. This is a nice benefit if you don’t want to pre-purchase capacity, but still have a stable workload. They even do something neat with ‘inferred instances’ where they bin-pack partial instance usage. This means you don’t lose your discount if you replace instances through the month, and ends up giving you the maximum possible discount. I can’t do it justice here, check out the docs, it’s really cool.</p>

<p>Google’s answer to AWS spot pricing is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible">Preemptible Instances</a>. Instead of bidding on instances and working out the maximum price you’re willing to pay, they offer a single, fixed 80% discount. One thing that is trickier with Preemptible Instances is that you only get a 30-second warning before your instance is preempted. On AWS you get two minutes. The tradeoff is that both pre-emptible and standard instance startup times are faster because Google can evict Preemptible Instances more quickly. On AWS, after submitting a spot request you may have to wait a short time before your spot request is fulfilled.</p>

<p>Lastly, Google has an answer to Amazon’s Reserved Instances, and again they are much simpler. To use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/signing-up-committed-use-discounts">Committed Use Discounts</a>, you purchase vCPUs and memory capacity separately. Your purchase is tied to a region but is otherwise convertible to just about any instance configuration (see the docs for a few small limitations). Committed Use Discounts are automatically applied to the instances you are running in your workload, and then Sustained Use Discounts are applied to any resource usage on top of that.</p>

<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>

<p>Picking Terraform has been a really big win for Deps. It enables us to quickly and safely spin up a complete staging or development environment to test a risky infrastructure change. It also ensures that changes to production are tracked, commented, and coherent as a whole. Terraform takes a little bit of learning, but the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html">Google Cloud Provider docs</a> are really good, and the team working on the provider is constantly updating it with new features and resources in GCP. If you want to be on the bleeding edge of every GCP feature then Terraform may not be a good fit for you, as they don’t generally support beta resources. However you could manage those beta resources via the console/CLI/<a href="https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/">Deployment Manager</a> until Terraform support is added, then <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html">import</a> them into your Terraform config.</p>

<p>The one place I think Terraform has room to improve is in running multiple environments from a single configuration, e.g. dev, staging, prod. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html">Workspaces</a> are good, but there is limited support for switching variables based on your workspace.</p>

	The decision to shut down eight nuclear reactors in the year following the Fukushima disaster contributed to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/418078/electricity-prices-for-households-in-germany/">higher electricity prices</a> in Germany. It also led to the partial replacement of nuclear generation by electricity generated from coal, lignite and gas, and thus to an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and local pollution, the health effects of which have not been considered.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Diffuse and concentrated risks</b>
</p>
<p>
	The dispersal of risks and accidents is a factor that facilitates their social acceptance. Thus, although much less deadly than road accidents (which cause more than <a href="https://www.preventionroutiere.asso.fr/2019/12/22/statistiques-daccidents/">3,000 deaths</a> a year in France), plane and train accidents cause more emotion. Even if we add to this the 20,000 or so injured people hospitalized each year as a result of road accidents, the car is perceived as not very dangerous, and public opinion erupts when the authorities seek to impose speed limits. In the evaluation of public policies, this difference in perception is generally not considered. At best, economists calculate the balance of aggregate benefits and costs without taking into account how these benefits and costs are felt by the public. Politicians, on the contrary, if only for electoral reasons, are more sensitive to the concentration or dispersion in time and space of the effects of their decisions.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Phasing out nuclear power</b>
</p>
<p>
	Germany's nuclear power plant policy is an example of this sprinkling effect. In 2011, after the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi reactors, the German government, which had just relaunched the industry, decided to gradually close all its nuclear power plants. The last ones will have to stop in 2022. No cost-benefit assessment was carried out to support this decision, but the federal authorities considered that it would be well accepted by the population, which has often shown its hostility to this technology because of the risks of accidents and the problem of waste reprocessing. Even today, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-015-0558-8">81% of Germans are still in favor</a> of this radical change of policy. For <a href="https://www.greenpeace.fr/la-sortie-du-nucleaire-en-allemagne-a-t-elle-ete-compensee-par-une-hausse-de-la-production-de-charbon/">environmental organizations</a>, the move away from nuclear power is a win-win situation, as plant closures are compensated for by the production of electricity from renewable sources, which is operated at close to zero cost and without emitting greenhouse gas or particulates. It is undeniable that green electricity production has <a href="https://www.energy-charts.de/ren_share.htm?year=all&amp;source=ren-share&amp;period=annual">sharply increased</a> over the decade. But in an industry where the product is not storable on a large scale, it is necessary to ensure that production is available at the times when consumers want to use it. Because wind and sun are intermittent, unless considerable capital is invested in energy storage facilities, green energy cannot be an identical replacement for dispatchable plants that operate at baseload levels and, if necessary, increase their output to meet peak demands. The problem arises in particular at the end of the day when demand increases while the photovoltaic panels are not producing. At times when green energy is not available, conventional German thermal power plants, or imports, have had to be used to replace closed nuclear power plants. The shutdown of the reactors has therefore been accompanied by an increase in production from green energy at times when it is available and, at times when it is not, by an increase in production from power stations burning coal, lignite and gas, as well as by an increase in imports, especially from Denmark, France and the Czech Republic.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Generalized cost</b>
</p>
<p>
	In total, output from thermal power stations has fallen, but to a lesser extent than if the nuclear power stations had not been shut down. A <a href="https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WP304.pdf">study</a> conducted at Berkeley measures the difference between the observed trajectory and that of the alternative scenario in which the nuclear reactors would not have been shut down early (the counterfactual). It assesses the costs associated with the more intensive use of conventional thermal power plants and the increased imports resulting from the nuclear phase-out. The authors analyze the shutdown of 10 reactors (out of the 17 initially operating) between 2011 and 2017. The originality of the study is that it is not limited to production costs and aggregate carbon emissions. It also integrates the spatial dispersion of effects in terms of local air pollution. By combining data on hourly and plant by plant operating volumes and costs between 2010 and 2017 with information on electricity demand and prices, local weather conditions and primary energy prices, the authors calculate what the hourly output per plant would have been if the government had not ordered the closure of the ten reactors. They deduce the additional costs incurred in terms of primary energy consumption and environmental damage. They end up with some estimates of the effect of the closure decision on the average production of thermal power plants (+15%), on imports (+37%) and on wholesale prices (+4%). As the four major industrial groups owning nuclear power plants also owned coal-fired power plants, they were little penalized by this energy substitution. However, the higher prices were indeed a cost for German consumers, estimated by the authors at $1.6 billion per year. But this is not the main cost. The impact on health and the climate must also be considered.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<b>Local pollution and excess mortality</b>
</p>
<p>
	The combustion of fossil fuels causes emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and pollutants with local health effects (SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> and fine particles). According to the study cited, the replacement of nuclear power plant production resulted in an additional 12% for each of these emissions. The additional carbon dioxide emissions amount to 36 million tons per year, which, based on a social cost of carbon of $50/tCO<sub>2</sub>, represents an additional cost of $1.8 billion per year.
</p>
<p>
	But the most important effect comes from additional local pollution: it would have caused an excess mortality of 1,100 individuals per year. This number is calculated from a geographical analysis of the populations living around the thermal power plants, the variation in local production induced by the government decision and estimates of the harmfulness of local pollution (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24332274">ESCAPE project</a>). It only considers residents in Germany, without integrating the effects in neighboring countries. Taking a value of $7.9 million as the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318790641_Income_Elasticities_and_Global_Values_of_a_Statistical_Life/fulltext/597f45b6aca272d568188301/Income-Elasticities-and-Global-Values-of-a-Statistical-Life.pdf">price of a German's life</a>, the authors of the study estimate that the additional cost of the closure decision due to local pollution amounts to $8.7 billion per year.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Benefits of closure</b>
</p>
<p>
	The costs are therefore substantial. What about the benefits? By closing the country's nuclear power plants, the German government wants to eliminate the risk of accidents and solve the problem of waste treatment and storage. The evaluation of the induced gain depends on the accident probabilities retained and on the way in which the <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/2019/04/20/est-il-vrai-que-l-accident-nucleaire-de-fukushima-n-a-cause-aucun-mort_1720075">populations</a> in the vicinity of the damaged plants are taken care of (evacuation, re-housing, care, etc.). Current estimates are around <a href="https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/tme/research/energy_environment/Pdf/wpen2013-14.pdf">$3 per MWh</a>. As the exit policy has resulted in a reduction of 53 TWh/year in nuclear generation, the estimated gain is less than $200 million per year, far from the annual cost of $12 billion resulting from the addition of the additional cost of production ($1.6M), the additional CO2 emissions ($1.8M) and the additional mortality linked to local emissions ($8.7M).
</p>
<p>
	*
</p>
<p>
	*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *
</p>

<p>
	Assessing the economic and environmental impact of a nuclear power plant is not easy. It requires approximate assumptions that are open to criticism. But even if one can think that the costs are overestimated and the gains underestimated by the study cited above, the gap between the two is so great that it is difficult to see how the decision to close could be justified on a purely techno-economic level. However, in hindsight, even in possession of these data, it is likely that the anxiety-producing potential of the images of the earthquake/tsunami/reactors-meltdown sequence looping through the 24-hour news channels would have led the German government to take the same decision. The scattering of illnesses and deaths caused by local pollution considerably reduces their weight in the face of an event such as Fukushima, where we find the ingredients of the classic tragedy: unity of place, unity of time and unity of action. It is a psychological fact that explains why political rationality often frees itself from economic and environmental analysis.

        <span>Step 3:</span> Get scrappy.
      </p>
      <p>
        It happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        The email every app developer dreads:
      </p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/rejection-e2a3c6a88dbf773961f19d543c955055.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>
        I had done everything right:
      </p>
      <p>
        -- I tackled a problem I had from my 5 years of working remotely: <span>the difficulty of privately sharing team-wide tasks, announcements, and reminders.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        -- I found my first customer on Twitter before writing a line of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- I even shipped quickly and iterated.
      </p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/tweet-1c7e0b96d0e0d70d03aa4b661afb9531.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>
        I checked all the boxes they teach you in Startup School!
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to reason with them, or get some direction on how to get approval:

        No dice.
      </p>
      <p>Time to get scrappy.</p>
      <p>In a moment of brash inspiration, I tweeted at Stewart Butterfield (Slack's CEO) basically pleading my case</p>
      <p>No response.</p>
      <p>Sidenote: I deleted that tweet, but Stewart - if you’re reading this, give me a 5-minute chat any time, any place!</p>
      <p>My next move was to scour Twitter for phrases related to “Slack team tasks”, “Slack mass-messaging”, etc. and reach out directly to as many people as possible.</p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/tweet2-9e15582f560fc65c73ec2c8461ff9e5a.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>I ended up finding a 2-year-old tweet by Ryan Hoover (Founder of Product Hunt) about a browser plugin that served a similar purpose, but not very well.</p>
      <p>To get his attention, I posted the app to Product Hunt, and asked him for feedback as a reply to his original tweet:</p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/hoover-fa7a1492ebc3de3e203a5b3f80d7cac7.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>No response, again :/</p>
      <p>Next I created <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/direct-memo" target="_blank">an Indie Hackers profile</a> with a post linking to the Product Hunt page, which led to a good number of upvotes.</p>
      <p>Sidenote: I’ve found the IndieHacker community to be one of the most supportive and welcoming on the internet - a testament to the leadership team and Rosie Sherry, the community manager. If you’re interested in community building, <a href="https://rosieland.substack.com/" target="_blank">her newsletter</a> is a must-read.</p>
      <p>Upvotes trickled in, until something awesome and unexpected happened. Ryan upvoted my post!</p>
      <p><img src="https://directmemo.io/images/blog/1/upvote-5751a7e7165c8c5e0cb3245eda22e5bb.png?vsn=d" alt=""></p><p>Obviously, app signups surged.</p>
      <p>Users signed up from large corporations, small businesses, universities, and everything in between.</p>
      <p>Industries ranged from watch-makers to fantasy sports commissioners, to CEOs.</p>
      <p>The thrill was intoxicating, and it hasn’t died down. A month later I still jump out of bed to check on new signups every morning!</p>
      <p>Moral of the story: When things don't go as planned, get scrappy and put yourself in a position to get lucky.</p>
      <p>Next I’ll be experimenting with other ways to grow, like social media ads. Are there any courses or websites you recommend for learning how to do them well?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>C++17 introduced <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new">an alignment argument</a> to <code>::operator new()</code>. It's important to note that if you allocate something using aligned new, you <strong>absolutely must</strong> deallocate it <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/delete">using aligned delete</a>, or the behavior is undefined. LLVM 10.x takes advantage of this alignment parameter, if the compiler supports it. That means if you are compiling on Windows with MSVC set to C++14, <code>__cpp_aligned_new</code> is not defined and the extra argument isn't passed. Otherwise, if it's compiled with MSVC set to C++17, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/User:D41D8CD98F/feature_testing_macros"><code>__cpp_aligned_new</code> is defined</a> and the extra argument is passed.</p><p>There's just one teeny tiny little problem - <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/6d2f73f821ed5ea584869924b150ac2e6e65c12e/llvm/include/llvm/Support/Compiler.h#L568">the check was in a header file</a>.</p><p>Now, if this header file were completely internal and LLVM itself only ever called <code>::operator new()</code> from inside it's libraries, this wouldn't be a problem. As you might have guessed, this was not the case. LLVM was calling <code>allocate_buffer()</code> from inside header files. The corresponding <code>deallocate_buffer</code> call <em>was</em> inside the same header file, but sadly, it was called from a destructor, and <em>that</em> destructor had been called from inside one of LLVM's libraries, which meant it didn't know about aligned allocations… <strong>Oops!</strong></p><p>This means, if your program uses C++17, but LLVM was compiled with C++14, your program will happily pass LLVM <strong>aligned memory</strong>, which LLVM will then pass into <strong>the wrong delete operator</strong>, because it's calling the unaligned delete function from C++14 instead of the aligned delete function from C++17. This results in strange and bizarre heap corruption errors because of the mismatched <code>::operator new</code> and <code>::operator delete</code>. Arguably, the real bug here is LLVM calling any allocation function from a header file in the first place, as this is just begging for ABI problems.</p><p>Of course, one might ask why a C++17 application would be linking against LLVM compiled with C++14. Well, you see, the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-10.0.0">prebuilt LLVM binaries</a> were compiled against C++14… <strong>OOPS!</strong> Suddenly if you wanted to avoid compiling LLVM yourself, you couldn't use C++17 anymore!</p><p>Luckily <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/7aaff8fd2da2812a2b3cbc8a41af29774b10a7d6"><strong>this has now been fixed</strong></a> after a bunch of people complained about the extremely unintuitive errors resulting from this mismatch. Unfortunately, as of this writing, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/">LLVM still hasn't provided a new release</a>, which means you will still encounter this problem using the latest precompiled binaries of LLVM. Personally, I recompile LLVM using C++17 for my own projects, just to be safe, since LLVM does not gaurantee ABI compatibility in these situations.</p><p>Still, this is a particularly nasty case of an unintentional ABI break between C++ versions, which is easy to miss because most people assume C++ versions are backwards compatible. Be careful, and stop allocating memory in header files that might be deallocated inside your library!</p></div></div>]]>

Things that are hard to come up with but easy to copy are ‘Math hard'.</p><p>Many mathematics problems take a long time to figure out how to solve. But, once you have a method, often the answer can be verified quickly and the method can be learned easily. Pythagoras needed to be smart to invent his theorem, but now children learn it in school. Other Math Hard things include recipes, designs, and new ideas.</p><p>Unless Pythagoras could have kept his method a secret, which is difficult to do, his theorem wouldn’t have helped him build a defensible company. Even school kids can copy it.</p><p>This is like startup ideas for a new kind of user experience or interface – they’re hard to figure out, hard to keep secret (especially if your users experience the secret), and easy to copy.</p><p>But what if you could keep the secret? After all, ‘trade secrets’ can be kept for a while if you’re careful.</p><p>The problem is, the more success you have with your secret, the more effort other people will put in to discover it. You might be really smart, and have worked really hard, but there are lots of smart people who will work hard to be successful. It’s unrealistic to think that you’ll ever have a totally unique insight, let alone one other people couldn’t come up with if they really wanted to.</p><p>If this kind of insight were the defensibility criterion necessary for starting a successful company, by definition almost no-one would ever start one. No matter the ingenuity of your invention, you’re going to end up competing on some other dimension.</p><p>Math Hardness, the hardness of working stuff out, at best buys you time. How much time? Sadly, some amount of time that’s inversely proportional to how much success you’re having. The more valuable your secret turns out to be, the less time you have left.</p><p>The other kind of hardness is the intrinsic hardness of doing certain things. Some things are difficult to do, even if everyone knows how to do them. This is Bodybuilding Hard.</p><p>Achieving a bodybuilder’s physique isn’t complicated, no matter what the endless range of supplements suggests. You need to: exercise frequently with heavy weights; and consistently eat a protein rich diet. Neither is a secret or complicated to understand. Most people, in shape or not, know this stuff. The problem is that doing these things is intrinsically hard. It requires strenuous activity that’s much less fun than seeing friends over beers and burgers.</p><p>Most valuable achievements are Bodybuilding Hard. Learning a new skill, becoming wealthy, being a good partner – all require effort. Practically everyone knows more or less how to achieve these things, but few actually do. That’s why there is a supplement shortcut for every industry: pointy guitars; self help books; and magazines with fancy bedroom techniques.</p><p>Bodybuilding Hard startups are everywhere. On demand services, marketplaces, ecommerce – they’re the backbone of Rocket Internet’s portfolio. They don’t have Pythagorean secrets. These businesses are a pain to run, requiring the coordination of thousands of people and complex operations.</p><p>Without a secret, beating everyone else is hard. But bodybuilding isn’t economically self-sustaining&nbsp;if&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;just&nbsp;good: you need to be the best. Despite small differences, the winner still takes it all.</p><p>Hence, bodybuilding is riddled with steroids and techniques to eek out tiny advantages. Bodybuilding startups are no different — only their steroids are cash, experience, and thousands of traumatised former bankers and consultants.</p><p>The more success you have through doing something Bodybuilding Hard, the more people are going to be incentivised to try to do the same thing. If it’s a startup worth starting, eventually the payoff must outweigh the hardness. And once it’s clear it does, your competition will bring steroids.</p><p>Bodybuilding Hardness, like Math Hardness, buys you time. How much time? Once again, some amount of time inversely proportional to how much success you’re having. The better it’s going, the less time you have left.</p><p>Both types of hardness are good ways to get started. Doing something hard buys you a window of opportunity to succeed. But, once you’re big, something else has to keep you there.</p><p>Defensibility doesn’t imply hardness in the long run, even if hardness is useful in the beginning. For the best companies, things get easier after the hard part.</p><p>Their long term advantage doesn’t require new insights or ongoing effort: it’s too hard to compete like this once the stakes are high enough. Their advantage is unique resource accumulation – like Google’s datasets or Apple’s brand, or scale-enabled product differentiation – like Uber’s liquidity or Amazon’s delivery infrastructure. You need to snowball.</p><p>Doing something hard can put you ahead of your competition, but it isn’t the hardness that will keep you there.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1553598693305_327084"><div><p>Thanks to the EF team for reading drafts of this.

Delivering a successful product is not something you do once and forget about but is rather a continuous recurring process. With every line of code that changes, software must remain in a functional state, which implies the need for rigorous testing.</p>
<p>Over time, as the software industry evolved, testing practices have matured as well. Gradually moving towards automation, testing approaches have also influenced software design itself, spawning mantras like test-driven development, emphasizing patterns such as dependency inversion, and popularizing high-level architectures that are built around it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, automated testing is embedded so deeply within our perception of software development, it’s hard to imagine one without the other. And since that ultimately enables us to produce software quickly without sacrificing quality, it’s hard to argue that it’s not a good thing.</p>
<p>However, despite there being many different approaches, modern “best practices” primarily push developers specifically towards <em>unit testing</em>. Tests, whose scope lies higher on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid">Mike Cohn’s pyramid</a> are either written as part of a wider suite (often by completely different people) or even disregarded entirely.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is often supported by the argument that unit tests provide the most value during development because they’re able to catch errors quickly and help enforce design patterns that facilitate modularity. This idea has become so widely accepted that the term “unit testing” is now somewhat conflated with automated testing in general, losing part of its meaning and contributing to confusion.</p>
<p>When I was a less experienced developer, I believed in following these “best practices” to the letter, as I thought that would make my code better. I didn’t particularly enjoy writing unit tests because of all the ceremony involved with abstractions and mocking, but it was the recommended approach after all, so who am I to know better.</p>
<p>It was only later, as I’ve experimented more and built more projects, that I started to realize that there are much better ways to approach testing and that <strong>focusing on unit tests is</strong>, in most cases, <strong>a complete waste of time</strong>.</p>
<p>Aggressively popularized “best practices” often have a tendency of manifesting cargo cults around them, enticing developers to apply design patterns or use specific approaches without giving them a much needed second thought. In the context of automated testing, I find this prevalent when it comes to our industry’s unhealthy obsession with unit testing.</p>
<p>In this article I will share my observations about this testing technique and go over why I believe it to be inefficient. I’ll also explain which approaches I’m currently using instead to test my code, both in open source projects and day-to-day work.</p>
<p><em>Note: this article contains code examples which are written in C#, but the language itself is not (too) important to the points I’m making.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: I’ve come to realize that programming terms are completely useless at conveying meanings because everyone seems to understand them differently. In this article I will be relying on the “standard” definitions, where unit testing targets smallest separable parts of code, end-to-end testing targets software’s outermost entry points, while integration testing is for everything in-between.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 3: if you don’t feel like reading the entirety of the article, you can skip to the end for the summary.</em></p>
<h2>Fallacies of unit testing</h2>
<p>Unit tests, as evident by the name, revolve around the concept of a “unit”, which denotes a very small isolated part of a larger system. There is no formal definition of what a unit is or how small it should be, but it’s mostly accepted that it corresponds to an individual function of a module (or method of an object).</p>
<p>Normally, when the code isn’t written with unit tests in mind, it may be impossible to test some functions in complete isolation because they can have external dependencies. In order to <em>work around</em> this issue, we can apply the dependency inversion principle and replace concrete dependencies with abstractions. These abstractions can then be substituted with real or fake implementations, depending on whether the code is executing normally or as part of a test.</p>
<p>Besides that, unit tests are expected to be pure. For example, if a function contains code that writes data to the file system, that part needs to be abstracted away as well, otherwise the test that verifies such behavior will be considered an integration test instead, since its coverage extends to the unit’s integration with the file system.</p>
<p>Considering the factors mentioned above, we can reason that <strong>unit tests are only useful to verify pure business logic inside of a given function</strong>. Their scope does not extend to testing side-effects or other integrations because that belongs to the domain of integration testing.</p>
<p>To illustrate how these nuances affect design, let’s take a look at an example of a simple system that we want to test. Imagine we’re working on an application that calculates local sunrise and sunset times, which it does through the help of the following two classes:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDisposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HttpClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _httpClient<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDiposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> _locationProvider <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _locationProvider<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although the design above is perfectly valid in terms of OOP, neither of these classes are actually unit-testable. Because <code>LocationProvider</code> depends on its own instance of <code>HttpClient</code> and <code>SolarCalculator</code> in turn depends on <code>LocationProvider</code>, it’s impossible to isolate the business logic that may be contained within methods of these classes.</p>
<p>Let’s iterate on that code and replace concrete implementations with abstractions:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>HttpClient</span> httpClient<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _httpClient <span>=</span> httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span> _locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span><span>ILocationProvider</span> locationProvider<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _locationProvider <span>=</span> locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By doing so we were able to decouple <code>LocationProvider</code> from <code>SolarCalculator</code>, but in exchange our code nearly doubled in size. Also note that we had to drop <code>IDisposable</code> from both classes because they <strong>no longer own their dependencies</strong> and thus have no business taking responsibility for their lifecycle.</p>
<p>While these changes may seem as an improvement to some, it’s important to point out that the interfaces we’ve defined serve <strong>no practical purpose other than making unit testing possible</strong>. There’s no need for actual polymorphism in our design, so, as far as our code is concerned, these abstractions are <em>autotelic</em> (i.e. abstractions for the sake of abstractions).</p>
<p>Let’s try to reap the benefits of all that work and write a unit test for <code>SolarCalculator.GetSolarTimesAsync</code>:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculatorTests</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>Fact</span><span>]</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>Task</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync_ForKyiv_ReturnsCorrectSolarTimes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        <span>var</span> location <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Location</span><span>(</span><span>50.45</span><span>,</span> <span>30.52</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>var</span> date <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>DateTimeOffset</span><span>(</span><span>2019</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>04</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> TimeSpan<span>.</span><span>FromHours</span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> expectedSolarTimes <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarTimes</span><span>(</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>06</span><span>,</span> <span>55</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>29</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> locationProvider <span>=</span> Mock<span>.</span><span><span>Of</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ILocationProvider</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span>lp <span>=&gt;</span>
            lp<span>.</span><span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> Task<span>.</span><span>FromResult</span><span>(</span>location<span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> solarCalculator <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span>locationProvider<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        <span>var</span> solarTimes <span>=</span> <span>await</span> solarCalculator<span>.</span><span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        solarTimes<span>.</span><span>Should</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>BeEquivalentTo</span><span>(</span>expectedSolarTimes<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we have a basic test that verifies that <code>SolarCalculator</code> works correctly for a known location. Since unit tests and their units are tightly coupled, we’re following the recommended naming convention, where the test class is named after the class under test, and the name of the test method follows the <code>Method_Precondition_Result</code> pattern.</p>
<p>In order to simulate the desired precondition in the arrange phase, we have to inject corresponding behavior into the unit’s dependency, <code>ILocationProvider</code>. In this case we do that by substituting the return value of <code>GetLocationAsync()</code> with a location for which the correct solar times are already known ahead of time.</p>
<p>Note that although <code>ILocationProvider</code> exposes two different methods, from the contract perspective <strong>we have no way of knowing which one actually gets called</strong>. This means that by choosing to mock a specific one of these methods, we are making an <strong>assumption about the underlying implementation</strong> of the method we’re testing (which was deliberately hidden in the previous snippets).</p>
<p>All in all, the test does correctly verify that the business logic inside <code>GetSolarTimesAsync</code> works as expected. However, let’s expand on some of the observations we’ve made in the process.</p>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/motherboard-and-hands-320.jpg" alt="Motherboard and Hands" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->I think Covid-19 has re-emphasized the value of self-reliance
      to many of us.  During this pandemic, we have been through
      periods when we couldn't simply pick up a phone and call someone 
      to come to our home to make repairs.  We may also have been 
      unable to go to a local shop to get help.  Since so much of our 
      personal business must now be conducted on line, finding inexpensive 
      computers and making basic repairs to our own computers 
      are becoming important life skills.  Without them, we may be unable 
      to stay connected to the world, to attend school, to work, or even to 
      buy food without risking exposure to a potentially deadly disease.</p>

   <p>Fortunately, repairing a computer or buying a cheap used one is not as 
      difficult as many people seem to believe.  All that is needed is the 
      will to learn to do these things in a hands-on way.  Individuals must 
      be willing to take the risks associated with trying to repair 
      their own computers or buying used computers on line.  For most people, 
      I think this is the stumbling block that they never overcome.  
      What separates the people who can do these things from those who 
      cannot is not intelligence.  It is nothing more than need and 
      interest sufficient to get them past the stumbling block.  
      If you are willing to learn, you will win the battle for 
      computer self-reliance.  I will not tell you that you will not be 
      frustrated at times.  I will only say that, if you keep trying, you 
      will learn these skills.</p>

   <p>In this article, I will outline the knowledge and skills that are 
      necessary to solve most basic computer repair problems.  But first, I 
      will explain one simple step that you can take right now to have a 
      working computer in your home at all times.</p>

   <p>Have a working backup computer in your home to use in the event of 
      the death or loss of your primary 
      computer.  A backup computer need not be expensive.  In fact, you can 
      buy a useful, used computer on Ebay for around $50.  The role of this 
      computer is only to get you on line to do research or to buy parts or 
      other necessities until you can get your primary computer working 
      again, or until you can buy another computer.  A rather 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/surf-internet.html">old computer</a> is capable of meeting 
      these needs.  Some of you may want to use a cellphone for this, and 
      that will work if your cellphone service includes a data plan.  However, 
      for reasons that will become clear later, a fully-functioning computer 
      would be better.  I have written several articles on 
      cheapskatesguide.org that explain how to buy a cheap computer on 
      line.  For suggestions about multiple approaches to getting a cheap 
      laptop, read <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/how-to-get-a-cheap-laptop.html">this 
      article</a>.  For recommendations regarding the best used laptops to 
      buy for less than $100 in the year 2020, read 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/best-laptops-in-2020.html">this</a>.  To obtain a more 
      in-depth understanding of the art of buying a computer that meets your
      needs, go to the <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/helper/core-page.html">Core 
      Articles</a> page and read the articles there in chronological order.</p>

   <p>Now, let me talk about what you need to know to make basic computer 
      repairs.  If you take good care of your computer, the only computer 
      repair that you are likely to need that is not basic is the 
      replacement of your motherboard.  So, if your computer is completely 
      dead or stops booting at the BIOS screen (both symptoms of a bad 
      motherboard), it is most likely time to buy another computer.  If any 
      life at all remains in your computer--if you hear beep codes (beeping 
      sounds when you turn on your computer), see a repeating 
      pattern of flashing 
      lights, or see an error message on the monitor--you may be looking at 
      a computer that you can repair with basic skills.  Below, are the 
      skills that everyone can learn and then use to make basic computer 
      repairs.  Everyone should be able to:</p>
   <br>

   <div>
   <center><h2>Basic Computer Repair Skills Everyone should have</h2></center>
   <ul>
      <li>Diagnose basic computer problems</li>
      <li>Identify compatible parts for a computer</li>
      <li>Research repair methods on line</li>
      <li>Make basic changes to a computer's BIOS settings</li>
      <li>Create a bootable Linux USB drive</li>
      <li>Re-install software</li>
      <li>Replace a hard drive or solid state drive</li>
   </ul>
   </div>
   <p>When you think about it, that is a rather short list.  I think that a
      simple lack 
      of desire is the only thing that prevents most people from obtaining 
      these skills.  In this article, I will not teach you these skills.  I 
      will tell you what you need to know and a little about how to find 
      that knowledge.  I will tell you how to develop the skills.  And, in 
      some cases, I will outline basic repair procedures and tell you how 
      to fill in the details yourself.</p>
   <h2>Diagnosing Basic Computer Problems</h2>
   <p>Most symptoms of computer problems are pretty obvious.  Your keyboard 
      stops working.  A USB connector stops working.  Your computer's monitor 
      doesn't light up.  A message appears on your monitor saying that no 
      operating system was found.  Your computer's sound stops working.  
      The question is not whether a problem exists but whether it is 
      a software problem or a hardware problem.</p><p>The easiest way to rule out a hardware problem is to boot your 
      computer from a reliable, bootable Linux USB flash drive.  If the 
      problem does not go away, then you most likely have a hardware 
      problem.  One obvious exception is that the problem will go away if 
      your hard drive is bad.  I recommend creating a bootable Linux Mint 
      USB flash drive, making sure it works with every piece of hardware on 
      your computer, and setting it aside for when you need it.  Another
      benefit of having a Linux USB flash drive is that if your hard
      drive dies, you will still be able to use your computer to get online.</p>

   <p>If the problem is caused by software, an online search will give you 
      possible sources and procedures to follow to narrow down the problem 
      to one source.  If an error message appears, use an online search 
      engine to search for that exact error message with quotes around it.  
      If you have no error message, you may have more difficulty finding 
      information about the exact source of your problem.  This process can 
      sometimes take several hours, but you are likely to eventually find 
      hints that will lead you to solutions for most computer software 
      problems, especially if the software is common.</p><h2>Identifying Compatible Parts for Your Computer</h2>
   <p>On a modern laptop computer, the battery and hard drive are the only 
      parts that are likely to fail that you can replace with basic 
      skills.  In over 30 years of owning computers, I have never had a 
      single stick of RAM fail.  I have had RAM sticks that have become 
      unseated from their connectors and needed to be pushed back into 
      place.  Beep codes or flashing lights can give you a hint that RAM 
      has become unseated.  Search on line for "computer beep codes" to find 
      the specific beep codes for your computer.</p> 

   <p>You generally only need to know three things to locate a 
      hard drive or Solid State Drive (SSD) that is compatible with your 
      computer: the hard drive's width, its thickness, and the type of 
      connector to which it connects.  You need to buy a replacement hard 
      drive that will physically fit into the space in your computer, and  
      the connector of the hard drive must connect to the connector on your 
      computer's motherboard.  These days, all spinning hard drives are 
      either 2.5 or 3.5 inches wide with SATA connectors.  Most 
      regular-sized desktop computers have 3.5 inch hard drives, but a 
      laptop will never have a 3.5 inch hard drive.  Laptops have either 2.5 
      inch spinning hard drives or some kind of SSD.  If your computer has 
      an SSD, you will have to open up your computer and look at the SSD's
      connector.  Unfortunately, these days, there are a small number of 
      solid state drive connector types that have the same physical 
      connections but are different electrically.  In my opinion, this was 
      a very poor design decision.  Luckily, these SSD's are the only 
      example in the computer industry of which I am aware of this being 
      allowed to occur.  Find a picture of your SSD's connector online and see 
      what type of connector the online source says it is.  Wikipedia is 
      a good place to look for this type of information.  Once you have 
      identified the type of connector on your SSD, see what Wikipedia says 
      about its electrical arrangement.  Do not try to use an SSD with a 
      different type of electrical arrangement, because this is likely to 
      damage the replacement SSD and your computer.</p>
   <h2>Researching Computer Repair Methods on Line</h2>
   <p>When your computer develops a problem, you can almost always find a 
      procedure on line for solving it.  First, you need to know <i>what</i> to 
      do to repair a generic computer with the specific problem you are 
      seeing.  You can read on line about <i>what</i> to do to repair the 
      problem on a generic Windows, Mac, or Linux computer.  Then, if the 
      problem is a hardware problem, you need to know <i>how</i> to 
      physically accomplish the repair of your specific model of computer.  
      A Youtube video can be beneficial for this.  An example of 
      what I mean by "<i>how</i> to physically repair" is the following.  When 
      you open the back of your laptop, what screws do you have to unscrew 
      to release the hard drive?  Do you pull the hard drive straight out 
      perpendicularly from the back of the laptop?  Or, do you slide it 
      parallel to the back of the laptop …</p></div></div>

                    <div>
                 <p>Technical Tuesdays: Markdig, error-free programming, and coding for fun.</p>
<p>Code for this can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/DanielBMarkham/LeanPubX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/DanielBMarkham/LeanPubX</a></p>
<p>Couple of things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's nothing here to test, ie, if I wanted to add tests they would all be acceptance tests, not system tests. That's good. That's what we want.</li>
<li>The application itself is acting like a function that the OS calls. That's also what we want. It enables supercompilers (see Info-Ops 2)</li>
</ul>            </div>
                    </div>

</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>Each feed is <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhnrss.org%2Fnewest">valid RSS</a> served over <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=hnrss.org">HTTPS</a>.</p>
<h3 id="firehose-feeds">Firehose Feeds</h3>
<p>The “firehose” feeds contain all new posts and comments as they appear on Hacker News:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest
https://hnrss.org/newcomments
</pre>
<p>For just the posts that have appeared on the front page:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/frontpage
</pre>
<p>If the firehose feeds are a bit too noisy for you, <a href="#activity-parameters">read below</a> on filtering them with the <code>points</code> and/or <code>comments</code> parameters.</p>
<h3 id="search-feeds">Search Feeds</h3>
<p>You can get a feed of new posts and/or comments containing keywords by using the <code>q=KEYWORD</code> parameter. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?q=Django
https://hnrss.org/newcomments?q=WordPress
</pre>
<p>If you want a single search feed but multiple keywords, separate the keywords with " OR ":</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?q=git+OR+linux
</pre>
<h3 id="reply-feeds">Reply Feeds <sup>new</sup></h3>
<p>Keep an eye on replies to your comments:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/replies?id=jerf
</pre>
<p>Use a comment ID to follow replies to a particular comment:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/replies?id=17752464
</pre>
<h3 id="self-post-feeds">Self Post Feeds</h3>
<p>Ask HN, Show HN, and polls are available:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/ask
https://hnrss.org/show
https://hnrss.org/polls
</pre>
<h3 id="job-feeds">Job Feeds</h3>
<p>Job opportunities from YC funded startups:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/jobs
</pre>
<p>Top level comments in threads created by the whoishiring bot:</p>
<pre># Comments from "Who is hiring?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/jobs

# Comments from "Who wants to be hired?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/hired

# Comments from "Freelancer? Seeking freelancer?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/freelance

# All of the above
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring
</pre>
<p><span>new</span> If you’re interested in something in particular, you can apply a <code>q=KEYWORD</code> parameter to only return relevant comments. For example, filter the top-level “Who is hiring?” comments to only those containing “React Native”:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/jobs?q=React+Native
</pre>
<h3 id="user-feeds">User Feeds</h3>
<p>If you don’t want to miss a post or comment by a given user, you can subscribe to that user’s feed:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/submitted?id=USERNAME # posts
https://hnrss.org/threads?id=USERNAME   # comments
https://hnrss.org/user?id=USERNAME      # everything
</pre>
<h3 id="thread-feeds">Thread Feeds</h3>
<p>A feed of new comments on a particular post can be found at:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/item?id=THREAD_ID
</pre>
<p>With <code>THREAD_ID</code> the numerical ID found in the URL when viewing the comments page.</p>
<h3 id="feed-options">Feed Options</h3>
<p>You can modify any feed’s output using URL parameters. Multiple parameters can be applied at the same time by joining them with an ampersand.</p>
<h4 id="activity-parameters">Activity Parameters</h4>
<p>You can apply a <code>points=N</code> or <code>comments=N</code> parameter to any feed to filter the results so only entries with more than N points or comments are shown:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?points=100
https://hnrss.org/ask?comments=25
</pre>
<p>You can also combine both parameters:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/show?points=100&amp;comments=25
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>/newcomments</code> <a href="https://github.com/algolia/hn-search/issues/55#issuecomment-73599729">does not work</a> with a <code>points=N</code> parameter.</p>
<h4 id="search-parameter">Search Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, searches on posts only look at titles. If you want to search against the submitted URLs themselves, use the <code>search_attrs</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre># Search for posts with "WordPress" in the title only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the URL only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=url

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the title or URL
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=title,url

# Don't restrict search attributes at all. This searches for posts
# containing 'WordPress' in all attributes indexed by Algolia. This was
# the behavior of searches prior to June 3, 2015
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=default
</pre>
<h4 id="link-parameter">Link Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, the RSS <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element points to the submitted article’s URL. The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element can be changed to point to the Hacker News comment page by appending <code>link=comments</code> to the end of the URL. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?link=comments</pre>
<h4 id="description-parameter">Description Parameter</h4>
<p>You can disable the <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> element entirely by passing the <code>description=0</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?description=0</pre>
<h4 id="count-parameter">Count Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, feeds return 20 RSS items. This can be increased via the <code>count=N</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?count=50</pre>
<p>There is a hardcoded limit of 100 entries, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h4 id="feed-formats">Feed Formats <sup>new</sup></h4>
<p>By default, feeds come back as RSS. But if you add “.atom” or “.jsonfeed” to any endpoint you’ll receive the contents in <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html">Atom</a> or <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>, respectively.</p>
<pre># The front page as Atom
https://hnrss.org/frontpage.atom

# "Ask HN" with 10 or more comments as JSON Feed
https://hnrss.org/ask.jsonfeed?comments=10
</pre>
<p>Note: These formats are a lot less battle-tested than the RSS format. If you see any wonkiness or they don’t play nicely with your feed reader, please <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss/issues/new">open an issue</a> with as much information as possible. Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> for providing their <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api">REST API</a>. Without it, hnrss.org simply would not exist.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jaredandrews">Jared Andrews</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss/pull/23">PR</a> that created the /whoishiring/ endpoints.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/grantjenks">Grant Jenks</a> for the idea of adding the Article URL and Points to the description.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cagrimmett">Chuck Grimmett</a> for being a sounding board when it comes to adding new features to hnrss.org as well as suggesting the /jobs endpoint.</p>
<p>And many, many thanks to all those who have donated in support of the project over the years. You all mean the world to me.</p>
<h2 id="colophon">Colophon</h2>
<p>hnrss.org is served by nginx on DigitalOcean. HTTPS is provided by Let’s Encrypt. DNS is provided by Namecheap.</p>
<p>As of September 2018, the feeds are generated using the <a href="https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/">Gin</a> web framework. From May 2014 to August 2018, the feeds were generated using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web framework.</p>
<h2 id="repositories">Repositories</h2>
<p>A brief primer on the various repositories that make up hnrss.org:</p>
<p>When hnrss.org was created in May 2014, code and documentation lived inside the <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> repository.</p>
<p>In April 2017, the documentation was revamped, migrated into Hugo, and was given its own repository at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The built assets were copied into the <code>docs/</code> folder on <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> and published at <a href="https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/">https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/</a>.</p>
<p>In August/September 2018, hnrss.org underwent a rewrite from Flask to Gin. This new code lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p>So, as of September 2018, that’s the state of play. The documentation source lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The Gin source that powers hnrss.org lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> contains the Flask code that powered the site from May 2014 to August 2018 as well as the <code>docs/</code> folder that contains the built HTML copied from <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>.</p>
<p>At some point I’d like to simplify all of this and run everything out of one repository, but it’ll do for now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AWS SDK maintains and publishes SDK for over 110+ services with simultaneous and multiple updates on all SDKs each day. They have achieved what interestingly all big companies strive for, launching new APIs seamlessly and effortlessly. During AWS’s flagship entertainment packed conference <strong>“Re</strong><strong>:Invent</strong><strong>,</strong> the SDKs are updated with new APIs that were just announced in less than 2 hours for the world to use.</p><p>To interact with any of AWS services you need to use a AWS SDK in either python, JAVA or any other language your software is in.</p><p>I have been an engineer in the PHP SDK for AWS which is open-sourced on Github and anyone can look at the code published by the AWS teams. AWS manages over 8 SDKs including SDK for <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java">JAVA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby">ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3">python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js">javascript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php">PHP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go">go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp">C++</a> and few other languages.</p><p>Generally, it requires a significant number of engineers to manage just one SDK. To make sure all APIs and features are available across all SDKs is a big feat. In this post, we are going to talk about how to scale the SDK and how AWS is able to achieve perfect synchronicity across all SDKs without sloshing the SDKs team with manually updating each SDK.</p><h2>How does the AWS SDK works?</h2><p>All of the SDKs have two parts one is the core and another one has all the service-specific code. The core of the SDK handles various features such as “Signing each request using AWS’s Sigv4 protocol”, security features, SSL handling, multi-threading, asynchronous requests, waiters, paginators, and a ton more features.</p><p>The other part of each SDK is based on “model” files specific to each service. All model files are exactly similar across each SDK.</p><p>The difference is very evident in AWS’s python SDK which is divided into two different repositories “boto” and “botocore”.</p><p>All the model files are built on <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenApi</a> protocol to some extent and are compatible with <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> API Protocols.</p><p>Here is a JSON definition for DynamoDB in AWS PHP SDK with name “<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/blob/master/src/data/dynamodb/2012-08-10/api-2.json">api-2.json</a>” and &nbsp;the exact same file also exists in Boto SDK as well with name “<a href="https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/develop/botocore/data/dynamodb/2012-08-10/service-2.json">service-2.json</a>“</p><p>At AWS each service will release these JSON model files which specify all information related to each API &amp; service. Each SDK handles these files a bit differently as compared to other SDKs. PHP SDK loads these JSON files dynamically in each client to allow various APIs while JAVA SDK will pre-build each of these methods into concrete classes.</p><p>Each AWS team maintains and releases these service-specific model file, which are then consumed by each SDK team in the way they would like.</p><h2>Show Me The Code!</h2><p>I am sure these look like magic to you like it looked to me when I first saw it. So let’s dig into the code. We will look at PHP SDK example as that is team I was part of for over a year and know in and out of the SDK.</p><p>We will look at the AWS Lambda’s invoke method.</p><pre><code>"Invoke":{
      "name":"Invoke",
      "http":{
        "method":"POST",
        "requestUri":"/2015-03-31/functions/{FunctionName}/invocations"
      },
      "input":{"shape":"InvocationRequest"},
      "output":{"shape":"InvocationResponse"},
      "errors":[
        {"shape":"ServiceException"},
        {"shape":"ResourceNotFoundException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidRequestContentException"},
        {"shape":"RequestTooLargeException"},
        {"shape":"UnsupportedMediaTypeException"},
        {"shape":"TooManyRequestsException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidParameterValueException"},
        {"shape":"EC2UnexpectedException"},
        {"shape":"SubnetIPAddressLimitReachedException"},
        {"shape":"ENILimitReachedException"},
        {"shape":"EC2ThrottledException"},
        {"shape":"EC2AccessDeniedException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidSubnetIDException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidSecurityGroupIDException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidZipFileException"},
        {"shape":"KMSDisabledException"},
        {"shape":"KMSInvalidStateException"},
        {"shape":"KMSAccessDeniedException"},
        {"shape":"KMSNotFoundException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidRuntimeException"}
      ]
    }</code></pre><p>The above API is expecting an “InvocationRequest” object and returns a “InvocationResponse” object.</p><p>This is how the “InvocationRequest” is defined.</p><pre><code>"InvocationRequest":{
      "type":"structure",
      "required":["FunctionName"],
      "members":{
        "FunctionName":{
          "shape":"NamespacedFunctionName",
          "location":"uri",
          "locationName":"FunctionName"
        },
        "InvocationType":{
          "shape":"InvocationType",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Invocation-Type"
        },
        "LogType":{
          "shape":"LogType",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Log-Type"
        },
        "ClientContext":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Client-Context"
        },
        "Payload":{"shape":"Blob"},
        "Qualifier":{
          "shape":"Qualifier",
          "location":"querystring",
          "locationName":"Qualifier"
        }
      },
      "payload":"Payload"
    }</code></pre><p>This is the response object.</p><pre><code> "InvocationResponse":{
      "type":"structure",
      "members":{
        "StatusCode":{
          "shape":"Integer",
          "location":"statusCode"
        },
        "FunctionError":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Function-Error"
        },
        "LogResult":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Log-Result"
        },
        "Payload":{"shape":"Blob"},
        "ExecutedVersion":{
          "shape":"Version",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Executed-Version"
        }
      },
      "payload":"Payload"
    },</code></pre><p>The PHP SDK auto-generates code for each of these request and response object and here how the code would look:</p><pre><code>$result = $client-&gt;invoke(array(
    // FunctionName is required
    'FunctionName' =&gt; 'string',
    'InvocationType' =&gt; 'string',
    'LogType' =&gt; 'string',
    'ClientContext' =&gt; 'string',
    'Payload' =&gt; 'mixed type: string|resource|\Guzzle\Http\EntityBodyInterface',
    'Qualifier' =&gt; 'string',
));</code></pre><p>Even the docs are automatically generated from the model files.</p><p>So the various SDK team will not need to write any code “manually” at all for any of these service updates. The service teams,( in this case, AWS Lambda) just needs to make sure that the model file they are creating is error free. The SDK will be able to auto-generate any updates to existing clients as well as auto-generating code for new APIs and services.</p><p>The best part of the SDK team is that is is completely open-sources and is directly integrated into various AWS services.</p><p>API Gateway allows you to deploy Swagger (also knows as OpenAPI Standards) models and then use the APIs to directly generate SDKs with all the features that are already inbuilt into the AWS SDKs.</p><p>I hope this will prove helpful in designing your SDKs for your services. In any SDK the focus should be on creating a model file that is compliant with “OpenApi” standards. By having a standard model for APIs, it will get super easy and fast to launch various SDKs in various languages with very little development time.</p><div><div><div><p><a href="https://dailyjag.com/profile/admin/" rel="author"> <img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33563973b6f338002e574f30a3f94788?s=80&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33563973b6f338002e574f30a3f94788?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="80" width="80"> </a></p><div> <p><span>  </span> <span> <span>Member since</span> <time datetime="2019-02-25 10:02"> August 16, 2011 </time> </span></p></div></div><p><span>I am an android developer, hacker, web developer, professional blogger and a complete tech freak.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>February 2015</h3><p>I was working for a startup based in Jerusalem called Curiyo. Back then I had a nice routine: I wake up around 6 am, go to the gym with my buddy, come back to my room to take a shower, eat a bowl of salad and then leave for work. I get to work around 9 am, leave around 5 to meet friends, hang out, or do whatever activity I was planning for that evening.</p><p>In September of the same year, I went on my first trip abroad. I went with my best friend from high school on a 2-week trip to Italy. And as they say, I caught the travel bug. After that trip, all I could think about was planning the next ones and when I could fly again. And since then, I started traveling literally every month.</p><p>One day, I found a blog post about digital nomads and remote work. "This is it, this is what I want!", I said to myself, and the race began to figure out how I could make that happen. A couple of months later, I landed my first remote job with Toptal and signed up for a 3-month trip around southeast Asia (SEA). And in September 2016 -a year after my first trip- I was in Thailand working remotely, enjoying the beach, drinking fresh coconut water, and calling myself a digital nomad.</p><p>"Work hard, play harder": that is the digital nomad slogan. Each day’s schedule looked different from the day before, depending on what I felt like doing or what the group I’m with is planning. In other words, it’s impossible to have a fixed routine, you have to be flexible and dynamic. Otherwise, you will either have to choose between FOMO or doing a shitty job at your work so you don’t miss whatever fun others are having.</p><h3>February 2017</h3><p>After my 3-month trip to SEA, it was time to go back to Jerusalem to see my family and plan the next move. I wasn’t excited to go back, I grew up in Jerusalem and till that point, it’s where I spent all my life. It was so hard and boring after what I’ve experienced, I just came back after spending 3 months in heaven.</p><p>Suddenly there were no more beaches, no more parties, or random strangers to hang out with. There was a lot of free time thatI had no idea what to do with. All I was doing every day was leaving my parents’ house, go to the university campus where I spent five years getting my computer engineering degree, and work till it’s so hard to keep my eyes open.</p><p>I filled all the free time I had with work. I created an outsource web development company with a friend and worked 14h a day 7 days a week, I became a workaholic. I was hoping that by creating a successful business I will have the means to escape my city and move elsewhere to go back to the heavenly life I had for a short period.</p><p>After 3 months of long days and restless nights mishmash, I realized that wasn’t what I wanted. Of course, I still wanted to build my own business, but I didn’t like the path I was taking. And one day I found myself writing this:</p><p>I woke up late, as usual, tried to open my exhausted eyelids. I had skipped the usual question “What’s the plan for today?” and left my bed. It has been almost 3 months since the last time I answered that question, after the first week of going back to Jerusalem it was the same day repeating itself over and over again. Wake up, go to the university campus, meet the same people, and work for 12-14 hours.</p><p>Everything was the same that day except one thing, one thought. When suddenly I found myself shouting out loud to myself “Oh shit, I’m not happy, FUCK!” after a voice inside my head asked: “Are you happy?”. The answer was obviously no. I just realized I was on auto-pilot and forgot to ask myself such a trivial question. “If you are not happy, what is the point?” I kept asking myself for the rest of the day.</p><p>Work was just my way to escape reality and fill my free time. All that made me wonder: do I have to bury myself in work and live miserably now so that my future self can be happy?&nbsp;</p><p>Probably many of you will say “yes”, or maybe you will hesitate a bit before saying “no”. But that doesn’t change the fact that it is actually what we all do somehow. All of us work hard today hoping that tomorrow, next week, next month, or a year from now we will be happy, satisfied, and fulfilled.</p><p>This led me to another question that has changed everything: <strong>what is the point of chasing big dreams and goals if I'm not enjoying the way to get there?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I didn’t have a clear answer to this question so, in a way or another, my answer was <strong>procrastination</strong>. On one side, I wanted to build a business and create great things. On the other side, I didn’t want to work (hard) on anything as long as I don’t know how to be happy while doing it!</p><h3>June 2017</h3><p>After several months and hustling paperwork, I moved to Germany, and my digital nomad life was on again. Since then, I’ve spent the last 3+ years, traveling around the world, exploring, having fun, and creating memories. I was living the dream that many people dream of. A was living a life with no routine whatsoever, wake up whenever I want, work whenever I want, and tomorrow is always an unplanned adventure.</p><p>You can say everything was perfect, but still, the old dream was bugging me, I want to build and create a successful business, my own business. I never liked the idea of working for someone and trading my time for money. And between fun and procrastination, I was trying to build stuff and bootstrap ideas, but things were always falling between the cracks. With a lifestyle like that, it’s really hard to say no to the sunny beach outside and go work 10 hours on a side project. So as a result, procrastination became my new lifestyle.</p><h3>March 2020</h3><p>I left Mexico for a 2-week trip to San Francisco, I had a lot of traveling planned for this year. Things would have stayed on the same path as before for at least another couple of years if it wasn’t for COVID-19.<br></p><p>Two weeks into the pandemic, I found myself without work and without anything else to do. No travel, no friends around, nothing. This time, I didn’t only have a lot of free time, but all my time became free time. History got a chance to repeat itself, and I had a decision to make. Do I want to re-live 2017 all over again? Do I want to keep myself busy with side projects and endless work?&nbsp;<br></p><p>The feeling from 3 years ago was still fresh in my memory that I didn’t want to fall into that trap again. That was an opportunity I had to take advantage of. I was living alone with no distraction of any kind, It was a chance to rediscover myself and what I really want.</p><p>My goal was to bootstrap a business while having a work life balance. I didn’t want to spend 14 hours on my laptop and feel like it was sucking the life out of me. I believed it was possible to bootstrap without falling into the workaholism swamp.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0eb03257a01af20a5e4_iZLNJNTTrlnhbqu6GYvnavIObyReSuyqU1-_DJxGfOeSpFmF8hzwy3AryXXXt0pxgt7dn0EkcqU2AAEDMG8i5AS7HAfEUP0GlsyIOdpqtN07TOSJopLFwNzxQ3HwUjMJw5YSN36s.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Earlier this year I was somewhere on the bottom left side. To shift toward the right I had to deal with my procrastination problem. Since nothing I’ve tried before worked for me, I decided to learn everything I can about the subject and challenge myself to write a book about it, this book! I’m trying to prove to myself (and others) that it’s possible to live in the middle, a place where you can be productive and happy.</p><p><strong>“A bird in the hand is worth t̶w̶o̶ ten in the bush”</strong></p><p>My best friend, who is running an online business with ~$300k ARR, is on the opposite side of the curve. He is the most dedicated hard working person I know, but he’s not happy. When I asked him about it, he said he doesn’t believe it’s possible to have that balance. For him, you can’t be productive (grow fast enough) and happy at the same time. His goal is to have a big stable business by age 40 so he can relax and enjoy life then.</p><p>I don’t want that, I don't want to build a business if my happiness is the price. I don't want to live on 30% happiness for the promise that my future self will be 100% in five or ten years. It's not only that 100% happiness is not realistic, but I also believe my future self will still be stuck on the same hamster wheel convincing himself that he needs another 5 years to get to the imaginary perfect happiness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0edf9a94c0bc0e6cd9f_Ngrb7PW6OqzpCoN3VZ8zAT8vHN_BKz_ZRkF_1Ze-89S6gTlwS6qyz89AWZIy-r5M6aleCzSf5xq-qp0OG1qkgdq14HcQdSlY1F6TkBny8CtjNETh2sdP4f0dgcuKCAnqFIVf3wiu.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Workaholism will blind you, you no longer see the big picture, you have no time to think and re-think, and you work for the sake of the work itself. And without a proper system and regular stops where you pause to double-check where you are heading, the wheel will just spin faster and faster until it eventually spits you out and throws you against the wall.</p><p>I know, sometimes you have something you are so excited about and it doesn’t feel like work. But pure excitement doesn’t last forever. Eventually, you will have to work on other boring and less exciting parts of your project. And once that initial excitement fades away, you either quit or close your eyes and hit the gas pedal to become a workaholic zombie.</p><p>However, life is not easy and you can’t always accomplish things while relaxing and taking it easy. Sometimes you have no other option but to push so hard, for days, weeks, or even months. The problem starts when you have no idea when you are going to lift your foot off the gas pedal to look around and see where you are going and check if you should make a turn and change directions.</p><p>So let’s glue all pieces together. A Procrastinator has this <strong>Instant Gratification Monkey (1)</strong> who wants immediate rewards, to have fun, and enjoy the moment without giving a shit about the future. A workaholic has a <strong>Panic Monster (2)</strong> who wants to work so hard and sacrifice everything today so you can be happy tomorrow.</p><p>The answer to the question: “How do you chase big dreams and without depriving yourself happiness?” is the same answer to the question: “Where could your instant gratification monkey meet your panic monster?” You need both.The monkey is as important as the monster, we’ll see that in the chapter “The Productive Procrastinator”. While in other chapters, we try to find that meeting point, as the sole purpose of this book is not to help you just be a productive person but a <strong>happy</strong> productive person.</p><p>1,2:&nbsp;originally presented in Tim Urban's <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html">blog post</a></p><p>‍<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5ef900053c15adf3558a9fb8_1*Bx1xIfh3q-_hY0LzmbLePg.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>📕 This chapter is …</p></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Once you start working with international clients you'll run into many issues you will never experience when contracting for clients in the same country.</p><p>Language barriers, time zone differences or different cultures which could lead to different styles of communicating or different expectations to name just a few. </p><p>But the biggest one might be accepting payments. Cross-border payments are usually costly (both in fees and unfavorable exchange rates), take a long time to be processed and are sometimes even just hard to make as it's not a very common use case for most business owners. There's also different laws, taxes and payment methods.</p><p>The pandemic has made remote work a lot more common and many freelancers now have to deal with this new set of problems.</p><p>I have been working remotely since 2016 and worked for clients all over the world, used dozens of payment methods and dealt with both major and smaller currencies and want to share what I've learned over this period in terms of accepting payments.</p><p>Before we start, it's important to know there's no single best option as each situation is different. Payment frequency, invoice size, where each party is incorporated and many other variables might play a role in which payment method is best for your situation.</p><p>That being said, in every situation we want the same things. Make it easy for the client to pay you, make it easy for yourself to receive the money and do both of these in a timely and inexpensive way.</p><h2 id="international-bank-transfers">International Bank Transfers</h2><p>By far the most common payment method for domestic payments is to use a wire transfer. This works well for domestic payments but is very expensive and slow for cross-border payments.</p><p>Most banks charge a flat fee for processing international transfers but will also convert the money from the client's currency to yours at an exchange rate that is more expensive for you than the actual current exchange rate. My post about <a href="https://blog.jurn.io/international-payments-freelancers/">international transfers</a> explains the hidden costs of these payments more in-depth.</p><p>So before you ask your clients to transfer the money to your account, check with your bank what fees and exchange rates they use for the transfer. Some banks also give you the option to open a foreign currency account, if you regularly take payments in the same currency this could save you a lot in currency exchange fees.</p><h3 id="transferwise">TransferWise</h3><p>One of the best alternatives I found is to use <a href="https://transferwise.com/invite/u/joernv2">TransferWise</a>. TransferWise allows you to hold and accept multiple currencies and have local bank details in many different countries. You can then transfer the money you received at the mid-market exchange rate into your own currency and pay it out to your own bank account with low fixed fees.</p><p>Your client can thus transfer the payment to a local bank account like they would normally do for domestic payments. You can exchange this at a much better rate than banks would offer you and withdraw it to your own bank account for a low and transparent fixed fee.</p><p>This method offers the advantages of bank transfers without the downsides and has in my experience been both the cheapest and best way to accept payments for most situations.</p><p>If you are your client are in a country that is not supported by TransferWise you can also use <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/">Payoneer</a> which works in a very similar way and supports more countries around the world, albeit with higher fees than TW offers.</p><h2 id="credit-cards">Credit Cards</h2><p>Another very common payment method and one that is incredibly easy to pay with for your clients, credit cards.</p><p>Using online payment processors like Stripe, you can easily create an invoice along with a payment link where you client can pay using their credit card. The fees are pretty high, 3.4%+$0.50 per successful card charge and an additional 2% fee is applied if currency conversion is required so you have to be willing to accept high fees for speed and convenience.</p><p>Accepting credit cards is usually only worth it if you sent lots of small invoices and want a convenient way for you clients to pay these. </p><h2 id="paypal">PayPal</h2><p>PayPal was one of the pioneers in the payments industry but I'd strongly recommend using another option whenever possible. </p><p>Accepting payments via PayPal is easy. You can quickly generate a payment link for the client to sent with your invoice and you can easily create a PayPal account, no matter what country you are located in.</p><p>Unfortunately, their fees are very high (both the fixed fees and the currency conversion cost) and they are known for arbitrarily holding funds without good reason. Which they are allowed to do under their own ToC for up to 6 months(!).</p><p>If some of the better payment methods aren't available to you, PayPal might be the best option you have available but for most people it's probably better to steer clear of them. Even banks usually offer a better exchange rate than PayPal does.</p><h2 id="checks">Checks</h2><p>Most people outside of the US probably have never used a check to receive or make a payment so this could be quite a shock when your US client offers you to pay you using one.</p><p>My advice is to avoid these at all costs and talk to your client about setting up an alternative payment method. </p><p>Most non-US banks do not even have the option to cash these out and if they do it's very expensive. Checks, especially international ones, take a long time to arrive after they are mailed to you, they might get lost in the mail or sent to the wrong address, you (likely) need to mail these to your bank once you receive the check to cash it out and you still have to pay the unfavorable exchange rate.</p><p>In my personal experience, it will take around 4-6 weeks in total before the money from the client arrives in your account and you'll pay a very high fee for it.</p><p>Luckily these are becoming less common and I've head the good fortune of not having to deal with one of these for 2 years already.</p><h2 id="escrow">Escrow</h2><p>Escrow transfers are usually only worth it for selling big-ticket items where you need to transfer digital assets such as a domain. The fees are very high but it removes a lot of the risk when you work with a client that you haven't built up any trust with. </p><p>You should view Escrow as taking out an insurance, you accept a higher fee for less risk.</p><h2 id="cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</h2><p>Last time I wrote an article about cross-border payments <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22854120">some people commented</a> that crypto was the obvious solution here as there is no currency conversion and the transfer fees are very low. </p><p>I'd figure it's best to address this head-on this time; Although I love the concept of cryptocurrency, it's just not practical to use it for most freelancers. </p><p>Unless you work for a very high-tech startup, it's extremely unlikely someone in the company knows how to use one of these cryptocurrencies or will get permission to buy crypto and transfer it.</p><p>They are also extremely volatile, even though the transfer fees or currency exchange fees of conventional payment methods will cost you more, I have also never lost 10% of my company's liquid assets in a few minutes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>As remote freelancers we are spoiled for choice nowadays and we have many different options to use depending on what situation we find ourselves in.</p><p>I have used every single option I discussed in the article and they all have their own pros and cons. There is no "one size fits all" solution here and you'll need to do some research to see what works best for the type of business that you run.</p><p>I've found that for my situation I most often end up using TransferWise to accept payment, convert the currency and deposit it to the bank account where my company is incorporated. </p><p>Whether this works best for you is something you will need to research for yourself based on your company and location.</p>

<p>Hello! 👋 My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>In short, I am a company of one. I answer the customer support emails and I code and deploy new features. I also manage the <a href="https://developers.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">API docs</a> and <a href="https://support.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">knowledge base</a>, poke around the logs when there are issues, write the <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/sample_newsletter" target="_blank">bi-monthly newsletters</a> and I designed the logo!</p>

<p>As the company scales, so too must all aspects of my work which I break down into 4 parts: customer support, engineering, product and marketing.</p>

<p><strong>Finding opportunities for process optimization is honestly one of the more fun parts of running a business</strong>. I greatly attribute these to how I’ve been able to stay both solo &amp; sane up until now, currently with 600+ users and $45,000 ARR. In this post, I’m excited to share some of my most successful strategies along with anecdotes from my experience working on Lunch Money.</p>



<p>In the last 14 days, here’s what I got done across all departments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Launched an internal beta testers program and two sets of new features to test</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Wrapped up a 2-week long refactor of some core components on the client-side</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Launched a major feature: advanced transaction filters</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Closed 13 tickets related to feature improvements and bug fixes</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Sent out a newsletter outlining the latest new features</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This blog post</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Added new pages to the marketing site (<a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/rules">Rules</a> and <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/collaboration">Collaboration</a>) and updated the icons in <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features">Features</a></li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Received 239 inbound support tickets and sent out 358 emails</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes all this work bearable for me is the fact that there is so much variety (which, of course, is the spice of life!). I love being able to switch between tasks to keep the job interesting and my mind refreshed while still being productive overall.</p>

<p><em>Case in point: I just finished a major refactor and pushed out 2 major features to beta, so writing this blog post right now feels like a vacation for my brain.</em></p>

<p>To state the obvious, I enjoy being hyper-efficient (without burning myself out, of course). Even though I am a single person, I can still automate, optimize and parallelize processes.</p>



<h2 id="implement-safeguards">Implement safeguards</h2>

<p><i>Ah, the blissful beginnings of Lunch Money when I’d push code directly to production several times a day.</i></p>

<p>At 500+ users now, those days are long gone and I’ve since needed to adopt the more boring but responsible approach of implementing safeguards to prevent shipping faulty code.</p>

<p>For one, <b>I’ve been thoroughly reviewing my own code before every change</b>. Every major feature, improvement and bug fix lives in a feature branch that I still, by habit from the corporate days, prepend with <code>jen/</code>. After verifying everything works great locally, I make sure to take a break first, whether that’s working on a completely unrelated task, going for a meal or going to bed. The point of this is to ensure that I’m code reviewing with a clear head.</p>

<p>While adhering to these standards of code reviewing myself may add extra time to my overall process, it potentially saves hours of bug-fixing, answering related support tickets and self-loathing (I’m half-kidding here) down the line if I accidentally ship bad code.</p>

<center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New phase of Lunch Money– no more pushing major features straight to production 🤯😂 <a href="https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L">https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L</a></p>— Jen (@lunchbag) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchbag/status/1256987437600927744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2020</a></blockquote> </center>

<p><b>I also recently implemented an internal beta-testing program open to Lunch Money subscribers.</b> With more users accessing my app on a regular basis, the stakes are higher to ship a version that’s as bug-free as possible.</p>

<p>As an engineering team of one, it’s nearly impossible to always get it right the first time, despite having tests (what if I missed an edge case?) or testing locally extensively (how I think my users will use a feature is not always so).</p>

<p>The beta-testing program has provided some additional benefits. It’s nice to have a cohort of users with whom I can have a more candid conversation about Lunch Money and it’s also a great way to show users that their feedback is valued!</p>

<h2 id="automate-later-than-you-need-to">Automate later than you need to</h2>

<p>While automating tasks can save a lot of time in the long-term, it doesn’t always make sense to automate right off the bat.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"><span>Obligatory XKCD comic (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/" target="_blank">link</a>)</span></p>

<p>Automating too late is not a bad thing. I’ll have done the manual work enough times to understand how to eventually automate the task and what edge cases to look out for. I equate it to doing a job yourself before hiring someone– it’s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who you’ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).</p>

<p>I manually triggered the emails for bi-monthly account summaries for months because I wasn’t confident the sending cadence was reasonable. After observing open rates and collecting user feedback, these are now automated to go out on the 5th &amp; 25th of every month.</p>

<p>Something that I’m glad I didn’t spend the time to automate at all was the referral program. If an existing user refers a new user and the new user subscribes to a plan, then both users will receive credit for 1 month.</p>

<p>In the end, the referral program only brought on 11 extra users. It was not a pain at all to manually process rewards for those who did. If I had spent time conjuring up all the edge cases and automating this process, it would not have been worth the time investment.</p>

<h2 id="keep-low-hanging-fruits-in-the-back-pocket">Keep low-hanging fruits in the back pocket</h2>

<p>In my task management system, I use a tag (🍏) to denote which tasks are low-hanging fruits. For the uninitiated, low-hanging fruits are quick tasks that are easy to knock out, such as one-liners or 5-minute fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YP1Jb0JNc7kqFDbdjm/giphy.gif"></p>

<p>I find that keeping these around and tackling them on days when you feel generally unmotivated can really help raise spirits. Still being able to get something completed and shipped is a great way to get out of a slump.</p>



<h2 id="timing-marketing-pushes">Timing marketing pushes</h2>

<p>At Lunch Money, a big part of the business is using the services of Plaid for bank syncing. Plaid charges on a monthly basis which means that if a user signs up on April 30, connects a bank account immediately and doesn’t end up subscribing at the end of their 14-day trial, they will charge me for this user in both April &amp; May’s invoices.</p>

<p>This realization coupled with my intense aversion to paying more than I need to has shaped a lot of practices at Lunch Money.</p>

<p>For one, the data retention policy used to be 30 days which means if your trial ends and you didn’t put in your billing information, your data will be deleted in 30 days. This certainly guarantees that I’ll be overpaying for churned users and is the reason why the data retention policy has since been revised to 5 days.</p>

<p>In total, a user who does not end up subscribing can spend up to 26 days in the Lunch Money system. This comprises of a 14-day trial, the potential for a 1 week trial extension and a 5 day grace period. Assuming enough users connect their bank accounts, the best way to minimize my costs for churned users is to ensure their lifetimes are within one calendar month.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/calendar-1.png"></p>

<p>As a result, I always schedule marketing pushes such as blog posts and product launches in the first few days of the month. When I came to this realization, my next Plaid bill went down for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="merging-marketing-and-engineering-for-a-combo-win">Merging marketing and engineering for a combo win</h2>

<p>Taking this a step further, the perk of having a spike in new users is that their trial periods more-or-less overlap. Usually when a new user signs up, they will poke around the product and maybe send in a bug report, a feature request or another piece of feedback. If I reply and address their feedback by putting in a fix or shipping their requested feature within days, more often than not, they end up converting into a happy customer.</p>

<p>I’ve therefore identified the following cycle to maximize potential conversions from spikes in user signups:</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/gantt-2.png"></p>

<p>After a marketing push, let’s say a product launch, I will see an immediate increase in signups lasting about 3 days and then slowly trailing off.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll start hearing from these new users via support tickets. I prioritize responding to them and I get to work. Showing these users that I’m committed to improving Lunch Money based on their feedback is a great and honest sales tactic.</p>

<p>About 3 days before the initial wave of user trials ends, I wrap up my engineering sprint and send out a newsletter detailing the latest features and improvements. This re-enforces to new users that the product is under continuous development.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a drip campaign that automatically notifies users a few days before their trial expires and on the actual date of expiry. This period of time is when I typically see most users convert 🤞.</p>



<p>I used to think that if I were to hire someone, it would first be a customer support agent but I’ve since been moving away from that idea. Users are constantly surprised (in a good way!) when they realize the founder is responding to their bug reports or feature requests directly.</p>

<p><strong>Consistently providing great customer support is a long-term investment for Lunch Money</strong> as it is undoubtedly a great way to turn customers into champions. As I receive and respond to support tickets, I’m also able to identify and overhaul the common sources of trouble for users.</p>

<p>I’ve always believed that customer support would be the most important and the hardest part of the business to scale, especially if I have the goal of staying a company of one.</p>

<p>Corroborating data from <a href="https://emailmeter.com/">EmailMeter</a> and my database, it seems my changes are making a difference. Despite a growing user base, inbound support emails remain fairly steady!</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/screen-shot-2020-05-21-at-4-20-15-pm.png"><span>Handling support on my own should be sustainable at least for the foreseeable future!</span></p>

<h2 id="how-do-support-tickets-work-at-lunch-money">How do support tickets work at Lunch Money?</h2>

<p>A feedback button is located at the bottom right corner of every page. Clicking on it opens up a text area wherein users can submit feature requests, questions, bug …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p><em>This post is the second in a four-part blog series by Peter Zaitsev, Percona Chief Executive Officer.</em></p>
<p>In this series, we are talking about Linux performance measurement, how to measure it right. Linux performance is a very broad topic, so we’ll focus on the four primary resources which are typically going to drive your system performance – obviously CPU, memory, disk storage, and network.</p>
<p>Other parts in this series include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-cpu/">Measuring Linux Performance: CPU</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-disk-storage/">Measuring Linux Performance: Disk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-memory/">Measuring Linux Performance: Memory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-network/">Measuring Linux Performance: Network</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of the disk, there are actually two things you have to take care of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disk space</strong> – simple, right? You don’t want to run out of disk space.</li>
<li>And disk as <strong>I/O performance</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disk-space">Disk Space</h2>
<p>Starting from the simple tool – disk space.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people who do not understand the difference between size, the file length, and the disk usage. So, in this case, I created a test file of 16 gigabytes, but if you look at <code>du</code>, it only takes 4 kilobytes, because that is a sparse file, which is one giant 16-gigabyte hole.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image1.jpg" alt="Example of disk size/filesize" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Of course, you’re not likely to see this kind of a difference in the real world but you can, because there are a number of systems using sparse files for different things.</p>
<p>For example, in MySQL, due to some of the table compression that is used there may be a big difference between disk space used vs. file length that may be substantially different.</p>
<h2 id="io-performance">I/O performance</h2>
<p>Now when you speak about the disk I/O performance standpoint, you need to consider a number of things here.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is <strong>IOPS</strong> - how much it can do in the bandwidth. They are not quite replaceable, both can be the bottleneck, especially when it comes to the network-attached storage or slower buses. For example, it can be noticed that all SATA SSDs exactly deliver 500 megabytes a second because the SSDs are so fast, but SATA buses are so slow in this case, so that is the limit out there.</p>
<p>You also need to understand <strong>the different types of loads the disk reads, writes, or fsyncs</strong> , because we do have different latency and load implication.</p>
<p>In addition, your load concurrency is often referred to as a <strong>Queue Depth</strong> when it comes to the disk because concurrency is how many requests the system can process in parallel when big throughput is achieved that it is actually typical.</p>
<p>So, from typical mistakes: <em>“My Iostat Disk Utilization number has reached 100%"</em>. I have seen so many times this kind of being so much scared about this 100% when <em>“there is no way to go! Oh my gosh!"</em></p>
<p>The reality is that your <code>iostat</code> utilization number <strong>means the percent of the time when at least one I/O request was outstanding</strong>. It may make sense again for a single spinning drive in the last decade or last millennia, but it doesn’t really make sense for common storage we use those days.</p>
<p>It does not make sense for SSDs, it doesn’t make sense for RAIDs, it doesn’t make sense for NAS, it doesn’t make sense for cloud storage because they are very good at processing multiple requests at a time.</p>
<p>Performance, the latency at least, would not be impacted.</p>
<p>The points that should be highlighted here:</p>
<h3 id="1-separating-read-and-write-latency">1. Separating read and write latency</h3>
<p>Depending on your system, the difference between read and write latency may be very significant. Some systems actually have varied read latency, some have better write latency. In this case, what I do is compare their current latency to their kind of average latency, which you’ve seen on this system over the last period of time, so I can understand relatively easily that it’s abnormal.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image2.png" alt="Disk I/O latency" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p><em>Comparing Current Latency to Historic Latency can help to see when the latency is abnormal</em></p>
<h3 id="2-the-disk-load-that-also-can-be-the-average-disk-use">2. The disk load, that also can be the average disk use</h3>
<p>It means how many requests are going on at the same time. Because if you’re really saturating your disks, queuing happens, and when this thing typically becomes quite high you should know what exactly your storage is expected to be able to optimally handle.</p>
<p>The problem is of course if you think about cloud storage, you don’t really know what the optimal concurrency is. They don’t tell you and that’s going to be implementation-dependent, which can change at any point any time.</p>
<p>

<h3 id="3-biolatency-block-device-latency">3. Biolatency: Block Device Latency</h3>
<p>The next thing is a biolatency, which again you can get from eBPF. You do not need to look at just the average latency, you can look at the distribution which can be done on an I/O device.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image4.png" alt="Block device latency distribution" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>eBPF also has some tools where you can look at that on a file system level that is more interesting because that is where you can also see your cache efficiency as well as you can look at some more of the outliers.</p>
<p>So, this is the tool for ext4 and also one for XFS and some other common file systems.</p>

<![CDATA[A Few Catchy Philosophy Quotes That Are Often Misinterpreted]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<h2>1. "Man is a naturally political animal." - Aristotle (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1253a">Politics, Book 1</a>)</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>1. People are drawn to "political associations to satisfy their social needs." (<a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/164">source</a>), or...</p>
<p>2. People enjoy engaging in the ugly parts of politics, or...</p>
<p>3. People are meant to live in cities. (closest to the actual meaning)</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>To Aristotle, the words "natural" and "political" held special meanings that are not equivalent to what we mean today. The result is that this quote is closer in meaning to:</p>

<blockquote>"Human beings have an internal principle that necessarily leads us to collaboration rather than to independence, and as a result we are meant to live in cities."</blockquote>

<p>When we say "natural" today, we typically mean something that is not man-made. To Aristotle, "natural" refers to things that have a "nature":</p>

<blockquote>"within itself a principle of motion and stability in place, in growth and decay, or in alteration" (Aristotle 192b13)</blockquote>

<p>So when Aristotle says that something is "naturally" the case, through a modern lens he's saying something closer to it being the result of the laws of nature.</p>

<p>Second, by "a political animal," it's tempting to conclude that Aristotle simply means "suited for life in a polis" (city) or "conducive to starting a polis." But he goes on to say that "a human being is <span>more of a</span> political animal than is any bee or any gregarious animal [i.e., an animal that lives in a group]" (1253a8, emphasis mine). So Aristotle thinks that some gregarious animals are political animals, but not to the extent that human beings are. It seems unlikely that Aristotle would suggest that bees or gregarious animals are "suited for lives in a polis" to any degree. More likely, by "political," Aristotle means "working toward a common goal" or "collaborative."</p>

<p>Secular, modern readers would likely disagree with Aristotle's next passage. He argues that nature has "given us" the ability to speak and make moral judgments, and nature "does nothing pointlessly," so we are <span>meant</span> to collaborate on our moral judgments. With our modern understanding of evolution, nature doesn't "give us" features, and nature does sometimes do things "pointlessly." However, this is what Aristotle meant when he said we are "naturally political animals." So even if you agree with the actual meaning of the quote, you probably don't agree with Aristotle's reasoning.</p>

<h2>2. "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>When I hear this quote today, I find that people often use it to mean that even if no one observes a fact, it is still true. So it's used as a rhetorical question, with the answer being "of course it makes a sound!"</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>This quote is not directly from any philosophical text, but the question is derived from "A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge" by the Anglican bishop George Berkeley (namesake of UC Berkeley!). Here's the closest section, where Berkeley explains a counterargument and his response:</p>

<blockquote>"But say you, surely there is nothing easier than to imagine Trees, for instance, in a Park... and no Body by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it: But what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your Mind certain Ideas which you call Books and Trees, and the same time omitting to frame the Idea of any one that may perceive them? But do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while?" (<a href="https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/Berkeley/HumanKnowledge/1734/HumKno.pdf">source</a>, pg. 18)</blockquote>

<p>I know that's confusing. Let's break it down. For context, Berkeley's famous phrase "esse est percipi" ("to be is to be perceived") is a summary of his philosophical position that objects as we know them cannot exist without the existence of minds to perceive them. (The gist is that everything we know about the object is known through our minds, so when you remove those characteristics, there's nothing left.)</p>

<p>In the first sentence, Berkeley is paraphrasing an objector who claims they are able to imagine trees that no one is perceiving. But Berkeley points out that the objector is simply thinking of the idea of trees ("certain Ideas which you call Books and Trees"), which only exist because the objector is thinking about them.</p>

<p>Since Berkeley believed in a Christian God, it's not clear whether he thought real objects could possibly exist without any perceiver at all, since God might always be watching. But to a secular reader of Berkeley's arguments, the consequence is that <span>the tree does not make a sound</span>, since sound is a perception, and the existence of a perception depends on the existence of a mind to perceive it.</p>

<h2>3. "God is Dead." (The Gay Science) - Nietzsche</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>This quote might be interpreted as a proclamation of atheism.</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>Nietzsche presented this phrase to a group of atheists, claiming that it was new information for them. So it can't be a statement about atheism.</p>

<p>In this section of "The Gay Science", Nietzsche discusses how many of the underpinnings of Western society, particularly our moral philosophy, implicitly rely on the concept of God. With the rise of philosophical secularism that came with the Enlightenment, we can no longer rely on God to give life meaning and value, and everything that was built on the Christian faith is destined to "collapse" (GS 343). This is what it means for God to be "dead."</p>

			<p><span>I discovered the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/no/book/show/38714658-the-order-of-time">The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli</a> a few years ago and it reignited my interest in Quantum Physics. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/24/carlo-rovelli-the-order-of-time-review">This is the original review that reeled me in. </a>The title caught my attention initially because the focus was on the concept of time. Time is a mysterious topic. It changes in unexpected circumstances, it’s perceived in different ways and scientists still ponder what it actually is. It turns out that time and quantum physics go hand in hand. The book is in three sections; the understanding of time in modern physics, what happens without time and finally the latest theories on time including Rovelli’s own research into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity#:~:text=Quantum%20gravity%20(QG)%20is%20a,effects%20of%20gravity%20are%20strong.">Quantum Gravity</a> which present some of the most recent theories in the field. </span></p>
<p><span>One of the intriguing things was the link between time and heat. As things heat up, thermal agitation increases, which leads to entropy and disorder. This can distinguish the past and the future. There are many surprising assertions about time (at least for me) that I won’t spoil for you.</span></p>
<p><span>The tone of this book is poetic. It’s always in awe of the amazing world we live in. The best part is that it simplifies very difficult concepts into something most people could understand, allowing for greater access. This can only be a good thing for technology research overall. </span></p>
<p><span>As much information as there is about the concept of time and the theories that exist, there are still many open questions. It leaves you feeling small, knowing there is so much we don’t know about our world. And finally, unlike most other science books, there’s only one equation mentioned (good news for some).</span></p>
<p><span>I’ll leave you with <a href="https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/wellbeing/carlo-rovelli-coronavirus-italy-life-death-psychology-419679">something recent by Carlo Rovelli talking about the pandemic reminding us we are only human and encouraging collaboration and science to overcome it.</a></span></p>

<p>Thread dump files tend to span for several hundreds of lines (sometimes a few thousands of lines). It is hard to conceive and assimilate all the information in the thread dump due to its verbosity. Flame Graph generated by <span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fastthread.io/" target="_blank">fastThread</a></span> tool condenses all the information into one single compact flame graph format. It facilitates you to identify hot code paths quickly. In this article, let us learn how to use flame graphs generated by fastThread tool for effective debugging/troubleshooting purposes.</p>



<pre>If you would like to learn how to generate flame graph from java thread dumps, you can refer <a href="https://blog.fastthread.io/2020/06/23/flame-graph-from-java-thread-dump/">to this article</a></pre>



<h2>fastThread Flame graph features</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>Here are key features of the flame graph generated by fastThread application:</p>



<h3>1. Information on Mouse Hover:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Stack traces are represented as a column of boxes, where each box represents a function (a stack frame). On mouse-over of boxes, a tooltip will be displayed. It will show the class name, method name, and line of the code that has been executed. More importantly, it will show the number of threads that are executing this line of code.</p>



<p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em><strong><em>&nbsp; </em></strong></p>



<pre><code>com.buggycompany.framework.concurrent.buyggycompanyCallable.call(buggycompanyCallable.java:82), thread count: 2467)</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Fig: Hovering mouse generates tool tip indicating line of code that is executed</em></strong></p>



<h3>2. Flame Graph Color</h3>



<p>The background color for each box is not significant and is picked at random to be a warm hue. This randomness helps the eye to differentiate boxes, especially for adjacent thin “towers”.</p>



<h3>3. Box width</h3>



<p>The width of each box depends on the thread count. If the width of the box is sufficient, it displays the full function name. If not, either a truncated function name with an ellipsis is shown, or nothing.</p>



<h3>4. Click to zoom</h3>



<p>When a box is clicked, the flame graph zooms horizontally. This reveals more detail and often function names for the child functions.&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[Moving from TypeScript to Rust / WebAssembly]]>
            </title>

<br/>
July 8, 2020 | https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently decided to switch the engine of
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> from TypeScript
to Rust. The application itself is an SPA written in Svelte.
I only switched the logic that updates the game state to Rust.
Here is a summary of my experience with the transition:</p><h2>Isomorphic Architecture</h2><p>One of the advantages of using JavaScript or TypeScript is
that you can run the same code on both client and server.
For <a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a>, this means
that the game state can be updated independently on both sides.
This results in a lag-free experience on the client
while still using the server as the authoritative source of
data.</p><p>With <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> taking off, you can get the same advantage
writing Rust. Instead of pushing client-side code to the server, we push server-side code to the client by compiling Rust
to WebAssembly.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust">Rollup</a>
plugin allows you to import a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file into your
TypeScript codebase, allowing a seamless integration between
Rust and TypeScript code. The dev experience is almost as smooth
as writing TypeScript itself (for example, the browser refreshes
automatically when you change a line of Rust code).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a>
facilitates serialization of Rust structs into JSON objects
and vice-versa.</p><h2>Limitations of TypeScript</h2><p>Coding in TypeScript has been a largely pleasant experience,
but switching to Rust immediately brought to light some of the
limitations of TypeScript.</p><h4>Strict Typing</h4><p>TypeScript is more of a type-hinter than a type-checker.
It primarily ensures that you’re not accessing fields that
you aren’t declaring via the type system (which is quite expressive). It also enables nicer autocomplete for your IDE.</p><p>However, it does not actually ensure that the data you are
manipulating corresponds to the type that you have declared
to represent it. For example, the data might contain <strong>additional fields</strong> or
even <strong>incorrect</strong> values for declared types.</p><h4>Data Validation</h4><p>You have to write data validation code to ensure that you’re
operating on correct data in TypeScript. You get this for
free in Rust, which will throw an error if you parse data
that doesn’t line up with the struct that is to hold it in
memory.</p><h4>Error Handling</h4><p>Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html">pattern matching</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">error handling</a> make it easy to
handle every code path that could result in an error, leading
to very robust code.</p><p>This leads to a great degree of confidence that if it compiles,
it’s probably not going to throw an error at runtime.</p><h2>Performance</h2><h4>WebAssembly is faster than JavaScript</h4><p>The initial rewrite without any performance optimizations
is already faster than the previous TypeScript codebase.
This doesn’t matter too much yet, but
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> will eventually
ship with bots, so the performance will matter once
game trees need to be searched.</p><h4>The Rust server is leaner</h4><p>The multiplayer server receives updates from clients via
WebSockets and then:</p><ul><li>Updates its copy of the game state.</li><li>Broadcasts the client update to other clients.</li></ul><p>The previous server used <a href="https://github.com/websockets/ws">ws</a>, a popular library for NodeJS. The new version uses <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> (Rust), which uses less memory
under the same load.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with the switch. I haven’t really
encountered much resistance from the borrow checker despite
being fairly new to Rust (I come from a C++ background, so
maybe that helps).</p></div></div>]]>

<p><img height="501" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/fc9b27d1ce9c1a803fe76b3cfc1a34f3_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>An artist's rendering of a Seasteading community (c) Ocean Builders</p>

<p>In a palm-fringed, sunny bay in Panama, a revolution is taking place. This is the location of the first SeaPod manufacturing facility, where around 30 single family SeaPods are being pieced together from 3D-printed molds and lifted onto their foundations just over a kilometre from the shoreline.</p>
<p>The plan is that these will be self-sufficient homes that power themselves, produce their own hydroponic food and electricity, handle their own wastewater treatment, and even be fitted with an underwater coral nursery to support marine life. Air and water drones will courier trash, recycling, packages, food delivery and emergency medical support like defibrillators and medicine.</p>
<p>This is not science-fiction. If all goes ahead, by late Fall this year, Linton Bay Marina in Panama will house the first residential seasteading community in the world. </p>
<p>Seasteading, the concept of creating permanent dwellings at sea outside the territory claimed by any government, is not new, but some examples more credible than others. For instance, in the 1960's the founder of The Church of Scientology based much of the group's executive leadership on seasteads, before moving them back to land in the 1970's. In his 1992 book <em>The Millennial Project; Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps,</em> <a title="Marshall Savage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Savage">Marshall Savage</a> discussed building tethered <a title="Artificial island" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_island">artificial islands.</a>  </p>
<p> <img height="501" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/86199cf33beb4e1e21cb4a752200ef37_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Artisanopolis concept for the Seasteading Institute (c) Gabriel Scheare, Luke Lourdes Crowley and Patrick White</p>
<p>But recently the concept has gained traction with a more serious school of thought. In April 2019, the concept of floating cities as a way to cope with rising oceans was included in a presentation by the United Nations program UN-Habitat. In addition, a Dutch pro-choice non-profit named <a href="https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/">Women on Waves</a> uses seasteading as a way to circumnavigate abortion laws, using a commissioned ship that contains a specially constructed mobile clinic, the A-Portable. When WoW visits a country, women make appointments for an abortion or other reproductive health service, and are taken on board the ship. The ship then sails out approximately 12 miles to international waters where Dutch laws are in effect on board ships registered in the Netherlands.<sup id="cite_ref-5"></sup></p>
<p>This particular seastead in Panama is the brainchild of <a href="https://ocean.builders/about/">Ocean Builders</a>, a company co-founded by Silicon Valley bitcoin entrepreneur Chad Elwartowski, former Navy aeronautical engineer Rüdiger Koch and software developer Grant Romundt. This is not the first attempt at creating a long-term residential community. It came close, last year, when Elwartowski and his partner Supranee Thepdet moved into the first floating, octagonal seastead 12 miles off the coast of Phuket, Thailand.</p>
<p>They lived there for around two months, but after a video of them drinking champagne and inviting others to "join their ocean community" was published online, the Royal Thai Navy sent out a crew to remove their seastead as "a threat to Thai sovereignty". Elwartowski and his partner had already fled after a tip-off from a friend. </p>
<p>Two years prior, a floating island building company called <a href="https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/">Blue Frontiers,</a> had signed a memorandum of understanding with French Polynesia to create the first semi-autonomous "seazone" for a prototype in 2017, not least on the grounds of fast-rising sea-levels as a potential life-line to hedge against global warming. But the project was later shelved indefinitely after local protests. </p>
<p><img height="593" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/decd3a2ab1d05af8f8461db5097bbe83_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The seastead that was home to Chad Elwartowski and his partner Supranee Thepdet</p>
<p>This time, in Panama, they have the full support of the government, says Ocean Builders CEO Grant Romundt, over a Zoom call. "We will be working closely with Panama to identify any legal matters related to our floating homes. We wish to pursue a flagging system so that owners of the homes can hold a title and claim ownership of their new home fully backed by the legal system of Panama."</p>
<p>An advertisement on the Ocean Builders website is recruiting people to join the growing community, “entrepreneurs, aquapreneurs, technology enthusiasts, electronics hackers, marine biologists and other people that are passionate about developing new products and services that a city on the ocean would need.” </p>
<p>The 3D printer they are using to create the molds for the homes is huge, 20 feet by 16 feet, to build details down to the millimeter. The current pod design is engineered for 5 meter waves as the pods float about 2.5 meters above the waves, similar to an oil rig. The design for the SeaPods came from Dutch architect Koen Olthuis of Water Studio, an established designer of floating homes. </p>
<p>"We really don't feel waves like a normal boat would which is floating in the turbulent surface of the water, and when we go further out to sea we can scale our designs to withstand larger waves," says Romundt. Ocean Builders is working towards 3D printing the entire floating home which may take years of research and development. In the meantime, SeaPods are molded from 3D printed molds in a combination of plastic and foam and then covered with fiberglass. The Pods have an outer shell made of a white gel coat. On the interior, owners can choose between gel coat or a Corian artificial stone surface from Dupont.</p>
<p>During the first phase of sales, according to Romundt, the primary focus will be on tourism and businesses, through 'SeaBnBs', time shares and rentals. "We want as many people to experience our new homes as possible," he adds. </p>

<p><strong>Legalities</strong></p>
<p>Every land-based country has their own rules on how long they consider a person needs to be in their country to be deemed a resident of their country, either for legal, tax, health insurance or other purposes. But seasteading countries would be free of that obligation, said Romundt. "There is no requirement for how long someone would need to live on a seastead to be deemed a resident of that community." </p>
<p>To be considered as a country, a seasteading community would likely fly a maritime flag of a country similar to how boats are flagged under a country. This would give them some legal protections as they would theoretically be seen as a part of the country they are flagged under, explained Romundt. To be completely outside of a governments' jurisdiction a seasteading community would need to be 200 miles from land.</p>
<p>According to the non-profit think tank, the Seasteading Institute, many seasteading proponents are fed up with their country's outdated laws and welcome the idea to rewrite the rulebook for the 21st Century. </p>
<p>"The challenge with old governments is that obsolete laws don’t go away as fast as new laws are created. For instance, <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/A9999/5169_I1.HTM" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">a law that all horses on the highway must wear sleigh bells was not repealed in New Jersey until 2017</a>," said President of the Seasteading Institute, Joe Quirk.</p>
<p>"We need legal systems to evolve as rapidly as the cultures and technologies they govern, and Seasteading is a technology to accelerate the process by which smart laws are developed and dumb laws are deleted. Special Economic Zones are areas within existing countries that are given unique regulatory systems to increase prosperity. Think of them as legal islands created on land. <a href="https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2019_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">There are more than 4000 around the world, including more than 250 in the US</a>," he added. </p>
<p>Tom W. Bell, a professor of law at Chapman University, wrote a book proposing a new kind of Special Economic Zone known as a SeaZone, which will take the lessons learned from land-based zones and apply them in a floating zone. He said in the book, "Governments across the globe have begun evolving from lumbering bureaucracies into smaller, more agile special jurisdictions - common-interest developments, special economic zones, and proprietary cites. Private providers increasingly deliver services that political authorities formerly monopolized, inspiring greater competition and efficiency, to the satisfaction of citizens-qua-consumers. These trends suggest that new networks of special jurisdictions will soon surpass nation states in the same way that networked computers replaced mainframes."</p>
<p>While this is all good in an ideal, libertarian world, argues Emma Lindsay, a New York-based partner at international law firm Withers, escaping the nation state is difficult, even on the high seas, and in fact the laws of several countries could apply.  </p>
<p>She adds: "<span lang="EN-US">Individuals are subject to the laws of their state(s) of nationality no matter where they are. While not all of a state’s laws apply outside its territory, many do. The laws of the flag state of the seastead also apply.  All seagoing vessels are registered or licensed in a flag state which is deemed the nationality of the vessel. Panama is the world’s largest flag state by far.  Seasteaders also could be subject to the laws of any state that is harmed by their activities at sea, such as by pollution of surrounding waters. The current negotiation of a new UN treaty on conservation and sustainable use of the high seas has increased attention globally on this issue."</span></p>
<p>Withers is advising High Seas Alliance in its advocacy with states and other stakeholders negotiating the new treaty in New York.</p>

<p> <strong>Life In A Tax Haven</strong></p>
<p>The homes in Panama will be located in an anchorage close to a marina in calm, protected waters, as part of a trial run for a community further away in future. This allows for getting accustomed to living on the water while still being able to travel on land having easy access to groceries, supplies and the airport. Each home will be fitted with solar panels, a water filtration system and hydroponic farming to aim for as much self-sufficiency as possible.</p>
<p>One reason for trialling the concept in Panama is that it is a pure tax haven, meaning that it imposes no income, corporate, …</p></div></div>

It doesn’t have a sharp blade, an open flame, or jagged shrapnel. And it’s not dangerous because a bright orange sign proclaimed it so; but precisely the opposite. <em>Invisible</em> goes under the radar and over our heads, engaging no defenses and no fight-or-flight moment.</p><p id="viewer-3emtj">Because <em>invisible</em> doesn’t invoke urgency, less visible matters naturally seem distant, even nonexistent. What’ll get first dibs on my attention — the Amazon rainforest burning for months on end, or the candle burning in my living room? Probably the candle; not because it’s more <em>important</em> than the rainforest, but because it’s more readily <em>visible</em>.</p><p id="viewer-8hggc"><span>Visibility almost never exists on a level playing field. Why is SkyMall staring you in the face on a long flight? And why is Starbucks conveniently placed on the morning-commute-heavy side of the road? Particularly in commercial spaces, what you </span><em>see </em><span>is rarely coincidence. At any given moment, more than a few brands bid fiercely for your eyes — whether via the “</span><a href="https://www.cstoreproductsonline.com/general-merchandise/hitting-consumer-strike-zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strike zone</a><span>” of convenience store shelves, the head of your search results, or slices of your Instagram timeline. So visibility becomes a point of leverage for those with capital —</span><strong>a differentiator between </strong><em><strong>winners </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>losers</strong></em><span>.</span></p><div id="viewer-vfg6"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_907433be8cb24d2a96f9f8be149bdaaf~mv2.jpeg/v1/fit/w_400,h_353,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_907433be8cb24d2a96f9f8be149bdaaf~mv2.jpeg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpeg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-ads28"><a href="http://www.joehollier.com/fiveonthat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><p id="viewer-e7ps3">Let’s rewind back to the candle and the rainforest. Who’s the winner there? For starters, it’s the company that sold me the candle. And as winners, they’re inclined to preserve the conditions that let them win. So the immense supply chain that turned crude oil, glass, and paper into a delightful candle (probably clearcutting a rainforest along the way) is deliberately made opaque to regulators and consumers like me. In other words, the <em>box</em> is kept <em>black</em>. With diminished visibility, the loser — the rainforest — is subject to further disadvantage. Thus, <strong>the black box preserves the existing divide between winners and losers.</strong></p><p id="viewer-fq9n4">But if you look a little closer, the winner-loser divide isn’t so black and white. Obviously I, as the owner of the candle, benefit from its black-boxedness. I can fill my living room with citrus blossom fragrances, blissfully ignorant of the polluted air it sends into the lungs of people and animals closer to the candle’s production. And though I may claim to support ecological policy reform, thereby aligning with the loser, my consumption choices say otherwise.</p><div id="viewer-602v0"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_83100eafdb1a4ead944746138bb13165~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_600,h_316,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_83100eafdb1a4ead944746138bb13165~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9pmb0"><a href="http://www.joehollier.com/fiveonthat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><h2 id="viewer-amq0v">Defense mechanisms</h2><p id="viewer-blqmb">Cognitive dissonance is inescapable in a world of black boxes. While they’re often vital to societal functioning — like the black box of democracy, as discussed in <a href="https://vujadeworld.substack.com/p/tangled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part two</a> — they’re not necessarily moral. Underneath their murky surfaces, we know, are plenty of things we don’t want to see. But since our very lifestyles have molded around them, exposing their inner workings would threaten the way we live. To ward off anxiety and guilt, we construct defense mechanisms (on individual <em>and</em> societal scales).</p><p id="viewer-4nhpg">Take, for example, the moment you dispose of a piece of trash. From the moment it hits the bottom of the bin, a massive system comes to life — of garbage trucks, dumpsters, street cleaners, sanitation centers, and landfills — to whisk it out of your life as quickly as it came in. Or, it just lands on the side of the road…</p><p id="viewer-7h8d">In any case, our products <em>come from</em> and <em>return to</em> a sort of <strong>mental nowhereland</strong>; a cavity for unspoken thoughts to fester: “<em>this doesn’t exist after I’m done with it</em>,” or taken further, “<em>the Earth is abundant</em>.” Of course, these aren’t explicit views in our minds; they occupy the <em>negative space</em> — like shadows, or lies.</p><div id="viewer-a3v8v"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ac3ced2b99534923a938a3d3c2c9b5e5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1418,h_1418,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ac3ced2b99534923a938a3d3c2c9b5e5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-b0mtt"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhA8Dhejk9l/?igshid=18a1vwb87761x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><p id="viewer-eued3">And this is just for lifeless products.

But as demonstrated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prison-industrial complex</a>, we’re quite adept at dealing with people in the same callous, logistics-driven manner we deal with objects.</p><p id="viewer-2rm48">Cop cars fill the place of garbage trucks. Landfills become prisons. We thrust our pesky challenges as far as possible from the cozy suburbs, and guard them with barbed wire and strict visitation rules. Behind bars, we lock away the questions we don’t want to ask, as well as the societal shortcomings that made those bars necessary.</p><p id="viewer-aa1kn">And like the candle/rainforest scenario, these black boxes produce winners and losers. Those in charge would like you to think that <em>you</em> — Mr. or Mrs. Upstanding Citizen — are the only winner. You can drive by inmates picking up trash on the side of the road, permitted to think: “<em>those people belong there</em>.” But as they pick up the scraps put there by people like you, the more complicated truth remains deep in a black box.

They are institutional voids, which perpetuate the same invisibilities that produced them. In the process, they carve out a negative space of shadows, lies, and unasked questions. And as this negative space crystallizes, <em>power</em> is encoded into <em>narrative</em>. <strong>Stories, after all, are the strongest defense mechanisms we have</strong>.</p><h2 id="viewer-bd1j1">The glass slipper</h2><p id="viewer-dnank">If <em>defense mechanisms</em> work best when they’re <em>invisible</em>, and <em>invisible is dangerous</em>, then what does that say about <em>stories</em>? That they’re <em>dangerous</em>? Well, sort of. <strong>Stories are most dangerous when they’re</strong> <em><strong>invisible</strong></em>.</p><p id="viewer-dfbfb">In their refined, packaged-up formats, stories are relatively benign. The danger in Disney fairy tales, for instance, stems from the societal narratives surrounding them — which they subtly reinforce. <em>Cinderella</em>, the movie, isn’t the problem; it’s the broader story of femininity, and the impossible challenge of fitting into the “glass slipper” of male expectations.</p><p id="viewer-63p5o">The symbols and mythology of a story, while potential tools for relaying the real issues at hand, also run the risk of obscuring those same issues. As a result, a story itself can be a sort of glass slipper. Beautiful, yet rigid; prompting conformity under the guise of transparency.</p><div id="viewer-b3cqt"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_2f350a6be9ea43bea2bed514c28e560a~mv2.gif/v1/fit/w_500,h_273,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_2f350a6be9ea43bea2bed514c28e560a~mv2.gif"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-39jn9">Because they’re so easy to perpetuate, stories are the most manipulative of all black boxes. And the protective shell of narrative too often lets injustice off the hook. <strong>If the&nbsp;<em>content</em>&nbsp;of a story doesn’t adequately address its</strong> <strong><em>context</em>, a black box has been formed.</strong> These narrative black boxes, like the prison and the landfill, only reaffirm the conditions that produced them in the first place.</p><p id="viewer-9n9s0">Mark Zuckerberg famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Facebook_Effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>: “A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.” Albeit tone-deaf rhetorically (such as his default to <em>dying</em> and <em>Africa</em>), this is, in fact, a <em>story</em>. And it’s not actually about squirrels, nor people in Africa.</p><p id="viewer-9csne">On the surface-level, it seems reminiscent of the candle/rainforest analogy — illustrating how we naturally prioritize what’s <em>visible</em> over what’s <em>important</em>. But Zuckerberg’s subtext is covertly self-reflexive. Visibility, according to the story, sits outside his locus of control. By focusing on a narrowly-defined “relevance” to our “interests,” he implies that all Facebook does is reflect our own natural tendencies. In a sly erasure of context, the squirrel analogy obscures Facebook’s troll-under-the-bridge role: how levied allotment of visibility is their entire profit model.</p><p id="viewer-dg8pl">If history is written by the victors, then <strong>stories are told by the winners</strong>. So behind every story, and thus behind every black box, there’s a winner. And the BIG winners — like Facebook, Google, and Amazon — not only tell stories, but they run the bidding wars for visibility itself. Space, whether on a shelf or a timeline, is fought for exclusively by those on the <em>outside</em> of the black box.</p><div id="viewer-9pui"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ddef68de436249d8b3a7f9f9b4ab7580~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1382,h_1382,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ddef68de436249d8b3a7f9f9b4ab7580~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><h6 id="viewer-9h5iv"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5n1R8XJr83/?igshid=uzunevirh3bo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></h6><p id="viewer-i4hr">But now, the black boxes that have cocooned us for so long are beginning to crack.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Online abuse of trust is one of the topics I’ve studied deeply, including significant work toward an unfinished <a href="https://levien.com/thesis/thesis.pdf">PhD</a>, and over two years working on a spam and abuse team at Google. These days my main work is on 2D graphics, but seeing patterns of misinformation about Covid-19 is bringing back interest and motivation to think about these topics.</p>

<p>As Covid-19 has been unfolding, I’ve spent significant time and energy trying to understand it, as I tend to do with threats in general. In so doing, I’ve developed some insight on how to tune media consumption patterns towards more truthful content and less misinformation.</p>

<h2 id="america-is-broken">America is broken</h2>

<p>The astonishingly poor national response to Covid-19 is heartbreaking. Given our incredible richness of resources, it is surprising that many of the failure modes resemble those from low-income countries: superstition, cult of personality, suppression of science, and straight up corruption. A common thread is misinformation and disinformation.</p>

<p>Our response to Covid-19 has been very much like driving a car with poorly-maintained brakes. We’ve done the equivalent of neglecting regular maintenance, ignoring the brake light on the dashboard, and choosing to not to pay attention to the squishy feeling of the brake pedal. It’s as if there’s a devil on our shoulder saying, “oh no, don’t get the brakes fixed, it might cost hundreds of dollars.”</p>

<p>I think it’s worth trying to understand <em>why</em> we’re in that position, but it’s beyond the scope of this blog post. Mass behavior of humans is pretty predictable, but individual choices can probably make some difference. I have no answers for those who <em>want</em> to listen to that devil (a big challenge in and of itself), but for those would prefer to listen to the angel instead, I have some tips.</p>

<h2 id="it-is-a-partisan-issue">It is a partisan issue</h2>

<p>I often see the plea “it is not a partisan issue” attached to factual arguments. I think this represents an aspiration: it <em>should</em> not be partisan. In 2020 America, the reality is that there is a powerful anti-science, anti-truth faction, and that faction makes up a large part of the composition of one of the political parties. It’s not 100% alignment, and I want to give credit where credit is due: for example, the moderate Republican governor of Massachusetts has embraced science and investment in public health, and the results in that state are one of the best in the country.</p>

<p>But in general, any factual argument that has bearing on a political question such as “should we invest in public health” or “should we restructure the economy away from carbon consumption” is now inherently partisan.</p>

<p>Much of the partisan content in media is around issues that are not very consequential, either pure entertainment, or (at least traditionally) between candidates or parties that have comparable ability to govern. I was hopeful that the life or death nature of Covid-19 would motivate the people who decide what appears in media to higher standards. But apparently, it’s just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog">nature of the scorpion</a>, they either can’t help themselves or just don’t care. Almost certainly, the media organization with the most blood on its hands is Fox News, which actively promotes an anti-health, pro-infection agenda. I don’t understand how they sleep at night.</p>

<p>Truth threatens a lot of existing power structures. If everybody woke up tomorrow and decided they were tired of being lied to, there would be seismic shifts of power. It’s worth thinking about who might be most affected by such a thing, and the kinds of things they do to keep it from happening.</p>

<h2 id="high-end-science-journalism">High-end science journalism</h2>

<p>I’m going to cover a range of information sources in this post, but there is a tl;dr: read up on actual science journalism by people who know what they’re talking about. Coverage by Science, Nature, and STAT News has been uniformly excellent. Good journalism is always teamwork, but I’ll also raise up the voices of particularly insightful individuals: <a href="https://twitter.com/sciencecohen">Jon Cohen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kakape">Kai Kupferschmidt</a> of Science, <a href="https://twitter.com/amymaxmen">Amy Maxmen</a> of Nature, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell">Helen Branswell</a> of STAT News. These are science journalists who have invested years in honing their craft.</p>

<p>I’ve also been impressed by coverage in The Atlantic. Their science content is quite good (thanks to top-notch contributors such as <a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209">Ed Yong</a>), but they also put the science in the context of American culture and politics. It is for this reason, I believe, that our President has <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/05/27/the-atlantic-saw-subscriptions-surge-after-trump-tweet/">singled them out</a> for criticism.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that these sources tend to be publications that have been around for a while (STAT News is a brand of the Boston Globe media group). It’s not exactly rocket science how to do this, you just need to find experienced, capable writers and pay them to do journalism, with editorial and institutional support. But in today’s hyper-capitalist society, sustaining such efforts is a struggle. If you can, try to support publications that do good work by subscribing, or donating in the case of non-profits.</p>

<p>For someone with a limited budget of time and attention, good science journalism is absolutely the best bang for the buck. The other recommendations in this post are for people who want to spend a little more effort to gain, hopefully, a little more insight.</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p>By far the most interesting experience I’ve had has been Twitter. What makes Twitter unique is its extremely wide dynamic range of information quality: both the worst of the worst and the best of the best are well represented. (An example of an information source of low dynamic range is an encyclopedia: almost every article is pretty good, garbage and brilliance both being rare)</p>

<p>A well-curated Twitter feed is one of the best information sources available today, and following random people on Twitter is one of the worst.</p>

<p>Even though it has no formal structure such as subreddits, Twitter functions as a set of overlapping communities, often described as “X Twitter” or “Y Twitter” (incidentally, a good explanation of how communities work on Twitter can be had in Jeff Jarvis’ <a href="https://buzzmachine.com/2020/05/11/a-conversation-with-nathan-allebach-steak-umms-voice/">interview of the voice behind Steak-umm</a>). There are many experts who generously share their knowledge and thoughts with us, and I’ve found that with a modest investment of time, it’s possible to follow along.</p>

<p>In one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCud8VIawWp17jKl2Lp0VvlQ">Jeff Jarvis interviews</a>, they jokingly referred to “idiot Twitter,” and, though it was a joke, the concept has stuck with me. Twitter, like all social media properties, works by engaging very large numbers of people with content that appeals emotionally. The expert communities are far too small a fraction of Twitter’s traffic to be profitable for them, but they support them as a way to maintain the prestige of the platform. The replies of any popular post are filled with all manner of conspiracy theory, miracle cure, denial, blame, and, I think at least sometimes, active disinformation by those who would do us harm (it’s hard to tell the difference and the outcome is the same). I think of all that as “idiot Twitter” and just do my best to avoid it. I also see it everywhere, of course, not just Twitter, and the quantity of it is a good measure of the value in a social media platform.</p>

<p>Twitter has a delicate balance to maintain, as there are many aspects of the site design that push you toward “idiot Twitter” even when you’re trying to curate your experience to avoid it. One example that consistently frustrates me is the trending panel, as that seems to be about half composed of idiot Twitter. It’s addictive, even so, because it tempts you with the thrill of discovering things early. I’ve also found that it’s easier to avoid junk on the desktop site than the mobile app. I’m worried the experience will degrade; Quora stands as a cautionary tale of what can happen to a relatively respectable site when they pursue clicks at the cost of all else.</p>

<p>Whether it would be viable to develop a social network designed for quality of discussion is another topic beyond this blog. I’m not especially hopeful on this front, as it’s hard to see how it would be profitable. In any case, there’s not much value in wishing for the possibly impossible, as somebody seeking quality information can find it even today.</p>

<h3 id="list-curation">List curation</h3>

<p>One of the interesting features of Twitter is that people will curate and share lists of people they feel are worth following. My <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1239639611694911489">covid-19 list</a> is one such, and a lot of thought went into it: I’ve intentionally included people with a wide range of expertise (including, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/j_g_allen">Joseph Allen</a> for his insight into healthy buildings and <a href="https://twitter.com/uche_blackstock">Dr. Uché Blackstock</a> for expertise on health equity). I’ve also deliberately excluded people from this list who express strong political views or often use an emotional tone. Because of the latter criterion, it’s missing people I personally feel are worth listening to, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/gregggonsalves">Gregg Gonsalves</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyKonyndyk">Jeremy Konyndyk</a>. As always, your mileage may vary. The goal of this particular list is not to be comprehensive, it’s to select a set of voices that have excellent signal to noise ratio; for a much more comprehensive list, see <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1237834151694303234">this one curated by Jeff Jarvis</a>.</p>

<p>One phenomenon I’ve noticed is that people at the top of these lists tend to recommend each other. I wouldn’t be surprised if some automated evaluation (perhaps based on eigenvalues) could yield a good curated list. That said, in my past research, I’ve found that any automatic metric with an incentive will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">gamed</a>, and invariably will lift up self-promoters over quiet, thoughtful voices.</p>

<p>Speaking of self-promoters, two names do not belong on lists of top experts, but are often found there: Eric Feigl-Ding &amp; Laurie Garrett. Both are good communicators, but are also sloppy enough with their science to get called out regularly. Inclusion of these names is a sign that a list of experts is not especially carefully curated.</p>

<p>Another important warning sign is lack of inclusion of women and people of color; mainstream media is often guilty of this. Health equity is an especially important part of the …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><em><center>Neil Postman (March 27, 1998)</center></em></p><hr>
      <p>Good morning your Eminences and Excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen. 
      </p><p>The theme of this conference, "The New Technologies and the Human 
      Person: Communicating the Faith in the New Millennium," suggests, of 
      course, that you are concerned about what might happen to faith in the new 
      millennium, as well you should be. In addition to our computers, which are 
      close to having a nervous breakdown in anticipation of the year 2000, 
      there is a great deal of frantic talk about the 21st century and how it 
      will pose for us unique problems of which we know very little but for 
      which, nonetheless, we are supposed to carefully prepare. Everyone seems 
      to worry about this--business people, politicians, educators, as well as 
      theologians. 
      </p><p>At the risk of sounding patronizing, may I try to put everyone's mind 
      at ease? I doubt that the 21st century will pose for us problems that are 
      more stunning, disorienting or complex than those we faced in this 
      century, or the 19th, 18th, 17th, or for that matter, many of the 
      centuries before that. But for those who are excessively nervous about the 
      new millennium, I can provide, right at the start, some good advice about 
      how to confront it. The advice comes from people whom we can trust, and 
      whose thoughtfulness, it's safe to say, exceeds that of President Clinton, 
      Newt Gingrich, or even Bill Gates. Here is what Henry David Thoreau told 
      us: "All our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end." Here 
      is what Goethe told us: "One should, each day, try to hear a little song, 
      read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if possible, speak a few 
      reasonable words." Socrates told us: "The unexamined life is not worth 
      living." Rabbi Hillel told us: "What is hateful to thee, do not do to 
      another." And here is the prophet Micah: "What does the Lord require of 
      thee but to do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God." And 
      I could say, if we had the time, (although you know it well enough) what 
      Jesus, Isaiah, Mohammad, Spinoza, and Shakespeare told us. It is all the 
      same: There is no escaping from ourselves. The human dilemma is as it has 
      always been, and it is a delusion to believe that the technological 
      changes of our era have rendered irrelevant the wisdom of the ages and the 
      sages. 
      </p><p>Nonetheless, having said this, I know perfectly well that because we do 
      live in a technological age, we have some special problems that Jesus, 
      Hillel, Socrates, and Micah did not and could not speak of. I do not have 
      the wisdom to say what we ought to do about such problems, and so my 
      contribution must confine itself to some things we need to know in order 
      to address the problems. I call my talk <i>Five Things We Need to Know 
      About Technological Change</i>. I base these ideas on my thirty years of 
      studying the history of technological change but I do not think these are 
      academic or esoteric ideas. They are to the sort of things everyone who is 
      concerned with cultural stability and balance should know and I offer them 
      to you in the hope that you will find them useful in thinking about the 
      effects of technology on religious faith. 
      </p><p><b>First Idea</b> 
      </p><p>The first idea is that all technological change is a trade-off. I like 
      to call it a Faustian bargain. Technology giveth and technology taketh 
      away. This means that for every advantage a new technology offers, there 
      is always a corresponding disadvantage. The disadvantage may exceed in 
      importance the advantage, or the advantage may well be worth the cost. 
      Now, this may seem to be a rather obvious idea, but you would be surprised 
      at how many people believe that new technologies are unmixed blessings. 
      You need only think of the enthusiasms with which most people approach 
      their understanding of computers. Ask anyone who knows something about 
      computers to talk about them, and you will find that they will, 
      unabashedly and relentlessly, extol the wonders of computers. You will 
      also find that in most cases they will completely neglect to mention any 
      of the liabilities of computers. This is a dangerous imbalance, since the 
      greater the wonders of a technology, the greater will be its negative 
      consequences. 
      </p><p>Think of the automobile, which for all of its obvious advantages, has 
      poisoned our air, choked our cities, and degraded the beauty of our 
      natural landscape. Or you might reflect on the paradox of medical 
      technology which brings wondrous cures but is, at the same time, a 
      demonstrable cause of certain diseases and disabilities, and has played a 
      significant role in reducing the diagnostic skills of physicians. It is 
      also well to recall that for all of the intellectual and social benefits 
      provided by the printing press, its costs were equally monumental. The 
      printing press gave the Western world prose, but it made poetry into an 
      exotic and elitist form of communication. It gave us inductive science, 
      but it reduced religious sensibility to a form of fanciful superstition. 
      Printing gave us the modern conception of nationhood, but in so doing 
      turned patriotism into a sordid if not lethal emotion. We might even say 
      that the printing of the Bible in vernacular languages introduced the 
      impression that God was an Englishman or a German or a Frenchman--that is 
      to say, printing reduced God to the dimensions of a local potentate. 
      </p><p>Perhaps the best way I can express this idea is to say that the 
      question, "What will a new technology do?" is no more important than the 
      question, "What will a new technology undo?" Indeed, the latter question 
      is more important, precisely because it is asked so infrequently. One 
      might say, then, that a sophisticated perspective on technological change 
      includes one's being skeptical of Utopian and Messianic visions drawn by 
      those who have no sense of history or of the precarious balances on which 
      culture depends. In fact, if it were up to me, I would forbid anyone from 
      talking about the new information technologies unless the person can 
      demonstrate that he or she knows something about the social and psychic 
      effects of the alphabet, the mechanical clock, the printing press, and 
      telegraphy. In other words, knows something about the costs of great 
      technologies. 
      </p><p>Idea Number One, then, is that culture always pays a price for 
      technology. 
      </p><p><b>Second Idea</b> 
      </p><p>This leads to the second idea, which is that the advantages and 
      disadvantages of new technologies are never distributed evenly among the 
      population. This means that every new technology benefits some and harms 
      others. There are even some who are not affected at all. Consider again 
      the case of the printing press in the 16th century, of which Martin Luther 
      said it was "God's highest and extremest act of grace, whereby the 
      business of the gospel is driven forward." By placing the word of God on 
      every Christian's kitchen table, the mass-produced book undermined the 
      authority of the church hierarchy, and hastened the breakup of the Holy 
      Roman See. The Protestants of that time cheered this development. The 
      Catholics were enraged and distraught. Since I am a Jew, had I lived at 
      that time, I probably wouldn't have given a damn one way or another, since 
      it would make no difference whether a pogrom was inspired by Martin Luther 
      or Pope Leo X. Some gain, some lose, a few remain as they were. 
      </p><p>Let us take as another example, television, although here I should add 
      at once that in the case of television there are very few indeed who are 
      not affected in one way or another. In America, where television has taken 
      hold more deeply than anywhere else, there are many people who find it a 
      blessing, not least those who have achieved high-paying, gratifying 
      careers in television as executives, technicians, directors, newscasters 
      and entertainers. On the other hand, and in the long run, television may 
      bring an end to the careers of school teachers since school was an 
      invention of the printing press and must stand or fall on the issue of how 
      much importance the printed word will have in the future. There is no 
      chance, of course, that television will go away but school teachers who 
      are enthusiastic about its presence always call to my mind an image of 
      some turn-of-the-century blacksmith who not only is singing the praises of 
      the automobile but who also believes that his business will be enhanced by 
      it. We know now that his business was not enhanced by it; it was rendered 
      obsolete by it, as perhaps an intelligent blacksmith would have known. 
      </p><p>The questions, then, that are never far from the mind of a person who 
      is knowledgeable about technological change are these: Who specifically 
      benefits from the development of a new technology? Which groups, what type 
      of person, what kind of industry will be favored? And, of course, which 
      groups of people will thereby be harmed? 
      </p><p>These questions should certainly be on our minds when we think about 
      computer technology. There is no doubt that the computer has been and will 
      continue to be advantageous to large-scale organizations like the military 
      or airline companies or banks or tax collecting institutions. And it is 
      equally clear that the computer is now indispensable to high-level </p></div></div>

<p>It’s often said that you can tell a lot about a person by observing their living space. In a similar vein, I believe we can glean a lot about society by observing our own minds – where we store the individual thoughts, beliefs and values that form society’s collective structures. Unsurprisingly our headspace is often a product of our mind’s state, sitting somewhere along a spectrum of fulfilment to boredom at any one time. In this article I want to focus more on the latter, more specifically, how boredom as a pervasive state of mind has shaped our consumption habits. What we feed our minds for entertainment and why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before I get into that though we have to clarify the relationship between boredom and consumption, or rather dispel a popular myth. Boredom isn’t resolved by quick, easy stimulation of the mind, instead boredom feeds off of it to grow even larger. You can think of it as drinking alcohol to quench thirst, in the immediate term you will feel hydrated only to realise it will leave you even more parched than before. Now that we’ve acknowledged this, bear in mind that today’s pace of life and technology has ensured that we do exactly that. Boredom is met with quick stimulus leaving an even larger craving in its wake, only to be met by quicker and easier stimulation, and so goes the cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s entertainment economy has adjusted to this fundamental transformation in our consumption habits – I call it a transformation because it has happened slowly but surely over several decades. And while the link isn’t obvious yet, it’s a large part of the reason you’ve been walking out of cinemas thinking “is it just me or were movies better a few years ago”. While I can’t surely say movies were better a few years ago, why, in an increasingly creative, technologically advanced society would viewers be left feeling this way post a movie experience?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The explanation for this lies in, you guessed it, boredom. Also to an extent, discovery and recommender systems but we won’t get into that now. To solve for boredom at scale, we have to appeal to the lowest threshold for stimulation. This objective to appeal to the lowest common denominator for stimulation quickly becomes a defining factor of our consumption habits. When Youtube launched in 2006 later to be acquired by Google, it signalled the start of a shift in consumable entertainment. User-generated entertainment was never before a comparable form of media for the masses. People didn’t watch vlogs and live streams while they ate dinner, they watched old school Tv shows and movies. But Youtube was successful because it was one of the first to address the quantity of entertainment required to “quench” boredom at scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Youtube and subsequent platforms like TikTok are naturally able to provide the lowest common denominator across the board – “there is something for everyone” – with the sheer quantity and diversity of user generated content (UGC) on these platforms. Hollywood movies though, don’t work on the function of quantity. Rather they work on high-quality production and creative output. Hollywood had to address the challenge of vying for eyeball time in an increasingly saturated ‘boredom market’. To do this, Hollywood had to begin considering what platforms like Youtube were doing, providing a quick dopamine hit whilst servicing the lowest common denominators that would attract the most people. Hollywood’s take on this has manifested into today’s mainstream film industry. This takes the form of ‘PG’ movies appealing to younger, broader audiences, through to the one-liners in marvel movies that seem to hit just right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One other clear example of this is the influx of reboots over the last few years. Here, nostalgia is the common denominator these movies are targeting instead of focusing on the creation of new content. <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens </em>is probably a good example of this, basically a play by play of <em>A New Hope</em> – the first movie in the Star Wars franchise to release in the 1970s.</p>



<h3>How Quibi failed to read the room</h3>



<p>Quibi, Hollywood’s poster child for short-form video content, has been created for a mobile-only audience. It claims it competes with “free” forms of video like Youtube and TikTok that target viewers with time and attention constraints. This offering rests upon the assumption that viewers on current UGC platforms would prefer higher quality production.</p>



<p>If I Imagine the pitch-room for Quibi seed round investment – the pitch would have gone something like this. “We’re time poor/attention-deficit and addicted to the drip-drip release of dopamine that our smart-phones deliver unto us. As our consumption patterns arc away from the past – we are ever in search of easier to consume, easier to enjoy doses that slot into the (apparently) smaller spaces of discretionary time in our lives or minds – Youtube/TikTok have shown how hungry the people are for these short bursts of escape – but user-generated content can’t fill that gap at the scale and quality we can”</p>



<p>What QuiBi failed to understand is that the transformation in our consumption pattern wasn’t about short-form content with high-quality production but about fulfilling the need for stimulus created by boredom. In actual fact, our consumption patterns had fragmented into two formats. The first is “Hollywood” style productions, high-quality story driven content that requires greater cognitive participation (immersion). The second is lower quality production or user-generated content that we equate with easy, effortless consumption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anecdotally, you can abandon a YouTube video halfway and not feel dissatisfied for having wasted five minutes on it – a perk of non-immersive content. Comparatively, it would be difficult to abandon the type of high production content found on Quibi – where you’ve already committed to participating cognitively and are anticipating immersion – without feeling a little cheated of time and effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Immersion requires the cognitive expense of dedicating a set amount of time and a certain mindset to consume that content. This cognitive expense is at odds with the youtube or TikTok model, where spontaneous discovery and consumption also equate to spontaneous abandonment of that content without dissatisfaction. If Quibi wanted to replicate the spontaneous discovery and consumption, their focus should have been on scaling quantity that allows for spontaneity rather than spending 100,000 USD per minute of video. Imagine if there were 80,000 or 800,000 pieces of content rather than 8,000?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So then the absurdity of the following statement is apparent:</p>



<p>“We’re competing against free,” Jeffrey Katzenberg says referring to the likes of youtube and social media platforms like TikTok. “We have to offer something that is meaningfully, measurably, quantifiably, creatively different. They don’t know how to do what we do, with all due respect,…”</p>



<h3>Hollywood: Where tried and tested formulas often outweigh the cost of creative risks</h3>



<p>The lowest common denominator is easier to identify on YouTube where stimulus is dictated and served by ‘market’ forces, basically the consumption demands of users. On the other hand, Hollywood relies more heavily on a commercial push strategy informed by the smaller sample set of feedback available in audience scores. The cost of identifying the nature of demand is significantly larger in the latter compared to the throwaway cost of a YouTube production. Producers can easily move from one youtube video to the next without losing an arm and a leg.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high cost of production in Hollywood doesn’t afford the same luxury, the same applies for Quibi’s production value. This then exacerbates a reliance on more obviously popular tropes, reboots are an easy out given that the particular world, plot or characters are already loved by audiences. This pushes production towards tried and tested formulas which are replicated year on year, where funny one-liners from marvel movies are a hallmark of Hollywood production now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where optionality was limited in the 90s, early 2000s or any time before to the TV and Cinema, taking punts on new formats, stories or original productions seemed a less risky endeavour. In today’s world, there is far too much optionality and much slimmer margin for error.</p>
