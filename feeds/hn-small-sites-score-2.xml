<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-301"> <div><p>Jesse Schoberg, CEO &amp; indie founder of DropInBlog, went from $1k per month, to now towards a 7-figure income. Jesse and his team currently faces the decision of “how big they want to grow”.</p><h2>About This Indie Interview</h2><div><p> This is the <code><span><strong>#2nd</strong></span></code> installment of our <a href="https://indiediary.com/hub/interviews/indiefounders/" title="interviews with indie founders">Indie Interviews</a> series to help <strong>aspiring indie founders &amp; indie entrepreneurs</strong> to get inspired by listening from those successful indie founders who are already highly involved on the startup scene and *being there* taming the waves &amp; surfing better than ever to achieve their dream – seeking financial freedom, working on projects that matters to them, getting a sense of accomplishment (in their own eyes) and working on their own schedule.</p><div><p> It is also an opportunity for new indie founders to get to know other like-minded indie entrepreneurs. </p><p>I hope you will derive as much fun to read my interviews as I’m having by interviewing those awesome indie founders, entrepreneurs &amp; businesses.</p></div><hr></div><h2>And Now the Interview With the Indie Founder</h2><h3>### Spotlight on our today’s indie person</h3><h4><a name="tell_us"></a>&gt;&gt; Please tell us about yourself + what your workstation looks like + any productivity tools you use?</h4><p>Hi. I’m <strong>Jesse Schoberg</strong>, CEO and Co-Founder of <strong><em>DropInBlog</em></strong>. I’ve been working on internet stuff since 2001 when I learned “web design” as it was called at the time. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and PHP.</p><p>I just started building websites for small businesses. That eventually turned into an agency with remote staff.</p><p>Learning to find global talent was huge for me. Once you learn how to source a team of freelancers, your journey becomes a lot faster. The agency did well enough that I made a good living. But I knew scaling an agency was a nightmare. The real path to freedom was with my own projects.</p><p>I started a variety of side projects over the years with varying success. Some failed, some eventually had moderate 6 figure exits.</p><p>I’ve done a bunch of things, but here are a few: vacation rental directory, white label hotel booking engine, white label SMS marketing SaaS, form processing SaaS, franchise directory, and eventually DropInBlog (a SaaS that adds a blog to sites not built in <a href="https://indiediary.com/wordpress/">WordPress</a>).</p><p>My experience running the agency and knowing how to code helped immensely. It helped me hire, helped me manage staff, helped me manage projects efficiently, Etc.</p><p><strong>My workstation</strong> – I’m a minimalist and a nomad so I don’t have a big desk setup.</p><p><strong>The tools I (we) use daily to keep things organised &amp; productiv</strong>e:</p><p>We use&nbsp;<strong>Freedcamp</strong>&nbsp;for our primary PM tool, and we’ve been delighted with it. They are always responsive to issues and seem to have a great team.</p><p>I keep my “today’s focus” just in a simple text doc that runs in its own space.&nbsp;I have a few little apps I like:</p><div><div><ul><li><strong>TripMode</strong>&nbsp;– limits which apps can connect to the internet, great for coffee shops, Etc</li><li><strong>Micro Snitch</strong>&nbsp;– notifies you anytime an app turns on your mic or camera</li><li><strong>Droplr</strong>&nbsp;– screenshots / screencasts / code snippets</li><li><strong>Migadu</strong>&nbsp;– email hosting based on usage, not domains/accounts</li></ul><h4><a name="routine"></a>&gt;&gt; Do you have a routine to start your day off &nbsp;or do you take it as it comes?</h4><p>I’m more of a night guy. I don’t feel my real energy kicking in until the afternoon. So I take my mornings slow. I do personal stuff – catch up with friends, life admin, reading, Etc.</p><p>You gotta follow your energy, and work when your brain is most “on”. This is different for everyone. I don’t use an alarm, I only eat 2 meals/day, and breakfast is not one of them. I love a good latte to start my day. I like to do a bit of callisthenics.</p><p>That said if I’m deep into a project, all that goes out the window. I’ll wake up and go straight to smashing keys as my brain won’t turn off until the task is finished. Sometimes that’s days or a week. Follow your energy.</p><h4><a name="motivation"></a>&gt;&gt; How do you keep yourself motivated to achieve your goals?</h4><p>I value freedom a lot. I also love building stuff. So ultimately that’s what keeps me motivated.</p><p>Internet businesses and the money they generate creates incredible freedom that most people can’t even wrap their head around if structured correctly.</p><p>Aside from that, I love the satisfaction of creating things and the excitement that can come with the hustle.</p><p>If my motivation is low, I try to step away from the keyboard. I walk, listen to podcasts (that are often not about business), play the guitar, or explore whatever city I’m dwelling in.</p><p>For me, motivation comes in large waves – I’ve learned it’s better not to force it.</p><h3>### The Indie Person as an Indie Founder/Entrepreneur</h3><h4><a name="change_world"></a>&gt;&gt; What change are you seeking to make to the world?</h4><p>Since <strong>DropInBlog</strong> has taken off, I’ve done my best to keep side projects to a minimum. But there is one we’re pursuing that is about impact and awareness.</p><p>That project is about alternative protein sources. It turns out we’re running out of resources on this earth place. We got interested in bug protein (crickets specifically) and are working on that project over at <strong>Crickets.org</strong>.</p><h4><a name="books"></a>&gt;&gt; The books or material you recommend?</h4><p>I know everyone talks about it, but if you are new in your journey, you should read <strong>The Four Hour Work Week</strong>. While the industry has dramatically evolved since its publication, it is a good starting point for mindset — precisely, <em><strong>the Dreamline exercise</strong></em>.</p><p>For personal growth and also an understanding of other humans, my all-time favourite book is <strong>The Happiness Hypothesis <em>by Jonathan Haidt</em></strong>. (Also see his follow-up <strong>The Righteous Mind</strong>.)</p><h4><a name="difference"></a>&gt;&gt; According to you, what is the difference between a founder &amp; an entrepreneur? And which one are you?</h4></div></div><p>That is an interesting question. I’ve never really thought about it.</p><p>I guess in my mind, all founders are entrepreneurs, but all entrepreneurs are not founders.</p><p>I feel like I’ve been an entrepreneur my whole life. I didn’t feel like a founder until I was focused on certain projects or companies and leading a vision.</p><p>If you hustle hot dogs on the street side or flip widgets on ebay, you’re an entrepreneur, if you take those to the next level with process, vision and longevity you are a founder.</p><h4><a name="habit"></a>&gt;&gt; What ONE habit played an important part for you as an indie founder?</h4><p><strong>Consistency</strong>. Success is a long game, and you’ve got to show up (albeit not&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;day).</p><h3>### The SaaS Business of the indie person</h3><div><p> Claim your (free) 30%-off coupon to unlock 100+ deals on tools/services to supercharge your startup journey!

However, it’s a different use case than WordPress or Medium or other platforms.</p><p>It allows you to embed a blog into your existing site, using your current template or theme. Some might call it a “headless blog platform”. So that could be your hand-coded HTML site, something built in Webflow or Kartra, a Shopify store, a Thinkific site, Etc.</p><p><strong>It’s called DropInBlog</strong>. Because, well.. it lets you “drop” a blog into your website. We didn’t overthink it too much. Simple, brandable, and we could secure the .com and related social profiles.</p><p><strong>Our niche</strong> is people with websites that are not built in WordPress that want to have a blog.</p><h4><a name="aha"></a>&gt;&gt; When exactly did you get that “aha moment“ for your business/project? Tell us the story behind..</h4><p>It was quite a long time ago. Before WordPress took the world by storm, we were building sites for our clients using basic HTML, and some PHP includes.</p><p>Then clients started asking for blogs. We would install WordPress in a folder and then create a custom theme to match the existing site.</p><p>It was a tedious process, and then clients were frustrated because WordPress was a bit convoluted when using it “just” as a blog.</p><p>So with that, I thought – “why couldn’t we build a basic CMS that was just a blog that plugged into any existing site?”</p><h4><a name="biz_model"></a>&gt;&gt; What is your business model – how are you generating revenue &amp; making it profitable?</h4><p>It’s a SaaS. There are two plans, and both of them are paid-plans. There is a free trial but no free-plan.</p><p>We’ve never done well with freemium.</p><h4><a name="success"></a>&gt;&gt; In the context of this indie business, what does success mean to you?</h4><p>I want <strong>DropInBlog</strong> to become the “household name” when it comes to the pain point we solve.</p><h4><a name="income"></a>&gt;&gt; Can you share your revenue stats &amp; journey towards your 7-figure income?</h4><p>The first few years we had it as a little side project it was only making like $1k / month.</p><p>Then we had a bunch of things kind of fall into place early 2019. That’s when we saw the potential.</p><p><strong>We blew past six figures once we started focusing on it, now on the road to 7-figures </strong>– around which point we’ll have to make some serious decisions about how big we want to take this thing.</p><h4><a name="research"></a>&gt;&gt; How do you do your market research?</h4><p>Mostly we watch our signups. If there is a community like <strong><em>Kartra</em></strong> or <strong><em>Webflow</em></strong> we see using our product a lot, we start to lean into that community more and cater our content &amp; product to their needs a bit.</p><p>Once we identify things we want to target, our favourite tool is <strong>Ahrefs</strong> for sure.</p><p>But we also use <strong>Hotjar</strong> for user experience stuff and many tools from <strong><a href="https://indiediary.com/baremetrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc">Baremetrics</a></strong> to engage our customers and keep an eye on how our numbers are doing.</p><h4><a name="trust"></a>&gt;&gt; How are you building trust to attract customers + Your promotion strategies?</h4><p>We do a fair amount of content marketing. I’m active on twitter as the founder (<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/JesseSchoberg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc">@JesseSchoberg</a></strong>), and occasionally I speak at conferences.</p><p>We’re mostly organic but are also testing some paid channels. We drive some traffic from some Facebook groups related to the platforms we are popular with as well.</p><h4><a name="tech"></a>&gt;&gt; What tech stack, infrastructure &amp; tools are you using to power your business?</h4><p>We’re <em>LAMP</em> programmers by trade. Our original code was written in <strong>Symfony</strong>. However, we’re now working on a rewrite using <strong>Laravel</strong>.</p><p>We use <strong>Amazon</strong> for the full stack including <strong>E2 &amp; S3</strong> along with <strong>Cloudflare</strong> for cache and routing. Once things got a bit larger, we hired a <em>DevOps</em> team to get our ducks in a …</p></div></article></div>

    <p>Have you ever noticed how you can be fuming with anger one second, and absolutely calm the next?</p>

<p>An asshole driver cuts you off on the highway, and you’re raging. A moment later, you notice him pull into the hospital and your anger melts away. “Yeah, maybe he has a patient in the car with him. Or, maybe someone close is dying. I guess he’s not an asshole after all.”</p>

<p>An obscure rule from Probability Theory, called Bayes Theorem, explains this very well. This 9,000 word blog post is a complete introduction to Bayes Theorem and how to put it to practice. In short, Bayes Theorem is a framework for critical thinking. By the end of this post, you’ll be making better decisions, realise when you’re being unreasonable, and also understand why some people believe in UFOs.</p>

<p>It’s a hefty promise, and there’s a good chance of failure. Implementing these ideas will take emotional effort, but it’s worth it.</p>

<p>Thinking the driver is an asshole is normal. Bayes Theorem expects the same. The difference between Bayes and us is the intensity with which we believe. Most times, the seething anger isn’t warranted. This is probably why we feel stupid about all that anger. It melts away so quickly! This is calibration - aligning our emotions to the intensity of the situation - which we’ll cover as well.</p>

<!-- One way to check = If you're flip flopping between beliefs very quickly, you're probably miscalibrated. -->





<p>There’s no fancy math in this guide. We’re using Probability Theory, but aren’t going into the derivation, nor are we solving probability problems from school textbooks. These things are tedious without understanding the why. Instead, we’ll understand why Bayes Theorem matters, and how to apply it.</p>

<p>To begin with, let’s play a game. Throughout this game, <em>notice</em> how you feel about your decisions. Notice what decisions you’re making, and notice how you find the answer.</p>

<h2 id="the-246-game">The 2,4,6 game</h2>

<p>There’s a black box with a formula inside for generating 3 numbers. Your job is to try and guess this formula. The input box below is connected to the black box. If you give it 3 numbers, it’s going to tell you whether they follow the formula or not. Separate each number with a comma.</p>

<p>To start you off, (2,4,6) follows the pattern. Try it out!</p>





<p>Did you figure it out? Write down your answer in here:</p>

<h2 id="bayes-explanation">Bayes Explanation</h2>

<p>Most people try some sequence of: (4,6,8), (1,2,3) … and end up with either increasing numbers, or increasing numbers that are even. Notice how you’re pretty confident in your answer by the time you write it down. You’ve tried a few examples, and <strong>all</strong> of them made sense!</p>

<p>But perhaps you didn’t think to try (-1,2,10) or (4,2,6).</p>

<p>If my comment made your confidence waver, go ahead and try the input box again. See if you can find a pattern that works. The answer is at the bottom of this section, but don’t skip ahead. Every sentence before that is setting up an important idea.</p>

<h3 id="bayes-theorem">Bayes Theorem</h3>

<p>If you’ve heard of Bayes theorem before, you know this formula:</p>

<p>\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) * P(H)}{P(E)} \]</p>

<p>Indeed, that’s all there is to it. I bet you’ve also heard the famous formula: \(E = mc^2 \). That’s all there is to mass-energy equivalence. However, figuring out how to harness nuclear energy is still a hard problem. The formula made it possible, but implementing it still took 40 years.</p>

<p>It’s the same with Bayes Theorem. The formula is exciting because of what it implies. We’re discovering the nuclear energy version of Bayes Theorem.</p>

<p>Translated to English, the formula goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To form accurate beliefs, you always start from the information you already have. You update beliefs. You don’t discard everything you know.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- This is Bayes Theorem. Start from a pre-existing belief, a prior, then use the new information you get to update that belief, and finally land at your new belief. -->

<!-- It's wrong to form your beliefs using just the new piece of information you see. -->

<p>The first key component is a hypothesis (H) - the belief we’re talking about.</p>

<p>The second key component is the evidence (E) - what data do we have to support / reject the hypothesis.</p>

<p>The third key component is probability (P) of the above two. This probability is our confidence in the belief.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with probability theory, you learned this in school. If not, don’t worry, there are <a href="https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule/?l=1zq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent mathematical introductions</a> to explain it to you. We’ll skip the math, and focus on how to use it.</p>

<p>Our point of interest, and where bayes truly shines is where we compare two hypotheses. Instead of uncovering the absolute probabilities, which is hard, this focuses on how much more likely one hypothesis is, compared to another. Most reasoning in our mind takes this form.</p>

<!-- does it? - This is what makes contrast so valuable. -->

<p>In this case, the formula looks like:</p>

<p>\[ Posterior \hspace{2mm} Odds = Prior \hspace{2mm} Odds * Likelihood \hspace{2mm} Odds \]</p>

<p>Posterior odds measure how likely a hypothesis is compared to another one.</p>

<p>Prior odds measure how likely it was before we had any new evidence.</p>

<p>Likelihood odds measure how well the evidence explains the current hypothesis, compared to the other one. We’ll explore what this means with the help of examples.</p>

<p>\[ \text{Likelihood Odds} = \frac{ \text{Probability of evidence assuming hypothesis is true}}{\text{ Probability of evidence assuming competing hypothesis is true}}\]</p>

<p>We’ll start with the 2,4,6 game to show how qualitatively, math and intuition agree. Then we’ll get into a simpler example where we’re miscalibrated and do the math.</p>

<p>I’m going to choose my path through the 2,4,6 game, but I hope yours was similar enough. If not, try doing this on your own!</p>

<p>I have a hypothesis I want to test, \(H_{3even}\) = 3 even numbers in increasing order. It’s implicit here, but the hypothesis I’m testing this against is \(H_{not-3even}\), or that the formula <strong>is not</strong> 3 even numbers in increasing order.</p>

<p>I input (4,6,8) and the black box says “Yes”. My confidence in 3 even numbers rises. In Bayesian-speak, my posterior odds have increased, because the likelihood odds have increased. And the likelihood odds have increased, since the probability of (4,6,8) saying “Yes” is higher when the formula is \(H_{3even}\).</p>

<p>You’ll notice how <em>you feel</em> every new number that matches your hypothesis makes your belief stronger.</p>

<!-- This corresponds to a likelihood odds of greater than 1, since the belief you're testing is getting stronger. -->

<!--Too many ideas: A question to ponder here: Can (4,6,8) be acceptable in a world where \\(H_{not-3even}\\) is true? That is, the formula is not 3 even increasing numbers? This is seeking disconfirming evidence -->

<p>I try (1,2,3) next. “Yes”. What? I expected “No”!</p>

<p>Everything tumbles, like it should, when you find something that doesn’t follow the pattern. The probability of (1,2,3) saying “Yes” is higher with \(H_{not-3even}\), since (1,2,3) are not all even. The likelihood odds are in favour of \(H_{not-3even}\) now, which means we discard \(H_{3even}\). In this case, one small piece of evidence was enough to completely flip the scales.</p>

<p>Then, which new hypothesis should you try? The clues usually lie in how you disproved the previous hypothesis.</p>

<p>I tried (1,2,3) which said “Yes”, when I expected it to say “No”. My new hypothesis thus became “3 increasing numbers”.</p>

<p>Just like in the previous case, (4,2,6) saying “Yes” killed this hypothesis. My new hypothesis thus became “3 positive numbers”.</p>

<p>I tried (-1,2,3), which said “No”! This was all I needed to become reasonably confident in “3 positive numbers”. The more negative numbers I tried, the more confident I got.</p>

<p>3 positive numbers is indeed correct.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Graphically, this is what’s happening with the 3 hypotheses:</p>

  <p>However, after a certain level of confidence, you live your life believing it’s true. Once you start believing is when you must pay close attention to evidence that doesn’t fit.</p>
</div>

<p>Calibration is key. What we’ve just shown is our thinking process, and how Bayes theorem is mostly aligned with it when we’re thinking well. Bayes theorem updates beliefs in the same direction our brains do, but what changes is how much each piece of evidence influences us!</p>

<p>With this next example, let’s get into the basic math. We’ll revisit the 2,4,6 game in a bit.</p>

<h3 id="being-late-example">Being Late Example</h3>

<p>Your colleague is sometimes late to work. They’ve been on time 4 times, and late 3 times the past week. How many more times would it take you to start believing they’re “always” late?</p>

<p>In my experience, just a few more times does the trick. But let’s use Bayes to calibrate.</p>

<p>Since there’s no good reason to expect tardiness over punctuality, let’s say the prior odds are 1:1.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13">2</a></sup> The alternative hypothesis, the one we’re testing against is “not always being late”. To make this more concrete, let’s say this means they’re late only 10% of the time.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup></p>

<p>We’ll use the data we have to calculate the likelihood of being late. We want to contrast
<span>the data<span>being late thrice, and on time 4 times</span></span>
with us believing that they’re almost always on time, or almost always late. Remember, to figure this out, we imagine believing the first hypothesis, then judge how likely the data is. Then, we imagine believing the second hypothesis, and judge how likely the data is.</p>

<p>There are several ways to mathematically represent this data, from a binomial function to a beta distribution. However, we’re not getting into that yet. Today is more about an intuitive explanation, one which you’re more likely to use …</p></div></div>

</figure>

                <p>I was <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-with-jason-podcast/noah-gibbs-3/">recently on Jason Swett’s podcast again</a>. He’s a great interviewer and I always have fun with him.</p>

<p>By Twitter request we talked about… When would you <strong><em>not</em></strong> use Rails? It’s a great question.</p>

<p>For the entertaining version, <a href="https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-with-jason-podcast/noah-gibbs-3/">listen to the podcast</a>. For the just-the-facts extra-complete version, I’m writing this post.</p>

<h2>When Is Rails the Wrong Choice?</h2>

<p>I’ll start with a few simple, obvious times you wouldn’t use Rails, and then I’ll talk about some technically interesting times.</p>

<p>First, and most important, is team familiarity. If your team doesn’t already know Rails and isn’t especially interested in learning it then Rails is the wrong choice. This should be obvious, but it still deserves first billing.</p>

<p>Second, when you know some other framework fits better. I’ll talk more below about when that is. But sometimes you have a specific concern that trumps everything else. If you need to use a Java-language machine learning library and you don’t want to use JRuby for some reason, Rails isn’t your framework. If you’re writing a WordPress plugin, you’ll be doing it in PHP. Often there’s one specific compatibility concern that overrides everything else.</p>

<p>You can also think of it as: use it where Rails’ good points hold and its bad points don’t. So we’ll also talk about the good and bad points.</p>

<p>Separately: you’d normally only use Rails as an HTTP server, so some tasks just aren’t Rails-shaped.</p>

<h2>When is Rails Too Much?</h2>

<figure>
    <a href="https://rubymadscience.com/img/assistant_pirate_with_sphere_bigthumb.png">
      <img src="https://rubymadscience.com/img/assistant_pirate_with_sphere_bigthumb.png" alt="A pirate puppet with an eyepatch, safety goggles and a huge scraggly mustache watches over a purple crystal ball at his feet.'" title="He's too much lab assistant for your lab.">
    </a>
        <figcaption>He’s too much lab assistant for your lab.</figcaption> 
</figure>

<p>Some places not to use Rails can include:</p>

<p><strong>Really Small Tasks that Won’t Grow</strong>: if a server does very little, Rails is often too much. Not going to touch a database? Then the DB setup isn’t helping you, is it? Just a tiny low-traffic intermediate server with no caching? A lot of Rails is more trouble than it’s worth.</p>

<p>Be careful with tasks that grow, though — making a tiny server scale up to do a lot more can be ugly. If you’re already serving HTTP pages to a human with a web browser, consider that you may have to add features to it later. Something like <strong><em>that</em></strong> is already fairly large from the word “go”.</p>

<p><strong>When It’s ‘Just’ an API Server</strong>: Rails has less to offer an API server that speaks JSON over the wire. A lot of its HTTP security doesn’t matter for that case (e.g. SQL injection safeguards, XSS prevention.) While ActiveRecord can be nice for some database use cases, Rails really shines when you’re building an HTML site that talks to browsers. Very small projects that mostly speak a structured format read by machines will often get less from Rails.</p>

<p>Related to that is when you’re doing in-browser rendering and Rails is ‘just’ serving JSON. It’s a weird kind of in-between case. A lot of Rails security and convenience functions no longer help you, but you’re still doing things where internal libraries (ActiveRecord, ActiveJob, ActionMailer) can be highly useful. But if you’re never rendering HTML on the server and you’re very sure you never will, Rails will probably help you less.</p>

<h2>When Is Rails Not Enough?</h2>

<p>Rails is also designed for a small team and a medium-sized codebase. A huge team (lots of programmers) or a huge codebase (lots of controllers, models and/or lines of code) will tend to drag down the standard Rails-app structure.</p>

<p>Ruby allows for a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">non-local effects</a>. Whether that’s monkeypatching, writing to a database or creating new types at runtime, Ruby isn’t designed for a team of 200 programmers where you don’t trust some of them. There are too many ways for them to cause you trouble. You can use <a href="https://sorbet.org/">good tooling</a> to scale Ruby to larger teams, but even that will <a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/troubleshooting#escape-hatches">tend to have exceptions and difficulties</a>. That’s not really Ruby’s sweet spot.</p>

<p>In most cases you can cut up a large project into smaller projects. If one Rails app is too big, you can often separate it into multiple apps, or a thinner app with more back-end services, or an app and a separate microservice, or… One way or another there is usually a way to separate out smaller pieces. Ruby strongly encourages that, as do I.</p>

<p>There are also not-quite-Rails structures that can scale better. Avdi Grimm’s (now retired) <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13481927-objects-on-rails">Objects on Rails</a> was an attempt in that direction, as is <a href="https://medium.com/@vsavkin/hexagonal-architecture-for-rails-developers-8b1fee64a613">the Hexagonal architecture for Rails</a>, which in turn has a lot in common with the older and more general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">N-tier architecture</a>.</p>

<p>But at some point you might want to consider a different framework. <a href="https://hanamirb.org/">Hanami</a> is an obvious choice, designed to be less quick and nimble than Rails for getting a tiny app off the ground, but more scalable if you want to use the same code with a lot more contributors.</p>

<p>I’d still start out in Rails, personally. If you’re building something quickly to see if anybody cares, I know of no framework that comes close to its productivity. Wait to rewrite (in a more rigid framework) until you’re successful and you can afford the drag on your development speed.</p>

<p>The other worry here can be performance. If you’re rewriting a project that is already as large as the current Basecamp… then you’re <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/only-15-of-the-basecamp-operations-budget-is-spent-on-ruby/">actually fine for performance</a>. Rails still scales <strong><em>great</em></strong> for them. But if you’re looking at something a hundred times larger (which by definition means B2C, not B2B) then you might have a situation where your server costs are substantially greater than your engineering payroll. In that case it can make sense to slow down your engineers to pay lower server costs. To check this, see what your EC2-or-equivalent costs are <strong><em>just for your application servers</em></strong>, which are what run Rails. And check your payroll <strong><em>just for web engineers</em></strong>, which is who writes in Rails. Normally the engineering payroll is much larger and you should stick with trading cheap machine time for expensive engineering time. But at some point the balance may tip and you should consider raising your engineering payroll to cut your server costs.</p>

<h2>When Does Rails Have the Wrong Assumptions?</h2>

<figure>
    <a href="https://rubymadscience.com/img/dr_bear_microscope_bigthumb.png">
      <img src="https://rubymadscience.com/img/dr_bear_microscope_bigthumb.png" alt="A pirate, a bear and a chimp sit at a wicker table. The bear looks into a very old-fashioned microscope as the other two look on." title="They're checking the microscope for real-world use cases where Rails might be wrong.">
    </a>
        <figcaption>They’re checking the microscope for real-world use cases where Rails might be wrong.</figcaption> 
</figure>

<p>Before checking if Rails’ assumptions are right for you, we should see what those assumptions actually are.</p>

<p>Before you take my word for it, I recommend taking <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/">David Heinemeier Hansson’s word for it</a> in the form of The Rails Doctrine. It’s a great document and it covers a lot of ground.</p>

<p>Indeed, if you want to better understand why Rails isn’t amazing for large, low-trust teams, you should read <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#provide-sharp-knives">“Provide Sharp Knives”</a> in the Rails Doctrine several times. A lot of Rails’ tradeoffs are entirely by design.</p>

<p>Rails also has some simpler assumptions: it assumes you’re writing an interactive app with server-rendered HTML. It assumes that security is vital (Rails trades a lot for security) but that you don’t want to build your own custom security system in most cases. And it assumes that you either have a small, excellent team doing prototyping work (“Provide Sharp Knives”) or that you have a possibly-mediocre team that needs powerful built-in guidelines (<a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#omakase">“The Menu is Omakase.”</a>)</p>

<p>Rails also assumes you want high developer velocity at a cost of technical debt. In other words, it’s designed for building very quickly. That makes sense when <strong><em>technical execution is not your biggest risk</em></strong>. For instance: if you’re building a small startup, and you’re pretty sure you can build the site but people may not buy your product, you are dominated by market risk. That’s when Rails is perfect. You want to build very quickly. And even if you build perfectly, you’re probably going to have to throw away the result for nontechnical reasons, like “people don’t want to buy it.”</p>

<p>As part of “high dev velocity, technical debt is okay” Rails assumes things like, “you’ll want to use a lot of gems” and “dependencies that work are fine if they speed you up.”</p>

<p>Rails assumes you don’t mind scaling out application servers horizontally (by bringing more of them online.) It’s designed to scale well <strong><em>if</em></strong> you can do that. Rails assumes CPU is fairly cheap and it’s usually right about that. Relatedly, Rails assumes that the database is usually your most serious performance bottleneck, which is how web applications usually work.</p>

<p>Rails also assumes you’ll have some calculation or data transformation in your application. It assumes that it’s okay to use some CPU because you’ll be doing that anyway.</p>

<p>(When does that last assumption matter? Let’s talk about Evented Servers and see.)</p>

<h2>What Isn’t Rails Good At?</h2>

<figure>
    <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/when-should-you-not-use-rails/node_js_logo.png">
      <img src="http://codefol.io/posts/when-should-you-not-use-rails/node_js_logo.png" alt="The Node.js logo." title="Sometimes you need it, or something like it.">
    </a>
        <figcaption>Sometimes you need it, or something like it.</figcaption> 
</figure>

<p>While Rails is great at a lot of things, there’s one particular task that it’s not amazing for: shim servers.</p>

<p>By “shim servers” I mean servers that do very little calculation but integrate answers from a few other back-end services and relay the result. Imagine a server that queries two JSON services and combines the result with simple string-manipulation, for instance. It does very little calculation, but it juggles a lot of events.</p>

<p>And that’s the relevant word: “events.”</p>

<p>There is a specific kind of app architecture embodied by Node.js and its relatives called “Evented” programming. It can support many thousands, or even millions, of simultaneous connections with a tiny amount of server resources. It can be both high-throughput and low-latency. Its benchmark numbers are matchless… for the cases where it works.</p>

<p>Rails can’t match Evented programming at what Evented programming is good at. Basically no framework can. There are Evented frameworks for Ruby (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine">EventMachine</a>, <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async">Async</a>.) Rails is built differently.</p>

<p>If Evented is so much better, why don’t we use it for everything? Because it doesn’t work for everything. I emphasise calculation per-request because an Evented server will fall down and die if you try to make it do very much calculation per-request. Having one server handle a million connections is no good if each connection …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
            

            

<p>If you’ve been a software engineer for long enough, it is very likely that you’ve seen this example of floating point perfidy:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span>3.0</span> / <span>10</span>
<span>0.3</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span>0.1</span> * <span>3</span>
<span>0.30000000000000004</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We understand that this is due to the fact that floating point numbers, stored
with only 64 bits of precision, cannot represent the entire real number line.
Moreover, when we perform operations with these floating point numbers, the
errors inherent in their representation can accumulate and multiply. The moral
of the story is, never use a floating point number to represent money.</p>
<p>At least, that is the moral for financial applications. At Square, we used a
<code>long amount_cents</code>, and we got along with our lives. However, for most
applications that have a good reason to use floating point, this can’t be the
end of the story. If floating point were the unpredictable, unreliable thing
that I once believed it to be, we wouldn’t be able to numerically solve
differential equations, or linear systems, or land on the moon. Rather, there is
a science of floating point error, forming part of a science of numerical errors
in general, which seeks to tame and understand what happens to errors as they
flow through our calculations. In general, numerical error is something that can
be rather precisely quantified, as we’ll see. Along the way we’ll look at the
Fundamental Axiom of Floating Point Arithmetic, which, at the very least, sounds
way cooler than “10 things every developer should know about floating point
numbers”.</p>
<h2 id="machine-epsilon">Machine Epsilon</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, error in floating point is due to the problem of “roundoff”. Just as in base 10, we cannot represent the
number \(1/3\) without rounding it off somewhere:</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{3} = 0.33333333333333 \dots \approx 0.33333333,
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>in base 2, we cannot represent many numbers without rounding. Of course, some numbers we <em>can</em> represent exactly. The
number 1, for example. Or any integer in the range \((-2^{53}, 2^{53})\). Also notably, many fractions can be exactly
represented:</p>
<p>\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} &amp;= 0.1_2 \\\<br>
\frac{3}{4} &amp;= 0.11_2 \\\<br>
\frac{17}{8} &amp;= 10.001_2 \\\<br>
&amp;\vdots
\end{align*}</p>
<p>However, a number like \(1/10\), just like \(1/3\) in base 10, must be truncated to fit in the 24 or 53 bits of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significand">mantissa</a>. When we enter <code>0.1</code> in a console or in source code, the value that is <em>actually stored</em> is very slightly
different than <code>0.1</code>. According to this excellent <a href="https://www.exploringbinary.com/floating-point-converter/">IEEE-754 Floating Point Converter</a>, the floating point number that is
actually stored (for 64-bit floating point) is</p>
<p>\begin{align*}
&amp;(0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011001101)_2 = \\\<br>
&amp;(0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625)_{10}
\end{align*}</p>
<p>So the initial input to our calculation was flawed! We weren’t calculating <code>0.1 * 3</code>, we were actually calculating</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625</span> * <span>3</span>
</code></pre></div><p>How much of an error is this? We can get an idea by counting the zeros in between the significant
digits, \(0.100\dots 00055\). In this case, there are 16. So in simply entering a number which is not representable
exactly in floating point, we have incurred a relative error of roughly \(10^{-16}\).</p>
<p>Indeed, in <em>all</em> cases we can expect to incur a relative error of
roughly \(10^{-16}\). This magnitude is called machine epsilon, often
written \(\epsilon_{\text{machine}}\). It comes from the relative difference
between two successive floating point numbers. For every representable floating
point number \(x\), there is a <em>next</em> floating point number, and it is
approximately \(x + \epsilon_{\text{machine}} x\). So for an arbitrary real
number \(x_0\), it falls between two floating point values \(x\)
and \(x + \epsilon x\) (leaving off the subscript of \(\epsilon\) for conciseness). When we
represent \(x_0\) in floating point, we will get one of these two values. Let’s denote
the floating point representation of \(x_0\) by \(\text{fl}(x_0)\). The absolute
error incurred just by representing \(x_0\) in floating point is</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
e_{\text{abs}} = |\text{fl}(x_0) - x_0| \leq \max(|x_0 - x|, |x_0 - (x + \epsilon x)|) \leq |\epsilon x|.
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>The relative error, then, i.e. the absolute error divided by the true value, is</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
e_{\text{rel}} = \frac{e_{\text{abs}}}{x_0} \leq \frac{|\epsilon x|}{x_0} \approx \epsilon.
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>Cool! So we’ve seen that the worst we can do, in relative terms, when representing a floating point number, is
approximately \(10^{-16}\). This is, for almost all practical purposes, <em>very good</em>. Because remember, we’re speaking of
a relative error. That means we’re able to represent even very small values, very accurately. Here’s the nearest floating point
number to \(10^{-20}\):</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
0.000000000000000000009999999999999999451532\dots
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>If you’re curious, I invite you to count the 9’s. There are 16 of them. Even when dealing with extremely small numbers,
we maintain the same relative precision.</p>
<h2 id="the-fundamental-axiom-of-floating-point-arithmetic">The Fundamental Axiom of Floating Point Arithmetic</h2>
<p>Now you might be thinking, wait! It’s all good and well that we can get excellent relative accuracy when <em>representing</em>
floating point numbers, but what about when we go to <em>do</em> something with them? Here we’ve got two floating point
numbers, both of which are inexact, and we’re about to multiply them! Who knows what might happen?</p>
<p>This concern is well-founded, because the algorithms of floating point arithmetic must be implemented with finite
precision. If we are asked to multiply two large numbers with pen and paper, the algorithm that most
of us will use is the one we learned in school, which involves lots of addition, carrying, sub-multiplications, and so
on. If all of those intermediate steps are using some kind of binary representation, then the intermediate products may
be losing precision as we go along! This seems like a recipe for disaster. Fortunately, there is a property that we can
require of a floating point implementation, one which is satisfied by IEEE-754 and most other popular floating point
standards, that will save us from total anarchy. This is what Trefethen and Bau, <em>Numerical Linear Algebra</em>, refer to
as the <strong>Fundamental Axiom of Floating Point Arithmetic</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All floating point arithmetic operations are exact up to a relative error of \(\epsilon_{\text{machine}}\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that for any two floating point numbers, say \(x\) and \(y\), any operation involving them will give a floating
point result which is within a factor of \(1 + \epsilon_{\text{machine}}\) of the true result. This is easiest to
understand if we use a special notation to represent the floating point version of, say, \(+\). Let’s write \(\oplus\) to
denote floating point addition, and \(+\) to denote exact addition. Then the Fundamental Axiom tells us,</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
\frac{|(x \bigoplus y) - (x + y)|}{x + y} \leq \epsilon_{\text{machine}}.
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>Remember, \(x\) and \(y\) are exactly representable as floating point numbers, but of course they are also, mathematically,
just real numbers. So \(x + y\) is a real number (point on the number line), which <em>may not be exactly representable in
floating point</em>. The Fundamental Axiom is telling us that the floating point operation \(\oplus\) can do no worse than
simply trying to represent the number \(x + y\) as a floating point value directly, assuming our computer had access to the
mathematical, infinite precision object \(x + y\).</p>
<p>Put another way, we incur no extra error by going through floating point
arithmetic than we would by using a magical computer to do exact arithmetic on
our floating point values and then casting back to floating point. In
mathematical terms,</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
\frac{\left|(\text{fl}(a) \oplus \text{fl}(b)) - (a + b)\right|}{a + b} \approx \frac{\left|\text{fl}(\text{fl}(a) + \text{fl}(b)) - (a + b)\right|}{a + b} \approx \epsilon_{\text{machine}}.
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>Recall that \(\text{fl}(a)\) is the mathematical number we actually represent when
we try to represent \(a\) in floating point. So the first fraction gives the
relative error from performing \(\oplus\) on the floating point representations
of \(a\) and \(b\), and the second fraction gives the relative error from performing
the exact arithmetic operation, \(+\), on the floating point representations
of \(a\) and \(b\), then casting the result to floating point.</p>
<h2 id="error-analysis">Error Analysis</h2>
<p>The Fundamental Axiom of Floating Point Arithmetic allows us to analyze the numerical error that may be incurred by even
complex arithmetic operations. To see an idea of how this works, let’s consider the problem of computing the length of a
2D vector, \([x, y]\). Mathematically, this has the form</p>
<p>\begin{equation*}
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\end{equation*}</p>
<p>There are several stages to the computation, and at each one we will incur a little bit of numerical error:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the numbers \(x\) and \(y\) into the computer, incurring roundoff error.</li>
<li>Compute \(x^2\) and \(y^2\), using floating point multiplication.</li>
<li>Compute \(x^2 + y^2\), using floating point addition.</li>
<li>Compute \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), using the floating point square root operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>At each step, the result we get will be equal to the true result, times some error factor \((1 + \epsilon)\), where
each \(\epsilon\) is very small, on the order of \(\epsilon_\text{machine}\). Each operation may have a different
error \(\epsilon\), but we’ll use the same symbol for all of them. We don’t care so much about the exact value
of \(\epsilon\), only that it is very small.</p>
<p>We’re going to carry these \(\epsilon\) through the computation to see how they
affect the final result. To make that easier, we can use special rules of arithmetic to manipulate \(\epsilon\):</p>
<ul>
<li>\(\epsilon^2 = 0\). If \(\epsilon \approx 10^{-16}\), then \(\epsilon^2 \approx 10^{-32}\), which is so small that we just
decide to completely ignore it.</li>
<li>\((1 + \epsilon)^2 = 1 + 2\epsilon + \epsilon^2 = 1 + 2\epsilon\).</li>
<li>\(\sqrt{1 + \epsilon} = 1 + \frac{\epsilon}{2} - …</li></ul></div></div>

            <div id="post">
                
                <p><span>04 August 2020</span></p><p><img src="https://monokh.com/img/ledger.jpg" width="400" alt="ledger device"></p>
<p>This post will disclose a vulnerability in the Ledger hardware wallets that can lead to theft of user funds.</p>
<p>An attacker can exploit this method to transfer Bitcoin while the user is under the impression that a transaction of
    another, less valuable altcoin (e.g. Litecoin, Testnet Bitcoins, Bitcoin Cash, etc.) is being executed</p>
<p>If you use bitcoin forks on your device, you could be affected. You should avoid using these ledger apps until fixes are available.</p>
<p>The issue has been disclosed to Ledger but remains unaddressed. See <a href="#disclosure-timeline">Disclosure Timeline</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The ledger device exposes bitcoin (mainnet) public key and signing functionality outside of the "Bitcoin"
    app. It presents misleading transaction confirmation requests indicating the selected app's addresses and amounts
    when in fact different transactions are being signed.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>To support an asset on Ledger devices, you must install the corresponding app. Ledger devices support multiple
    apps and typically users will use it to store a variety of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Ledger apps are intended to be isolated. Such that only one app is unlocked on the device at once. Unlocking the
    asset allows external communication to prompt for various functions for example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Exporting public keys</li>
    <li>Signing messages</li>
    <li>Confirming transactions</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, from a security perspective, the expectation is that <strong>locked apps are untouchable by external messages.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-issue">The issue</h2>
<p>It was discovered that for Bitcoin and Bitcoin forks, the device exposes it's functions for any of the assets. In
    other words, having unlocked the Litecoin app, you will receive a confirmation request for a Bitcoin transfer while
    the interface presents it as a transfer of Litecoins to a Litecoin address. Accepting the confirmation produces a
    <strong>fully valid signed Bitcoin (mainnet) transaction</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-reproduce">Steps to reproduce:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Open the Litecoin app</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Retrieve mainnet bitcoin (segwit) addresses using <code>getWalletPublicKey('84'/0'/0'/').publicKey</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Query UTXOs and construct a bitcoin transaction to spend outputs</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Send <code>createPaymentTransactionNew(...)</code> to prompt device for signing this transaction</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Receive <strong>Bitcoin Mainnet</strong> valid signed transaction</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Expectation: Ledger device should throw an error at step 2 and step 4 and prevent execution</p>
<p>Actual: Ledger prompts user for a litecoin transaction and produces a valid signed transaction spending the Bitcoin
    utxos</p>
<pre><code> +----------------------------------+

<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of Concept</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/monokh/ledger-app-isolation-bypass-poc" target="_blank">https://github.com/monokh/ledger-app-isolation-bypass-poc</a>
</p>
<p>The PoC demonstrates retrieving a valid signed bitcoin mainnet transaction from the ledger device while user is under
    the impression that a litecoin transaction is being signed.</p>
<p>It spends from the first 20 receive and change addresses of the native segwit bitcoin wallet.</p>
<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>The implications are serious. As briefly covered, users expect to be protected by the ledger device when they have
    not unlocked their Bitcoin app. Yet, while having an altcoin unlocked, external applications can still:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Read the Bitcoin xpub (thereby knowing all addresses belonging to the wallet)</li>
    <li>Prompt Bitcoin transactions from the device that will be displayed as altcoin transactions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attack-methods">Attack methods</h3>
<p>The methods of attack here are many. Essentially, <strong>any trust placed on altcoin ledger apps can be exploited</strong>. Consider
    the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You are invited to try out a new service with testnet coins, that actually sweeps real Bitcoin out of your
        wallet.</li>
    <li>You swap low value coins on an untrusted exchange. The exchange can read your Bitcoin balances and given a good
        enough opportunity will take the exit. You wouldn't have applied the same level care with altcoins.</li>
    <li>You could be targeted with a patched version of Ledger Live that sends Bitcoin instead of altcoins. Then
        prompted to do a P2P trade with altcoins.</li>
</ul>
<p>No investigation has been done on instances of this exploit in the wild.</p>
<h3 id="affected-versions">Affected Versions</h3>
<p><strong>Firmware:</strong> All versions. Currently 1.6.0 <br>
<strong>App Versions:</strong> All versions. Currently 1.4.3<br>
<strong>Apps:</strong> Any apps deriving from the Bitcoin app as per <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin/blob/29717f9c95625ffc3c87176ff000a26d7721ae0d/include/btchip_context.h#L270">btchip_context.h</a><br>
<strong>Apps Tested:</strong> Bitcoin Testnet, Litecoin</p>
<h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h2>
<p>Recommendations for Ledger and users.</p>
<h3 id="ledger">Ledger</h3>
<p>Apps should be completely isolated with regards to the derivation paths that they are allocated to. No public key
    info or signing functionality should be exposed while they are not open.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Altcoin apps should be disabled on the Ledger live app directory and users should be notified to avoid using
        altcoin apps until fixes are available</li>
    <li>Apps/firmware should be updated to prevent this bypass</li>
    <li>Users should be notified to urgently upgrade to the patched versions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="users">Users</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid using altcoin apps until fixes are available</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interactions-with-ledger">Interactions with Ledger</h2>
<p>Based on my experience from the first disclosure (Jan 19), I understood that that they weren't
    motivated to see this issue to completion.</p>
<p>Ledger was aware of the issue before the disclosure as they indicated the latest firmware update includes fixes. Post
    disclosure, they described that the app updates were under QA and that the issue would be disclosed publicly once
    updates have been made. No further progress&nbsp;was observed
    and requests for update received no response.</p>
<p>With the second, more serious disclosure, expectations were already low. I observed that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They minimised the issue to privacy initially</li>
    <li>When pressed for their plans in addressing the vulnerability, had no input.</li>
    <li>Still insisted on a 90 day disclosure period despite being fully aware of issue for 1y 6mo minimum (during development
        of firmware 1.5.5)</li>
    <li>No further communications regarding steps to fix or disclose. Requests for comment had no response.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the interactions described above, it was apparent that there was no intention to address the issue and the
    disclosure period would not yield any results. Nonetheless I gave them the benefit of the doubt and afforded some
    patience.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>I do not consider myself a security expert. Despite this, I was able to discover this issue while developing and
    experimenting with Ledger support on <a href="https://liquality.io/" target="_blank">Liquality</a>. It is worrying
    that the vulnerability did not utilise any complicated techniques such as side-channel attacks, buffer overflows
        etc. This could indicate that there are other issues undiscovered or in plain sight.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most shocking conclusion is the negligence from Ledger regarding the handling of this issue. For an issue
    with this severity, to not attempt a fix, not communicate progress and avoid disclosure, is disrespectful towards
    the trust that people (including myself) have placed on them. With their increased focus in other departments
    (integrating alt coins, trading), I urge them to reconsider their attention to security. Such should be the
    commitment to a hardware wallet.</p>

August 4, 2020 | https://homehack.nl/degoogle-my-life/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://homehack.nl/degoogle-my-life/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>According to Wikipedia to DeGoogle is the act of removing Google from your life. As the growing market share of the internet giant creates monopolistic power for the company in digital spaces, increasing numbers of journalists have noted the difficulty to find alternatives to the company’s products. This is my experience to purge my life of Google and I can assure you it’s difficult but if we don’t act soon it will become impossible.</p><div>
		
<p>It’s been 1.5 years since Google+ closed and <a href="https://homehack.nl/category/social/page/2/">I started dipping my toes</a> into the Fediverse and other distributed social networks. It also kicked off my search to get rid of everything Google. To <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGoogle">DeGoogle</a> is easier said than done because Google is everywhere from search to fonts, from the video platform YouTube to the file storage and synchronisation service Google Drive, and from blog publishing service Blogger to the Google mobile operating system Android. And the list goes on. So chances are you’re using a lot of these services and most of them require a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Account">Google account</a>, a devious move from Google. It’s for this reason that it’s very hard to get rid of this o so convenient account.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1493" data-permalink="https://homehack.nl/degoogle-my-life/google_shattered/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/homehack.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Google_shattered.png?fit=692%2C261&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="692,261" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Google_shattered" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/homehack.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Google_shattered.png?fit=300%2C113&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/homehack.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Google_shattered.png?fit=692%2C261&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/homehack.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Google_shattered.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" alt="Shattered Google logo illustrates that we need to break the power of Google on the web." srcset="https://i0.wp.com/homehack.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Google_shattered.png?w=692&amp;ssl=1 692w, https://i0.wp.com/homehack.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Google_shattered.png?resize=300%2C113&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The shattered Google logo (that I made in Inkscape) illustrates that we need to break the power of Google on the web.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To get a more comprehensive view take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products">this article</a>. Below I’ve compiled a list of the most important Google services and products that I replaced with something else.</p>



<h2>Google Search</h2>



<p>Search was perhaps the easiest to replace (or is it). While Google search is by far the largest search engine in the world DuckDuckGo (DDG) is becoming <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic">increasingly popular</a>. I’ve  used DDG to great satisfaction and only had to use Google search a couple of times. The only gripe that I have is that DDG isn’t free and open source software (FLOSS) let alone distributed. In that respect I’ve read some good things about <a href="https://searx.me/">Searx</a> and I may give that a try in the future.</p>



<h2>Chrome</h2>



<p>The Chrome browser of Google has become very popular with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#Market_share">estimated market share of approximately 70%</a>. A large portion of the Chrome’s source code is based on Chromium, the open source browser project from Google,  however Chrome is proprietary freeware because it contains large blobs of proprietary code. The Spyware Watchdog considers <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/chrome.html">Chrome’s Spyware level extremely high</a> this due to multiple spyware features that are built-in such as Google Account and Navigation Assistance. Another threat come from the earlier mentioned market share. This gets even worse when we include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Active">other browsers that are based on Chromium</a> such as Microsoft Edge, Opera and Vivaldi.  I currently use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>. It’s perhaps not the most privacy minded browser around but it’s FLOSS, it has a reasonable market share which is important for support of web developers and development of Firefox is very active. </p>



<h2>YouTube</h2>



<p>Next is YouTube which BTW is becoming more and more annoying with all these ads and the recommendations with the sole purpose to keep the user as long as possible on YouTube (and serve even more ads). I invested a lot in YouTube in the past with over 70 video made about 3D CAD, 3D printing and electronics so replacing it is not easy. The solution that I found is two-fold. I remastered (part) of my existing videos and uploaded them to both <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a> and YouTube. If I want to watch YouTube videos I use <a href="https://www.invidio.us/">Invidious</a> in the browser of <a href="https://newpipe.schabi.org/">NewPipe</a> on my Smartphone (still Android sadly).  </p>



<h2>Google Drive</h2>



<p>Over the years I got dependant on Google Drive e.g to store the CAD files that I wanted to share after I published a project either in blog or a video. I want readers and viewers to be able to reproduce the project. Since I didn’t want to self-host a solution <s>such as <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> wasn’t for me</s> (see edit below). I started looking for a paid service. I currently have a contract with Strato, a German hosting company that also hosts my websites. Strato offers HiDrive, it’s not FLOSS unfortunately but it offers 100% storage in the EU and (paid) end-to-end encryption is possible although only in the HiDrive desktop program for Windows (which is a bummer but I don’t need encryption for this purpose anyway).</p>



<h2>Google Maps</h2>



<p>Instead of Google maps I started using <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> and products based on OpenStreetMap such as <a href="https://osmand.net/">OsmAnd</a> (on Android) and <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Komoot">Komoot</a> both on Android and the web browser. Komoot is excellent for hiking and cycling but unfortunately it isn’t FLOSS. These alternatives have proven to be good enough for me since I haven’t used Google Maps any more. </p>



<h2>Gmail</h2>



<p>I somehow started using Gmail. I don’t know exactly why because I already had very good email services. I also fail to understand why it’s so popular because every other email service does about the same. My own ISP comes with a very good email service and so is the web hosting company that I’m using. To stop using Gmail takes some preparation most importantly to list and notify all the people and organisations that send you email to your Gmail address. Also list all online services that use your Gmail address. Now replace this Gmail address with another email address.</p>



<p>You may want to delete your Gmail completely but it’s possible that it’s linked to your Google account. If this is the case you can either <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Your-Email-Address-on-Google">use a different email address </a>for this account or more radical <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-your-gmail-account-1172073">delete your Google account</a> completely. In case you choose the latter remember that lots of Google services are couples to your Google account and can’t be accessed any more. Having said that if you start to purge Google from your life the Google account becomes less and less important with every Google service that you delete. So at a certain point deleting the Google account will be painless.</p>



<h2>Android</h2>



<p>Although Android is Free and Open Source software most Android phones come with proprietary software and services that prevent users from using the phone the way they seem fit. The easy way to free the software on your phone is to install <a href="https://f-droid.org/">FDroid</a>. For most users the Google Play Store is the only way to install software on their phone. FDroid is an alternative software store that enables the user to easily install and maintain Free and Open Source software on their Android device. BTW installing FDroid and replacing proprietary apps is what I have done thus far and it’s a good start.</p>



<p>Even better is to replace the Google infested Android with a free version of Android like <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>. LineageOS is a FLOSS version of Android that can be used without a Google account and that comes without the proprietary Google apps (and perhaps other junk from the phone manufacturer). Make sure to check if your phone is supported before trying to install in on your phone.</p>



<h2>Fonts</h2>



<p>Yes I know, I have Google fonts in my blog. That came with the choice of the WordPress theme and I didn’t realize that at the time. That’s just another example how Google infested the web and how difficult it is to DeGoogle my life but rest assured fonts will be next.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>To get Google out of your digital life is hard, very hard. This tells us how much Google is integrated into our lives and probably for the most part without being aware of it. Luckily we still have choice (other than just say goodbye to the web), choice that gives us freedom to use the web without being used. The freedom to control our data and not being exploited. </p>



<p>E<em>dit: As someone on Mastodon pointed out it’s not necessary to self-host NextCloud. Examples of cloud service providers running Nextcloud are <a href="https://disroot.org/en/services/nextcloud">Disroot</a>, <a href="https://www.owncube.com/index_en.php">OwnCube</a> and <a href="https://operationtulip.com/">Operationtulip.com</a> (currently in beta). </em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3389">

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of its mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

<iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0On19DRA2fU?start=88" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="lazy lazy-hidden mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></center><p>Truthfully, we’re all being held hostage. I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

They usually don't make a lot of sense themselves and are rarely representative of your desires or beliefs. Think of them as a background process that keeps your brain in tune with the world around you<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. </p><p>Dreams become more vivid when there are changes in your sleep quality and timing. Stress, anxiety &amp; uncertainty affect your sleep quality. Think of the night before a big event like a job interview. Falling asleep gets that much harder, and your sleep quality is usually worse. This leads to more vivid dreams.</p><h2 id="dreams-as-a-function-of-rem-sleep">Dreams as a function of REM sleep</h2><p>Dreams mostly occur during the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage of your sleep <sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. Every night you go through 3 different types of sleep - Light, Deep &amp; REM - in a cyclical process that lasts about 90 minutes. The time you spend in each type of sleep depends on the time of night. Earlier in the night you spend majority of the 90 minutes in light &amp; deep sleep. Earlier in the mornings is when you get most of your REM sleep. </p><p>The amount of REM you get each night is also controlled by how much REM sleep you've been getting over the past few days. Get too little REM sleep? Your body compensates for it by spending longer periods in REM sleep. This is why you experience a lot of dreams in the morning after a heavy night of drinking. Alcohol is a REM depressant and once its effects wear off, your body tries to catch up on REM sleep. Its a phenomenon called REM rebound. </p><p>Amount of time in REM this cycle = f(Current time, Amount of REM sleep over the past few days)</p><p>The pandemic has caused many changes in the way we live and work. Not having a morning commute means many people have the chance to sleep in. If you've been REM deprived in the past, and are spending more time in the morning sleeping, you are in REM rebound. This can lead to more vivid and frequent dreams. If your sleep schedule is inconsistent, you are getting a lot of REM on some nights and much less on others. This also leads to REM rebound and more vivid dreams.</p><h2 id="heightened-dream-recall">Heightened dream recall</h2><p>The emotions felt on a daily basis govern our dreams. Bizarre and negative dreams are a way of coping with everyday stressors. Dreams activate a neuron called serotonin 5-HT2A <sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. This neuron turns off a part of the brain called the dorsal prefrontal cortex. The result is “emotional disinhibition” a state in which emotions flood the consciousness.</p><p>We dream many times a night but our dream recall is usually poor. A sudden increase in anxiety and uncertainity leads to decrease in sleep quality. Poor sleep quality results in more night-time awakenings. Its much easier to remember your dreams when you keep waking up in the middle of the night.</p><p>The pandemic has raised anxiety &amp; stress levels across society. The dreams we experience reflect these emotions. Throw in high dream recall, and you get vivid, weird &amp; frequent dreams. </p><p>None of this is cause for much alarm. If you are generally REM deprived, your body will catch up to it. If you're sleep schedule is inconsistent, switch to a consistent wake up time. If your dreams are bothering you, there is early evidence that "dream mastery" techniques can reduce the intensity <sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>.</p><p>Humans are good at coping with changes long-term. As we start accepting this new normal, odds are these "Pandemic dreams" will subside. </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about sleep and techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Understanding-Sleep" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brain Basics: Understanding Sleep</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11121/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Possible Functions of REM Sleep and Dreaming</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2015.00225/full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The role of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in memory and cognition</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005789419300267?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mediators of Change in Imagery Rescripting and Imaginal Exposure for Nightmares: Evidence From a Randomized Wait-List Controlled Trial</a></p></li></ol></div></div></div>]]>

                <p>You’ll often hear folks claim that it’s well-researched that some developers are ten times (or twenty-seven times! Or more!) as productive as the median developer. They often refer these gifted folks as “10x developers.”</p>

<p>The “well-researched” part is garbage. Completely wrong. There are some studies and they’re terrible.</p>

<p>But is there perhaps some truth to the idea? Let’s talk about that.</p>

<p>And what would “some truth to it” mean? That depends on how you define “productivity.” So let’s look at some definitions.</p>

<h2>“Well-Researched?”</h2>

    <a href="http://codefol.io/posts/urban-legend-of-the-10x-developer/leprechauns_cover.png">
      <img src="http://codefol.io/posts/urban-legend-of-the-10x-developer/leprechauns_cover.png" alt="The cover of Laurent Bossavit's book 'The Leprechauns of Software Engineering.'" title="It's a wonderful, depressing read.">
    </a>
        <figcaption>It’s a wonderful, depressing read.</figcaption> 
</figure>

<p>You may be one of <a href="https://xkcd.com/1053/">today’s lucky 10,000</a> to learn about <a href="https://leanpub.com/leprechauns">Laurent Bossavit’s “The Leprechauns of Software Engineering.”</a> It’s a thoroughly excellent ebook that I recommend highly.</p>

<p>It turns out that we, as software engineers, tend to believe that we’ve researched a few specific things about software engineering and that we know those things scientifically. We’re nearly always wrong about that. For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>The “10x Developer” thing has only a couple of empirical papers that actually even try to measure, and they do a bad job of that</li>
<li>That “changes get exponentially more expensive to fix” based on time-after-writing never had any empirical data behind it and is based on miscopying a theory</li>
<li>“Waterfall” as a project management methodology <strong><em>did</em></strong> basically exist and was used, but the “definitive” paper wasn’t made popular until its enemies did</li>
</ul>

<p>But I can stop spoiling the book for you. It’s worth your time to read it.</p>

<p>In any case, the early studies that found “10x productivity” developers studied different kinds of developers in different environments with minimal controls and far too few developers being sampled. The research is terrible if you want to base any real work on it.</p>

<p>“Leprechauns” goes even further, and basically thinks our field <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> measure this. The claim sounds outlandish, but I think he’s basically right. Until we’re willing to define “productivity,” which is very hard, we’re not going to be able to define a good study around it.</p>

<p>And the horrible quality of the existing studies is a warning to us: designing a bad study doesn’t teach us anything useful.</p>

<h2>Productivity? That’s Lines Per Day, Right?</h2>

<p>Also, are we trying to say that <strong><em>at similar experience levels</em></strong> there are 10x differences between different developers? Or between similar developers in different circumstances? Are we trying to say that there is a 10x difference between one developer on their second week and the same developer in their thirtieth year? Mostly, more experienced developers do different tasks and approach them in different ways, so are we trying to say that there is a 10x difference in a similar task, but where the developer can pick <strong><em>what functionality</em></strong> to implement? Because if so, we’re not going to be able to design a good research study for that. Ever.</p>

<p>So: studies don’t actually say this, partly because coding productivity is <em>really</em> hard to design a reasonable study for. Also because most software engineering research is terrible. Also we have a tendency to cite previous papers as saying things they don’t.</p>

<p>Are you thinking, “that can’t be that hard?” If so, I <strong><em>strongly recommend</em></strong> you read The Leprechauns of Software Engineering. He’s put a lot of effort into tracking previous attempts to show the problems with them. He’s also put a lot of effort into formulating definitions of “productivity” to show how hard it is to show that what you’re measuring should measure that idea of productivity. Basically, if you don’t know what your definition is, you’ll tend to wind up multiple steps away from anything sensible, in a way that leaves your measurement as complete nonsense.</p>

<h2>What Can We Say? Money?</h2>

<p>All right, let’s take it as a given that measuring productivity is really hard. What can we say?</p>

<p>There are some traditional measures of productivity. They’re bad, but they’re a long-established kind of bad. What can we do with that?</p>

<p>One is money. The amount of money a piece of work sells for (either by an employee or a company) has very little to do with the quantity or quality of that work. So: don’t conflate money with either how hard somebody works or how well they work. But can’t we just measure money?</p>

<p>We can.</p>

<p>It’s clear that there is a far greater than 10x difference between the amount of money being made by the highest- and lowest-paid programmers. That’s true if look at employees: early Google employees made many millions, random senior programmers make far less than 1/10th as much. It’s true if you look at founders: the median founder loses money while a few founders make many millions of US dollars. It’s true of freelancers, where the same developer may go from $40/hour to $400/hour or more over a surprisingly short time.</p>

<p>Of course, low-quality code often makes a lot of money. Money isn’t a very good measurement of anything but money. There’s a great Stephen King quote I can’t find — he was asked by somebody how he could be a bestselling author when his writing was so bad. He said, roughly, “listen to your own question. It’s best-<strong><em>selling</em></strong> author, not best-<strong><em>writing</em></strong> author.”</p>

<p>In the tech realm, the early Wordpress code was pretty clearly <strong><em>not</em></strong> good code. I don’t mean “it was in PHP.” I mean it was insecure, inefficient and inconsistent in interfaces. It was, however, astoundingly popular and made a lot of folks a lot of money. Excellent code is often small, so measuring how many lines or how much functionality it has is often missing the point. <strong><em>Well-chosen</em></strong> functionality is usually the point, and that’s often more in the realm of design or product (or occasionally random chance) than of engineering.</p>

<p>Money mostly measures money.</p>

<p>For all the same reasons, popularity mostly measures popularity. There is clearly far more than a 10x difference between the median-popularity and most-popular software, even if you measure developer-by-developer or hour-by-hour.</p>

<p>But we knew that, and it’s not what we actually want to measure.</p>

<h2>Impact?</h2>

<p>Can you show a 10X <strong><em>impact</em></strong>? Not really, no. I mean, you can easily show that some developers have <strong><em>no</em></strong> impact. I worked for a year on DVR firmware that never shipped, and two years on a phone operating system no carrier ever bought. There are many similar stories. So in some sense, if you deployed a web app around 2005 you were an infinite number of times more productive than I was that year.</p>

<p>But “impact” shares the same problems as “money” and “popularity” - it’s easy to show that a staggeringly huge difference exists, but that difference is almost completely detached from how hard or how well the developer actually worked.</p>

<p>Frequently it’s completely random.</p>

<h2>What Would 10x Look Like?</h2>

<p>Part of the reason we want to point at “10x developers” at all is that we’ve worked with developers that seem to write better projects, a lot faster than others. We have a gut-level intuition that some developers are far more productive than the average.</p>

<p>We just don’t know a good way to quantify that. And if we can’t quantify it, we can’t test our gut-level intuition and see if it’s true or not.</p>

<p>Indeed, some people are sure it’s a mirage. “A 10x developer is just a regular developer on a good team with a supportive environment.” “A 10x developer is writing code with so much technical debt the rest of his team is down to 0.1x trying to clean it all up.”</p>

<p>There’s no research for <strong><em>that</em></strong> idea of a 10x Developer either. But it’s not hard to imagine a world where it’s true. If we can’t test any of the variations of 10x Developer then we can’t rule them out.</p>

<p>I, personally, hope I can significantly improve as a developer over my career. It would be nice to think that I’m more useful now than I was 30 years ago. But if we want something as wishful thinking, we should be suspicious of it.</p>

<p>When we look at a meaningless Rorschach Blot Test, the things we crave will mysteriously appear.</p>

<h2>What We Can’t Measure</h2>

<p>I believe there exists something along the lines of a 10x Developer. I have a mental concept of it. It might even have some kind of truth behind it, though it’s hard to tell.</p>

<p>To explain that concept to a non-developer, I might say:</p>

<p>“There are software developers who seem to create useful software quickly. They don’t need much managing. They often ignore managers in favour of producing what’s actually needed. They usually have a good read on company politics, but they work in a position where they don’t need to do much of it. They’re well-trusted, and are often brought in to rescue a team whose project is bogged down.”</p>

<p>And it strikes me, as I write that, how much of it is about the organisation trusting the developer. Much of it is about ignoring structure and rules that, at that moment, would get in the way. A developer usually needs skill and talent to get that trust, but the continuing productivity is about <strong><em>continuing to have the trust of their employer</em></strong>. Just having skill and talent often won’t do it.</p>

<p>In other words, I’ve come to a personal definition that is very similar to “a 10x developer is a solid, ordinary developer with good organisational support.”</p>

<p>Indeed, if you <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/free-electron/">read between the lines of many existing descriptions</a> you’ll see that a lot of it is about organisational support there, too. It’s just written by people who think that if you’re good enough technically, the organisation will let you apply your skill where it will make a difference. That hasn’t been my experience, personally.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that “anybody could be one.” I think actual “solid, ordinary” developers who can do good work on many different types of projects are rare and underrated. But they’re not magic …</p></div></article></div>

<p>TL;DR – Hierarchically arranged API gateways can be used to build “macro” bounded contexts. This can make microservices “less”of a problem by reducing them to an implementation detail within that macro context. This results in a simplified architecture composed of stable interactions between hierarchical domain boundaries.</p>
<hr>
<p>Microservice architectures have many advantages as well disadvantages, and the internet is rife with debate about the size of a “micro”-service. A less talked about problem is the “conceptual sprawl” that individual microservices modelling a rich problem space create. There can be dozens or hundreds of well-defined bounded contexts each represented by a microservice.</p>
<p>However, discovering the right combination of these services to fulfil a new business requirement becomes an increasing challenge. Each individual part (service) may be well designed, but we start losing our way in the exponential number of interactions between them.</p>

<h3>Case Study : Backend for Frontend</h3>
<p>A “backend for frontend” is a service supporting a frontend by combining data from multiple underlying services. This is the node server backing a react app, the controller layer behind thymeleaf/JSP pages and so on.<br>Let’s walk through how new UIs are often built. The first version almost always directly calls existing APIs across many services (likely because there aren’t many such calls). As more and more services need to be called and their data merged into each other in more complicated ways, a debate arises as to whether all this should be done in the frontend or the backend and which team should do this.</p>
<p>The typical response these days is to spin off a “service” which does whatever the frontend team wants it to do.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1024x888.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1024x888.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1024x888.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-300x260.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-768x666.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1070x928.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend.jpg 1330w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1024x888.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-300x260.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-768x666.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1070x928.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend.jpg 1330w"></figure>
<p>While we can think of this new service as a system that supports a particular UI, what it is actually doing is providing an abstraction that allows the frontend to have only a limited exposure to the full complexity of the backend.</p>
<h3>The Cognitive Overhead Problem</h3>
<p>The problem described above happens because a single frontend team cannot possibly deal with a microservice-based backend fragmented into tiny “domain” capsules exposed all at once. The cognitive overhead in combining these tiny pieces into larger things is tremendous. One has to understand all of them as they relate to each other and the ways they communicate with each other (e.g. are they eventually consistent with each other? Do they have independent state machines and how do they relate to each other?).</p>
<p>The other problem is that the underlying architecture is constantly shifting, with more microservices coming up, services getting deprecated and changing contracts etc. All this makes our “abstraction service” brittle. The microservice owners have to be on the lookout for all consumers lest they break them with any change. Service users are always tinkering with their service to keep it in line with the underlying services. Migrations become a permanent fixture on the sprint board.</p>

<p>Given this scenario, a specialized solution in the form of one service for one UI is actually a good solution – it is the only way to move forward! Anyone looking to combine information across multiple domains as defined by each microservice has to create a solution of their own because that is all they can do.</p>
<p>But in the larger scheme of things, this is clearly not a good place to be in. How can we reduce this complexity in combining things so that we are better able to leverage the existing systems?</p>

<h3>Organization in Complex Systems</h3>
<p>Here’s a quick, shallow recap of organization in complex systems.<br>Complex systems are made of hierarchies of independent subsystems. The hierarchical arrangement emerges as an evolutionary response to changing environment and leads to more and more sophisticated features. Each level is a response to needs faced by one or more lower level systems and it abstracts their details while still facilitating their functioning. The overall system is therefore partially resilient to failure of its somewhat independent subsystems. Collectively, this gives to an ever rising dynamic complexity which is highly resilient and adaptive.</p>

<p>If this sounds remarkably similar to distributed system design (buzzwords et al) because it is. Large distributed systems are rich complex systems with all constituent parts interacting with each other and triggering concurrent changes in each other. So let’s try to bring some systems thinking to bear on the problem of custom backends-for-frontends.</p>
<p>The custom backend-for-frontend we just saw is the microservice architecture’s highly specialized evolutionary response to the pressure of the external world, viz. the functional requirements of the frontend and the limited time in which to meet those requirements. Evolutionary timescales are generally long because the system tries out many combinations before “discovering” what works best in the new environment. However, by putting a timeline on “survival” we have hamstrung the usual mechanics resulting in a system response much like growing corns to protect against shoes that pinch instead of allowing better shoes to “emerge”.</p>

<p>The evolutionary pressure is also intense because there is no sense of hierarchy in our microservice architecture. The entire complexity of the domain is laid bare all at once to everyone. While upstream-downstream relationships can be inferred between domains looking at data and call flow, there is no concept of hierarchy of ideas that can simplify comprehension for new users.</p>
<p>So while domains are the building blocks of our systems, we have not yet managed to layer these building blocks in layers of increasing complexity in representation and function.</p>
<h3>Domain Modelling is Hierarchical</h3>
<p>Bounded contexts are the philosophical building blocks of microservice architectures. If we want to layer our architecture, we need to layer our concepts. And as you might imagine, this is not difficult at all! We have the entire organization’s structure to be inspired, and since domain driven systems tie in very closely with how organizations are organized, there is plenty of opportunity to copy-paste.</p>
<p>Our organization’s structure clearly tells us that a “domain” can mean very different things at different levels of abstractions. As soon as we say “abstraction”, we know that we are in a hierarchical world.</p>
<p>If you have ever seen a junior developer try to explain a production outage to a senior manager, you know what I am talking about. The minutiae of system implementation don’t matter to the senior manager because at his level of operation, “outage due to timeout in calling payment authentication service from checkout validator service” is interpreted as “outage in checkout due to payment system”. He doesn’t care about “timeout”, “authentication”, “validator” or “service” – he cares about “checkout”, “outage”, and “payment”. The CEO doesn’t even care about “checkout” and “payment”, he probably just hears “tech” and “outage”.</p>
<p>This gives us a direct line to solving our problem – let’s bundle our bounded contexts in a way that all contexts in one group can be represented by one word. This is the reverse process of how we break down the system into microservices; a microservice-to-monolith migration, if you will.</p>
<h3>Representing domain hierarchies</h3>
<p>So we want to bundle multiple closely allied domains (physically represented by their corresponding microservices) into a single umbrella.and then those umbrellas into a larger umbrella and so on. Note that the bundling process is subjective because people can disagree with what “closely allied” means. An instinct for naming is a good guide – the collective name should not sound dissonant from the individuals.</p>

<p>In the real world, a higher level domain can be represented by a separate team (Payment Coordination Team) or a separate manager at a certain level (VP, Director, Architect etc). How do we do this in the technical world? If we want to build an interface that can span across multiple internal systems and combine them into a cohesive experience wrt system vocabulary and capabilities, then we need not look farther than an API Gateway.</p>
<h3>API Gateways</h3>
<p>API gateways are used as single points of ingress and egress of data from the system. They are typically the points where administrative functions like authentication, rate limiting etc are applied. Companies often employ “public” API gateways to expose a limited subset of their tech stack to external users (external meaning any software not running on the company’s servers, including mobile apps).</p>

<p>The traditional role of API gateways has been that of gatekeepers of all traffic coming into the company. They are meant to be lightweight with no business logic (though they may contain minimal schema transformations), and they often expose an aggregate of the capabilities of multiple internal components as a single unit. E.g. Signing up for a website via its API gateway might create an account in the “User Service” and create a newsletter subscription in the “Newsletter Service” in one go.</p>
<h3>API Gateway as domain boundaries</h3>
<p>The backend-for-frontend we saw earlier is essentially an API gateway designed from the wrong side, i.e., by consumers of the API rather than publishers of APIs. The consumer is compelled to do so because no standard conceptual hierarchies exist for them to leverage.</p>
<p>We can apply this API gateway’s aggregation capability in an internal context to develop coarse-grained system boundaries between our microservices to model hierarchical domains. We can hide the microsevices we had previously put under the same umbrella behind an API gateway which now represents the new domain boundary. No one is allowed to call these services directly. Any capabilities that need to be exposed must be exposed via the API gateway.</p>

								<p>Almost everybody has a Woke Breaking Point. A point of <em>Peak Woke</em>. Or, at least, they should.</p>
<p>There should always be a line that, once crossed, signifies to someone that the ostensibly good or noble thing they currently support has soured or, as the case may be, gone completely bad. We all know the history of the twentieth century (or, so I delude myself into believing). Certain features of the Woke ideology, even if only on its extreme fringe, show shocking potential for being a totalitarian nightmare unfolding before our eyes, especially because so many good and decent people so vigorously (and viciously) support it all of a sudden. Even the rapidity with which it is spreading is disorienting, and thus alarming.</p>
<p>I realized the importance of establishing a “Woke breaking point” the other night while discussing the bizarre defenses of our current era with a brilliant friend. We were talking about the people in our lives who have hit their Woke breaking points and those who haven’t. It struck me that many of the people in my life who remain sympathetic or outright denialist about the excesses of the Woke (Critical Social Justice) movement haven’t grappled with the possibility that it isn’t quite the noble and necessary cause that it sells itself to be.</p>
<p>What I realized is how very helpful it is for people, rather than becoming confrontational, to encourage their Woke-sympathetic friends to start identifying and naming what their non-negotiable lines will be. People’s lines will—and should—vary, but as things get increasingly extreme, they will also get crossed more and more certainly. Knowing the line has been crossed, however, takes <em>knowing there is a line</em> and&nbsp;<em>where it is</em>.</p>
<p>The question to pose, then, is simple enough: <em>What would it take for you to say that the Woke movement has gone too far?</em></p>
<p>Why should you ask this? Two reasons, given how out of hand the movement already is. First, people should be asked to grapple with the idea that things could possibly go too far, or even that they already have. Second, in circumstances like these threaten to be, everyone should stake out at least some tentative line that their current principles won’t let them cross, and they need to do this&nbsp;<em>before</em> they’ve already crossed it and been forced to defend that which they currently find indefensible.</p>
<p>This simple act of getting people to commit to their principles before they let them slip is of tremendous importance and use because of how we process our moral reasoning. We do this by <em>post-hoc rationalization</em>, meaning that we lawyer ourselves into believing we acted morally after act, which often means after we’ve already crossed the line. Drawing a clear line ahead of time, especially in a social context where accountability weighs in, makes it that much easier to see the line, bright and clear, and that much harder to cross first and rationalize after.</p>
<p>To get real about this, you shouldn’t expect this conversation to go well. It might, of course, depending on the relationship, but it’s very likely to be received defensively or with an assumption that you’ve lost your mind. So here’s some advice: Don’t expect it to go well. Don’t expect them to come around. Don’t expect them to take you seriously. Just get the question out there where they have to think about it.</p>
<p>You also don’t have to push the issue, and you shouldn’t. If you meet resistance, it’s best not to argue or damage your relationship, and you should know you won’t have to. There’s no need to force it. You can ask the question and then just leave them with it. The question will bother them basically forever if they refuse to play, and let it. Let it do its work. It’s far more important for them to grapple with than it is for you to get an answer to.</p>
<p>Then again, they might want to explore and engage. That’s even better.</p>
<p>My friend and I discussed some of the breaking points that were crossed for us and for people we know. For me, it was something between seeing unfair witchhunt-like haranguing applied to public figures I respected (falsely accusing them of racism and sexism), the subversive manipulation of language, and, especially, the brazen attacks on science coming from both the activist and scholarly communities around Critical Social Justice. This happened for me a few years ago. For my friend, it was the undeniable <em>real </em>racism and blatant double-standards at the heart of much of the Woke activist enterprise. For some of our friends, the public defense of riots in Woke language—like “whiteness is property,” so it’s okay to burn down a business—was a bridge too far. For others, it was being bullied into allyship that’s never good enough. For so many more, it’s just the outright racism.</p>
<p>Of course, I also hear from people citing the tearing down of statues (including George Washington’s), people losing their jobs, people being afraid to lose their jobs, “Shut down STEM,” people’s relationships falling apart (including otherwise healthy interracial marriages, in particular), and a wide variety of other clear signals that things have gone too far with this moral panic and the bad ideas rising to prominence within it. For more and more people, these need to stop.</p>
<p>So, the question for you is: <em>What is (or was) your Woke breaking point?</em> The question for your friends is the same. I’d love to hear them. Post them in the comments. Where did they cross the line for you?</p>
<p>Even though the conversation won’t go well, don’t be afraid to ask about this directly, because this is important. Get specific if you need to. Ask: Whose statue has to come down? Seriously, whose is the last straw? Abraham Lincoln? Martin Luther King, Jr.? Whose? What freedom has to be stripped? Due process of law? Speech? The right not to suffer cruel and unusual punishment?</p>
<p>Ask: When is enough, enough? Who has to get cancelled? Fired? How many people have to lose their livelihoods? How overt does the racism have to become? How many people have to humiliate themselves in “Antiracist” Struggle Sessions? Who has to be doxxed? Destroyed? Beaten up? Killed? Does it take a public lynching? Or would it take horrors we believed we left behind in the darker chapters of the twentieth century? Where is the uncrossable line between here and there?</p>
<p>The questions have to be asked. They’re something we have had the genuine privilege of not having to ask ourselves in a long time, and it seems like we’ve forgotten. Now, they have to be asked.</p>
<p>For one friend of mine, the line is at “real violence,” whatever that means in the present era. Perhaps it’s the kind the media isn’t spinning excuses for, maybe it means with firearms (it seems not to include the skyrocketing violent crime rates, though). At least it’s a line. At least he’s thinking about it. Another, a scholar, said the obvious perversion of his own academic field would be his last straw. It’s a bit fuzzy, but at least it’s a line and one that seems to fall far short of violence. Violence, he even said, wouldn’t be acceptable, and he’s already very uneasy with the property damage and the general mayhem. At least he’s thinking about it.</p>
<p>But, maybe it has to hit closer to home. Ask: <em>Where is the line?</em> Would it have to be personal? Do they have to be personally denounced a racist? Subjected to an “Antiracist” Struggle Session? Fire? Would it take destroying the thing <em>they</em> love? <em>Their</em> family? <em>Their</em> kids? <em>Their</em> job or career? <em>Their</em> hobby?&nbsp;<em>Their</em> life’s passion? What is it? What’s too far? We have to start asking, and it hardly matters if their breaking point is something selfish. People need to grapple with this. Even if all they can think about is themselves or their closest friends and family, at least they’re thinking about it.</p>
<p>For a close friend of mine, who is quite Woke still but not at all “all in,” we had to go quite far to find an absolute line. He has one. Should I, or other people he’s close to and knows don’t deserve it, get doxxed or start receiving credible death threats for standing up to Wokeness, that will apparently do it (does anybody deserve this, though?). Seems a little extreme to me that my own life would have to be on the line before he’d think surely this is getting out of hand, but at least he has a line. At least he’s thinking about it.</p>
<p>The people you ask should be able to find a Woke breaking point and name it, though, and if not, they need to be pressed on that point. That’s serious. They need to be asked:&nbsp;<em>what does it mean that you can’t imagine this going too far?</em> Maybe it spurs no reflection. The “right side of history” is, after all, quite the Greater Good, but even this is something they need to face up to, if it’s the case. Maybe that, at least, would get them thinking about it.</p>
<p>Again, the goal of this intervention isn’t to get anyone to change their minds. It isn’t even to get them to believe something horrible might be happening, is likely to happen later, or is even plausible in the current situation. It’s only about getting them to engage with their principles now before the machinations of motivated reasoning lead them, eventually, to excuse what they would, as of now, see as inexcusable—at least until it happens.</p>

  <p>On the off chance there’s anyone out there who still believes open software’s “funding” problems reflect something special about software, have a read through <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/the-truth-is-paywalled-but-the-lies-are-free/">Nathan Robinson’s recent editor’s note, “The Truth Is Paywalled But The Lies Are Free”</a>.  Perhaps we can see in another what’s so hard to see in ourselves.</p>

<p>In my reading, the problem here is evident: black-and-white, either-or thinking.  Nathan begins his essay:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paywalls are justified, even though they are annoying. … I try not to grumble about having to pay for content online, because I run a magazine and I know how difficult it is to pay writers what they deserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But by the end, he’s regressed to an insoluble-sounding conflict-of-goals again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Creators must be compensated well.  But at the same time we have to try to keep things that are important and profound from getting locked away where few people will see them.  The truth needs to be free and universal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To this I would respond, not just to Nathan, but to everyone stuck at this impasse:  Don’t worry.  You’re not stuck.  None of the above is true.</p>

<p>Creators needn’t be compensated well just because they are creators.  Creators of valuable works—works valued by others—ought to be compensated.  Creators of highly and broadly valued works ought to be compensated well.  I deserve, and shall assuredly receive, no compensation whatever for the bad musical improvizations, repetitive doodles, or unfunny, dead-end software libraries I churn out from time to time.  Everyone, including me, should be fine with this.</p>

<p>Neither must useful works of every kind cost nothing to everyone.  Even the greatest works remain manifestly irrelevant to the vast majority of people.  And there are myriad, happier mediums between $0, expensive, and exclusive, in one dimension, and effortless, inconvenient, and inaccessible, in the other.</p>

<p>I happen to believe that in most areas of creative work, and in most adjacent industries, giving more away for $0 online would improve outcomes for most players, overall.  Our business instincts and well-worn patterns haven’t quite kept up with the times, and never do.  But there is nothing inherently worse about paying a fee you can afford than enduring an inconvenience you have the time to manage.  When the works we need or want come readily available at affordable costs that we can pay, and paying is easy, there’s no great harm to access or progress or truth.  That cost many not be great.  But if a great many pay it, the results can be.</p>

<p>For those interested in economics, intellectual property, and history in the news industry specifically, I heartily recommend <a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=29452">Will Slauter’s <em>Who Owns the News?</em></a>.  You might also read up a bit on stalwart news institutions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press">like the Associated Press</a>.  What you find might surprise you.</p>

<p>Virgin Atlantic has  filed for bankruptcy protection in the US on Tuesday, being yet another major airline that uses judicial protection in the crisis. The British company founded by billionaire Richard Branson applied for Chapter 15 at the New York Bankruptcy Court.</p>



<p>“The group and its business have been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused an unprecedented near-shutdown of the global passenger aviation industry,” according to the court papers. “Global aviation was one of the first industries to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and is likely to be one of the last to fully recover.”</p>

<p>Virgin Atlantic is a privately held <a href="https://kokpitherald.com/klm-to-lay-off-5000-employees-due-to-covid-19-crisis/">airline</a> company with 51% of the shares belonging to the Virgin group and 49% of Delta Air Lines. Because Virgin Atlantic has business in the US and has American investors, it is authorized to enter Chapter 15, which is a kind of Judicial Recovery for foreign companies.</p>



<p>According to the New York court website, “one of the most important objectives of Chapter 15 is to allow cooperation and communication between American courts and stakeholders with cuts from abroad.”</p>



<p>For now, it is not clear what steps will be taken by <a href="https://www.virginatlantic.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Virgin Atlantic (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virgin Atlantic</a>, which did not apply for the order in the British courts, where it was founded and is based.</p>



<p>It is worth remembering that the sister airline, Virgin Australia, also filed for bankruptcy and is expected to go on sale soon. Virgin Atlantic had already announced the retirement of the Jumbo Boeing 747 and Airbus A330-200 aircraft, in addition to the layoff of more than 3,000 employees due to the dramatic drop in demand.</p>



<p>Its founder, Richard Branson, was even trying to sell part of the company’s space division to save the airline.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-6215155d39820be63dcc"><div><p>This is the fourth installment of an ongoing saga concerning the history of the aether.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where possible, I’ve included the words of the relevant scientists that sought cause for the invisible actions-at-a-distance — light, electromagnetism, and gravity.&nbsp;&nbsp;For several thousand years, the search for mechanism centered on this mysterious, yet undetectable substance called the aether. Please start at&nbsp;<a href="https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/lifeanddeathoftheaether"><span>the beginning</span></a>&nbsp;of the story, so as to frame all that follows appropriately.&nbsp;<br></p><div><p><a href="https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/aether-part-iii"><span>Last time</span></a>, we went deep into the civil war that gripped physics over the nature of light.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wave theorists were continually thwarted by their relentless reliance on the failed analogy of light to the longitudinal waves of sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, the triumvirate of Huygens, Young, and Fresnel brought forward the conception of light as a longitudinally propagating transverse oscillation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, corpuscularists had one last ace up their sleeve: the abominable stellar aberration.</p><p>As we shall see, from here on out, the aberration of light has been a nightmare for physicists since reported in 1728.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bradley"><span>James Bradley</span></a>, a professor of Astronomy at Oxford, was attempting to measure the parallax of light on opposite sides of our planet’s orbit from a distant star.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parallax is the effect you can experience right now by focusing on these words with only one eye at a time — you notice the apparent position of the words shifts right or left of center, ever so slightly.  Parallax is due to uncentered observation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of finding parallax (which proved&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;small on account of the relative distances to the star vs. the diameter of the Earth’s orbit), Bradley noted something even more bizarre: He found a shift in apparent position which occurred exactly opposite parallax, out of phase by 90 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;The distortion of signal is extremely slight — 20 arcminutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is 20/3600 of a degree.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even today, the aberration is so slight that&nbsp;<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aaf8/968d49265cc29bb005c38a2abb3eec395255.pdf"><span>it is not taken into account when calculating star positions by NASA</span></a>.</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596569313430_7559"><div><p>Bradley&nbsp;<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstl.1727.0064"><span>discussed</span></a>&nbsp;happening upon the aberration for the first time,&nbsp;</p><p>“<em>It was chiefly therefore Curiosity that tempted me (being then at Kew, where the Instrument was fixed) to prepare for observing the Star on December 17th, when having adjusted the Instrument as usual, I perceived that it passed a little more Southerly this Day than when it was observed before.</em>”</p><p> What Bradley observed was an aberration of light that occurred only as the Earth became perpendicular to the source during its orbit about the sun. The speed of light was a hot topic, for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_R%C3%B8mer"><span>Roemer</span></a>&nbsp;had quite recently demonstrated the finite speed through his observations of Jupiter’s eclipses, which appeared early when Earth was near and later as we were far.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Bradley looked at the perpendicular location of the Earth during aberration and imagined the lateral contribution of the Earth’s speed to the velocity of light.</p><p>The Earth’s orbital velocity had been known for quite some time, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/curriculum-collections/cosmic-horizons-book/ole-roemer-speed-of-light"><span>Roemer/Huygens contributed the speed of light</span></a>&nbsp;to the calculation. From there, it was a simple trigonometric deduction, using each of these speeds as velocity vectors on a triangle to back-calculate the angle of aberration. In Bradley’s&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.2305.pdf"><span>own words</span></a>,&nbsp;</p><p>“[the aberration]&nbsp;<em>proceeded from the progressive motion of light and the Earth’s annual motion in its orbit. For I perceived, that, if light was propagated in time, the apparent place of a fixed object would not be the same when the eye is at rest, as when it is moving in any other direction, than that of the line passing through the eye and object; and that when the eye is moving different directions, the apparent place of the object would be different.”</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596569313430_10300"><div><div><p>Bradley’s basic idea seems sound enough. It is often described as analogous to running in the rain. When you stand still the drops come straight down, but when you sprint into them, they appear to come at an angle (in reality you’re running into the sides of the drops so the experienced pressure vector is at an angle). This explanation put Bradley squarely in the camp of the corpuscularists. It proved quite easy to deduce the aberration when assuming a star fired a bullet-like drop of light from a given location — presuming light corpuscles like this, the angle of aberration simply described the former location of the emitted light. But the corpuscularist victory would not last long.</p><p>On the other side of the Channel, trouble was brewing. We&nbsp;<a href="https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/aether-part-iii"><span>learned last time</span></a>&nbsp;that Fresnel had essentially won the world over when he mathematically united the notions of interference from Young with the Huygen’s wave theories. One of Fresnel’s collaborators from that period was&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Arago"><span>Francois Arago</span></a>. The&nbsp;&nbsp;French corpusculist,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace#Black_holes"><span>Pierre-Simon Laplace</span></a>, commissioned Arago to look into some astronomical matters. Laplace was quite sure that the gravity of large bodies would retard the speed of light, and so asked Arago to check it out (for this initial speculation about the interaction between of gravity and light, Laplace is often credited with being the father of Black Hole-ology).</p><p>Instead of recording gravitational effects of light, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51891244_Rethinking_the_Foundations_of_the_Theory_of_Special_Relativity_StellarAberration_and_the_Fizeau_Experiment?_esc=publicationCoverPdf&amp;el=1_x_3&amp;enrichId=rgreq-08ff39521bc2490c799b650e1ea2be2d-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzUxODkxMjQ0O0FTOjM0MDU5MzYzODE2NjUzN0AxNDU4MjE1MjU5NjEz">Arago found a contradiction</a> in the explanation for the aberration given by Bradley.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bradley’s reasoning relied on combining the velocity of the Earth’s orbit with that of light.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arago, however, had found that at six-month longitudinal intervals when the Earth’s motion should add or subtract from a star the most, there was <a href="https://www.mathpages.com/rr/s2-05/2-05.htm">no observable change in the predicted focal length</a> that should result from the added speed in either opposing direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2171974_Arago_1810_The_first_experimental_result_against_the_ether">In a separate experiment,</a> Arago observed the aberration through a very thick prism, which according to the corpuscularists should change the aberrational angle significantly but did not. Light’s speed appeared irreconcilably constant regardless of motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bradley’s vector addition was in trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Arago and his colleagues tried desperately to talk themselves out of the constancy of the vacuum speed of light.&nbsp;&nbsp;They imagined, incorrectly, that perhaps there were other rays, beyond those visible, that travel at differing velocities:</p></div><p>“<em>It seems [that] ... one can only explain the observation by assuming that luminous bodies emit rays with all sorts of velocities, provided one also admits that these rays are visible only when their velocities fall between specific limits. In effect, in this hypothesis the visibility of the rays will depend on their relative velocities, and, as these same velocities determine the quantity of the refraction, the visible rays will also always be refracted in the same way.”</em></p><div><p>Arago turned to his pal, Fresnel <a href="https://skullsinthestars.com/2008/07/05/what-a-drag-aragos-experiment-1810/">to rectify the matter</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresnel imagined that the aether within the prism did not attain the speed of the prism itself, because it was only partially dragged by the object. This launched a new epic in aether history: The search for the aether drag.&nbsp;&nbsp;This topic is well worth its own post, so I’ll leave the details to our next session. Without getting too far out of sequence, we must recognize that Fresnel’s mathematical formulation of the aether drag is essentially reproduced in Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity, which is the go-to explanation for the aberration today.</p><p>But we have to note that there remain occasionally debated inconsistencies with the relativistic interpretation of the aberration and one might even say that relativity has not quantitatively improved upon Bradley’s conception. For instance, one of the postulates of Relativity is that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames, which obviously rules out additive velocities of light. To get around this, Einstein simply kicked the can down the road to the parameter, time, saying that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#Velocity_time_dilation">time itself expands</a> to account for Bradley’s well-documented trigonometric explanation.</p><p><a href="https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/the-physical-definition-of-time?rq=what%20is%20time"><span>Recalling</span></a>&nbsp;that time itself is a concept to relate the relative motion, or relocation, between any two bodies, one wonders what is meant by the contraction of time itself, if not that one of the reference objects’ motion has slowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this cannot be, for we know that under basic relativity postulates, light’s motion cannot be truly additive for an observer.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ve known this long before relativity, beginning with Arago’s 1810 focal length experiment.</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596569313430_21843"><div><p>One also wonders&nbsp;<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.6229&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"><span>why velocity-addition explanations for the aberration</span></a>&nbsp;only make use of the orbital velocity of the Earth alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1967AmJPh..35..817E/abstract"><span>Measurements of binary star systems</span></a>, confirm that only the Earth’s motion, not the emitter’s motion is relevant to the aberration calculation — this seems to fly in the face of corpuscular ballistic notions of light-as-particle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Eisner">Edward Eisner</a>, who first advanced the contradiction, defended the relativistic interpretation in the end of his paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967 Eisner wrote:</p><p>“<em>We have shown that the “binary star paradox” is not a paradox at all, but merely a consequence of an erroneous, but commonly accepted interpretation…The fact that we do not see myriads of widely separated binaries in wild gyration does not require any fundamental change of outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it does require that the aberration should be realistically treated as the transformation between the frames of reference of two observers, not a source and an observer.”</em></p><div><p>There are several resources available for comprehending the relativistic reconciliation with these matters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mrelativity.net/CompleteNatureStellarAberration/The%20Complete%20Nature%20of%20Stellar%20Aberration.htm"><span>Here</span></a>&nbsp;is one of my favorites, which sort of side-steps Bradley’s vector-addition by swapping the combined hypotenuse speed for the speed of light.&nbsp;&nbsp;This rather ad-hoc adjustment allows the relativist to remain in congruence with the light-speed constancy for an observer.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the major cathetus of the triangle, formerly the speed of light for Bradley, then represents the sun’s reference frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, either triangle (earth position 1, earth position 2, star) is so elongated as that there is virtually no difference in length between the two legs – remember, the angle of aberration is 20/3600 of a single degree of declination to the horizon.&nbsp;&nbsp;So both calculations work, but Bradley’s elegant reasoning is absent in the …</p></div></div></div></div>

				<div><p>Last month, I had the opportunity to present at the second virtual <a href="https://www.meetup.com/sfpython/events/xkwxvqybckblb/">SF Python Meetup </a>about how CTO.ai is making it easier for Python developers and Data Scientists to streamline their critical workflows in Slack. </p><p>Going into the meetup, I admittedly didn't know that much about how this community managed their workflows, but one of our prior team members Ethan had built a really awesome automation with Jupyter on top of AWS EKS. </p></div><div><p>When the meetup was announced, I found that <a href="https://twitter.com/caiussivjus?lang=en">Aly Sivji</a> was doing a 45 minute keynote about almost the exact same topic! Initially I thought, oh no, this is awkward, but then I realized it was a good opportunity to better demonstrate how developers can find efficiency in their workflows via The Ops Platform.</p><p>Here is Aly's talk from the meetup, where he does an amazing job to explain the intricacies of how to use Docker in your workflow, which is a great overview for anyone who wants to understand this process from first principals:</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tuYgEv40s7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><div><p>Aly's talk is awesome. He goes deep into all of the important aspects of how to use Docker in your workflows and why you can benefit from containerized technology to easily customize a portable environment with your team.</p><p>Building on this, the talk I did was intended to demonstrate how CTO.ai is making these sorts of workflows dead simple, while also enhancing this natural paradigm with increased portability / accessibility / transparency - via Slack. We bring 12 factor application principals via Secrets, Configs, Logs, Events and (very soon) Metrics that "just work" for anyone who wants to streamline their team workflows.</p><p>Here is the talk I did which shows a similar process of creating a Jupyter playbook on AWS EKS / Kubernetes from Slack, in about 5 minutes total.</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6OfR6p_j2A0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>Both of these presentations show the power of Cloud Native workflows when it comes to streamlining the developer experience for teams, especially for complex tasks, that often need to leverage the exponential compute power of the cloud.</p><div><p>At the same time, you can see how complex these workflows can be when adopted from first principals, relative to how easy they can be with an approach like CTO.ai, which is purpose built for empower the developer experience, is used in your team.</p><p>Our goal is to save developers times and help them be more focused on the most meaningful work that they can deliver, in turn driving more success for their team and their own careers. This is what we think of as 10x development. </p></div><blockquote>10x development is helping 5 people be 2x more successful.</blockquote><div><p>If you have any questions about this or have some ideas for interesting Data Science workflows, please feel free to send me a message via our <a href="https://cto.ai/community">Slack Community</a>.</p><p>We're really excited about how we can do more workflows like this for Data Science use cases, so we'd love to collaborate with you if you have some ideas!</p></div>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7trv8KWD7oA" width="320" youtube-src-id="7trv8KWD7oA"></iframe></p><p>Yes, I know Linus was just reporting on the <a href="https://twitter.com/komiya_kj/status/1286898274427756544" target="_blank">ever circulating rumours</a> that the new ARM MacBook MIGHT be $799. Not WILL be $799. We haven't heard anything from Apple yet, so it's always best to keep an open mind.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem I have with Apple is that they have a very strange sense of what constitutes as value nowadays. And don't hate on me, either, I've been using Macs for decades. I've owned everything from a Classic, Plus and 2CX to an iMac and a MacBook Pro. I've gotten used to their stubborn attitude and no-compromises way of doing things. It's how they roll.&nbsp;</p><p>While that may not be a bad thing for getting other companies to adopt new technologies and making them mainstream in the process (such as getting rid of floppy disk drives in the original iMac or their adoption of Thunderbolt 3), their behaviour lately has confused me somewhat.&nbsp;</p><p>I was excited about the possibility of AMD-based Macs and what this could mean for the lower end of their range. A Ryzen based MacBook Pro 13" would have been superb (especially with Renoir). A refreshed Ryzen based MacBook could have been sublime.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only that, but think of the possibilities in their desktops: a Threadripper based Mac Pro makes me drool quicker than Homer Simpson.&nbsp;</p><p>I seem to be going round the garden path.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple know how to extract the maximum value from a product or service wherever possible. I don't think this means lower pricing, only higher profits. Take the new iPhone SE, for example. This uses tech and design from other models mashed together for a 'value' design. In the UK, though, a 64GB model costs £419. I wonder how much lower the price could have gone? What are the margins?</p><p>This brings me to the ARM-based MacBook. Will the savings be passed onto the consumer? I have a nagging feeling that it won't.&nbsp;</p><p>The MacBook Air starts from £999 in the UK, rising to £1299 for a faster model. What will happen to this if a cheaper MacBook is released? I can't imagine Apple would want a cheaper product to cannibalise sales of this line.&nbsp;</p><p>The same goes for the iPad Pro. Would they want the ARM MacBook to cannibalise sales of this range, especially if it has better features (such as next gen USB) and longer battery life?</p><p>It will be extremely interesting to see how Apple pitches the ARM MacBook and to whom. Whether it will be affordable, too, remains to be seen.</p><p>As always, these are just my thoughts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, Amazon Cloudfront added support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/07/cloudfront-geolocation-headers/">geolocation headers.</a></p>
<p>This helps sites serve content dynamically based on where their viewers are.</p>

<p>I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and how accurate my location was based on these headers.</p>
<p><a href="https://headers.owen.dev/">So I made a demo site to see how accurate these headers are.</a></p>

<p>Here are some of my findings so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>I live in Reston, VA. When reaching the site on my ISP, it puts me in Herndon, VA – which is pretty close. </li>
<li>When using my phone, Pixel 2XL and AT&amp;T, it puts me in Baltimore – pretty far away.</li>
<li>When using an iPhone on Verizon, it only gives Country information, and gives Central time zone instead of Eastern.</li>
</ul>
<p>So Cloudfront GeoLocation headers aren’t perfect, but you can’t expect that much precision from a free product that does location lookup based on IP address.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<p>This picture  may appear to be a collection of color fields without meaning or  purpose, but there is a ton of math and evil genius behind this image.</p>
<p><strong>This is a view of Magnasanti, the metropolis that pushes SimCity to its population limits. </strong></p>
<p><strong><span id="more-2933"></span></strong>Here is a closer view:</p>

<p>Vincent Oscala, a 22-year old architecture student from the Philippines, spent years decoding the formula for success in Sim City 3000.</p>
<p>Sounds like lunacy…but his insane investment of effort into “beating” SimCity raises interesting questions about the urban landscapes we inhabit, and the ways in which they can go horribly wrong.</p>

<p>After a massive amount of planning and a great deal of trial and error, he was able to create a city with over six million inhabitants.</p>
<p>Moreover, the city he created was remarkably stable, with no abandoned buildings and no wasted space. There are no roads — all transit is mass transit. An omniscient police force has eliminated all crime in the city. Magnasanti’s water and power needs are supplied by neighboring cities, eliminating the need for much of the related infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>In SimCity </strong><strong>terms</strong><strong>, it is a masterpiece.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But at the “street level,” so to speak, it looks like a horrifying dystopia. </strong></p>
<p>Unemployment is high, air pollution is stifling, education is largely absent, medical care and fire response are non-existent. Citizens do not live to reach retirement age. The police state has essentially eliminated free will and allowed the city to maximize its size while reducing quality of life to a minimum — and still maintaining total control over the citizens.</p>
<p>Every person living in Magnasanti spends his life working and residing in one small, massively efficient block of space, until death around age 50.</p>

<p>Here is a video that explains some of the development process for Magnasanti, including two smaller cities that served as development prototypes for Oscala’s final achievement:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="630" height="355" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTJQTc-TqpU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>As the soundtrack indicates, Oscala was highly influenced by the art film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koyaanisquatsi" target="_blank">Koyaanisquatsi</a>, or “Life out of Balance,” directed by Godfrey Reggio with music by Philip Glass.</p>
<p>Koyaanisquatsi is a non-narrative work that examines and explores the contrasts between the form and pace of nature and modern human life. Ultimately, the film confronts us with the fact that our species is living a life out of balance with nature, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>It’s a really cool movie that is highly recommended. Here’s a teaser:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="630" height="355" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LFBijDU8PpE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Now, you may be asking, what in the world does a game of SimCity — in an obsolete version, no less — have to teach us about a “life out of balance”?</p>
<p>Magnasanti is, first and foremost, a study in how to game SimCity to a maximum-population win condition.</p>
<p>However, I do think it raises some intriguing questions.</p>
<p>Oscala <a href="http://www.viceland.com/blogs/uk-games/2010/05/10/the-totalitarian-buddhist-who-beat-sim-city/" target="_blank">comments</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The film presented the world in a way I never really looked at before  and that captivated me. Moments like these compel me to physically  express progressions in my thought, I have just happened to do that  through the form of creating these cities in <em>SimCity 3000.</em> I  could probably have done something similar – depicting the awesome  regimentation and brutality of our society – with a series of paintings  on a canvas, or through hideous architectural models.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But it wouldn’t be  the same as doing it in the game, for the reason that I wanted to  magnify the unbelievably sick ambitions of egotistical political  dictators, ruling elites and downright insane architects, urban planners  and social engineers.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Australian architecture blog <a href="http://supercolossal.ch/2010/10/07/pay-to-click-get-rich-quick-urbanism-and-the-ideal-simcity/" target="_blank">Super Colossal discusses</a> some of the issues provoked by Magnasanti (link <a href="http://m.ammoth.us/blog/2010/10/magnasanti/" target="_blank">via</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of archiporn that I am a sucker for; gamespace urbanism  exploited to its extreme condition. Can you ‘win’ urbanism? Is this  even urbanism? If not, can we take anything from its construction? The  primary move that the city makes is to remove cars altogether and base  transport purely on subways. I suspect this is a method to exploit the  space otherwise taken up by roads for real estate allowing for an  increased population per tile, however, it is a strategy that many  cities—Sydney included—are seriously looking into. Remove motor  vehicles, increase public transport. Seems like a sound idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to see a world in which the lack of cars exists alongside a lack of freedom, and indeed may even be symptomatic of it. Oscala has created a system so “sustainable” that citizens are chained to their city blocks; they’re able to access the rest of the city through mass transit, but in effect have been relieved of the need to do so by the ruthless efficiency of their cookie-cutter “neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>Maybe — all right, probably — this is effective because the game engine is warped. Super Colossal concludes that “Ultimately, Magnasanti has little to do with urban design and everything to do with gaming systems for maximum&nbsp;reward.”</p>
<p>I can’t help but think that Magnasanti represents a semi-realistic dark side of centralized urban planning: the tools of modern construction and city planning as wielded by a despotic madman bent on maximizing population at any cost. Creativity, vibrancy and nature itself are cast away as a focus on efficiency and the bottom line are elevated to a religion and a science.</p>
<p>And of course, the police force are ever-present, just in case disorder begins to stir.</p>
<p>As Oscala <a href="http://www.viceland.com/blogs/uk-games/2010/05/10/the-totalitarian-buddhist-who-beat-sim-city/" target="_blank">explained in an interview with Viceland</a>, Magnasanti represents a “cage” in which he has imprisoned six million “economic slaves”. He <a href="http://images.shareapic.net/images7/022530174.jpg" target="_blank">utilized the geometry</a> of the Buddhist Wheel of Life and Death as further symbolic comment on the topic.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Technically, no one is leaving or coming into the  city. Population growth is stagnant. Sims don’t need to travel long  distances, because their workplace is just within walking distance. In  fact they do not even need to leave their own block. Wherever they go  it’s like going to the same place. </strong></p>
<p><strong>There are a lot of other problems in the city hidden under the  illusion of order and greatness: Suffocating air pollution, high  unemployment, no fire stations, schools, or hospitals, a regimented  lifestyle – this is the price that these sims pay for living in the city  with the highest population. It’s a sick and twisted goal to strive  towards. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The ironic thing about it is the sims in Magnasanti tolerate  it. They don’t rebel, or cause revolutions and social chaos. No one  considers challenging the system by physical means since a  hyper-efficient police state keeps them in line. They have all been  successfully dumbed down, sickened with poor health, enslaved and  mind-controlled just enough to keep this system going for thousands of  years. 50,000 years to be exact. They are all imprisoned in space and  time.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://m.ammoth.us/blog/2010/10/magnasanti/" target="_blank">Mammoth blog</a> calls Magnasanti “An intentionally hellish vision which exploits the game’s internal logic as commentary.”</p>
<p>Oscala <a href="http://www.viceland.com/blogs/uk-games/2010/05/10/the-totalitarian-buddhist-who-beat-sim-city/" target="_blank">adds </a>that “if we make maximizing profits the absolute objective, we fail to take  into consideration the social and environmental consequences.”</p>
<p><strong>At the very least, it’s delicious food for thought for would-be urban planners and simulation gamers.</strong></p>

<p>Laissez Faire Leadership is a form of leadership that offers many benefits for startups. In fact, if you currently work at a startup, you’re likely practicing a laissez-faire management style without even realizing it! In this article, we’ll briefly cover what laissez-faire leadership is and three benefits that it can bring to your startup.</p>



<h3><strong>What is Laissez Faire Leadership?</strong></h3>



<p>Laissez-faire leadership is a hands-off management style based on trust and is the direct opposite of micromanagement. Laissez-faire managers set clear visions and give their direct reports autonomy to make decisions in whatever way they best see fit.</p>



<p><em>Fun fact: </em><a href="https://www.paulallen.com/"><em>Paul Allen</em></a><em>, co-founder of </em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/"><em>Microsoft</em></a><em>, is known for taking a hands-off, or laissez-faire, approach to management. Other famous laissez-faire leaders include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett">Warren Buffett</a>, founder of Berkshire Hathaway, and <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/donna-karan-4">Donna Karan</a>, founder of DKNY.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Before we cover the advantages of laissez-faire leadership for startups, it’s worth mentioning why some are opposed to this leadership style. Those who oppose it prefer a hands-on, involved approach and wish to be closely involved in project implementations. Others find that a laissez-faire approach leads to time mismanagement, especially when there is a lack of accountability amongst team members.</p>



<p>Although those qualms are valid, we still believe that most startups would benefit from laissez-faire leadership. Next, we’ll cover the 3 biggest benefits laissez-faire leadership brings to startups.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefit 1: Empowers employee creativity</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blue-lemon.jpg" alt="Blue Lemon Creativity" srcset="https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blue-lemon.jpg 640w, https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blue-lemon-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>Laissez-faire leaders bestow trust and autonomy onto employees and give them free reign to learn through trial and error. In other words, they give their teammates goals and freedom to achieve those goals.</p>



<p>When given the freedom to make decisions, employees tend to be more creative because they aren’t simply handed a “right answer”. Creativity is important and is increasingly <a href="https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/why-creativity-is-more-important-than-ever">a competitive advantage</a> for startups, especially as they battle large incumbents like Google and Amazon. </p>



<p>Ambitious startups thrive on innovation, rapid iteration, and new ideas, making laissez-faire leadership a great fit for any fast-growing company.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefit 2: Attracts employees who thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments</strong></h3>



<p>Paul Graham <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">famously notes</a> that “a startup is a company designed to grow fast.” Employees who effectively deal with ambiguity and who are fast learners are more likely to thrive in the dynamic, fast-paced nature of startups.&nbsp;Such employees likely chose to work at startups because they thrive in unpredictable environments and wouldn’t do well with overly-prescriptive management styles.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog.cadencework.com/daily-standups-asynchronous-communication/">Micromanagement has no place</a> in an environment like a startup, where growth and changes are the only constants. In such environments, micromanagers would be bottlenecks to growth, as work would be inhibited unless their directives were given. Instead, startups value resourcefulness and autonomy, two values that laissez-faire leaders encourage.</p>



<h3><strong>Benefit 3: Is </strong>suitable<strong> for remote work</strong></h3>



<figure><img src="https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yellow.jpg" alt="Remote work keyboard" srcset="https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yellow.jpg 640w, https://blog.cadencework.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/yellow-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, most companies have implemented <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/07/27/google-amazon-facebook-microsoft-twitter/#bce4cb235c8b">work-from-home policies until 2021</a>. As these companies work remotely, many realize that given different working hours and timezones, it’s no longer realistic to equate online presence with productivity. Rather, the more productive approach is to focus on output and results. </p>



<p>Laissez-faire leaders empower remote teams to thrive because they don’t need to force employees to install intrusive tracking software in order to feel confident that work is getting done. Instead, they delegate, set tangible milestones, unblock teammates as necessary, and trust that they will accomplish those goals. This allows employees to execute on their current projects in whatever way works best for them.</p>



<h3><strong>Laissez-Faire Leadership is Great for Startups</strong></h3>



<p>Ultimately, laissez-faire leadership empowers employee creativity, attracts employees who thrive in fast-paced environments, and is suitable for remote work. Startups looking to differentiate themselves and stay competitive should consider implementing this style of leadership.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>You might feel sympathetic for me after reading the title. I promise that after reading all the mistakes I made, you will come to the conclusion that my dumbass deserved to get scammed.</p>
<p>I was looking to sell a bed and a dresser in an effort to purge my apartment of belongings before moving out of New York City. After reaching out to several groups of people, I was having no luck. I was even willing to give it away for free given that it went to someone I trusted. With my anxiety surrounding the situation increasing and the move out deadline approaching, I decided to heed my coworkers advice to put the items on Craigslist. It was the first and last time I ever will use that janky excuse of a website.</p>
<p>Only a day after posting my items up I got an email from a potential buyer! An immediate sigh of relief left my stomach. Wow, I can’t believe people still actually use this site! Though when I opened the email, I became skeptical:
</p><figure>

  <img alt="_Email for Bed_" title="_Email for Bed_" src="https://davidvargas.me/static/4cb0db93bd08a494fea1e01bfcc1e57e/fcda8/email.png" srcset="https://davidvargas.me/static/4cb0db93bd08a494fea1e01bfcc1e57e/12f09/email.png 148w,

  </a>
    </span>
    <figcaption><p><em>Email for Bed</em></p></figcaption>
  </figure>
There are a few things wrong with this email:
<ul>
<li>That “from” address looks suspicious. I chalked it up to how Craigslist automation works, in line with how shitty the rest of the site looks</li>
<li>Punctuation is a mess. Noted, stay vigilant</li>
<li>“Text me at email@address.com” That doesn’t make sense</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, with my desperation to get this bed out the door, I decided to email mister Sebastian anyway and see where it goes. Once I did, I mysteriously got a reply back, from a different email, from a Mrs. Janice Bishop. I reasoned that  Sebastian is some Craigslist scout that scrapes the site for his clients and forwards them the details when a match is found. Whatever.</p>
<p>In the middle of the exchange, I get this mysterious message from Janice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I instructed my Financial to mail out the payment including the mover funds. Hope i can also trust you with the mover funds? &amp; you will keep to your words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait. Why am I being responsible for the mover funds? If she’s coordinating the move, why didn’t she just pay them directly? I start to come to the conclusion to have sympathy for my not very intelligent buyer, and should just be accommodating since getting rid of my bed was top priority.</p>
<p>In parallel, I received another email from Sebastian, this time for the dresser. Given how I was able to quickly connect with Janice, I felt I could trust this guy to get me the second buyer and BOOM, problem solved! Both pieces of furniture will be gone! So I responded and my buyer for the dresser is a Mrs. Wislania Ribeiro. These names just feel like they were cranked from a random name generator on the internet. Anyway, after some back and forth, she sent me this message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once you receive the payment, you are to go ahead and Deposit/Withdraw the movers fund! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feels very fishy. Two independent buyers, both asking me to be responsible for the movers fund? I reason that Sebastian handles both the Craigslist scouting and the furniture moving, so this was just how he ran his business. I’m on high alert now. Or so I thought.</p>
<p>Checks for both pieces of furniture arrive in the mail about 24 hours from each other for about $2500. Let me repeat that. $2500!! For a bed and dresser that I’m selling for $300 each! Who the fuck would pay a mover $2200 for a piece of furniture they bought for $300?! The checks also look absurdly fake. Here are the two for the bed:

Nothing about where these checks came from, the memos, the signatures, or the banks make any sense. However, given how paranoid the buyers were about whether or not <em>I</em> could be trusted, and given that I assumed they weren’t very reasonable people, I decided that it wouldn’t be worth questioning them on these checks. Instead, I decided to mobile deposit these checks, on the assumption that if they were fake, they wouldn’t clear. If they did clear, then worst case scenario, my buyers are getting scammed by the moving company and <strong>I was safe</strong> because it was <strong>their money being lost</strong>. Oh Vargas, how naively incompetent you are.</p>
<p>Ok, so I deposit the checks, and wait for them to be moved from pending from my Citibank account. And they did!

This right here is the biggest incorrect assumption I made that was my downfall. <strong>Just because a check is no longer pending, doesn’t mean it’s been cleared.</strong> I didn’t understand this at the time, but distracted by my excitement to have buyers interested in getting this furniture out of my apartment I didn’t bother doing any further research into it. From this point forward, I’m operating under the assumption that their money is safe in my account and I’m dealing with someone else’s money.</p>
<p>Once I give Janice Bishop (bed) the heads up that I have the money safe into my account, she gives me the CashApp accounts that I am to forward the moving expenses to. What. If you had the CashApp accounts already, why the hell did you send me the checks? Why didn’t you just CashApp them directly? Whatever, I’m dealing with a moron, let me just be accommodating. I CashApp the money to a Sabrina Gudish, again another name that feels like it was generated by robots. I have a similar experience with Wislania Ribeiro (dresser), except she directed me to Zelle the money to a Giselle Marie Mendoza. There’s definitely some psychological effect here at play with all of these names being female sounding.</p>
<p>Saturday July 25th hits, and it’s pickup day for the bed. Janice Bishop texts me, <strong>on a different number</strong>, asking if I could do her a favor and send the movers an extra $200. She is insistent that the movers refuse to come pick up my bed until they have the $200 and that she will reimburse me with another check once it’s picked up. Nothing about this makes sense. I tell her that I will take out cash since I hit my CashApp weekly limit. She offers this brilliant workaround to the CashApp problem: I should go to my local store, buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/digitalgiftcards/">Steam gift cards</a> and send the codes to the movers. WHAT?!</p>
<p>No business I’m comfortable dealing with accepts gift cards as transactions. I tell her no. I have cash for the pickup, I’ll give it to the movers when they come. She gets aggressive:

As if now I’m being unaccommodating. I ask her if she could just send them the money or gift cards directly, but “she’s at work”. I call her, and a Google Voice picks up before going to voicemail. Red flags are parading my mind like a high school marching band. </p>
<p>I consult my friends, and they tell me not to buy the gift cards. But with the risk of my bed still being in my apartment when the move out time hits, I start to panic. I’m pacing my room not knowing what to do. I finally convince Janice Bishop, after about an hour of incoherent back and forth conversation, to give me the phone number of the moving company. Her phone number was (858) 375-9301 and the mover’s number was (858) 375-6028. THE FIRST 6 DIGITS WERE THE SAME! Guess what happened when I called it? Another Google Voice before going to voicemail. Texting the mover, they give me this Trump-esque response:

At this point I’ve lost all sense of rationality. I figured that I had already sent over $4400 of “their” money, what’s another 200? I go to a RiteAid and buy the gift cards. Maybe there’s a shot in the dark this move still happens. I grab on to this inspiring glimmer of hope:

My mom calls me that night to see how I’m doing. I decide to go over all of the nonsensical details that have transpired so far. As they leave my mouth for the first time with a third party, I start to recognize how insane the decisions I’ve made were, stumbling over my words. You know, that moment when you have to explain something to your mom when you know you’re in trouble? She even asked me if I’ve been drinking, a ludicrous question once you know I quit 8 months ago. She became concerned for my safety when I told her that I was sure that the checks cleared and it wasn’t my money that I was free wielding. We end the call on the agreement to do some research on the subject and reconnect in a half hour.</p>
<p>I stumble upon <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/craigslist-scams-14707309">the fifth bullet on this site on fake checks</a> and start sweating profusely. Scrambling over to my bank statements, my jaw lands on my keyboard when I see:

Fuck. This is the first of the three checks bouncing. I let my mom know when we reconnect, and she breathes a sigh of relief that this implies my safety is not in jeopardy and it’s just money I lost. I text Janice Bishop about her check bouncing and she of course plays dumb, asking for a screenshot. Probably so that scammy little shit could revel in their victory. Pour salt in the wound.</p>
<p>No one ever comes for the furniture. I don’t even bother following up with Wislania Ribeiro for the dresser. In the next week, the other two checks eventually bounce. I contact citibank, Zelle, and Cashapp to see if there’s anything I could do to recoup this money, but these were cash transfers that I authorized. They are meant to be sent to trusted parties. I lost the money for good. </p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>I’m not too upset about losing the money. My mom wired me the money I lost because she’s a wonderful woman and I love her dearly. But even if she didn’t, I had enough in my savings to cushion the blow and worst case scenario some of my long term goals get delayed a month or two. To help me feel better, I reasoned that the person who scammed me was in a much less financially secure position than I was, and hoped that the money could make a substantial impact on their life. </p>
<p>I am extremely upset about two other realizations. One, that I wasted so much time dealing with these scums. Two, and more importantly, that I still had the capacity to be so ignorant and make such negatively consequential mistakes. My only solace in this realization is some of the larger lessons I learned and can share with the world.</p>

It allows machines to follow regions of interest through a series of images. </p><p>Because of their resource efficiency Region Of Interest Trackers (KCF, CSRT, THOR, RAD, etc) have become a very popular approach to visual object tracking.</p><p><strong>Many modern trackers prioritize speed and accuracy at the expense of robustness.</strong></p><p><img src="https://teleidoscope.com/assets/drawing1-75.png" alt="drawing" width="70%"></p><p>At Teleidoscope, we’ve developed our own tracker (RAD) that attempts to address all three.</p><p><iframe data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/442186954?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1&amp;loop=1&amp;quality=720p" title="Bounding Box" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay;" allowfullscreen="" data-expand="-140"></iframe></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Performance in video above is impacted by visualization view rendering. See videos below for more accurate representation.</p><h2>The Balanced Tracker</h2><p>A balanced tracker balances the following attributes:</p><ol><li><strong>Speed</strong> - <em>How <strong>fast</strong> can it produce an estimate</em></li><li><strong>Accuracy</strong> - <em>How <strong>precisely</strong> it estimates the location of the object for a wide variety of objects</em></li><li><strong>Robustness</strong> - <em>How <strong>reliably</strong> it handles difficult conditions without losing the objects</em></li></ol><p>The impact one attribute has on the others varies by implementation but in general the following is often true.</p><ul><li><strong>Speed</strong> can be traded for <strong>Accuracy</strong> or visa-versa</li><li><strong>Accuracy</strong> can be traded for <strong>Robustness</strong> or visa-versa</li></ul><p>It makes sense that speed and accuracy are prioritized considering that’s what trackers are usually supplementing. But it doesn’t explain why robustness is hurt in the process.</p><p>The impact to robustness lies in how trackers determine whether or not they’re still tracking an object. Most trackers take a pass/fail approach and compare a confidence score to some fixed threshold to determine if their object is <strong>tracked (pass) or lost (failed).</strong></p><p>This approach can lead to problems because the range of possible scores differs between objects. This forces many trackers to choose between a <strong>high threshold which increases spurious failures</strong> or a <strong>low threshold</strong> <strong>which increases the chance of drifting</strong>.</p><p>The latter is usually chosen because it allows a wider variety of objects to be tracked accurately with this approach. However, this assumption can cause issues in unexpected ways, as demonstrated below.</p><p><iframe data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/441419592?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1&amp;loop=1&amp;quality=720p" title="Bounding Box" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay;" allowfullscreen="" data-expand="-140"></iframe></p><p><strong>Speed <em>and</em> Accuracy and Robustness</strong></p><p>In the video above, the combination of rapid scaling and background perspective change resulted in CSRT scaling incorrectly and not realizing it had drifted.</p><p>Many autonomous systems (e.g drones) rely on correct status reporting to determine if they need to perform more computationally expensive recovery tasks such as detection. If the tracker fails to often (high threshold), resources are wasted and if it doesn’t detect true failures (low threshold), drifting occurs. The latter can have severe affects on autonomous systems because they won’t know anything is wrong.</p><p>This make it clear that robustness is equally important as speed and accuracy. This of course makes the task of balancing a tracker very difficult.</p><p><strong>This is where Teleidoscope’s RAD (Relocalizable Adaptive Discriminative) Tracker comes in.</strong></p><p>RAD auto-calibrates to each object instead of using fixed implementation specific thresholds allowing it to report when tracking becomes unstable and recover itself when it does.</p><p>This allows RAD to track and recover, even in situations where there is very little scene detail.</p><p><iframe data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/441420068?autoplay=1&amp;muted=1&amp;loop=1&amp;quality=720p" title="Bounding Box" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay;" allowfullscreen="" data-expand="-140"></iframe></p><br><h3>Teleidoscope’s Visual Object Tracking Framework</h3><p>The RAD tracker is at the core of Teleidoscope’s visual tracking framework which was designed with these issues in mind.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><strong>This is the first essay in <a href="http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/you-may-finally-use-jshint-for-evil/">a four-part series about relicensing the JSHint
software project</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The process of relicensing JSHint took seven years. That’s far longer than
anyone expected, but seeing this through wasn’t just a matter of endurance. As
I worked with people around the world to move to the MIT Expat license, I
regularly experienced how non-free licensing (even as seemingly trivial as
“Good, not Evil”) poisons the well of free software.</p>

<p>Some numbers might help here. The following graph shows how many times JSHint
has been downloaded from <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/">npm</a> each week over the past
five years:</p>

<p><img src="http://mikepennisi.com/blog/jshint-watching-the-ship-sink-graph-1.png" alt="JSHint downloads over time"></p>

<p>We had a dip last year, but we’ve since recovered and then some. Over half a
million downloads per week sure sounds impressive, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> impressive in 2015. The fact is, npm’s usage has exploded over the
past half decade. Holding steady in this space is actually falling behind. Take
a look at the same statistic for <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>, a truly open
source project with the same purpose and target audience as JSHint:</p>

<p><img src="http://mikepennisi.com/blog/jshint-watching-the-ship-sink-graph-2.png" alt="JSHint and ESLint downloads over time"></p>

<p>Suddenly that dip in 2019 doesn’t seem so important. How did JSHint go from
being the most popular tool in this space to one that most developers today
consider antiquated? There are many explanations, but in this essay, I’ll focus
on the effects of non-free licensing.</p>

<h3 id="for-license-sensitive-users">For license-sensitive users</h3>

<p>JSHint was partly licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#JSON">the JSON
license</a>. It is nearly
identical to the widely-used MIT Expat license, but it includes one additional
clause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of this clause, folks who respect the practice of software licensing
simply could not use JSHint.</p>

<p>If you’re not versed in legal matters, that probably seems like an odd
restriction. By rejecting JSHint, are people admitting that they want to do
evil? And is that clause actually enforceable, anyway?</p>

<p>The answer to the second question is “no,” and that helps answer the first
question. Legally-conscious objectors aren’t betraying their own dastardly
motivations; they’re refusing to enter into an ambiguous contract. Put
differently: they’re not saying, “I’m an evildoer,” they’re saying, “I don’t
understand what you want.” This consideration disqualified JSHint from
inclusion in all sorts of contexts.</p>

<p>First, there were legally-conscious software repositories. Developers from the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a>
GNU/Linux distributions independently concluded that they could not include
JSHint due to licensing concerns. That’s why <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>
users can’t download JSHint via <code>sudo apt-get install jshint</code>.</p>

<p>Even in less discerning package managers, folks built tools to empower
developers to make similar decisions on their own. For instance, JSHint has
been available on <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/">npm</a> since its initial release, but
<a href="https://spdx.org/">SPDX</a> (along with tools like
<a href="https://github.com/ironSource/license-report"><code>license-report</code></a> and
<a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/licenses">Yarn</a>) has since been
designed to help folks understand the legal requirements of their dependencies.
This seemed like an encouraging trend toward conscientious code sharing, so <a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/pull/2420">we
did our part by adopting SPDX in
JSHint</a>.</p>

<p>More recently, an instructor at a US university wrote to the JSHint team asking
for permission to use JSHint in their course. I replied,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By all means, you are welcome to use the project and its website in your
courses. Please note, however, that the source code is partially
published under the JSON license. The FSF does not recognize this as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">a
free software license</a> nor
does the Open Source Initiative recognize it as <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">an open source
license</a>. This detail does not
effect most people in practice, but you may want to verify with your legal
team before relying on the code base.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honesty may be the best policy, but it also means fewer people are going to use
your bizarrely-encumbered JavaScript linter.</p>

<p>Finally, programming platforms that “repackaged” JSHint have reconsidered that
practice because of the license issue. There was a time when the popular
content management system <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> repackaged JSHint
in this way. Once they learned of the JSON license, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42850">they replaced JSHint in a
matter of weeks</a>.</p>

<h3 id="for-feature-craving-users">For feature-craving users</h3>

<p>Plenty of people don’t give a fig about free software. Whatever their reason,
they couldn’t care less about the legal terms that are bundled with
publicly-available source code. The “Good, not Evil” clause also pushed them
away, even if they didn’t realize it.</p>

<p>It began with the decline in license-sensitive users. The word “user” is a bit
too passive in the context of open source tooling because folks who use the
software are particularly empowered to contribute back to it. The “user-base”
is directly correlated to the “contributor-base.” When a project like JSHint
loses users, it also loses contributors.</p>

<p>This slows the addition of new features and the correction of bugs. Timeliness
is important for these things, and people perceive delays very negatively. The
best example of this comes from JSHint’s delayed support for async functions.</p>

<p>(The async function is a JavaScript language feature which was <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-intro">introduced in
2017</a>. It’s very popular among developers
but also very difficult for parsers to implement correctly. <a href="https://jshint.com/blog/2019-02-05/release-2-10-0/">It took us over a
year to support it in
JSHint.</a>).</p>

<p>Some expressed their dissatisfaction with the delay in <a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/2604#issuecomment-342173639">calm (though somewhat
impatient)
terms</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Async/await has been at stage 4 for over a month now (and baked into Node and
many mainstream browsers for longer), but jshint has yet to add support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…but others were more emotional:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/2604#issuecomment-329704124">“You just lost my interest in jshint. Sorry, to [sic]
slow.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/2604#issuecomment-331985362">“Thank you JSHint. It was good while it lasted. Switched to
ESLint.”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/2604#issuecomment-340112372">“RIP
Jshint”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/2604#issuecomment-455643712">“Seems like we waited enough. Bye JSHint. It was a good
time.”</a></li>
<li>“I know that you get a lot of complaints about this, but… if you can’t find
a way to include support for async/await, jshint is useless to me. I’m
switching to just using <code>node -c &lt;filename&gt;</code>” (via e-mail)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Internet has a way of surfacing the loudest and angriest perspectives, but
it seems safe to assume there was a substantial group of less vocal developers
who came to a similar conclusion.</p>

<p>A dwindling user/contributor-base is a vicious cycle. Though the movement may
have started with license-conscious folks, everyone felt the pain of the
release cycle equally, and their exodus exacerbated the problem.</p>

<p>This isn’t just a story of open-source “market” forces, though. My own
management decisions contributed to JSHint’s dissatisfying release cycle.</p>

<p>You see, many people express their dependency on software using a range of
versions. They don’t say, “give me Firefox at version 67.02.3” because they
don’t really care about that particular release. What they want is the software
to be familiar but also secure. They’re more likely to say, “give me the latest
version of Firefox 67.” With this statement, they’re trusting the maintainers
of Firefox to provide a program that looks and acts a certain way (i.e. not
exactly like version 65 or version 68) but that also has the latest bug fixes
(so 67.02.4 is preferable to 67.02.3).</p>

<p>This practice generally benefits users and developers alike. In my case,
though, I had a conflicting personal goal: I wanted the relicensed version of
JSHint to reach as many people as possible.</p>

<p>If we made drastic improvements to JSHint, we’d have to release a new major
version. The relicensing effort could continue with the new version, but many
people would continue to use the old version. For all the obsessing I’ve done
about JSHint over the years, I haven’t forgotten that most people aren’t
particularly concerned with the release schedule of their JavaScript linter.
When and if we succeeded, the users of the old version would be cut off from
our success (not to mention the improvements we made from that point forward).</p>

<p>This consideration made me averse to drastic changes in JSHint. Pretty
antithetical for a project maintainer.</p>

<h3 id="software-freedom-matters">Software freedom matters</h3>

<p>For many people, licensing is an esoteric part of software development. It’s a
relatable opinion: the legal frameworks are intimidating, and most
considerations can be addressed by simply defaulting to well-known
free/open-source licenses.</p>

<p>The trouble is that not all software is distributed under well-known
free/open-source licenses. My hope is that the particulars of JSHint’s decay

<p>After reading the drudgery of JSHint’s slow decline, you might be wondering why
we didn’t just give up. A sinking ship is only tragic if you value the ship. If
<a href="https://eslint.org/">a newer, faster, similarly-named ship</a> sails by, then
maybe it’s time to put down the bailer. It’ll take <a href="http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/jshint-dug-in/">another
essay</a> to address that fully.</p>

<div><p>August 4, 2020<span> · <a href="https://garrettyamada.com/tag/security/">Security</a></span><span> · </span><i></i></p></div>

<p>Today, I noticed something concerning - I received an automated email invoice from my landscaping company (who I won’t name here, out of courtesy) which contained a plain-text version of my credentials for their payment portal. </p><p>While this had happened before, it previously contained an auto-generated set of credentials (so I elected to continue leaving those in place for a while so as to minimize the “blast radius” were their system to be compromised).</p><p>I had recently changed my username and password to something else (my email address and a randomized password generated using 1Password), however, thinking that changing it both would tell the system to use the new email address I provided for future correspondence and perhaps flag the system to tell it to stop sending my credentials via email. </p><p>Neither of those things happened. The latest email invoice I received went to the previous email address on file, and my new credentials were still sent to me in plain text. </p><h2 id="an-investigation">An Investigation</h2><p>The payment portal itself is suspiciously vague about what third-party companies are responsible for its maintenance and card processing, so I decided to investigate. You may notice I didn’t have a lot to go on:<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jl3YR0gJRgy95gDG3NG6RBMsuIE42Jo9vSBrwtFjuK_9Ty94ekif1j3XuUnXBoPl5vNm86e1uPQhZnEJnVYnY692p3GSyYcA6dWRuuGs5I_ICzYqeKbmfNK6-z0LJvIt_sCAtWrl"></figure><p>A cursory once-over returns absolutely no information. The company running this portal is not named in the only valid link on the page (the Terms and Conditions). “Privacy” is not a link, and nor is “Web 2” (whatever that means). </p><p>A call to the phone number listed goes nowhere; it’s invalid. I mean, 555-1212? Come on, what is this, a cheesy hollywood movie?</p><p>The paragraph about “contact us by email by clicking here”? The linked email is “<a href="https://garrettyamada.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7b080e0b0b14090f3b161a121755181416"><span data-cfemail="780b0d0808170a0c3815191114561b1715">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>”. That sure isn’t going anywhere, either. </p><p>Since the information provided on the page itself is completely bogus, I next turned to the domain name itself. The domain name for this payment portal is “<a href="https://manageandpaymyaccount.com/">manageandpaymyaccount.com</a>”. A WHOIS lookup merely returns what I expected - the registration is private, masked by GoDaddy. </p><p>A dig command returns two A records - both for a CDN called “Incapsula”. Not a common CDN, so I looked a bit further. The site is HTTPS enabled (at least there’s that), so a quick search on Censys for “manageandpaymyaccount.com” returns this:<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DSek-SSgOEzHKX_RBm3295EISvS5ItBiYozbT0ge7-Pn-9CWQAqt1_gF2SJ0hlPw1YWOhNZHG4RyeYFjIa3Zycm0rgTqm15vvHL7UTDGTKDhEl1SxJM7AQpfxco48A7tk2aXLo6t"></figure><p>Nothing out of the ordinary so far (except that Incapsula apparently runs their CDN using IIS - really?). Next I dug into the first certificate in the chain:<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cQoRMyr2jyZWYg3q4yLyxajR35KkmxUSkwQdgGV1-EEGXxqUs6WhgsDZbsmmE__9LIC0UnmQ-C5lKDIp5bAAAhQPHz0dHsMd3sM8xrCwDw5H4giJy8Fvk9G2DKc4LKi5RP273xZX"></figure><p>Bingo! Now we’re getting somewhere. Some other interesting domains are listed here. As it turns out, “<a href="https://serviceautopilot.com/">serviceautopilot.com</a>” is the SaaS company my lawn care company uses to manage and run their business. A quick dig shows “backtell.net” doesn’t point anywhere but Google tells us Backtell, LLC is the registered parent company of Service Autopilot, both based out of Richardson, TX. </p><p>Some further searching turns up a couple of interesting things:</p><ul><li>A search on <a href="https://spyse.com/">Spyse</a> appears to show 312 subdomains of manageandpaymyaccount.com; there are likely at least that many companies using this payment portal.</li><li>There is one other documented public mention of this practice of sending plain text passwords, on Reddit:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ub_k5PLU242NGGgSIRqmcBI2uE1Lq8G08qzJQETits_5uZ5M7xC3JxLXEZXf_sERfVgTSDP12ho1FJ91Td4IaHWD6gP5y0b192o_-pzuXKj3ru_pt3CN-KZcluPRwMdYtNpHer3Z"></figure><p>The Reddit comment is from <em>two years ago</em>. Service Autopilot has been sending credentials in plain text for their payment portal (which they apparently went to rather surprising lengths to hide that they run) for at least two years, possibly much longer.</p><h2 id="so-what-s-next">So what’s next?<br></h2><p>Before writing this post, I reached out via email to the owner of my lawn care company, recommending he change payment processors and pointing out that sending passwords in the clear is non-compliant with PCI-DSS standards. </p><p>I also reported the issue using <a href="https://www.serviceautopilot.com/contact/">Service Autopilot’s contact form</a>. </p><div><p>Upon receiving notification of my report, my lawn care company responded as follows:</p><p><em>“Thanks for bringing this to my attention, we are going to make some changes moving forward with our current way of emailing usernames and passwords. &nbsp;These emails containing the username and password will serve as a temporary username and password for first time clients and we will encourage our clients to change their password/username any time they receive this email. &nbsp;We will not continue resending them monthly as we have been doing which should ensure a level of protection to our clients.”</em></p></div><p>This is a good start, as switching payment systems and business process flows is not an overnight process; they’re definitely limited by Service Autopilot’s technology though.</p><p>Service Autopilot responded with the following:</p><p><em>“Thank you for contacting us. &nbsp;I am glad to assist you. &nbsp;You are correct. SA is not PCI compliant, that is why we do not store credit card information. We store the token only. &nbsp;We recommend that when you email the client portal login information to your customers you advise them to change the password after they login. </em></p><p><em>As for safety concerns, you can advise them there is no credit card information stored in the portal, only customer name, address and phone. &nbsp;If someone were to access a customer's account there is no financial information stored on the site.”</em></p><p>This was very vague. Aside from the fact that PCI compliance also generally applies to the merchant, they seemed very cavalier about protecting their customers’ addresses and phone numbers. (Not to mention that the fact they can retrieve passwords in plain text means they’re not encrypted!) When pressed on protecting PII, and whether they would alter their portal to address this lax security practice, they stated:</p><p><em>“I have not heard of any upcoming changes. I will pass your feedback along for review. I have submitted product suggestion ticket (ticket #) on your behalf.”</em></p><p>Thanks for nothing!</p><h3 id="important-notes">Important Notes<br></h3><ul><li>In the course of this investigation, I only accessed publicly available data to determine and verify ownership of domains and companies involved in this situation.</li><li>Both companies involved were notified of the security issue in advance of publication.</li><li>No computer systems were accessed without authorization.</li></ul>

<![CDATA[Why I Self-Host My Website Analytics]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Recently I made the switch to self-hosted analytics, after being a long-term
Google Analytics user. Almost every website you visit will have a Google
Analytics tracker on it. I think there are idealogical and technical reasons to
opt for self-hosted analytics instead.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-efficacy">Tracking efficacy</h3>
<p>This one’s quick. You’re more likely to get analytics for a given user if you’re
using self-hosted analytics, than if you’re using Google Analytics. About <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/804008/ad-blocking-reach-usage-us/">26%
of
people</a>
are running adblockers now, a large percentage of which will also block tracking
scripts, like GA. Having your analytics on <code>analytics.yourdomain.com</code> makes
your requests less likely to be blocked.</p>
<h3 id="on-principle---being-a-customer-vs-being-a-lead">On principle - being a customer vs being a lead</h3>
<p>Google Analytics (including gtag and universal analytics), has a whopping <a href="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/web-analytics--1">73%
market share</a>. That’s millions and
millions of sites, and billions of data points processed every day. Google’s spending millions
on this service (disclaimer: that number is pulled from absolutely nowhere, but
even if 5 engineers are carrying the entirety of Google Analytics on their back
and server costs are zero, that already puts it in the millions).</p>
<p>Google, like any company, isn’t providing an expensive service for free out of
the goodness of their heart, or because they can spare the money. They’re hoping
that by being a Google Analytics customer, you’ll become an AdWords customer.
Google Analytics users aren’t customers, they’re leads. Personally I feel a lot
more secure in my transactions knowing I’m a customer.</p>
<p>There’s also the data privacy standpoint. I don’t want Google to know as much
about my website visitors as I do. Something doesn’t feel right to me about
giving Google that amount of insight into my site. With self-hosting I’m in
control of my visitors’ data.</p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>Google Analytics, for my purposes, has <em>way</em> too much complexity. I know there
are sites that benefit from the comparisons and stats you can pull up through
Google Analytics. Some website out there can probably benefit from finding out
what % of male users in Germany, who visited the marketing page
between January and March, signed up for a paid account in July. Maybe in the
future I’ll have a website receiving billions of hits per month where I could
materially benefit from such a query. But for now, I really don’t need it, and
I don’t want the complex UX that comes along with the ability to run queries
like that. All I need is a rough idea of how much traffic I’m getting, where
it’s coming from, and what pages it goes to. A simple self-hosted analytics
service gives me that.</p>
<h2 id="my-new-analytics-setup">My new analytics setup</h2>
<p>My GA-alternative of choice is <a href="https://github.com/electerious/Ackee">ackee</a>. It
took me all of 10 minutes to set up using the <a href="https://github.com/suda/ackee-chart">helm chart</a>(admittedly, longer than Google
Analytic’s 30-second copy and paste), it shows me the stats I care about in a
clean UI, it’s open-source, and it’s self-hosted.</p>

<p>To me, the strangest crackpots I’ve encountered through this blog are the π denialists.</p>



<p>When people have trouble with Cantor and differently sized infinities, I get it. It defies our intuitions. It doesn’t seem to make sense.</p>



<p>When you look at Gödel incompleteness theorem – it’s really hard to wrap your head around. It doesn’t seem to make sense. I get it.</p>



<p>When you talk about things like indescribable numbers, it’s crazy. How could it possibly be true? I get it.</p>



<p>But π?</p>



<p>It’s a pretty simple number: the ratio of the diameter of the circle and the circle’s circumference. There’s nothing all that difficult about what it means. And there are so many different ways of calculating it! We can use the nature of a circle, and derive series that compute it. We can write simple programs, do tactile demos, measure actual physical phenomena. And yet, there are people who fervently believe that it’s all a sham: that the value of π <em>isn’t</em> what we say it is. It’s exactly 4. Or it’s exactly 22/7. Or it’s exactly <a href="https://www.jain108.com/true-value-of-pi-3-144/"><img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7B%5Cphi%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\frac{4}{\phi^{\frac{1}{2}}}" alt="\frac{4}{\phi^{\frac{1}{2}}}"></a>. Or it’s not a number, it’s <a href="https://www.nevyns-lab.com/mathis/mirror/milesmathis.com/pi2.html">an <em>acceleration</em></a>.</p>



<p>It’s amazing. I constantly get mail – mostly from fans of either Jain (the author of the &amp;phi;-based &amp;pi; mentioned above), or from followers of Miles Mathis (he of “&amp;pi; isn’t a ratio, it’s an acceleration” fame), insisting that I’m part of the great mathematical conspiracy to deny the true factual value of &amp;pi;.</p>



<p>And yet… It’s so simple to demonstrate how wrong that is.</p>



<p>My favorite version is a simple program.</p>



<p>Here’s the idea, followed by the code.</p>



<ul><li>Take the unit square – the region of the graph from (0, 0) to (1, 1), and inside of it, an arc of the circle of radius 1 around (0,0).<img src="http://www.goodmath.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arc.jpg" alt=""></li><li>Pick a random point, (x, y), anywhere inside of that square.</li><li>If the distance from the origin (<img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%20%2B%20y%5E2&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="x^2 + y^2" alt="x^2 + y^2">) is less than one, then the point is inside the circle. If it isn’t, then it’s outside of the circle.</li><li>The probability, <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p" alt="p">, of any given random point being inside that circle is equal to the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square. The area of that region of the circle is: <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%2A1%5E2%2F4&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\pi*1^2/4" alt="\pi*1^2/4">, and the area of the the square is <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=1%5E2&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="1^2" alt="1^2">. So the probability is <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2F4%29%5Cpi%2F1&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="(1/4)\pi/1" alt="(1/4)\pi/1">, or <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%2F4&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\pi/4" alt="\pi/4">.</li><li>So take a ton of random points, and count how many are inside the circle.</li><li>The ratio of points inside the circle to total random points is <img src="http://l.wordpress.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%2F4&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\pi/4" alt="\pi/4">. The more random points you do this with, the closer you get to π.</li></ul>



<p>We can turn that into a simple Python program:</p>



<pre>from random import random

def computePi(points):
    inside = 0
    for i in range(points):
        x = random()
        y = random()
        if (x*x + y*y) &lt; 1.0:
            inside = inside + 1
    return (inside*1.0)/points * 4.0


for i in range(30):
    pi = computePi(2**i)
    print(f"Pi at 2**{i} iterations = {pi}")
</pre>



<p>The exact value that you’ll get when you run this depends on the random number generator, and the initial seed value. If you don’t specify a seed, most random number libraries will use something like last 32 digits of the current system time in nanoseconds, so you’ll get slightly different results each time you run it. I just ran it, and got:</p>



<pre>Pi at 2**0 iterations = 4.0
Pi at 2**1 iterations = 4.0
Pi at 2**2 iterations = 3.0
Pi at 2**3 iterations = 2.0
Pi at 2**4 iterations = 3.5
Pi at 2**5 iterations = 2.75
Pi at 2**6 iterations = 3.0625
Pi at 2**7 iterations = 3.125
Pi at 2**8 iterations = 3.109375
Pi at 2**9 iterations = 3.1875
Pi at 2**10 iterations = 3.171875
Pi at 2**11 iterations = 3.126953125
Pi at 2**12 iterations = 3.12109375
Pi at 2**13 iterations = 3.14013671875
Pi at 2**14 iterations = 3.169677734375
Pi at 2**15 iterations = 3.1324462890625
Pi at 2**16 iterations = 3.14453125
Pi at 2**17 iterations = 3.147247314453125
Pi at 2**18 iterations = 3.138519287109375
Pi at 2**19 iterations = 3.1364669799804688
Pi at 2**20 iterations = 3.1443214416503906
Pi at 2**21 iterations = 3.141223907470703
Pi at 2**22 iterations = 3.141301155090332
Pi at 2**23 iterations = 3.1419320106506348
Pi at 2**24 iterations = 3.1415367126464844
Pi at 2**25 iterations = 3.1421539783477783
Pi at 2**26 iterations = 3.1420511603355408
Pi at 2**27 iterations = 3.1415300369262695
Pi at 2**28 iterations = 3.141532242298126
Pi at 2**29 iterations = 3.1415965482592583
</pre>



<p>I suspect that I could do a lot better using a special number library to reduce or eliminate the floating point roundoff errors, but I don’t really think it’s worth the time. Just this much, using a really simple, obvious, intuitive method produces a better result than <em>any</em> of the numbers pushed by the crackpots.</p>



<p>To support that previous statement: the best crackpot value for π is the one based on the golden ratio. That version insists that the true value of π is 3.14460551103. But you can see – by using the simple metric of counting points inside and outside the circle – that the actual value is quite different from that.</p>



<p>That’s what makes this breed of denialism so stupid. π isn’t complicated: it’s a simple ratio. And it’s easy to test using simple concepts. Pi relates the diameter (or radius) of a circle to the circumference or area of that circle. So any test that works with circles can easily show you what π is. There’s nothing mysterious or counterintuitive or debatable about it. It is what it is, and you can test it yourself.</p>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>

<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>

<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>

<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>

Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

Sight is needed to observe what the currently displayed temperature is and to then adjust the setting. Secondly, touch, or more specifically, thermoception, is needed to 'feel' the new temperature or fan speed change and confirm whether the new setting is appropriate, or whether further adjustment is required.</p><p>Thus, this process usually involves a <em>two-step action</em>:&nbsp;manipulating the switch or dial to change the temperature/air-flow, and then placing a hand near the air vent to 'feel' whether the new temperature and air-flow is right.</p><p>Most car interiors reinforce this two step process by separating the air-vent and temperature controls and placing them in disparate locations.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_8_1479722101486_19028"><div><p><em>2017 Porsche 718 Boxster. The HVAC controls are just visible at the bottom of the image.</em></p><p>An example of this is the Porsche 718 Boxster. Porsche takes a contrasting approach to Audi and places its HVAC controls almost diametrically opposite to the air-vents, with both being separated by the infotainment screen and the media controls.&nbsp;Consequently, this design enforces the rigid two-step process outlined above, by forcing the driver to physically move their hand between two different locations in order to ensure the correct temperature and airflow setting.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_8_1479722101486_29996"><div><p>Audi's design, in contrast, is innovative because it elegantly and efficiently combines the disparate two step process in the Porsche and other vehicles. By integrating all necessary HVAC controls, including temperature, fan speed and airflow within the air-vent, the driver can <em>simultaneously</em> adjust the control and immediately feel the effect of their action, without having to physically move their arm.</p><p>While this may seem to be a superficial change, Audi's design has numerous benefits. Not only does it create a sense of harmony and visual symmetry, but by minimising the number of separate buttons and switches, it greatly reduces the potential for the driver to be confused or frustrated by excessive clutter and small, illogically placed controls. By streamlining a relatively complicated,&nbsp;two-step process into a single action, Audi's design could also potentially increase road safety, by essentially halving the time the driver spends with one hand on the steering wheel.</p><p>An innovative, refreshing and logical design that clearly moves the ball forward.&nbsp;Great work.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>here he was, smiling on the <a href="https://www.zinio.com/za/forbes-africa/june-2016-i18106">cover of <em>Forbes Africa</em> magazine</a>, dollar bills raining like confetti. It was June 2016, and Obinwanne Okeke, then 28, was on top of the world; he had just landed a coveted spot on the magazine’s prestigious 30 under 30 list of African entrepreneurs. In the article, he was one of many whiz kids described as “Africa’s bright young things.”</p>



<p>The 17th child of a polygamous father whose mother was the fourth wife, Okeke’s father died when he was 16, and his mother, a teacher, worked multiple jobs to put him and his siblings through school. Growing up in Ukpor, a village in southeastern Nigeria, was tough, and luxuries like sneakers or a Game Boy were hard to come by, he said in a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p065dtt3">2018 BBC interview</a>. </p>

<p>But he persevered, he said, studying in South Africa and Australia, earning a master’s degree in international relations and counter-terrorism at Monash University. He started his business in Nigeria in 2013. That business — which, as he has alluded to in other interviews, involved low-cost housing and green homes — expanded into South Africa, Botswana, and Zambia, with a potential addition in Uganda. His interests were worth almost $10 million, <a href="https://iono.fm/e/303518">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Okeke named his business Invictus, after the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus">poem</a> by William Ernest Henley about resilience in the face of adversity. It was said to be <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2013/12/morgan-freeman-masterfully-recites-nelson-mandelas-favorite-poem-invictus.html">Nelson Mandela’s favorite poem</a>.</p>



<p>“Invictus is in construction, agriculture, oil and gas, telecoms and real estate. He has 28 permanent and 100 part-time employees across nine companies,”<em> Forbes Africa</em> wrote in Okeke’s entry.</p>



<p>But that much-lauded business empire existed alongside Okeke’s criminal enterprises, the FBI later wrote in an August 2019 <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.450919/gov.uscourts.vaed.450919.5.0_1.pdf">affidavit</a>. Turns out, Okeke had been involved in a string of sophisticated online scams since at least 2015 — including when he was gracing that glossy <em>Forbes Africa</em> cover. He <a href="https://www.thecable.ng/fbi-arrested-invictus-obi-at-dulles-international-airport-just-before-escaping-us">was arrested</a> at Dulles International Airport, Virginia, on August 6, 2019, for defrauding a company of nearly $11 million. He <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/nigerian-businessman-pleads-guilty-11-million-fraud-scheme">pleaded guilty</a> to conspiracy to commit wire fraud on June 18, 2020, and now faces up to 20 years in prison at his sentencing in October. Okeke’s rapid ascent as a supposedly successful entrepreneur —&nbsp;and his subsequent defenestration — reflects a growing trend in online scamming known as <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/business-email-compromise-(bec)">business email compromise (BEC)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The tale of</strong> the Nigerian online scammers <a href="https://republic.com.ng/august-september-2019/yahoo-yahoo-naija/">stretches back to the 1990s</a>, when cybercafes sprung up across the country as internet access became increasingly widespread. Young men popularly known as “<a href="https://theconversation.com/meet-the-yahoo-boys-nigerias-undergraduate-conmen-60757">Yahoo boys</a>” became famous for conning their unsuspecting victims out of money by posing as romantic interests — typically American soldiers based in active conflict zones in the Middle East —&nbsp;or as wealthy royals in need of help getting a relative’s money out of some bureaucratic logjam. Their notoriety is now mainstream enough that they’ve become a pop-culture joke. In an <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/01/black-ish-recap-season-2-episode-12.html">episode from the second season</a> of the TV show “Black-ish<em>,</em>” a concerned sibling chastised her brother about his potential love interest, convinced he was being duped by a scammer. “This is a middle-aged Nigerian man who wants your money or your kidney,” she told him. The youngest sibling added, “I’m trusting to a fault, and even I know this screams Nigerian scam.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okeke’s case reflects how much has changed since then.<strong> </strong>Rather than settling for petty romance schemes, some scammers are now targeting the email accounts of executives at Western<strong> </strong>companies, tricking their companies into sending wire transfers to supposed overseas suppliers who then fraudulently transfer those funds into the scammers’ bank accounts. The stakes involved in BECs are high in nearly every possible way: they target wealthy and prominent victims and use complex tools to defraud them, and if the plot succeeds, it results in a windfall. Whereas the targets of online romance scams are usually older Americans or other lonely Westerners desperate for affection (or the occasional naïf fooled into going into business with a <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/technology/nigerian-prince-scam-social-engineering/">seemingly sweet-talking African prince</a>), email compromise focuses on businesses ranging from small-sized enterprises to multinational corporations. Scammers typically single out high-level executives, usually the CEO, CFO, or COO, “the real decision-makers who have the power to sign checks and grant approval,” Eniola Fadare, a Lagos-based computer security expert, told <em>Rest of World</em>. The goal, after gaining control of these decision-makers’ email accounts, is to authorize wire payments of money that will largely end up in accounts controlled by the scammers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In contrast to romance scams, where the guys — and they’re almost always guys — find their marks on Facebook, Instagram, or any number of dating apps, email compromise is a “patient scam,” Fadare said, that involves quietly shadowing a company or its executives for months, to determine the types of businesses they’re involved in and the vendors who will need to be paid. The operational costs of pulling off one of these scams often add up to millions of naira, but the payoff can be worth it. While romance scammers may make off with anywhere from $350 to $3,000, BEC scammers can potentially rake in much more. Olalekan Jacob Ponle, who also went by the name Mr. Woodbery, was arrested on June 10, 2020, in Dubai for allegedly <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/nigerian-national-expelled-united-arab-emirates-face-cyber-fraud-charge-chicago">stealing $15.2 million</a> in a scam targeting a Chicago-based company.</p>



<p>BEC involves a high degree of sophistication and collaboration between masterminds and co-conspirators, who provide services like designing fake landing pages for hijacking email accounts and harvesting passwords. There are also money mules who provide accounts, sometimes referred to as “houses,” to park the proceeds of the scams. A 24-year-old Lagos-based scammer, who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> through an intermediary to preserve his anonymity, said that romance scams are “easier and cheaper to do” than BEC scams. But they’re not the sure bet they once were, because of how widespread they are. “People are getting educated and enlightened,” Fadare said.</p>



<p>Business-related scams involve individuals spread around the world, requiring authorities to cooperate across borders; Mr. Woodbery was extradited to the United States after being captured by Dubai police. Last year, 281 individuals, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/281-arrested-worldwide-coordinated-international-enforcement-operation-targeting-hundreds">including 167 in Nigeria</a>, were arrested for their involvement in BEC schemes as part of an international raid called Operation reWired. Arrests were also made in Turkey, Japan, Italy, and elsewhere. The cases are being tried across several jurisdictions in the U.S., because the victims are American.</p>



<p>In a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California on the arrest of Hushpuppi, a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hushpuppi/">flamboyant Instagram</a> celebrity with 2.5 million followers, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/nigerian-national-brought-us-face-charges-conspiring-launder-hundreds-millions-dollars">described</a> BEC as “one of the most difficult cybercrimes we encounter as they typically involve a coordinated group of con artists scattered around the world who have experience with computer hacking and exploiting the international financial system.” Paul Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, claimed that the FBI recorded $1.7 billion lost to BEC schemes in 2019.</p>

<p><strong>The crime that</strong> got Okeke arrested began on April 1, 2018, making it perhaps the most lucrative prank ever pulled on April Fool’s Day. The victim was Unatrac Holding Ltd, the export sales office of a dealer for Caterpillar, a heavy industrial and farm equipment company. The company is based in Slough, a town about 45 minutes outside of London. According to the FBI statement, Unatrac’s CFO received an email containing a login link for his Microsoft Office 365 account and entered his login details, believing it to be real. Instead, it was a spoof website crafted by Okeke and unnamed associates to gain access to the CFO’s email. </p>



<p>After they did, the hackers sent invoices from an email address intended to mimic that of a legitimate vendor to the CFO’s email, using invoice templates and logos found within the compromised account to lend an air of legitimacy to the documents. Minutes later, those fake invoices were forwarded to Unatrac’s finance team from the CFO’s email. Because the finance staff had no reason to doubt the provenance of the wire transfer requests, they processed about 15 payments between April 11 and April 19, 2018. The company that allegedly submitted the invoices, Pak Fei Trade Ltd, was sent at least three payments that totaled more than $3 million, with the payments going to overseas accounts. In total, almost $11 million was stolen from Unatrac.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the same time the scam was underway, Okeke <a href="https://guardian.ng/news/nigerian-investment-expert-to-speak-at-lse-africa-summit-in-london/">was an invited speaker</a> at the London School of Economics’s Africa Summit, alongside luminaries like Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo and many other prominent African businesspeople. He also partook in that BBC interview, telling tales of growing up poor and how he was introducing low-income housing to a Nigerian property market saturated with expensive homes.</p>



<p>By the time the company realized it had been hoodwinked, it was too late to cancel the transactions, and little of the funds were recovered, according to the FBI statement. To avoid detection, the hackers set up email filters that immediately intercepted legitimate emails to and from the CFO, marked them as read, and moved them to another folder outside the inbox.</p>



<p>Fadare, the security expert, explained that, in conjunction with setting up email filters, scammers do not work “at active hours when they know the CEO is awake or busy.”</p>



<p>Additionally, “they clear the emails from the boxes as soon as they’re received. The real CEO, when he logs into his email, is not going to see anything,” he added. Fadare said scammers bank on people not carefully scrutinizing messages …</p></div></div>

		<p>Imagine tomorrow you go shopping and, for whatever reason, you never come back. Maybe be someone killed you, maybe someone kidnapped you, maybe you had an accident ... Now imagine you are travelling alone in Thailand and you die. How people who know you are going to find out what happen ? if you are being kidnaped how the police will do to find you, if you got lost how people will find you ? If you die how your family is going to find your papers ?</p>
<p>I wanted to find a way to answer all those questions, basically we can sum up the issues in 3 points :
- In case of being kidnaped or getting lost send as much information on your last location, and following locations, your last activity, all your digital information to someone who is going to help liberating you
- In case of dying, sending all your documents (passwords, friends list, legal documents, ...) to your family
- Not sending those documents by mistakes if you are not on the situations above</p>
<h2>First step : collect your position, your activity, your documents, ...</h2>
<p>The first step is to be sure that you have the data that you want to send, on my part, the data are:</p>
<ol>
<li>My current position and recent history</li>
<li>My last know activity and a recent history</li>
<li>The list of my credentials</li>
<li>The list of my legal documents (id, passport, health insurance, work papers, ...)</li>
</ol>
<p>I've written an <a href="https://blog.luap.info/how-i-track-my-life.html">article</a> explaining how I'm doing 1. and 2. (position in real time, and last activity), so this is fixed.</p>
<p>For my credentials, I use <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">keepassXC</a> with a keyfile + a master password, the keyfile and the password db is synced using <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthingd</a> with a server that I rent</p>
<p>My legal documents are all tied in one folder on my laptop which is also synced on the same server</p>
<p>So basically we have all the needed documents which are synced in real time on the same server</p>
<h2>Second step : Choose how to trigger the sharing of documents</h2>
<p>The biggest problem is you want the alert to react quickly but not fire because you have been sleeping for 8 hours. So I chose to rely on the time since I last changed of activity. Currently after 24h without changing activity a first notification is sent to my own email so that if this is a mistake I can stop the system before it is too late. And if 6 hours later I've still haven't changed of activity then a mail is sent to my parents.</p>
<p>So basically if something happens to me my parents will be notified maximum 30h after the event, this is not so great but this is a good beginning. In the future I should try to have an adaptive delay depending on the last activity, for example if my last activity is eating, then I won't eat for 24 hours, so I can trigger the alert after for example 4 hours.</p>
<h2>Last step : What to put inside the notification</h2>
<p>So my parents will receive an email after 30 hours of inactivity. In this email there is a link to a page which will allow them to retrieve all the documents.
<img alt="email" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/kidnap/email.png"></p>
<p>The link is random generated link available only 6 hours, this is important to be safe as you don't want anyone to be able to access all your passwords ...</p>
<p>And the page, there are explanations of that page is about, like, "maybe I was kidnaped, maybe I'm lost, check my last time active on whatsapp, contact xxxx to see if he knows anything"
You can also view the current position of my phone and a small location history, that way you can see if I'm still moving, or if the last point if 30 hours old, you can also see my last activity and when it started</p>
<p>And finally you can get the list of all my passwords, for that purpose I created a form, with 6 facts on my life, that only my parents can know all of them, like what was the color of my first car ..., then there you can submit your answer, there is a rate limit on the number of requests you can make to prevent a brute force. If the 6 answers are true, the backend will decode the keepassxc archive and return a json of the archive, containing all of my credentials, including the ssh password to connect on the server to get all the paper documents.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I know that all of that is far from being perfect. I check every few months that the alerting is working, by decreasing the delay to trigger the alert, but the server can go down, ton of things can happen to make the system not working, so that's why I tried to keep everything as simple as possible, postgresql + django + cron. Someone should create a service to manage that at a bigger scale, or maybe that's something that 1password or others could include in their offer</p>

Python to Java. Firefox to Chrome. Semicolons to blank line breaks. Emacs to Vim. The list goes on.</p><p>While more philosophical than factual, this sort of "advice" often overlooks the benefits of experiencing diverse options yourself that will inevitably expand our toolbox make you wiser. Take it with a grain of salt.</p><p><img src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/5/editors.png" alt="Marquee Blog"></p><h2>🧑‍🎤 What's your next IDE?</h2><p>Let's take a look at (ex-) development environments. (Ex-) IDEs more specifically. Ariana Grande serenades how one taught her love, one taught her patience, and one taught her pain. That'd be Vim, Xcode, and Eclipse for myself - in Miss Grande's exact order.</p><blockquote><p>VS Code is quickly catching up with my ❤️ vim-love. Which is how <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=activecove.marquee">Marquee, an extension for VS Code</a> came into existence.</p></blockquote><p>Having spent two decades in software development leading teams and organizations, one thing is certain: one size fits all does not exist. Infra is different from algorithms is different from app development is just as different as people are. In fact, saying "thank you, next" regularly is encouraged - get to know what's out there! Also, no need to be shy to go back to your familiar options when the situation calls for it.</p><h2>👻 One size fits all does not exist</h2><p>If you just got started with development, don't let platitudes about "if you need auto-complete to write code YOU don't code" get in your way. I recently taught myself Typescript and my learning journey was greatly expedited by VS Code's first class support for it. However, while it built my comprehension, I would happily write Typescript in GNU's nano. Probably slowed-down by a factor of 2x because... NANO 😑.</p><p>More recently I helped build an extension for VS Code called <a href="https://marquee.activecove.com/">Marquee</a>. Hopefully one day Marquee will be available for all editors. We didn't start out with VS Code for pure love - no, we wanted to fill a real gap. VS Code is also the most exciting platform for developers; perhaps only second to the browser which is much less specifically designed for devs.</p><p><img src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/5/marquee.png" alt="Marquee Blog"></p><blockquote><p>Stay on top of your VS Code windows. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=activecove.marquee">Marquee is available</a> from the VS Code Marketplace.</p></blockquote><p>Even though there is a lot of VS Code in my life today, you will still witness me vim-editing files on remote hosts or even in VS Code's embedded terminal as much as firing up Xcode to inspect some iOS code. I won't write about how one saves more time or grief than the other.</p><h2>🤓 Growth mindset means getting out of the comfort zone</h2><p>The one advice you should take to heart is this: don't get too comfortable for too long. Try out new things and cherish what you already know. Depending on what matters to you in the situation - getting the project done, learning something new, jumping head first into the cold water - diversity of first-hand experiences will give you options, lead to better results, and be your saving grace.</p><p>Seriously, though, VS Code is fantastic.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Thanks to the Vim’s vast choice of <a href="https://vimawesome.com/">plugins</a>, I’ve been using Vim daily for developing React applications in TypeScript. I classify these plugins as essential to make Vim a perfect IDE environment for programming although you might not need them as you can already do anything out-of-the-box, I’d still recommend installing them and making code writing more enjoyable and less error-prone.</p>
<p>I assume you have some basic skills in Vim or read my <a href="https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/5-most-essential-vim-commands-for-beginners/">previous article</a> as a starting point.</p>
<h2 id="install-plugin-manager">Install plugin manager</h2>
<p>Before we install any of the plugins, first we will need a plugin manager. There are many plugins managers for Vim, but always recommend using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a> mainly for its simplicity and ease-of-use.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bojan/image/upload/v1596552031/installer_ix85nf.gif">
</figure>
<p>So go ahead and execute this command in the CLI:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs <span>\ </span>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim</code></pre></div>
<p>After it finished, add a vim-plug section to your ~/.vimrc file.
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">call plug#begin<span>()</span>
<span>" In this section you will manage all of your future plugins.
</span><span>"</span> Plug <span>'example-path-to-git-repository'</span>
call plug#end<span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Essentially, in this block of code we have added you will include the path to the repository of the plugin you want to install by inserting <code>Plug 'path-to-repo'</code> and from inside Vim you will call: <code>PlugInstall</code>.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-lint-engine">Asynchronous Lint Engine</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale">ALE</a> is a plugin that will provide linting with syntax checking and semantic errors for your code.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bojan/image/upload/v1596551535/ale_w544ts.gif">
</figure>
<p>Let’s install it by including it in the Vim Plug and call :PlugInstall</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">Plug <span>'dense-analysis/ale'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After this, I recommend reading the documentation of the plugin to adjust the plugin better to your style of writing code.</p>
<h2 id="coc-conquer-of-completion">CoC - Conquer of completion</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim">CoC</a> is a completion engine and you really really want this one. This plugin saves me a lot of typing and peaking into other files for properties verification.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bojan/image/upload/v1596551521/coc_eftpyw.gif">
</figure>

<h2 id="yats-yet-another-typescript-syntax">YATS: Yet Another TypeScript Syntax</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme/yats.vim">YATS</a> is a TypeScript syntax highlighter with the most appealing color scheme for TypeScript code. Not just making your beautiful but also much more readable.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bojan/image/upload/v1596551519/yats_viclae.png">
</figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">Plug <span>'HerringtonDarkholme/yats.vim'</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="ctrlp-vim-fuzzy-finder">ctrlp.vim - Fuzzy finder</h2>
<p>You might have used this feature in VSCode, with <a href="https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp.vim</a> plugin we can get the same functionality. Very useful for searching the files on the go.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bojan/image/upload/v1596551519/fuzzy_parwqn.png">
</figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">Plug <span>'ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim'</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are some of the most essential plugins to get you going writing the code in React and TypeScript.</p>

<![CDATA[The basics of hiring Remote Employees]]>

August 4, 2020 | https://nohq.co/blog/how-to-hire-remote-employees/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nohq.co/blog/how-to-hire-remote-employees/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Remote hiring is one of the things that is very different from a traditional company. In a traditional company, the company usually has an office and corporation set up in the area you work in or at least have set up <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/how-much-should-you-pay-remote-employees/">payroll</a> there. Hiring people is easy and a normal employment contract is usually enough to get people hired full-time in a legally compliant way.</p>
<h2>The difficulties of hiring remote employees</h2>
<p>The responsibilities of an employer are very regulated too: PTO days are usually fixed, payroll knows how to deal with possible deductions such as taxes, social security and benefits and special local regulations are usually accommodated. That's not always the case with remote work.</p>
<p>When you are hiring remotely, you need to make sure you are compliant with local laws. Employees might face high social deductions, based on their country of residence, and it's also your responsibility to keep your employees informed on how much they are going to make after-tax.</p>
<p>PTO is also immensely different based on location: While in Europe 25-30 PTO days and 10-15 public paid holidays are often standard, it's usually lower in the US and Asia. There are other exceptions where an employee can take a day off, for example for Jury Duty in the US or military service in multiple other countries. Finally, <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/perks-for-your-remote-employees/">benefits are often very different as well</a> – while in the US you would usually expect to receive healthcare benefits and a 401k, that's not usual in many other countries.</p>
<p>There is a lot to watch out for, so what are your options?</p>
<h2>Hiring remotely through up a sub-corporation</h2>
<p>If a company is planning to set up a hub in a specific country, it can be worth it to establish a permanent sub-corporation in that state or country. In that case, the company officially incorporates there, sets up payroll (which usually involves hiring an accountant or accounting consultant) and then has the ability to legally hire people in that country or state.</p>
<p>This is not trivial and probably not an option unless you're a bigger corporation looking to hire 10+ people (depending on the country) there. The time commitment and cost is simply too high and things can get complex with multiple sub-corporations in terms of administration and taxes.</p>
<p>The advantage of it is clear: There's no substantial additional administration cost per hire, employees are employed with a local employer (often taking a lot of effort off their shoulders) and while the initial setup is taking a lot of effort, the maintaining of the corporation isn't so much work compared to some other options.</p>
<h2>Hiring remote employees as contractors</h2>
<p>Often a preferred way to hire people in remote companies is to simply list them as a contractor and getting invoiced from them on a monthly basis. This puts much of the needed effort on the shoulders of the employee, which is often more preferable in small companies.</p>
<p>It's absolutely needed to give employees time for administration in this case. Additionally to their work, they will have the handle the additional work that comes from running your own business, such as declaring themselves as self-employed or forming an LLC, possibly pay profit/income taxes additionally to their personal ones, figuring out all insurance and deductions that are needed and handling local nuances, such as setting up proper social security, handling retirement funds and healthcare.</p>
<p>While this sounds like a lot of work, a lot of these are once-per-year activities. Most remote companies still tend to go with this option. It's the cheapest, possibly fastest, simplest and most flexible way to get someone hired.</p>
<h2>Utilizing a payroll service to hire remotely</h2>
<p>In some countries, getting hired as a contractor is just not so easy as it might seem.</p>
<p>When I started working remotely myself, I looked into this for my home country Switzerland, and quickly realized that this came with too many disadvantages. Namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>To count as independently self-employed, I'd have to send invoices for at least three different clients to the government every month. This is not possible, if you're working on a single contract</li>
<li>I'd have to have opened a local LLC to work for a single client, requiring a security deposit of $25,000.</li>
<li>I'd have to calculate my social security and pension funds every year, and invoicing them separately to my employer</li>
<li>I wouldn't have gotten paid my full salary during military services (it's still mandatory here, the government reimburses salary)</li>
</ul>
<p>So we went ahead with a <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/hiring-remote-workers-in-foreign-countries/">local payroll service</a>.</p>
<p>A payroll service or global employer is a company that has set up payroll in a country. They're able to hire people locally, do all the work required for a local employee, and invoice the "real" employer accordingly. This service often costs $100 - $300 per month per employee, so as things scale up, can get costly. But else it is the least amount of effort required to hire someone remotely.</p>
<p>I like payroll companies so much, that <a href="https://payroll.nohq.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I've put together a list of them</a>, one for (almost) every country out there. Whether you're looking to hire someone in Canada, Australia, Germany or Barbados, there is a payroll company there.</p>

<p><a href="https://toogl.es/#/browse">Toogles</a> is (was) a super lean app to search and watch YouTube videos without all of the other crap that YouTube.com brings with it (comments, suggested videos, subscriptions, etc.). </p>



<p>I created it back in 2012, as a way to learn AngularJS and Zurb Foundation. Since then, it’s built up a small but dedicated community of users who just want to watch videos without all of the bloat. In the month of July, it got just over 100k pageviews.</p>



<p>Sadly, Google finally put an end to it. This morning, I was emailed that my API access was shut down for using it to run an app that clones the basic functionality of YouTube.com. </p>



<p>The specific complaint is:</p>



<blockquote><p>You and your&nbsp;API Clients&nbsp;must not, and must not encourage, enable, or require others to use&nbsp;YouTube API Services&nbsp;to create, offer, or act as a substitute for, or substantially similar service to, any&nbsp;YouTube Applications.&nbsp;API Clients&nbsp;must not mimic or replicate YouTube’s core user experiences by recreating features or process flows unless they add significant independent value or functionality that improves users’ interactions with YouTube. For example, an&nbsp;API Client&nbsp;must not recreate the browse experience from any YouTube Application without adding significant independent value to that flow.</p><cite><a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies#i-additional-prohibitions">YouTube Terms and Conditions</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>So that’s that. I can’t really argue that Toogles didn’t act as a substitute for a YouTube application, because that’s exactly what it did. I even had a Chrome extension to redirect YouTube.com video URLs to Toogles. </p>



<p>I am sad to have to say goodbye to my beloved Toogles. I am sad to be stuck with YouTube.com and all of the bloat and distraction that it brings. But I can’t say that Google is being unfair. I was breaking the rules, they found out, and that’s that. </p>



<p>Anyone know of any good browser extensions for stripping down YouTube.com? If so, <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">tweet me</a>.</p>

Such metrics are usually inner looking and are associate with factors that are important to the business, for example: revenue, customer retention, net sales, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KPIs are often used to quantify the success and effectiveness of an individual, project, team, department, or even entire corporation. As such, they can directly impact incentive mechanisms and consequently, employee behaviour when extensive emphasis is placed on hitting and improving upon KPIs. Depending on the type of KPI, incentive structure and expectations, employees may feel pressured to squeeze more desirable metrics and may resort to negative/ unethical behaviour to achieve said outcomes. For example, Wells Fargo, a major financial institution was caught in a scandal where some employees illegally falsified customer accounts and created over 2 million fake bank accounts to reach companies KPIs and compensation structures. Once it was found, it led to a government settlement of US$3 billion (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/business/wells-fargo-settlement.html">NYT</a>).</p></div></div></div><div data-id="3da557ca" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Driving organizational success with Customer Performance Indicators (CPIs)</h2></p></div><div data-id="3bfd6b7a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, Customer Performance Indicators (CPIs) have been identified by some as powerful predictors of growth (<a href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/the-most-important-metrics-youre-not-tracking-yet">HBR</a>). CPIs are customer-centric metrics that allows the organization to track the outcomes that are deemed important to the customer. Such parameters are put in terms that are meaningful to customers, for example: instead of “time to receive quote”. Given the fact that CPIs are often related to customer experience, they can directly impact KPIs. For example, <em>Quality of Purchase Experience</em> could be considered a CPI in a store and it can positively affect <em>Sales Growth</em>, a KPI, should customers continue to choose to purchase at certain location given the high CPI.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As explained in the article, “<a href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/the-most-important-metrics-youre-not-tracking-yet">The Most Important Metrics You’re Not Tracking (Yet)</a>” customers, and individuals at large, always have a purpose (or problem or need) and an expectation of how it will be solved. For companies that claim to put customers at the center of their operations, such metrics are paramount for client satisfaction – and tying them back to KPIs ensure that sound business judgement is employed throughout operations.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="8ebf300" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="blockquote.default"><div><blockquote><p> This is the primary rationale for adopting CPIs: The more your company’s attention is focused on outcomes important to your customers (CPIs), the better your company will likely perform on outcomes important to the business (KPIs).</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-id="118f6f47" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>The Importance of Performance Indicators – A Balancing Act</h2></p></div><div data-id="16a18faf" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, Performance Indicators (PIs) provide a means to quantify current and past performance associated to a company, department, team, or individual. Further, they also provide clear insight into goals and objectives to be achieved. They need to be clear and quantifiable. It is quite challenging to set an objective and not provide clear parameters that quantify the objective.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, saying that “sales need to increase” can be an ambiguous objective. It leaves room for interpretation as one might assume that an increase in the absolute number of sales satisfies the requirement – even if the total net amount of sales might result on being lower than what was previously reported. However, when an objective is directly tied to a PI, goals become clearer and are easier to achieve. For example, by stating “increase the number of new contracts signed per period by 5%”, the goal becomes more actionable. Evidently, other considerations such as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals">SMART</a> goals need to be taken into account when drafting actionable goals.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it is widely known, PIs can be specific to an industry, department, team, or even an individual within a team. As such, blindly tracking trendy PIs may not award the best measurement of success for the intended purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the idea of tracking CPIs as opposed to KPIs can be alluring and it makes a lot of sense for customer-centric companies or customer-facing departments and teams. However, even in customer-centric companies, there are certain situations in which it is necessary to focus on improving KPIs to increase customer satisfaction. For instance, customers do not care about keyword ranking, but that is an important metric to track if you want customers to find your products on the internet.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain KPIs can also give important insights into CPIs and overall customer behaviour. For instance, leads/ conversion rates may directly speak into the likelihood of which a customer visit to a website transitions into the buying stage. If conversation rates are suboptimal when compared to the industry (leave aside other factors), it might prompt the business into pursuing more research on why customers don’t feel enticed to make purchases.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When deciding on which type of PI to track, it is important to critically assess the need and why such metric is being tracked. Is it to have a better sense of what drives growth in the company? Is it to understand how a department is performing at a point in time? Most often, it is associated with improving a certain metric or achieving a certain goal. In that case, specially in customer facing teams, there can be benefits in tracking CPIs and KPIs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By tracking CPIs (metrics that are of importance to customers) businesses are able to better understand the correlation between such numbers and KPIs, customer’s desire, and some of the factors that influence their purchasing behaviour. All valuable data that can assist organizations in enhancing the overall quality of their service.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="3641f7c3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Performance Indicators’ Best Practices</h3></p></div><div data-id="6d0ef995" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned previously, the decision of tracking a specific KPI or CPI needs to be critically assessed. Such metrics are unique to the functions within a team. For instance, even in the HR department, the metrics tracked by the Compensations and Benefits team can be completely different from that of the Employee Relations team. The same observation is valid throughout the organization. Below are some best practices to be considered when deciding which and how to track KPIs:</p><ul><li><strong>Relate it to Strategy:</strong> associating KPIs with the overall strategy of the team, department, and individual is an important method to facilitate the accomplishment established objectives and goals. Further, it allows to better gauge performance in comparison to such objectives – allowing organizations to not just “talk the talk”.</li><li><strong>Data Gathering Process:</strong> KPIs are impacted by all the processes that come before the numbers are presented. As such, best practices for data gathering also need to be respected in order to report accurate numbers. Principles of transparency, privacy, protection, quality, identification, collection, approach, and analysis need to be taken into consideration.</li><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> it is important to understand why a performance indicator is believed to be relevant not only to the organization at large, but also to the department/ team in which the metric in being considered.</li><li><strong>Cost to build &amp; manage</strong>: The more robust a PI solution, the higher the likelihood that it can be expensive to maintain a robust PI that satisfies the organization’s needs. Understanding the current technological capabilities, coupled with organizations goals and means is essential to build a balanced solution.</li><li><strong>Incentive:</strong> alongside the purpose of the PI, it is important to understand the types of incentives that it may create on the workforce – especially when such PIs are strictly managed, enforced, beyond reasonable expectations and/ or impact pay or accolades given.</li><li><strong>SMART Goals:</strong> despite having slightly different variations, the S.M.A.R.T. acronym is incredibly helpful to set realistic and attainable goals and it should be employed when setting expectations associated to KPIs and CPIs. For more information on the practice, <a href="https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/smart-goals.php">Duncan Haughey</a> explores the different meanings behind the acronym and how they can be properly deployed. Emphasis should be placed on setting goals that are attainable, accurate, and not vague.</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-id="4c61201" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>Beyond Performance Indicators</h3></p></div><div data-id="fcf6e6e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performance indicators are important to measure the overall productivity and effectiveness of the efforts employed by individuals, teams and departments. However, it is also important to take into consideration the context in which the PIs and expectations are being deployed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, during times of hardship and constant change, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to understand that external factors may impact internal achievement and overall performance. Further, as external pressures occur, KPIs may need to be re-evaluated to match current goals and strategies. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some departments may have set goals with transitioning their workforce to remote working which meant that some internal KPIs may have changed to reflect new goals or needs that were brought upon them due to external conditions. As such, PIs can be contextual not only to the function, but also to the environment in which they are set. Understanding the incentives, they create in the workforce and how it translates into operations and service quality is paramount to overall success.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="7d62a2ad" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>The opinions in this article is of the authors and do not reflect clients or other’s views.</p></div></div><section data-id="1d5840a7" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="3aaecc47" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="5646d6ed" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="author-box.default"><div><div> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brenda-gonzales/"> <img src="https://gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/LBSA-Gala-4-199x300.jpg" data-src="https://gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/LBSA-Gala-4-199x300.jpg" alt="Brenda Gonzales"> </a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-id="42335a0d" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="588d47cf" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="author-box.default"><div><div> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilherme-peterson/"> <img src="https://gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20180627_172807-225x300.jpg" data-src="https://gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_20180627_172807-225x300.jpg" alt="Guilherme Peterson"> </a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="6602159d" data-element_type="section" data-settings="{&quot;background_background&quot;:&quot;classic&quot;}"><div><div><div data-id="1394b1f5" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="657eea7" data-element_type="widget" data-settings="{&quot;classic_columns&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;classic_columns_tablet&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;classic_columns_mobile&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;classic_row_gap&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:35,&quot;sizes&quot;:[]}}" data-widget_type="posts.classic"><div><div><article><div><h3> <a href="https://gpetrium.com/the-necessary-balance-between-kpis-and-cpis/"> The necessary balance between KPIs and CPIs	</a></h3><p><span> August 4, 2020	</span></p><p>The necessary balance between KPIs and CPIs Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on linkedin Share on email Share on whatsapp &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) allows companies, departments, and teams to assess their</p> <p><a href="https://gpetrium.com/the-necessary-balance-between-kpis-and-cpis/"> Read More »	</a></p></div></article><article><div><h3> <a href="https://gpetrium.com/account-hijacking-a-persistent-threat/"> Account Hijacking – A Persistent Threat	</a></h3><p><span> July 23, 2020	</span></p><p>Account Hijacking – A Persistent Threat Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on linkedin Share on email Share on whatsapp What is Account Hijacking? …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>We don’t need SMS 2FA.</p>



<p>I’m going to break down why we don’t need SMS 2FA and give you a replacement that is not only better but cheaper and easier too.</p>



<h2>What Is SMS 2FA?</h2>



<p>Hopefully, if you’re reading this, you have a good understanding of SMS 2FA.</p>



<p>If you don’t, SMS 2FA is the text message you get after entering your username and password. It’s another factor that is needed to log into an account.</p>



<h2>What’s The Purpose Of SMS 2FA?</h2>



<p>The goal of any 2FA is if your first factor (your password) is already known, the second factor (SMS 2FA) will keep the attacker out.</p>



<p>What are the ways a password is already known?</p>



<ol><li>Phishing.</li><li>Password reuse/credential stuffing attacks.</li><li>Malware.</li><li>Guessing/brute force.</li></ol>



<p>These are the most common ways a password is already known and why we use SMS 2FA.</p>



<p>Now the question becomes, does SMS 2FA actually solve these attacks? Not only that but is it the best option?</p>



<h2>1. Why SMS 2FA Is Not Immune To Phishing</h2>



<p>Phishing is when you get someone to go to the wrong website that looks like the real website and get them to enter their credentials.</p>



<p>Sounds simple enough; the user would fall for entering their username and password, but since the SMS 2FA code is one time use the attacker knowing it will be useless to them.</p>



<p>The problem is that this assumes hackers don’t evolve and change strategies. It’s not 2004 anymore; phishing has progressed quite a lot.</p>



<h3>One Example Is Modlishka</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Phishing with Modlishka (bypass 2FA)" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/308709275?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="770" height="433" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>To understand how this attack works, you need to think of the website the attacker sent you to as a web browser.</p>



<p>Your web browser goes to the attacker’s website. The attacker’s website then acts as a web browser for your web browser.</p>



<p>The user is using the real website but through the lens of the attacker’s website. Besides the URL in the user’s web browser not being correct, they’re none the wiser.</p>



<p>The user logs in with 2FA, and the attacker now has a session cookie, which keeps them logged in. The attacker has the username, password, and 2FA code.</p>



<p>The attacker’s server (aka “web browser”) has the session which means they’re already logged in and can do whatever they want. They could even turn 2FA off since most services don’t require 2FA to turn 2FA off once logged in.</p>



<h3>Modlishka Isn’t The Only One</h3>



<p>Since Modlishka is open source and free you get many variations that are also open source and free. Here is another example…</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kuba Gretzky - Phishing Through Modern 2FA Defences With Evilginx" width="770" height="433" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRyinxNY0fk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>These two phishing attacks have <strong>set the new floor for phishing</strong>. It only can get worse from here as the attackers will not go back to worse phishing programs. </p>



<p>This is why SMS 2FA is not a solution to the phishing problem.</p>



<p>The replacement at the end <strong>can</strong> help stop phishing.</p>



<h2>2. SMS 2FA Doesn’t Stop Credential Stuffing Attacks</h2>



<p>Saying SMS 2FA doesn’t stop credential stuffing attacks seems to be a sticking point for some.</p>



<p>The problem comes from the misunderstanding of credential stuffing attacks.</p>



<p>Jarrod Overson answers it best…</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/@jsoverson/no-2fa-does-not-stop-credential-stuffing-attacks-79de7476a80a"><em>The point of a credential stuffing attack is to boil a list of mostly-junk credentials into a list of valid credentials per service. If a service presents its 2FA gate to the user after they have entered in a good username and password then a credential stuffing attack still results in a list of valid accounts. What it doesn’t lead to is an immediate account takeover. This is an important nuance and, without acknowledging it, the phrasing leaves people thinking that 2FA is a silver bullet and that a silver bullet exists at all.</em></a></p>



<p>I suggest you read the rest of what Jarrod wrote.</p>



<p><strong>Attacks are layered and seeing an SMS 2FA</strong> <strong>screen doesn’t mean the attacker calls it quits</strong>. Instead, that user’s username and password go on a new list for the next round of attacks. The more the users are filtered, the more valuable they become as the attacker gets closer to their goal.</p>



<p><strong>You haven’t made it more difficult for the attacker; you instead made the user more valuable to the attacker.</strong></p>



<p>The next attack could be a targeted phishing attack, and as we know, SMS 2FA doesn’t hold up to that. What’s scarier is that a lot of users don’t have any 2FA on their email and love to reuse passwords especially ones that the attacker already filtered out from the credential stuffing attack. This means the attacker is just one password reset away from getting to their target after taking over the email account. 2FA is not as popular and abundant as everyone in the tech community thinks; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16922500/gmail-users-two-factor-authentication-google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90% of Gmail users don’t use any 2FA</a>. </p>



<p>This is why we say SMS 2FA is only “<em>kicking the can down the road</em>“. You’re not solving the problem but only delaying it. </p>



<p>The replacement at the end makes credential stuffing attacks useless. </p>



<h2>3. SMS 2FA Doesn’t Stop Malware</h2>



<p>The first immutable law of security.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://techtalk.gfi.com/security-101-the-10-immutable-laws-of-security-revisited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it’s not solely your computer anymore.</a></strong></p>



<p>SMS 2FA doesn’t protect the user against malware. There exist malware today that has shown that 2FA can’t stop it.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even better, if the malware has control over the device, they can change any web address to point to <strong>any</strong> website and perform the Modlishka attack.</p>



<p>Malware is a lose-lose situation.</p>



<h2>4. Guessing And Brute Force Attacks</h2>



<p>Straight up guessing someone’s password is not easy. Math and time are against you.</p>



<p>Unless the user is reusing the same or similar password, guessing is not something that happens much.</p>



<h3>Example Of How Hard It Is To Guess A Password</h3>



<p>Guessing passwords is not easy; here is an example with me telling you the password requirements.</p>



<p>Length = 16 exactly<br>Character set = 62 (upper, lowers, numbers)</p>



<p>If its precisely 16 characters long, it would take 1,487,111,351 years to guess all possibilities at <a href="https://threatpost.com/researcher-bypasses-instagram-2fa/146466/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 trillion guesses per second</a>. </p>



<p>This is ignoring slow hashing algorithms that would significantly extend guess time.</p>



<h3>Most Services Already Stop Guessing Attacks</h3>



<p>This is especially true on many services as they limit such attacks from happening in the first place.</p>



<p>It’s not hard to see one username being hit a lot of times with wrong password guesses.</p>



<p>Even if it’s from multiple IP addresses, you can still lock the user’s account as many services already do.</p>



<h2>SMS 2FA Resets</h2>



<p>Before we get to the replacement, we need to talk about SMS Resets.</p>



<p>And yes, I hear many of you right now saying SMS 2FA is not SMS Resets.</p>



<p>While this is true, it would be disingenuous to not talk about it because SMS Reset often comes along with SMS 2FA. They’re apart of the package on many websites, whether you want them or not.</p>



<p>We can’t ignore SMS Resets because this often means you can bypass everything with just a phone number and get into an account. Even worse are the websites that don’t have SMS Resets but add it later because they already have SMS 2FA.</p>



<p>SMS Resets are the worst thing about SMS 2FA, and ignoring it “because they’re not the same” is not helping the situation.</p>



<h2>The Replacement – Do This Instead Of SMS 2FA</h2>



<p>What’s great about the replacement to SMS 2FA is that it’s easier, cheaper, and more effective.</p>



<p>It’s quite shocking that we’re not doing it more often…</p>



<p><strong>Generate the passwords for the users!</strong></p>



<p>It’s that simple. I’ve already done a <a href="https://passwordbits.com/generate-user-passwords/">massive write up on why websites should generate passwords for users here</a>. </p>



<p>It solves all the shortcomings of SMS 2FA. It’s easier to understand. It’s easier to implement. It’s cheaper and no need to use 3rd party support. </p>



<h2>Educating Users Happens At Signup</h2>



<p>Besides dorks like me, the average user is not going to research passwords and how to be more secure.</p>



<p>The place where users are getting educated about passwords is happening at the signup page.</p>



<p><strong>We’ve spent years teaching users to make complex passwords with password requirements when we should have been teaching them to use unique passwords.</strong></p>



<p>The best way to teach a user to use a unique password is to do it for them. Creating passwords for users gets them to think of passwords as something you store, not something you remember.</p>



<h3>Passwords Need To Be Stored, Not Remembered</h3>



<p>Generating passwords for users gets them to treat passwords like they do phone numbers. No one remembers phone numbers anymore as they use the contact app on their phone or little black book.</p>



<p>Instead of giving password requirements, tell the user to write the password down, let the browser store it, or use a password manager.</p>



<p>Many users are simply not aware of such things and need to be told.</p>



<h3>It’s Not 2004 Anymore</h3>



<p>You can’t use the internet without a web browser and every web browser offers to store and fill passwords for you.</p>



<p>Every browser has profiles that allow you to log in from any computer and get passwords and bookmarks.</p>



<p>Every major browser works on all devices, even mobile. </p>



<p><strong>It’s so easy that users have to go out of their way not to use the password storage features</strong> <strong>in their web browser</strong>. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://passwordbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrome-Gif.gif" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>If they don’t trust the web browser, they can still use paper and pencil. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-security-guru-jot-down-your-passwords/">It’s okay to write down your passwords, we’ve been saying it for over a decade.</a></p>



<p>The best part is that the password doesn’t need to be long or complex if the service does proper peppering. We can shift a lot of the burden away from the user while making them more secure.</p>



<h3>This Works For Everyone</h3>



<p>It doesn’t matter how much money you have or how smart you are, generating passwords works for everyone.</p>



<p>SMS 2FA requires a user to have a working phone and a working phone number. Generating passwords requires a user to have a pen and paper.</p>



<p>Phone numbers can be abused for tracking and advertising while pen and paper can not.</p>



<p>People understand keeping secrets, even ones they do not create.</p>



<p>People have no issues with storing secrets like…</p>



<ul><li>SSN</li><li>Bank account numbers</li><li>Phone Numbers</li><li>Credit card numbers</li><li>Birth Certificates</li><li>License numbers</li><li>Health Insurance numbers</li><li>Download code</li><li>Activation code “gaming”</li><li>Claim numbers</li><li>Serial numbers</li><li>Love notes</li><li>Addresses</li></ul>



<p><strong>Treat passwords like keys</strong> – No one is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Imagine you’re a software reliability engineer with your service-level objectives clearly laid out on your Grafana dashboard. Suddenly, an alert appears: Your 99th percentile latency is going through the roof!</span></p><p><span>A quick glance at the relevant metrics reveals the culprit: A spike in traffic has exceeded the current system throughput. It’s clearly an issue caused by lack of capacity, that adding a few extra instances to the cluster should solve, right? After all, more machines means more capacity. You remain calm as the charts stabilize and the alert fades away. There’s no cause for concern; you automated the scaling process a long time ago.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But this story could have resulted in a very different, far worse scenario. Capacity is easily accessible these days, especially in cloud environments that offer simplified scaling processes. But the ease of provisioning and scaling also incurs rising infrastructure costs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In order to truly overcome the tradeoff between capacity and costs, organizations must maximize application performance. Improving application performance would not only result in significant cost reduction but also a higher quality of service – serving customers at speed to improve customer experience and increase revenues.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, in many cases handling performance issues or improving performance can’t necessarily be achieved simply by adding more machines due to application bottlenecks or resource management inefficiencies. To paraphrase a wise uncle: with greater compute power (adding more machines) doesn’t come greater performance. Unfortunately, in most cases today, improving performance will require architecture changes or code refactoring.</span></p><p><span>Since increasing the node count rarely helps with improving the performance, let’s explore what can be accelerated. The stack is composed of hardware, an operating system (OS), libraries, and the application, among other components. Making improvements at the hardware level is not always feasible, especially when running in the cloud. Vertical scaling is usually limited to the available predefined instance types, which can inflate your cloud bill in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p><span>Rather than spending more on your cloud bill, consider checking how fast the userspace code is. Application developers have a lot on their plates already. They must ensure a proper domain model, maintainable architecture, and timely feature delivery, and so there is only so much they can optimize.</span></p><p><span>While it is possible to invest R&amp;D efforts and time in replacing a poorly performing library with a more performant one or doing the occasional performance-focused rewrite in the hopes of resolving the issue, it’s possible neither will work.</span></p><p><span>When fidgeting with the hardware isn’t an option and the developers are unavailable to help, another option is to attempt to address the problem at the OS level.</span></p><p><span>The history of computing has not only been about smaller transistors and faster clocks. Back in the mainframe days, machines ran a single program at a time that was encoded on a punch card and inserted by a computer operator.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Then business people came along looking for a way to make computers more efficient since, during a program switch, the machines remained idle. This (and a fair amount of ingenuity on the part of early computer scientists) led to the creation of the operating system, a program that executed other programs and managed resource allocation between them.&nbsp; Operating systems, and Linux as one, were designed for users behind the keyboard running simultaneous tasks, therefore the operating system resource management was designed to provide this illusion of parallelism to users behind the keyboard by optimizing internal resource management to achieve high interactivity and fairness.</span></p><p><span>The steadily decreasing price of servers enabled a vast range of potential allocation. Servers were still scarce and ran heterogeneous workloads ranging from web servers to long-running batch computations. Yet they all were running the same operating system more or less: Linux. The OS had to have sensible defaults so that it could perform well in diverse conditions and fit with different kinds of hardware from many different vendors.</span></p><p><span>Today, it’s not uncommon to command a fleet of generic virtual Linux boxes that are mainly focused on running a specific application, a microservice. Due to the inherent modular approach, microservices have known consistent resource usage characteristics and patterns. But the OS underneath hasn’t changed much. It still behaves as if it were supposed to execute multiple programs and share resources between them, which isn’t necessarily the most efficient in such a case and doesn’t provide optimal performance for the application.</span></p><p><span>There are a number of potential performance improvements that can be tested and applied directly at the OS level. Tuning sys controls can have a significant impact on the performance of many subcomponents, such as networking.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>High speed NICs may require setting </span><span>net.core.netdev_max_backlog</span><span> much higher than the default to prevent filling up the card’s ring buffer, which can lead to packet loss. In addition, the initial value for </span><span>net.core.somaxconn</span><span> may prove far too low for proper machine saturation. And those are just two examples.</span></p><p><span>The I/O scheduler may be worth looking into as well. For example, with databases, the default CFQ (Completely Fair Queuing) can yield results that are inferior to those of the deadline scheduler. On the other hand, a noop scheduler allows you to avoid having to schedule I/O operations twice in cloud environments. After all, the VM’s hypervisor often manages the hardware already.</span></p><p><span>No matter what your approach, though, constant meticulous measurement in a production-like environment (or even the production itself, if you’re into chaos engineering) is recommended. Performance tuning is a highly advanced field that requires specialistic system knowledge. It’s also easy to make silly mistakes, such as forgetting to reload kernel parameter preferences after tweaking them.</span></p><p><span>Some OS features are not so easily accessible for performance tuning. For example, the Linux process scheduler utilizes the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), which is perfectly sensible in </span><i><span>most </span></i><span>cases. However, it can sometimes create a significant </span><a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/04/26/the-linux-scheduler-a-decade-of-wasted-cores/"><span>performance gap that cannot be easily found</span></a><span> with standard profiling tools. And even if you do discover it, you can’t simply change a parameter in one of the configuration files; rather a kernel patch and a rebuild is required.</span></p><p><span>Let’s say you’re perfectly fine with the algorithm, but you’d simply like to state that some threads are more important than others. By default you can’t do this, as the niceness setting only works at the process level.</span></p><p><span>I/O-bound applications are also complicated. Even when using raw sockets and </span><span>epoll</span><span>, there is no runtime mechanism to provide selection logic or even a priority to the sockets in the queue. And there is no way for a kernel to know the performance budget for a request.</span></p><p><span>In an ideal world, your application will consist of purpose-built operating systems tailored for each microservice and exploiting every opportunity to boost performance and synergize with the application. In such an ideal world, the internal resource management mechanisms within the operating system will be tailored to the application-specific utility function to drive optimized performance and in turn, also deliver reduced infrastructure costs.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, we’re not there yet, and such solutions are currently only available to corporate giants who can afford to hire a few dozen people to do just that full time. In the words of William Gibson, “The future is already here – it’s just not evenly distributed.”</span></p><p><span>So what is left to those with finite budgets? A new approach for real-time continuous optimization that enables organizations to leverage AI-driven infrastructure optimizations that are suited specifically to the running workload.</span></p><p><span>Using application-driven scheduling and prioritization algorithms, it is possible to identify contended resources, bottlenecks, and prioritization opportunities and solve them in real-time.</span><span><br> </span><span>These innovative solutions leverage application’s specific resource usage patterns, the data flow, analyzing CPU scheduling order, oversubscribed locks, memory, network, and disk access patterns, and more.</span></p><p><span>This approach ensures the most efficient use of compute resources, resulting in the need for fewer VMs, less compute resources, reducing costs significantly while delivering better performance.&nbsp;</span></p></div><p><h3>Subscribe to the Granulate Blog</h3><h4>Get the latest posts straight to your inbox.</h4> <!--[if lte IE 8]> <script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/v2-legacy.js"></script> <![endif]-->   </p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Kubernetes is the most popular open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure layer. As a result, developers can focus on building applications, then deploy them to any of those environments.</p>



<p>To bring Kubernetes closer to developers, we’ve created a ready-to-use <a href="https://github.com/microtica-components/component-aws-eks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infrastructure component for Kubernetes</a>. This component uses AWS EKS as a service and sets Kubernetes master and nodes in auto-scaling infrastructure setup. Nodes are EC2 instances based on Kubernetes optimized AMIs.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Components are a core concept in Microtica which allow developers to create and release their custom Cloud infrastructure setup in a standardized way. A</em>fter <em>the component is created, it can be reused in as many projects and environments as needed.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/start-creating-infrastructure-on-aws-like-a-pro/" target="_blank">infrastructure setup</a> for Kubernetes, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.microtica.com/" target="_blank">Microtica</a> also offers you CI and CD for microservices. This means that you don’t have to worry about the complex details of the integration with Kubernetes. With this, we cover the whole process of software and infrastructure delivery.</p>



<p>In this article, we will learn how to <strong>deploy a microservice in the cloud with our Kubernetes component</strong>. Let’s get started by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/register" target="_blank">creating your account</a> and project in Microtica. To deploy your first microservice in under 10 mins, follow these steps:</p>



<h3><strong>1. Add your AWS Account</strong></h3>



<p>First, go into <em>Settings</em>, then <em>AWS Accounts </em>tab, then <em>Add New Account</em>. Follow the steps to connect your account.</p>



<p><em>Note: All resources will be created on the provided AWS account, expenses will be calculated according to AWS pricing for using the services.</em></p>



<h3><strong>2. Create an environment</strong></h3>



<p>With a connected AWS account, you can continue to create your environment in which you’ll deploy your infrastructure. <a href="https://portal.microtica.com/environments/create" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Create an environment</a> following the wizard on Microtica and then continue to add the components we will need.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Add components</strong></h3>



<p>To successfully setup a working Kubernetes Cluster in which we’ll deploy a microservice, we will need only 2 components: a <strong>VPC component </strong>and of course a <strong>Kubernetes Cluster component</strong>. We need the VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud) component to enable us to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that we’ve defined. This virtual network is dedicated to your AWS account. This component sets one AWS VPC, and four subnets (2 public and 2 private subnets).</p>



<p>Here’s how to configure your components to connect them and create the infrastructure.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/07-jW74q-UenBJfwF-1024x510.png" alt="creating an AWS VPC Component

<p><em>Note: You will need to create an EC2 key-pair from the AWS console. We don’t create it automatically due to security reasons. This key should always be in your possession and kept in a secure place. This key will allow you to access your EC2 instances through SSH.</em></p>

<p>When configuring the parameters for the Kubernetes Cluster component you can reference the VPC component so you <strong>don’t have to manually reenter the values</strong>. Microtica will take care of the order in which the components will be deployed in the cloud. This will allow you to have a working environment.</p>

<p>With the configuration set in place, you can deploy your environment by clicking <em>Create Plan</em>. Here you will see a detailed listing of the resources that are about to be added to the environment. Confirming will initiate the deployment and lead you to a page where you can follow the logs and events that are happening. Setting up this infrastructure can take up to 15 mins, so let us get started with our microservice in the meantime.</p>



<h3><strong>4. Create a microservice</strong></h3>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we will be using a simple <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world" target="_blank">Hello World microservice</a> available in Docker hub. First, go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/microservices/create" target="_blank"><em>Microservices/Create microservice</em></a><em> </em>and follow the wizard in Microtica. For a source select public docker image and paste <strong>hello-world</strong>. Then, click <em>Next</em>, then <em>Create Microservice </em>and now we have our microservice.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1024x492.png" alt="Creating a Kubernetes microservice
" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1024x492.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-300x144.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-768x369.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1536x738.png 1536w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-2048x984.png 2048w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-740x356.png 740w" sizes="100vw"><figcaption>Create microservice from public Docker image</figcaption></figure>



<p>As a result of using a docker image as a source, we already have a built artifact so we can immediately deploy it in the Kubernetes cluster. <strong>You can do this from <em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em> Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>Microtica offers configuration options when deploying your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can select the scaling options, and as well setup continuous delivery for your microservice.</p>



<p>After successfully deploying the microservice in the Kubernetes Cluster you can preview your microservice by following the <strong><em>Access URL/hello-world-ms</em></strong><em> </em>(the name of the service if you’ve changed it). You should see this in your browser window:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0KLYx9DQIHY9wBiN8.png" alt="Your first microservice on a Kubernetes cluster
"></figure></div>



<p><strong>AND WE ARE DONE! WE JUST DEPLOYED OUR FIRST MICROSERVICE ON A KUBERNETES CLUSTER 👏</strong></p>



<h3><strong>5. Bonus: Cleanup</strong></h3>



<p>To remove all the resources we created on your AWS account go to environment details and in the menu select <em>Undeploy. </em>As a result, you’ll get your resources created on AWS cleaned. However, you will still have the configuration in Microtica in case you want to deploy it in the cloud again.</p>

<p>– Hey, Markus! What format is this head-rotation representation in?</p>
<p>– It is a rotation matrix, I answer. Right handed, z forward through the nose and x through the left ear. Our young newly graduated colleague nods his/her head.</p>
<p>After about 10 minutes I hear my name again.</p>
<p>– Markus…. Eh, what order is it?</p>
<p>– Oh no! You have opened Wikipedia? Haven’t you? I answer in despair from my desk.</p>
<p>It happens time to time that a newly graduated engineer (or summer intern) asks me exactly this question. Almost always with the Wikipedia page open at the screen, which I think is horrible (or even worse, some “Learn OpenGL” tutorial).</p>
<p>I <s>steal</s> take a chair to sit down beside the person. This will take a few minutes, we are going to do something that is harder than learning: we are going to unlearn.</p>
<p>It is interesting, I get no questions, or only very short questions, on Euler angels, Rodriguez rotations and actually only one recurrent question on quaternions. But very often I get questions on rotation matrices. I think it is a bit odd since rotation matrices are very simple in comparison to many other rotation representations. I think a big reason for this is the Wikipedia page. It looks something like this:</p>
<p>
\[
R_x(\theta) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos \theta &amp;  -\sin \theta \\
0 &amp; \sin \theta  &amp;  \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
R_y(\theta) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp; 0 &amp; \sin \theta \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
-\sin \theta &amp; 0 &amp; \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
R_z(\theta) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta &amp;  -\sin \theta &amp; 0 \\
\sin \theta &amp;   \cos \theta &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\alpha\cos\beta &amp; \cos\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma - \sin\alpha\cos\gamma &amp; \cos\alpha\sin\beta\cos\gamma + \sin\alpha\sin\gamma \\
\sin\alpha\cos\beta &amp; \sin\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma + \cos\alpha\cos\gamma &amp; \sin\alpha\sin\beta\cos\gamma - \cos\alpha\sin\gamma \\
-\sin\beta &amp; \cos\beta\sin\gamma &amp; \cos\beta\cos\gamma \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
</p>
<p>It talks about rotations. Rotation around different axes and their relation to Euler angles. This can be a bit confusing when working with for example a head pose. You can of course think about rotation matrices as if the head rotates around different axes in different order, but it becomes kind of hard to interpret:</p>
<p>
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
 -0.9987820 &amp; 0.0348782 &amp; -0.0348995 \\
  0.0283128 &amp; 0.9844193 &amp;  0.1735424 \\
  0.0404086 &amp; 0.1723429 &amp; -0.9842078
\end{bmatrix}
\]
</p>
<p>So to interpret this we need to solve the following equation system:</p>
<p>
\[
\begin{cases}
-\sin(\beta) &amp; = 0.0404086 \\
\cos(\beta)\sin(\gamma) &amp; = 0.1723429 \\
\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) &amp; = -0.9987820
\end{cases}
\]
</p>
<p>and then we get an <em>“intrinsic rotation whose Tait–Bryan angles are α, β, γ, about axes z, y, x”</em> to visualize in our head.</p>
<p>Its sad because I think rotation matrices are one of the easiest representation to interpret.</p>
<p>Don’t think of them as rotations, think of them as a unit vectors of a new coordinate systems.</p>
<p><img src="https://kodkodgames.gitlab.io/post/matrix_cs.png#center" alt="plot of the coordinate system"></p>
<p>We describe where the coordinate system is located related to another coordinate system (where we rotate from), for example from the camera’s coordinate system perspective (z forward, y upwards). The first column of the rotation matrix is the new x-axis expressed in the old coordinate system, the second column is the y-axis and so on. An identity matrix would yield in no rotation since all unit vectors would be the same as the previous coordinate system.</p>
<p>
\[
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
  X_x &amp; Y_x &amp; Z_x \\
  X_y &amp; Y_y &amp;  Z_y \\
  X_z &amp; Y_z &amp; Z_z
\end{bmatrix}
\]
</p> 
<p>Lets go back to the example with the head expressed in the camera coordinate system and assume the head position is atfront of the camera. So by interpret the previous matrix, we can look at the new z-axis:</p>
<p>
\[
Z_{axis} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
Z_x \\
Z_y \\
Z_z
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
-0.0348995 \\
0.1735424 \\
-0.9842078
\end{bmatrix}
\]
</p>
<p>(Remember that z-axis is where the head’s nose is pointing)</p>
<p>We can quickly see that z-part of the z-axis is almost -1. This means the nose is pointing at the opposite direction as the camera, eg. towards the camera if the person is sitting at front of it.</p>
<p>We can also se that the persons head is rotated a little bit up (positive y component of the z-axis) and is pointing a little bit to the right of the camera (negative x component).</p>
<p>And that’s it! Rotation matrices just describe the unit vectors of a new coordinate system.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>– Hey, Markus! How come this matrix is 4x4?</p>

        <p><em>This March, I spent a couple of days traveling through western Iceland.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/iceland.jpg" alt="Iceland, part 1"></p>
<p>While I was there, I thought a lot about tools – mechanical tools, software tools, tools that last, and tools that are fragile. The somber snow-covered scenery made me think about how quickly most of the tools we use today get outdated or replaced, and I thought about the kinds of tools that I’ve been building for myself for the last few years to help organize my life.</p>
<p>I took a walk around <em>Smábátahöfnin í Keflavík</em> (a small marina nearby) that night, unraveled myself into my hotel room, and started writing this post.</p>
<p>I want to share why I build my own tools and how I think we should think about building tools for life. It’s long, so here’s a roadmap. Feel free to jump around.</p>

<p>For the last few years, I’ve been on a journey to replace all of the essential digital tools I use for organizing my life with tools I develop, maintain, and deploy myself.</p>
<p>What started with a single-page notes app I made in high school has grown into a constellation of home-grown productivity tools I now rely on for my day-to-day work and learning. Here’s a sample.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/polyx#ligature">Ligature</a>, for long-term notes and tasks, goals, brainstorming, project planning, and other important writing.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/ligature.jpg" alt="Ligature"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/pico">Pico</a>, for more ephemeral notes and tasks that change on a daily basis. I split up my notes into two apps (Ligature and Pico) because it works better for my workflow. (More on this later.)</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/pico.jpg" alt="Pico"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/mira">Mira</a> for keeping track of people I know, why they’re interesting, and what we’ve talked about.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/mira.png" alt="Mira"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/polyx#noct">Lovecroft</a> for managing and sending emails to my <a href="https://thesephist.com/#newsletter">mailing lists</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lovecroft.jpg" alt="Lovecroft"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/polyx#noct">Noct</a> for backing up and syncing all my files across computers and the cloud. Noct doesn’t have a graphical UI, just a command-line tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/frieden/">Frieden</a> as a public availability calendar, showing when I’m free or busy.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/frieden.png" alt="Frieden"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/thingboard">Thingboard</a> for more free-form Post-its-on-the-wall style brainstorming.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/thingboard.jpg" alt="Thingboard"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://codeframe.co/">Codeframe</a> for spinning off simple JavaScript experiments like <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/word-experiments/#word-plotter">the word plotter</a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, these apps do almost everything I need to do on my computer to keep myself organized. I don’t use any third-party notes, task management, or contacts apps, though I used to be a big fan of Simplenote and Todoist. I’ve used Notion, Dropbox Paper, Google Docs, and Airtable, but only for working in teams that centralized on them. These days, besides email and calendar, I live within a system of my own tools, and it works well for me.</p>
<p>I don’t want to imply that my tools are objectively better than the professional tools on the market like Notion and Dropbox. Those latter services have more features, and might even be more reliable today. But I think my tools fit me better for a different reason.</p>

<p>Each person’s mind works a little differently, and each person remembers and processes information a little differently. I think we all work at our best when we work with tools that fit how our minds work.</p>
<p>The Eureka moment that some of us feel when we finally find a notes app or todo system that fits our brains – that epiphany happens when the tools we use mirror the way our minds work, and how we want to move information through our lives. Good tools fit perfectly around our workflows, bad tools don’t.</p>
<p>When we resort to having other people build tools for us, the tools they build might never quite perfectly fit our workflows, because they’re not built for our individual minds. When other people build tools for us to use, they either design tools after their own workflows and mental models, or worse, they design it for a mass market of millions of people who all sort-of-but-not-really work and think in similar ways. The result is that mass-market productivity tools don’t fit the way our individual minds are predisposed to work. Instead, to use these tools, we need to bend our workflows to fit around the tools.</p>
<p>My biggest benefit from writing my own tool set is that <strong>I can build the tools that exactly conform to my workflows, rather than constructing my workflows around the tools available to me.</strong> This means the tools can truly be an extension of the way my brain thinks and organizes information about the world around me. My tools aren’t perfect yet, but as they grow and evolve, they’ll only become better reflections of my personal mental models.</p>
<p>For example, one place where my mind works differently than the tools on the market is the task/notes distinction.</p>
<h3 id="tasks-and-notes-a-false-dichotomy">Tasks and notes, a false dichotomy</h3>
<p>My workflow used to differentiate between tasks and notes. Tasks were action items that I could reference, take action on, and complete, and then erase from my list. Notes were things that were indefinitely relevant. I would take notes and then come back to reference them many times. A note by itself isn’t actionable.</p>
<p>But once I started building my own tools, I realized this distinction isn’t really the way my brain worked. For me, a huge grey area exists between actionable, completable tasks and purely encyclopedic notes. Here are some things that fall in the grey area for me, pulled from my real, actual notes I took this week.</p>
<ol>
<li>I recently learned some really useful tips about how to grow leaders within a community from the book <em><a href="https://gettogetherbook.com/">Get Together</a></em>. I definitely want to act on these learnings at some point in the communities I lead, but I don’t want them cluttering up my todo list because they’re not things I can just complete and check off quickly. I also want to remember these tips forever, even after the first time I act on them.</li>
<li>I’ve been brainstorming an idea for a side project related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra">symbolic mathematics</a>. I’ve been writing down my inspirations related to this project. I don’t want to tuck it away in my notes, because this is something I want to build soon, but I also don’t want to shove paragraphs of notes into a todo list item.</li>
<li>I keep a running list of ideas I have for future blog posts, but I don’t really have a “write the next blog post” task item under which I’d normally put these ideas, because I don’t write on schedule – I just write when I can. Where should these ideas go? They’re sort-of notes and sort-of tasks.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that these are either very clearly todo items or very clearly notes, and that’s ok. But I certainly felt differently, and I realized I was only separating things into these two buckets because my tools forced me to. Before I wrote my own tools, I had a todo app (Todoist) and I had a notes app (Simplenote), and there was nothing in between.</p>
<p>Eventually, I discovered a better mental model for my working style: I ask myself <em>how immediately</em> I need to take action on something.</p>
<p>The way that I see it, everything I learn and jot down is something for me to act on at some point in my life. If I read something that I never thought would influence the way I lived, it wouldn’t have value to me, and I simply wouldn’t write it down. Armed with this insight, these days, I have two different notes apps, and I don’t use a todo list app. These two apps are Ligature and Pico, mentioned above.</p>
<p>One is for notes that are changing often. Day-to-day tasks, things to remember for the next week, even long notes and links related to what I’m working on <em>now</em>. The other app is for notes that grow over time, like notes I take while reading books or watching talks, my annual goals, financial planning, reading list, and project outlines. <strong>My two notes apps mirror the way my brain works best – one is my short-term, working memory, the other is my long-term memory.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve had this system for a few months now, and haven’t felt any need for something better. It doesn’t have the crazy features of some notes services on the market today, but it just works the way my brain does.</p>
<p>But what if I need something different later on in life?</p>
<h3 id="tools-that-grow-with-your-workflows">Tools that grow with your workflows</h3>
<p>The other benefit of building homebrew tools is that <strong>tools you build yourself can grow and change as your workflow changes over time</strong>. So if my needs do change over time, my tools can grow to accommodate exactly what I need.</p>
<p>When I first started keeping more organized notes on the interesting people I met, I started with a document in my notes app. Over time, I noticed that these notes followed a pattern: I wrote down their name and primary contact info, how I first met them, what school they went to, and what we talked about the last time we spoke.</p>
<p>So when I built Mira, my own people-manager app, I designed it around that exact workflow I had developed. When I later realized I was also recording people’s Twitter usernames in the description field, I just added a Twitter username field to each contact.</p>
<p>This is typical of the way I <em>discover</em> my workflows. <strong>I start with a minimal, bare-bones solution, and try to pick up on patterns and tricks I create for myself. And then I encode those patterns and tricks into the tools over time.</strong></p>
<p>This way, my tools can grow organically as my workflows evolve. Neither of them gets in the way of each other most of the time, and I think that was hard to appreciate before I started relying wholly on my own tools.</p>

<p>My productivity tools, especially my notes and contacts, are the load-bearing tools of my life. If they break or disappear, it’ll take a long time and a lot of effort for me to rebuild those same workflows and tools, so it’s important that they’re reliable, and that I can depend on them working for me for a long time (measured in years and decades, not quarters).</p>
<p>I’ve written at length about <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ownership/">the importance of ownership</a> before. I want to own the pieces of my life that are most critical, and I want agency over how these tools change over time.</p>
<p>I want these notes and ideas and workflows to stick with me as I grow as a person through the next decades. If I had to …</p></article></div>

<p>We were pleased when <a href="https://opencrux.com/">Crux</a> was included in the
ThoughtWorks
<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/crux">technology radar</a>
with a recommendation to <strong>assess</strong>:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Crux is an open-source document database with bitemporal graph
queries…​ it’s currently in alpha and lacks SQL support, but you can
use a Datalog query interface for reading and traversing
relationships.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>We are fans of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog">Datalog</a> and the
power it gives. Although it’s not directly compatible and may drift
out further, we’ve based our Datalog query API on
<a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query">Datomic’s</a>, where Datalog
is represented as a pattern-matching declarative data-structure.</p>
<p>Datalog is easy to construct and parse and it is natural to make use
of custom predicates and rules as part of the logical pattern
matching.</p>
<p>We love Datalog, but it’s also fair to say that a sizeable chunk of
potential users will want to use SQL. Be it for users who want to run
ad-hoc SQL queries without needing to know Datalog, or for integration
between systems where SQL is the lingua franca, it’s important that we
support it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_code_crux_sql_code"><a href="#_code_crux_sql_code"></a><code>crux-sql</code></h2>
<div>
<p>We have created a new <code>crux-sql</code> module in Crux which makes use of the
<a href="https://calcite.apache.org/">Apache Calcite</a> SQL query planning engine. Calcite
is a powerful library for exposing SQL queries against arbitrary data-sources
and has been integrated with a variety of DBMSs such as Cassandra, Mongo and
Elastic, as well as Big Data systems like Hive, Drill, Flink and Dremio.</p>
<p>Calcite has been around for a long while and is still very
active. We’re grateful for the work the Calcite team have put into
this tool and the power it gives, as well as the friendly community that
has built up around it.</p>
<p>We run Calcite in-process as part of a Crux node, so there’s no need
to set up any additional infrastructure. Rather you just need to add
the <code>crux-sql</code> module dependency:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="clojure">[juxt/crux-sql "RELEASE"]]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>We have integrated Calcite such that SQL queries are translated to
efficient Datalog queries, including sorts and inner joins.</p>
<p>You can avoid the relatively small overhead of preparing queries by
using PreparedStatements.</p>
<p>Please visit the
<a href="https://github.com/juxt/crux/blob/master/crux-sql/README.adoc">module
README</a> for how to get going with some simple steps, or please watch
this video:</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HEBL_ue2wbw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
</div>
<p>The <code>crux-sql</code> module allows for both in-process SQL queries and for
remote JDBC queries using
<a href="https://calcite.apache.org/avatica/">Avatica</a>. This is covered in the
docs.</p>

<p>Does your company have a culture of letting everyone see each other’s calendars? Do people often schedule meetings whenever there are openings, without asking?</p>



<p>If so, your calendar is a blocklist. The only time that isn’t available for someone to steal is time that’s already spoken for. This is a problem. A time slot that isn’t currently booked shouldn’t be free real estate. That’s my TIME! You can’t just take it without asking.</p>



<p>Instead, your calendars should be an allowlist. You should say “if you want to talk to me, this is when you can” instead of “this is when you CAN’T.” You shouldn’t have to defend our time like it’s gold and your coworkers are pirates. You should just assume that it’s yours to spend how you see fit.</p>



<p>Some people block time off to try to protect their calendars. They create big “GTD” blocks on their calendar and hope that nobody books meetings on top of them. I’ve even heard of people creating fake or vague meeting titles in hopes that others will assume there’s a real meeting at that time. This is a crappy workaround, and it isn’t enough. </p>



<p>The solution should be office hours. You should be able to say say “I’m free for meetings from 2-5pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and if you want to talk to me then that’s when you can.” In most companies, doing that would make you an annoyance. Those companies don’t respect Deep Work. </p>



<p>Scheduling meetings should be a little bit painful. You should have to really want it. You should be forced to question yourself. <em>Is this actually worth me going to the trouble of figuring out how to schedule this meeting? Or could it instead be an asynchronous discussion? </em>Office hours and calendars-as-allowlists have this added benefit.</p>



<p>Is your calendar an allowlist or a blocklist?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Have you ever wanted to restore your database's state to a particular moment in time? This post explains how, using WAL-G.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL-G</a> is an <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2017/08/18/introducing-wal-g-faster-restores-for-postgres/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source continuous archiving tool</a> used to easily set up and recover from <a href="https://supabase.io/blog/2020/07/17/postgresql-physical-logical-backups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical backups</a> in Postgres. It mainly handles the storage and retrieval of physical backups and WAL archives to and from a chosen cloud storage provider. In this post, we will walk you through on how to effortlessly set up WAL-G for your database as well as guide you on what to do if and when disaster strikes.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>For this tutorial, we will be using two instances running Postgres databases on <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu 18.04</a>. One instance will act as your main database, the other is your recovery database. If you’re using another operating system some file paths may vary.</p><h3>Installations</h3><p>Make sure the below packages are installed in your instances. Alternatively, you can spin up the <a href="https://github.com/supabase/postgres/releases/tag/v0.13.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest version</a> of <a href="https://github.com/supabase/postgres" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supabase Postgres</a> which would already have everything configured and installed, along with other <a href="https://github.com/supabase/postgres#features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goodies</a>. It is readily available in either the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08915TCJ2?qid=1595854723755&amp;sr=0-1&amp;ref_=srh_res_product_title" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/supabase-postgres" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Ocean</a> marketplaces and only takes <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/postgres/postgres-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a few minutes</a> to get running.</p><h4>Postgres 12</h4><p>A quick installation guide can be found <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h4>envdir</h4><p><a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/envdir.8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">envdir</a> allows us to run other programs with a modified environment based on the files in the provided directory. This can be installed through the <a href="https://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daemontools</a> package:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>sudo</span><span> </span><span>apt-get</span><span> </span><span>install</span><span> -y daemontools</span></p></div></div></div></div><h4>WAL-G</h4><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>wget</span><span> https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases/download/v0.2.15/wal-g.linux-amd64.tar.gz</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>tar</span><span> -zxvf wal-g.linux-amd64.tar.gz</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>mv</span><span> wal-g /usr/local/bin/</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>AWS credentials and resources</h3><p>When storing backups, WAL-G has numerous <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g#configuration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud storage provider options</a> for us to choose from. For this tutorial, we will be using AWS. Have the following prepared:</p><ul><li>AWS Access &amp; Secret keys.</li><li>An S3 bucket.</li></ul><h2>Setting it up</h2><h3>1. Configure environment variables</h3><p>The directory <code>/etc/wal-g.d/env</code> is created and contains files that stores environment variables. It would later be used in WAL-G commands via envdir.</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>umask</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span>=</span><span>rwx,g</span><span>=</span><span>rx,o</span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>mkdir</span><span> -p /etc/wal-g.d/env</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>'secret-key-content'</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> /etc/wal-g.d/env/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>'access-key'</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> /etc/wal-g.d/env/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>'s3://backup-bucket/project-directory'</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> /etc/wal-g.d/env/WALG_S3_PREFIX</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>'db password'</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> /etc/wal-g.d/env/PGPASSWORD</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>chown</span><span> -R root:postgres /etc/wal-g.d</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>2. Enable WAL archiving</h3><p>Here, we enable <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/continuous-archiving.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL archiving</a> and instruct Postgres to store the archives in the specified S3 bucket via WAL-G. </p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"archive_mode = yes"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"archive_command = 'envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env /usr/local/bin/wal-g wal-push %p'"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"archive_timeout = 60"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>3. Restart the database</h3><p>The database is restarted to let the changes in the configuration to take effect.</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>sudo</span><span> /etc/init.d/postgresql restart</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>4. Create your first physical backup</h3><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>sudo</span><span> -su postgres envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env /usr/local/bin/wal-g backup-push /var/lib/postgresql/12/main</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>At this point, if you were to check the S3 path that you provided, the following two newly created and populated directories would be observed:</p><p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/lai1mxg62kffyd2khmtm.png" alt="Alt Text"></p><p>From then on, subsequent physical backups would be found in the directory <code>basebackups_005</code> and any WAL archives would be sent to the directory <code>wal_005</code>.</p><h3>5. [Optional] Schedule regular physical backups</h3><p>A CRON job can then be set to schedule physical backups to be performed everyday:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"0 0 * * * postgres /usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env /usr/local/bin/wal-g backup-push /var/lib/postgresql/12/main"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> /etc/cron.d/pg_backup</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Here, the instance has been instructed to back up the database at the start of each day at midnight. By physically backing up your instance regularly, overall recovery time could be faster. Restoring from a physical backup from yesterday would lead to fewer WAL archive files to be replayed as compared to restoring from one from a month ago.</p><hr><h2>Disaster strikes</h2><p>Something goes wrong with the database or instance. We will now use what available physical backups we have in the S3 bucket to recover and restore all of our data on to a new instance.</p><h3>1. Configure environment variables</h3><p>The configuration should be the <strong>same</strong> as the original instance. For recovery and restoration, we would not need the variable <code>PGPASSWORD</code>.</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>umask</span><span> </span><span>u</span><span>=</span><span>rwx,g</span><span>=</span><span>rx,o</span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>mkdir</span><span> -p /etc/wal-g.d/env</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>'secret-key-content'</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> /etc/wal-g.d/env/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>'access-key'</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> /etc/wal-g.d/env/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>'s3://backup-bucket/project-directory'</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> /etc/wal-g.d/env/WALG_S3_PREFIX</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>chown</span><span> -R root:postgres /etc/wal-g.d</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>2. Stop the database</h3><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>sudo</span><span> /etc/init.d/postgresql stop</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>3. Switch to the user <code>postgres</code></h3><h3>4. Prepare the database for recovery</h3><h4>Set restore_command</h4><p>Through <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/continuous-archiving.html#:~:text=must%20specify%20is%20the%20restore_command,%20which%20tells%20PostgreSQL%20how%20to%20retrieve%20archived%20WAL%20file%20segments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">restore_command</a>, we instruct Postgres to pull all WAL archives from our S3 bucket to use during recovery.</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"restore_command = '/usr/bin/envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env /usr/local/bin/wal-g wal-fetch </span><span>\"</span><span>%f</span><span>\"</span><span> </span><span>\"</span><span>%p</span><span>\"</span><span> &gt;&gt; /tmp/wal.log 2&gt;&amp;1'"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf</span></p></div></div></div></div><h4>[Optional] Achieve Point in Time Recovery (PITR)</h4><p>If we want to restore the database only up to a certain point in time (eg. right before the disaster), we can do so by setting both <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#:~:text=recovery_target_time%20(timestamp)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recovery_target_time</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#:~:text=recovery_target_action%20(enum)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recovery_target_action</a>. Do note that the timezone would need to match that of the original instance. This is usually at the UTC (+00) timezone.</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"recovery_target_time = '2020-07-27 01:23:00.000000+00'"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf</span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"recovery_target_action = 'promote'"</span><span> </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>5. Restore from physical backup</h3><p>The current data directory is deleted and is replaced with the latest version of the physical backup from the S3 bucket.</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>rm</span><span> -rf /var/lib/postgresql/12/main</span></p><p><span>$ envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env /usr/local/bin/wal-g backup-fetch /var/lib/postgresql/12/main LATEST</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>6. Create a <code>recovery.signal</code> file</h3><p>This file <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/continuous-archiving.html#:~:text=Set%20recovery%20configuration%20settings%20in%20postgresql.conf%20(see%20Section%2019.5.4)%20and%20create%20a%20file%20recovery.signal%20in%20the%20cluster%20data%20directory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instructs</a> Postgres that the database should undergo recovery mode upon start.</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>touch</span><span> /var/lib/postgresql/12/main/recovery.signal</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>7. Log out of <code>postgres</code> and start the database</h3><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>$ </span><span>exit</span><span></span></p><p><span>$ </span><span>sudo</span><span> /etc/init.d/postgresql start</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Once Postgres finishes starting up and completes recovery mode, all data or data up to the specified point in time would have been successfully restored on to the new instance. Disaster averted.</p></section></div>]]>

It’s that simple.”</p><p id="viewer-8vmcf">“Stay at MSNBC at least until the midterms,” Jeffrey said a couple years back.  He advised to watch and see what happens.</p><p id="viewer-ekaih">“Hang in there… you’re needed,” Elizabeth recommended last winter.  “I was in your shoes when I was younger but I stuck it out.”</p><p id="viewer-bvvpg">A year and a half ago, simply quitting my job without knowing my next step sounded pretty radical.  So I stuck it out a bit longer until we were in the middle of a pandemic to make a truly radical move.  </p><p id="viewer-dj9sj">July 24th was my last day at MSNBC.  I don’t know what I’m going to do next exactly but I simply couldn’t stay there anymore.  My colleagues are very smart people with good intentions.  The problem is the job itself.  It forces skilled journalists to make bad decisions on a daily basis.  </p><p id="viewer-fl8l2">You may not watch MSNBC but just know that this problem still affects you, too.  All the commercial networks function the same – and no doubt that content seeps into your social media feed, one way or the other.</p><p id="viewer-4g127">It’s possible that I’m more sensitive to the editorial process due to my background in public radio, where no decision I ever witnessed was predicated on how a topic or guest would “rate.”  The longer I was at MSNBC, the more I saw such choices — it’s practically baked in to the editorial process – and those decisions affect news content every day.  Likewise, it’s taboo to discuss how the ratings scheme distorts content, or it’s simply taken for granted, because everyone in the commercial broadcast news industry is doing the exact same thing.  </p><p id="viewer-9c0ji">But behind closed doors, industry leaders will admit the damage that’s being done.</p><p id="viewer-5n5uh">“We are a cancer and there is no cure,” a successful and insightful TV veteran said to me.  “But if you could find a cure, it would change the world.”</p><p id="viewer-39g2k">As it is, this cancer stokes national division, even in the middle of a civil rights crisis.  The model blocks diversity of thought and content because the networks have incentive to amplify fringe voices and events, at the expense of others… all because it pumps up the ratings. </p><p id="viewer-a2lh5">This cancer risks human lives, even in the middle of a pandemic.  The primary focus quickly became what Donald Trump was doing (poorly) to address the crisis, rather than the science itself.  As new details have become available about antibodies, a vaccine, or how COVID actually spreads, producers still want to focus on the politics.  Important facts or studies get buried.</p><p id="viewer-d6q8h">This cancer risks our democracy, even in the middle of a presidential election.  Any discussion about the election usually focuses on Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, a repeat offense from 2016 (Trump smothers out all other coverage).  Also important is to ensure citizens can vote by mail this year, but I’ve watched that topic get ignored or “killed” numerous times.</p><p id="viewer-k0ik">Context and factual data are often considered too cumbersome for the audience.  There may be some truth to that (our education system really should improve the critical thinking skills of Americans) – but another hard truth is that it is the job of journalists to teach and inform, which means they might need to figure out a better way to do that.  They could contemplate more creative methods for captivating an audience.  Just about anything would improve the current process, which can be pretty rudimentary (think basing today’s content on whatever rated well yesterday, or look to see what’s trending online today).</p><p id="viewer-a360v">Occasionally, the producers will choose to do a topic or story without regard for how they think it will rate, but that is the exception, not the rule.  Due to the simple structure of the industry – the desire to charge more money for commercials, as well as the ratings bonuses that top-tier decision-makers earn – they always relapse into their old profitable programming habits.</p><p id="viewer-3haev">I understand that the journalistic process is largely subjective and any group of individuals may justify a different set of priorities on any given day.  Therefore, it’s particularly notable to me, for one, that nearly every rundown at the network basically is the same, hour after hour.  And two, they use this subjective nature of the news to justify economically beneficial decisions.  I’ve even heard producers deny their role as journalists.  A very capable senior producer once said: “Our viewers don’t really consider us the news.  They come to us for comfort.”</p><p id="viewer-a1lqp">Again, personally, I don’t think the people need to change.  I think the job itself needs to change.  There is a better way to do this.  I’m not so cynical to think that we are absolutely doomed (though we are on that path).  I know we can find a cure.  If we can figure how to send a man to the moon, if Alex Trebek can defy the odds with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, and if Harry Reid can actually overcome pancreatic cancer (he’s now cancer free), then we can fix this, too. </p><p id="viewer-2jvfe">“Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”</p><p id="viewer-evref">I know James Baldwin wasn’t thinking about MSNBC when he wrote that line in 1962, but those words spoke loudly to me in the summer of 2020.  Unfortunately, many of the same ailments are still at stake today.  Now maybe we can’t really change the inherently broken structure of broadcast news, but I know for certain that it won’t change unless we actually face it, in public, and at least try to change it. </p><p id="viewer-9pbe9">Through this pandemic and the surreal, alienating lockdown, I’ve witnessed many people question their lives and what they’re doing with their time on this planet.  I reckon I’m one of those people, looking for greater meaning and truth.  As much as I love my life in New York City and really don’t want to leave, I feel fortunate to be able to return to Virginia in the near term to reconnect with family, friends, and a community of independent journalists.  I’m both nervous and excited about this change.  Thanks to COVID-19, I’m learning to live with uncertainty. </p><p id="viewer-2bttl">And so very soon, I’m going to be seeking you out, any one of you who also may sense that the news is fundamentally flawed and is frustrated by it.  This effort will start informally but I hope to crystallize a plan for when better, safer days are upon us.  On that front, feel free to reach out anytime if you would like to discuss any of this – whether in agreement or not.  More than ever, I’m craving a full and civil discourse. </p><p id="viewer-ei74m">Until next time, thank you for reading.  I wish you all well.</p><p id="viewer-56pls">Ariana</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/freakwave.jpg" alt="Freak wave"></p>

<p>During the pandemic, I’ve done my civic duty and spent lockdown reading a ton of random stuff on the internet. In the midst of a Wikipedia binge, I went down a rabbit hole on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave">rogue waves</a>: massive waves that occur in the middle of the ocean, endangering ships and generating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu4ogCy5d4k">kickass Youtube content</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of a rogue wave reminded me of a particularly challenging stage in the life of many venture-backed enterprise SaaS startups. Similar to how a rogue wave forms, during this phase many Small Problems coincide and create a Big Problem. Also like rogue waves, this moment in the life of a high-growth enterprise SaaS business is uncommon – it seems to occur around $5-20 million ARR, which relatively few companies reach, and can seem almost mythical. And finally, the effects of both rogue waves and this challenging startup stage are predictable: if you spend long enough on the high seas, they’re waiting for you.</p>

<p>I’ve seen this phenomenon both in-person as an operator and as an observer of other companies, and I do believe it’s real. I’m writing this essay in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share what I’ve seen</li>
  <li>Provide some opinions on what you can do about it</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully I can be the crusty old mariner bringing back tales that others find useful.</p>

<h2 id="hitting-the-wall">Hitting the Wall</h2>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/boat.jpg" alt="Big boat, bigger wave">
Startups can be stressful</p>

<p>The rogue wave typically seems to hit between $5M and $20M in ARR. If you’re operating with a common venture-backed SaaS model of <a href="https://www.saastr.com/how-to-figure-out-your-competitors-revenues-in-about-70-seconds/">$1-200k ARR per employee</a>, this is around where you’ll hit the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191001-dunbars-number-why-we-can-only-maintain-150-relationships">Dunbar number</a> of ~150 people: the point where you can no longer operate as a large family, and need to start acting like a corporation. <em>(Note that the post linked is from 2012 – SaaS has since exploded, and more companies are raising huge rounds and hiring more on less revenue)</em></p>

<p>Crossing the 150-person barrier is both operationally and emotionally difficult:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operational: We have so many teams, we need regular status reports!</li>
  <li>Emotional: Why do I need to send <em>you</em> a status report all of a sudden, I thought we were all friends here?!</li>
</ul>

<p>This transition point is also when many leaders who excelled in scrappy startup mode <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/06/27/hardest-part-of-startup-scale-yourself.html">struggle to level up</a> in a larger organization. Some successfully scale themselves (slow, painful) and others will leave the company (fast, but often even more painful).</p>

<p>Many of the first contracts that you closed post-traction come up for renewal around this point (in the enterprise – SMB SaaS has less predictable growth profiles). If you’re following a <a href="https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/">triple-triple-double-double-double</a> growth path, you’ll be at roughly your second triple. There will be too many customers for the founding team to personally visit and retain everyone.</p>

<p>At this point you’ll need to renew “real” customers, not just friends who took a flyer on your infant product. These aren’t the earliest adopters who will be with you through thick and thin and are really closer to partners. These are real live paying customers who will leave if your product is screwed up. As these renewals approach, a mature post-sales motion becomes essential.</p>

<p>The expectations around your revenue also become more real at this stage. Under about $10M ARR, your revenue projections can be a mild shitshow. But the expectation that you’ll have at least some semblance of predictability steadily increases.</p>

<p>And through it all you need to continue to scale the product. Your code is no longer a series of never-ending green fields rolling off into the distance, and non-trivial parts of your product will need to be meaningfully restructured. You’re burdened by decisions made years ago, often by people who are no longer on the team.</p>

<p>This is especially true for enterprise SaaS. Enterprise products are much more unwieldy than jewel-box consumer products, as they have to support many more users and workflows. Consumer products are like Chipotle: a small, carefully curated set of menu items, built for elegance and efficiency. Enterprise products are like the Cheesecake Factory: you can get steak, pasta, a milkshake and 4 kinds of margarita in the same meal. You need to level up how your team builds products.</p>

<h2 id="cresting-the-wave">Cresting the Wave</h2>

<p>I’m writing about this phenomenon because if you haven’t seen or heard about it, there isn’t really a good way to realize that it might be coming. Even if it isn’t preventable, it’s better to know what’s on the horizon. After all, being able to see around corners is why many companies hire experienced operators.</p>

<p>I won’t claim to be an expert on how to react, but I can share a few things that I think work well and a few that don’t, and what I would do if I had to go through this phase again.</p>

<h3 id="the-crew">The Crew</h3>

<p>First, I would do my best to get the right team in place in advance. In particular, I would make sure that I had very strong functional heads for the functions that will be strained the most: Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support, and Customer Success. You don’t need every role covered, but it saves headaches to know that some parts of the team are bulletproof. This isn’t the time for unforced errors.</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/pirate-crew.jpg" alt="Pirates of the Caribbean crew">
You want a senior crew. You can tell that Sharkman here has experience and won’t freak out when the database goes down or a large account churns.</p>

<p>I also recommend hiring senior team members who can help see around corners and anticipate issues. This is a taxing time period because it’s so damn busy, and raw, well-directed horsepower tends to carry the day in those situations. More importantly, seasoned operators have typically seen challenging times before, and have the composure to handle them calmly because they know that things are always on fire.</p>

<p>It’s tempting during these busy times to make very junior hires such as new college graduates or coding bootcamp grads just to put butts in seats. These folks can be excellent hires in calmer times, but the chaos caused by too many inexperienced employees is very difficult while you’re cresting the wave.</p>

<h3 id="steering-the-ship">Steering the Ship</h3>

<p>Startups are generally fairly stressful, and that’s heightened in this time period. When operational problems strike in stressful times, it’s common to blame the people involved rather than processes – in reality, bad processes or incentives are usually the root cause.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the faster you’re growing, the more lightweight your processes should be. When you’re in rapid scaling mode your operational tempo is constantly changing, so there’s no point boiling the ocean to create a perfect process when next month so much will have changed.</p>

<p>For example: when confronting a startup rogue wave, I would not choose to reinvent a completely new system for launching new features. Instead, use 20% of the time to set up a simple, predictable process that gives you 80% of the value. Example: set up a recurring check-in meeting where upcoming releases are discussed by PMs and Tech Leads + a Slack thread where all new releases are announced when they go-live. It won’t be perfect, but you can get this up and running in 15 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="commit">Commit</h3>

<p>This is not the time to hedge your decisions or waffle on strategy.</p>

<p>For example: in general, I prefer to give people a generous window of time to grow into stretch roles. Promoting from within builds continuity, leads to a more invested team, and motivates others by demonstrating that you’re creating strong career paths. But in this phase it’s especially important that you commit to keeping or replacing leaders fast, as there’s just too much going on.</p>

<p>If you’re 30% of the way up a 100 foot wall of water and decide to adjust course, you’re going to get slammed.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-calm">Keeping Calm</h3>

<p>Whatever you do, <em>don’t freak out</em>. When it feels like shit is hitting the fan everywhere, it’s easy to want to react and search for magic solutions. Hire a new Head of X! Spend less! No wait, spend <em>more</em>! Pause development and focus on tech debt! Actually our largest customer needs more features, cancel all tech debt projects!</p>

<p>In reality, to take a line from The Sopranos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_po7So0MKq4">it won’t be cinematic</a>. Life isn’t a movie. There are no magic fixes – this challenging phase gets resolved by showing up and executing in an unflashy way for months. Magic fixes never really exist, and that’s especially true since this crucible stems from several medium-sized problems amplifying one another.</p>

<p>Searching for a unified solution to your troubles risks distraction. The road is reasonably straightforward and the challenges are tractable: there are just a lot of them. Just like an actual rogue wave, you can’t flee or dodge the factors that make crossing these rogue waves so difficult. You succeed by pointing your boat right at the problem and hitting the gas. Keeping calm doesn’t mean being stubborn or refusing to change, but it does mean that you can’t second guess your decisions – especially when it feels like you’re climbing a wall of water.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Not everyone makes it over the wave – of the roughly 10 cases that I’ve observed, roughly half had their growth stunted for at least several years after hitting this stage. In my opinion this SaaS rogue wave should be taken seriously.</p>

<p>But the good news is that once you’ve crossed the wave, you can speed up again. As you’re rising up the wall everything goes into slow motion; but once you’ve crested the top, your acceleration can increase again as you’ve set yourself up with a more stable operating model and a hardened team.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful time, as there’s so much opportunity. Your team is still in place. The market opportunity is there, and people are buying. And once you’re over the top, the water is much calmer towards the horizon.</p>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many challenging situations tend to arise simultaneously when high growth enterprise SaaS companies hit roughly $5-20 million ARR.</li>
  <li>The good news is that after this phase things get easier – the bad news is that it’s not easily avoidable.</li>
  <li>The best way to move forward is to focus on executing – and don’t be overly reactive.</li>
</ul>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’m pleased to announce the availability of the first release of <a href="https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde">SIMD
Everywhere</a> (SIMDe),
<a href="https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde/releases">version 0.5.0</a>,
representing more than three years of work by over a dozen developers.</p>

<p>SIMDe is a permissively-licensed (MIT) header-only library which
provides fast, portable implementations of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a> intrinsics for platforms
which aren’t natively supported by the API in question.</p>

<p>For example, with SIMDe you can use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE</a> on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_POWER_instruction_set_architecture">POWER</a>,
<a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, or almost any platform with a
C compiler.  That includes, of course, x86 CPUs which don’t support
the ISA extension in question (<em>e.g.</em>, calling AVX-512F functions on a
CPU which doesn’t natively support them).</p>

<p>If the target natively supports the SIMD extension in question there
is no performance penalty for using SIMDe.  Otherwise, accelerated
implementations, such as NEON on ARM, AltiVec on POWER, WASM SIMD on
WebAssembly, etc., are used when available to provide good
performance.</p>

<p>SIMDe has already been used to port several packages to additional
architectures through either upstream support or distribution
packages, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SIMDEverywhere">particularly on
Debian</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to play with SIMDe online, you can do so <a href="https://simde.netlify.app/godbolt/demo">on Compiler
Explorer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-in-050">What is in 0.5.0</h2>

<p>The 0.5.0 release is SIMDe’s first release.  It includes complete
implementations of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MMX</li>
  <li>SSE</li>
  <li>SSE2</li>
  <li>SSE3</li>
  <li>SSSE3</li>
  <li>SSE4.1</li>
  <li>AVX</li>
  <li>FMA</li>
  <li>GFNI</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have rapidly progressing implementations of many other
extensions including NEON, AVX2, SVML, and several AVX-512 extensions
(AVX-512F, AVX-512BW, AVX-512VL, etc.).</p>

<p>Additionally, we have an extensive test suite to verify our
implementations.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-coming-next">What is coming next</h2>

<p>Work on SIMDe is proceeding rapidly, but there are a lot of functions
to implement… x86 alone has about 6,000 SIMD functions, and we’ve
implemented about 2,000 of them.  We will keep adding more functions
and improving the implementations we already have.</p>

<p>Our NEON implementation is being worked on very actively right now
by Sean Maher and Christopher Moore, and is expected to continue
progressing rapidly.</p>

<p>We currently have two Google Summer of Code students working on the
project as well; <a href="https://masterchef2209.wordpress.com/2020/06/17/guide-to-intel-sse4-2-crc-intrinisics-implementation-for-simde/">Hidayat
Khan</a>
is working on finishing up AVX2, and <a href="https://medium.com/@himanshi18037">Himanshi
Mathur</a> is focused on SVML.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in using SIMDe but need some specific functions
to be implemented first, please <a href="https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde/issues/new">file an
issue</a> and we may
be able to prioritize those functions.</p>

<h2 id="getting-involved">Getting Involved</h2>

<p>If you’re interested in helping out please get in touch.  We have <a href="https://gitter.im/simd-everywhere/community">a
chat room on Gitter</a>
which is fairly active if you have questions, or of course you can
just dive right in on <a href="https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde/issues">the issue
tracker</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A new skyscraper –</strong> <strong>or two – thrusts itself up into the skies of Vauxhall-Nine Elms every year, it seems. It may be hard to imagine now, writes Andrew Rogers, but for the final third of the last millennium, the area’s skyline hardly changed at all. </strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nine-Elms-Cold-Store-Richard-Gallon.png" alt="" srcset="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nine-Elms-Cold-Store-Richard-Gallon.png 939w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nine-Elms-Cold-Store-Richard-Gallon-300x218.png 300w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nine-Elms-Cold-Store-Richard-Gallon-768x559.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px"><figcaption><em>Nine Elms Cold Store. Photograph by Richard Gallon.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For 35 years between 1964 and 1999 almost every view of Vauxhall was dominated by one building – the Nine Elms Cold Store. And it wasn’t even the tallest.</p>



<p>Even when the much taller (88m) Market Towers<span id="easy-footnote-1-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-9140" title="Since demolished in preparation for the ‘landmark’ (what – another one?) One Nine Elms development featuring residential, office, hotel and retail space."><sup>1</sup></a></span> came along in 1975, it barely succeeded in distracting the eye from the cold store. This giant, concrete, windowless, and for years redundant, monolith was very much Vauxhall’s landmark and a symbol of SW8’s almost dystopian-looking late-industrial landscape.</p>



<p>For most of its life it stood empty, or if not quite empty then abandoned by its owners. It was often emphatically not empty. According to legend it was used as a cruising ground, a performance space, a recording studio, and a temple for devil worship. Some say people died in there, and that it featured in an episode of <em>The Sweeney</em>.<span id="easy-footnote-2-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-9140" title="‘In From the Cold’. Season 3 Episode 2."><sup>2</sup></a></span> Can these things possibly be true?’ Urban myths surely.</p>



<p>But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s start almost at the beginning.</p>



<h2>1964–1979: The Chill Years</h2>



<p>The Nine Elms Cold Store stored cold things for less than half of its life. It held meat, fish, butter and cheese for 15 years then nothing for 20.</p>



<p>It opened on 30 November 1964<span id="easy-footnote-3-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-9140" title="‘£1M. Cold Store Opened’, <em>The Times.</em> Tuesday, 1 December 1964."><sup>3</sup></a></span> on land previously occupied by the <a href="https://vauxhallhistory.org/gas/">South Metropolitan Gas Works</a> which in turn had been built on the site of <a href="https://vauxhallhistory.org/candles/">Price’s Patent Candle Company</a>‘s Belmont works. The current occupant is the St George Tower and the green-glass, wing-topped St George Wharf apartments. Were these to be pitted against the derelict cold store in an ugliness competition it’s difficult to say who would win.</p>



<p>Anyway, the cold store was built, filling in Vauxhall Creek – the last vestige of the river Effra – in the process.<span id="easy-footnote-4-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-9140" title="Jon Newman (2016), <em>River Effra: South London’s Secret Spine</em>. Oxford: Signal Books."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>The opening merited a mention in <em>The Times</em> which reported that ‘Europe’s most modern cold store’ had cost its owners London Cold Storage Co (one of the Associated Fisheries Group of Companies) more than £1 million to build. With a capacity of two million cubic feet it could hold more than 16,000 tons of food<span id="easy-footnote-5-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-9140" title="<em>The Times</em>, ibid."><sup>5</sup></a></span> and goods could be loaded and unloaded there faster and more efficiently than at any other cold store in Europe.<span id="easy-footnote-6-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-9140" title="<em>Refrigeration and Air Conditioning</em>, Volume 68, Nos. 802–807."><sup>6</sup></a></span> Its purpose was to store produce for frozen-food processors and distributors.<span id="easy-footnote-7-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-9140" title="‘Quick Turn-round at New London Cold Store’, <em>Commercial Motor</em>, 11 Dec 1964."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>



<p>But why here? Why Nine Elms?</p>



<p>One reason was that the site was available. The gas works had disappeared in 1956 and the site was being used as a coach park. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://svsfilm.com/nineelms/bruns.htm" target="_blank">According to one account</a>, ‘Here a thieves’ market thrived, carefully observed and recorded by police officers watching from the top floor windows of <a href="https://vauxhallhistory.org/brunswick-house/">Brunswick House</a>.’</p>

Photograph by Martin Picton.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The location had excellent transport connections – river, road, and rail. Two barges could be unloaded simultaneously at the Cold Store’s 90ft Thames jetty<span id="easy-footnote-8-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-9140" title="<em>Refrigeration and Air Conditioning</em>, Vol. 68, Nos. 802–807."><sup>8</sup></a></span> and eight lorries at a time could use the four covered loading bays, according to a report in <em>Commercial Motor</em>.<span id="easy-footnote-9-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-9140" title="‘Quick Turn-round at New London Cold Store’, <em>Commercial Motor</em>, 11 Dec 1964."><sup>9</sup></a></span> ‘Hydraulic dock levellers are used at the lorry bays and electric pallet trucks and other mechanical aids are widely used,’ swooned the periodical in its report on the opening of the cold store.</p>



<p>In 1965 most of Nine Elms (including the site of the New Covent Garden Market and the since-shunted flower market) was occupied by railway yards. Today, the area’s railway history is all but forgotten but for 10 years from 1838 the area boasted its very own and quite grand railway terminus which was the end of the line for trains coming in from Woking and later Southampton. <a href="https://vauxhallhistory.org/nine-elms-station/">Nine Elms Station</a> stood at the end of Nine Elms Lane (then just called Nine Elms) which at that time emerged onto the Wandsworth Road roughly opposite the end of Miles Street (not Parry Street, as now). In 1848 the line was diverted before it reached the station to the new terminus at Waterloo via a new station at Vauxhall. The now-sidelined (literally) Nine Elms area became a massive railway yard and for over 120 years served variously as a carriage and wagon works, a goods depot and a locomotive depot.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/map-of-vauxhall.png" alt="" srcset="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/map-of-vauxhall.png 418w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/map-of-vauxhall-296x300.png 296w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/map-of-vauxhall-75x75.png 75w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px"></figure><p>When it was built in 1965 the Cold Store was served by lines which reached it by crossing Nine Elms Lane, as this map from around 1967 shows.</p></div>



<p>At this point, Nine Elms Lane still met the Wandsworth Road just north of Miles Street. It was presumably rerouted to its current position (opposite Parry Street) in the early 1970s when New Covent Garden flower market was built.</p>



<p>Sadly the Cold Store’s triple-transport-threat status was short-lived – the railway yard closed just two years later, in 1967.</p>



<h2>1979–1999: The Wilderness Years</h2>



<p>In 1979, 15 years after it opened, the Nine Elms Cold Store closed. Why?</p>



<p>Advances in refrigeration, the increase in air transportation, the demise of river-based haulage seem likely factors. And Associated Fisheries’ cold storage business had been badly affected by the UK’s 1973–75 recession.<span id="easy-footnote-10-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-9140" title="‘Associated Fisheries declines’, <em>The Times</em>, 9 July 1981."><sup>10</sup></a></span> But the value of the site must have played a significant role. In fact, the Chairman of Associated Fisheries suggested so much as far back as 1973 when the Cold Store had been open for less than a decade:</p>



<blockquote><p>Giving news to shareholders of Associated Fisheries […] Mr P. M. Tapscott, chairman refers to the proposed development of the Thames frontage on the south side of Vauxhall Bridge and the fact that AF’s Nine Elms cold store, a site of 1.6 acres, adjoins this development. Possibilities of re-development are, therefore, being closely examined.<span id="easy-footnote-11-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-9140" title="‘Chairmen&amp;#8217;s Reports’, <em>The Times</em>, 28 Nov 1973."><sup>11</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>



<p>London Cold Storage divested itself of the site pretty quickly after the Cold Store closed. In November 1980, <em>The Times</em> reported that contracts had been exchanged on the sale of the cold store and other property for £1.67 million cash with completion due on February 5.<span id="easy-footnote-12-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-12-9140" title="&amp;#8216;Associated Fisheries’, <em>The Times</em>, 21 Nov 1980."><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Which is when things begin to get really interesting at the Nine Elms Cold Store.</p>



<h2>Development Hell</h2>



<p>Why did it take 20 years for the Cold Store to be demolished? There’s probably a whole book to be written about it if there’s an audience for property development horror porn. Suffice to say that in the early days it involved Ronald Lyon, who could be described as a colourful property developer with an interesting business past.</p>



<p>Lyon got his hands on the Cold Store after the first proposal for the Effra site (which included land on both sides of the bridgefoot) fell apart.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/green-giant.png" alt="architect's image of never built green giant at nine elms" srcset="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/green-giant.png 443w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/green-giant-300x296.png 300w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/green-giant-75x75.png 75w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px"></figure><p><a href="http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=4248">The extraordinary 150m ‘Green Giant’ project</a> designed by architects Abbott Howard would have included 100 luxury apartments, 30,000 square metres of office space earmarked for Esso, and a gallery to hold the Tate’s sculpture collection.</p></div>



<p>Then along came Lyon, whose Arunbridge company was granted a controversial Special Development Order from the then Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine. This SDO would essentially allow Arunbridge’s office scheme to run roughshod over normal planning procedures. Despite this unfair advantage, Lyon failed to find the funding and the scheme collapsed. The Swiss Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co was holding the site as security against a loan and they sold it to Samuel Properties<span id="easy-footnote-13-9140"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-13-9140" title="‘Samuel Properties plans 1,000 flats on Green Giant site’, <em>The Times</em>, 8 May 1985."><sup>13</sup></a></span> who in turn sold it to a Middle Eastern consortium, who then… well, you get the picture. One of the ongoing barriers to development seems to have been the Borough of Lambeth’s objection to swanky residential schemes of the kind it now welcomes with open arms.</p>



<p>Quite how it took two decades to knock the Cold Store down isn’t clear but one factor seems to have been the cost of demolition. One person involved in a government scheme to build a new Home Office on the Effra site recalls that the Cold Store was to be addressed late in the scheme due to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://svsfilm.com/nineelms/bruns13.jpg" target="_blank">the cost of demolishing it</a>.</p>



<p>After a long, lingering decline, the Nine Elms Cold Store was finally put out of its misery in (I think) 1999. Thankfully Jonathan Bell was around to record the event for posterity.</p>



<figure><img src="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demolition-of-the-cold-store-vauxhall-nine-elms.png" alt="" srcset="https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demolition-of-the-cold-store-vauxhall-nine-elms.png 939w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demolition-of-the-cold-store-vauxhall-nine-elms-300x220.png 300w, https://vauxhallhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/demolition-of-the-cold-store-vauxhall-nine-elms-768x564.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px"><figcaption><em>The demolition of the Cold Store, photographed by Jonathan Bell.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But until then, the Cold Store could hardly be described as empty…</p>



<h2>Screen Appearances</h2>



<p>London film makers in search of ‘bleak industrial landscape bordering on dystopian’ needed to look no further than Nine Elms – even before it was abandoned. Less hackneyed, less iconic, and more alien than Battersea Power Station, the Cold Store made fleeting background appearances in films such as <em>Villain</em> (1971), a crime film starring Richard Burton, and <em>The Optimists of Nine Elms</em> (1973) with Peter Sellers. But the most thrilling use of it must surely be the 1976 episode of cop series <em>The Sweeney</em> called ‘In From the Cold’, which featured this exchange on the very roof of the Cold Store.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Cruising to Casualty</h2>



<p>After the closure of the Cold Store in 1979 its most frequent visitors were gay men, who adopted it as a night-time cruising ground, handy for rounding off a night out at the nearby Royal Vauxhall Tavern or the Market Tavern which was housed in the Market Towers high-rise. The Cold Store was a bedroom and playroom to many liaisons over the years but was notorious for providing pleasure and danger in almost equal measure – sometimes with fatal consequences.</p>



<p>One visitor who narrowly escaped death but lived to tell the tale is John (not his real name):</p>



<p>“The Nine Elms Cold Store was where you went after a night at the Market Tavern if you didn’t get lucky. You crossed Nine Elms Lane via the footbridge (pedestrians were made to navigate all the Vauxhall Cross main roads that way back then) to a gate just to the left of the wall which still shelters Brunswick House from Nine Elms Lane today. The steel gate was 10 feet high, padlocked, and there was barbed wire across the top, but a gap had been forced open at one side through which you could squeeze to get in to the grounds of the cold store. There was no such thing as site security in those days.</p>

<p><br>
With <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/async/">version 3.1</a>, you can finally use asynchronous views, middlewares and tests in Django. Support for async database queries will follow later. You don’t have to change anything if you don’t want to use those new async features . All of your existing synchronous code will run without modification in Django 3.1.</p>

<p>Async support for Django is on it’s way for quite some time now. Since <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/releases/3.0/#asgi-support">version 3.0</a> there’s support for <a href="https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">ASGI</a> included. But there was not much benefit for end users though. The only thing you could do concurrently were file uploads, since uploads don’t reach the view layer which was not async capable in Django 3.0.</p>

<p>When do you might want to use those new features? If you are building applications that have to deal with a high number of tasks simultaneously. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Chat services like <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a></li>
	<li>Gateway APIs / Proxy Services</li>
	<li>Games, especially MMOs like <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a></li>
	<li>Applications using <a href="https://youtu.be/MZvmYaFkNJI">Phoenix Liveview</a> - check out <a href="https://phoenixphrenzy.com/results">Phoenix Phrenzy results</a> for additional examples</li>
	<li>A reactive version of <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/admin/">Django Admin</a> where model changes are shown interactively</li>
	<li>A new api frontend for <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST framework</a> updating list endpoints interactively as new data comes in</li>
	<li>All kinds of dashboard applications showing currently active connections, requests per second updating in realtime</li>
</ul>

<p>As Tom Christie explained in his talk <a href="https://youtu.be/u8GSFEg5lnU">Sketching out a Django redesign</a> held at DjangoCon 2019 the core question is this: Do we want to have to switch languages to support those use cases? And while his <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a> project (gaining popularity recently in combination with the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI framework</a>) is allowing us to do all this in Python, we also might want to keep using Django.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-expect-from-this-article">What to Expect from this Article?</h2>

<ol type="1">
	<li>A small example on how to use async views, middlewares and tests</li>
	<li>Why is async such a big deal anyway?</li>
	<li>The gory details of multithreading vs async, GIL and other oddities</li>
</ol>

<p>Estimated read time: 25 minutes<br>
There's also a&nbsp;<a href="https://python-podcast.de/show/async-teil-1/">podcast episode</a>&nbsp;elaborating a little bit more on this&nbsp;topic (it's in german).</p>




<p>For this example you need a working installation of <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Any version from 3.6 onwards will do, but I recommend using the latest 3.8 series, because async is relatively new to Python and new versions still bring major improvements in usability and stability.</p>

<h2 id="create-virtualenv-and-setup-project">Create Virtualenv and Setup Project</h2>

<p>Usually I prefer setting up new projects with <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/">Poetry</a> nowadays, but I understand that requiring people to curl install software makes them feel uncomfortable. And for this example it doesn’t make a big difference anyway. Therefore I’ll use the builtin virtualenv module.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir mysite &amp;&amp; cd mysite
python -m venv mysite_venv &amp;&amp; source mysite_venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install django==3.1 httpx  # install Django 3.1 + async capable http client</code></pre>

<h2 id="initialize-django">Initialize Django</h2>

<pre><code>django-admin startproject mysite .  # create django project in current directory
python manage.py migrate            # migrate sqlite
python manage.py runserver          # should start the development server now</code></pre>

<p>You should now be able to point your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">localhost</a> and see the new Django project sample page. If this doesn’t work, make sure you didn’t set the $DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable. This is what happens to me all the time.</p>

<h2 id="create-some-views">Create some Views</h2>

<p>First we create a synchronous view returning a simple JsonResponse, just like we would have done it in previous Django versions. It takes an optional parameter <code>task_id</code> which we’ll later use to identify the url which was called from the second view. It also sleeps for a second emulating a response that takes some time to be build.</p>

<p>Edit <code>mysite/views.py</code> to look like this:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>import</span> <span>time</span>

<span>from</span> <span>django.http</span> <span>import</span> <span>JsonResponse</span>


<span>def</span> <span>api</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>):</span>
    <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>payload</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>"message"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Hello World!"</span><span>}</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>"task_id"</span> <span>in</span> <span>request</span><span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>:</span>
        <span>payload</span><span>[</span><span>"task_id"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>request</span><span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>[</span><span>"task_id"</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>JsonResponse</span><span>(</span><span>payload</span><span>)</span>
</pre>

<p>And then <code>mysite/urls.py</code> to look like this:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>from</span> <span>django.urls</span> <span>import</span> <span>path</span>

<span>from</span> <span>.</span> <span>import</span> <span>views</span>

<span>urlpatterns</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>path</span><span>(</span><span>"api/"</span><span>,</span> <span>views</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>),</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Now you should be able to see the response of little <a href="http://localhost:8000/api/">api view</a> in your browser. I recommend <a href="https://firefox.org/">Firefox</a> to look at json responses because they look a little bit nicer there, but any browser will do. This is not at all different from a normal synchronous api view in Django before 3.1.</p>

<h3 id="async-aggregation-view">Async Aggregation View</h3>

<p>Ok, let’s add an asynchronous view then. We are creating a view that builds ten different urls pointing to our original sync view and aggregate their results in a new response.</p>
</div>

<p>Add this code to <code>mysite/views.py</code> and move the imports to the top of the file:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>import</span> <span>httpx</span>
<span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>


<span>def</span> <span>get_api_urls</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>=</span><span>10</span><span>):</span>
    <span>base_url</span> <span>=</span> <span>"http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/"</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>base_url</span><span>}</span><span>?task_id=</span><span>{</span><span>task_id</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>for</span> <span>task_id</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)]</span>


<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>api_aggregated</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>):</span>

<p>Add a route to our new view to <code>mysite/urls.py</code>:</p>

<span>]</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>If you now point your browser to the url of your <a href="http://localhost:8000/api/aggregated/">aggregated view</a>, you should be able to see your first result from an asynchronous function. A normal sync view calling <code>httpx.get(url)</code> in a for loop would have taken at least ten seconds to complete, because every api view sleeps for one second and they would have been called one after another summing up their latencies. But our async view took only about one second to complete, so we must have called our sync views concurrently by using <code>async def</code>, <code>async with</code> and the magic of <code>asyncio.gather</code>. Great.</p>

<h3 id="compare-with-sync-view">Compare with Sync View</h3>

<p>We can check our hypothesis that the responses were collected concurrently by adding a plain sync aggregation view to <code>mysite/views.py</code>:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>def</span> <span>api_aggregated_sync</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>):</span>
    <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>perf_counter</span><span>()</span>

        <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>httpx</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
        <span>responses</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>())</span>
    <span>elapsed</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>perf_counter</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>s</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"message"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Hello Sync World!"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"aggregated_responses"</span><span>:</span> <span>responses</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"debug_message"</span><span>:</span> <span>f</span><span>"fetch executed in </span><span>{</span><span>elapsed</span><span>:</span><span>0.2f</span><span>}</span><span> seconds."</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>JsonResponse</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>And also add a route to the sync aggregated view to <code>mysite/urls.py</code>:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>urlpatterns</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>path</span><span>(</span><span>"api/"</span><span>,</span> <span>views</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>),</span>
    <span>path</span><span>(</span><span>"api/aggregated/"</span><span>,</span> <span>views</span><span>.</span><span>api_aggregated</span><span>),</span>
    <span>path</span><span>(</span><span>"api/aggregated/sync/"</span><span>,</span> <span>views</span><span>.</span><span>api_aggregated_sync</span><span>),</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>As expected, this <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/aggregated/sync/">sync aggregation view</a> takes now at least ten seconds to finish. Fine.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-it-work">Why Did it Work?</h3>

<p>But how did our async aggregation view work? Note that we just used the normal builtin development server Django provides. Shouldn’t we have to use some kind of <a href="https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">ASGI</a> server?</p>

<p>Since we annotated our async view function with <code>async def</code> Django is able to detect that we want to write an async view and runs our view in a thread within its own <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html">event loop</a>. That’s very convenient, because we could now write async views inside the normal <a href="https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what.html">WSGI</a> Django applications we already use and they’ll just work. We even gain the benefit of being able to do things concurrently inside async views like fetching results from other api endpoints and aggregating them in a new response.</p>

<p>What we won’t get by running async views in a WSGI application is concurrency when calling the view from the outside. Since each async view runs in it’s own thread, we’ll still have as many threads as concurrent requests on any given time.</p>

<h3 id="asgi-example">ASGI Example</h3>

<p>To try out an async example that’s concurrently callable from the outside, let’s install an ASGI server like <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/">uvicorn</a> then and change the runserver command so that we are now running Django as an ASGI rather than a WSGI application:</p>

<pre><code>python -m pip install uvicorn
uvicorn --reload mysite.asgi:application</code></pre>

<p>Our first <a href="http://localhost:8000/api/">sync api view</a> still works as it should. But if we try to open the <a href="http://localhost:8000/api/aggregated/">async aggregated view</a> view, we get a timeout error. What is happening here? When the aggregated api view is called, it makes subsequent get requests to ten sync api views. But uvicorn is a single threaded server. The <code>httpx.get</code> tasks are dispatched to run asynchronously on the event loop. But calls to <code>time.sleep</code> inside the sync api views are still blocking the main thread, piling up to at least ten seconds latency. Since httpx has a default timeout of five seconds, the fifth <code>httpx.get</code> call probably raises an ReadTimeout exception in our async aggregation view causing the whole view to fail.</p>

<p>In our previous <code>python manage.py runserver</code> example the <code>time.sleep</code> calls are also blocking the threads they are running in. Since the development server is running each request in it’s own thread, because it’s a multithreaded server, the latencies didn’t add up but are blocking different threads concurrently. Therefore the <code>httpx.get</code> calls only have to wait for about one second each.</p>

<p>If the backend you are sending requests to doesn’t support answering those requests concurrently, you still have to wait. We can resolve this by allowing uvicorn to start more worker processes. But this would not guarantee that each new request gets to run on a fresh worker. Maybe it’s dispatched to a worker which is already blocked by another request. So even if you have ten workers, your aggregated response time will probably be larger than one second.</p>

<pre><code>uvicorn --workers 10 mysite.asgi:application</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>--workers</code> option wont work under windows.</p>

<p>But uvicorn is a async capable server, why don’t we take advantage of this by turning our sync api view into an async api view? You also have to move the <code>import asyncio</code> line to the top of the file, if you haven’t done this …</p></section></div>

        <section>
          <h2>AM010</h2>

<p>It was late at night when I realized it was about to happen again.</p>
<p>The existing publishing tools I had at hand weren't particularly good to
showcase what I had in mind, but they were convenient enough that I could just
write and leave the problem of actually reading them to whoever happened to
land on that blog.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just a blog. Starting out with 8 patrons, the traffic it got was
mostly friends. They could bear with it.</p>
<p>But the unfortunate reality is that I can't quite stand watching something
being done poorly. It just broils in my gut the feeling that <em>we can do
better</em>. Editing could be simpler. Publishing could be faster. Thinking could
be easier.</p>
<p>I will try to best it, even if the end result ends up being worse, and while
I'll be the first to admit that perhaps it isn't the most attractive of
qualities, it always teaches me something new. Every now and then I do
manage to do it better. The world around me is a little better for it.</p>
<p>This time I had to sit down and write something. I didn't quite know what yet,
but I knew that how I had been writing was getting in the way of what I wanted
to write. So I took a step back and asked around how are the <em>cool kids</em> doing
it this days.</p>
<p>Many seem to like tools like <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a>, or
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. They all provide some sort of structure or template you fit your
content into, a couple of ways to do theming and navigation, and the
possibility to run the whole shebang as a static or dynamically generated
service.</p>
<p>I just needed some static files, and I needed them in the structure they were
already in, so from the choices I was offered it looked like the winner was in
fact Next.js. It came with a few interesting features that I dismissed as
<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?BellsWhistlesAndGongs">whistles &amp; bells</a>, and frowned at the requirement that
my pages would have to be translated into React components.</p>
<p>Surely a tool with such an emphasis on the "Developer Experience" would
consider the many formats my data could be in, and accommodate for it. But I
nonetheless decided to translate an essay into some Javascript code, and I
finally felt like I could start writing.</p>
<p>Until I had to embed some code.</p>
<p>Suddenly I was somehow recommended to go down the rabbit of hole of finding
good Javascript component libraries that would do the highlighting for me, that
worked with Next, from withing my own writing, which was now no longer just
text but in fact <em>a computer program posing as an essay</em>.</p>
<p>A quick look under the hood showed me there were over 100,000 lines of
Javascript code to turn my untranscendental words into a god damned website.</p>
<p><em>I sighed</em>.</p>
<p>There is a tolerable amount of complexity involved in doing our every day work.
I use <code>vim</code> and, on my computer, it runs on the Linux kernel. I tolerate the
many millions of lines of code from there down to the hardware it runs.
<strong>Tolerance</strong> here is the key word. They afford me things. Not physical things
like food, but the affordance that your thinking gains when you discover a new
idea.</p>
<p>When I first learned about <code>git</code> I suddenly had a new tool to think. I wasn't
familiar with branching models of Subversion or other versioning tools, but
<code>git</code>'s branches, merges, and code history extended my thinking. I have a vague
understanding of the internals of <code>git</code>, but I <strong>tolerate</strong> this complexity
because of what it affords me.</p>
<p>What was this tool really affording me with this complexity? I already had to
pay the cost of translating my content into the format it wanted of me, what
else is there? Hot reloading of assets. Great. My assets are stylesheet files,
the occasional image, and one or two embedded scripts. I can already refresh
a browser with a keypress. What else is there?</p>
<p>From the looks of it, this tools just doesn't support my use-case very well.
How can something so enormously popular and complicated as Next.js not support
my so seemingly simple use-case? I had to be wrong. Where is all this
complexity heading that I can't leverage it without bringing in even more of
it?</p>
<p>Some complexity exists because the underlying problem is in fact complex. It
needs to be dealt with and it cannot be reduced any further. We tend to call
this <a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf"><em>Essential Complexity</em></a>. Did all the complexity
in Next exist only to justify <strong>making me feel productive</strong>?</p>
<p>I started wondering what really was so essentially complex about what I needed
to do, but it didn't take long to put a list of the things that seemed the most
independent from each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd like my Markdown files to be compiled into their corresponding HTML
files, respecting their existing structure</li>
<li>I'd like them to be optionally templated, to share some framing information</li>
<li>I'd like to only do work that needs to be done</li>
<li>I'd like my files to be served in a browser fast, and</li>
<li>I'd like my files to be updated automatically in the browser</li>
</ul>
<p>There were them. 5 requirements that this problem could be broken into.  It
shouldn't take more than a couple of days to explore each one of them in enough
depth to understand whether I was looking at massive Essential Complexity, or
not.</p>
<p>I decided to build this tool.</p>
<h4>1. Compiling Markdown to HTML</h4>
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/introducing_markdown">Markdown</a> was introduced as a more humane way to write HTML. It has
evolved from a rather moving target of inconsistent syntaxes into a series of
standards, some describing a fairly complex format with plenty of features.</p>
<p>To build a Markdown to HTML compiler I'd have to be clear about <em>which</em>
Markdown format I'd be supporting. Since my content was currently written
mostly following <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm">Github Flavored Markdown</a>, that
seemed like the Markdown to target.</p>
<p>Every compiler has a series of stages that take the initial source code, or a
similar specification of a program, and turns into another language. Some
compilers turn this source code into machine language, some others just turn it
into another high-level language.</p>
<p>Whichever your target is, chances are the compiler will read some binary
strings (sometimes this is just UTF-8 text, sometimes its actual binary encoded
data), and transform them into something that it can operate on. Then it
proceeds to transform these data structures into something that more closely
resembles the desired output, maybe making some checks along the way.</p>
<p>In my case, I designed it to have 3 stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsing of Markdown text — a parsing phase would require a Markdown
parser that would deal with the quirks of GFM, and the CommonMark spec it
builds on.</li>
<li>Transformation between Markdown structures and an HTML tree — this
would take data structures like <code>Paragraph { content: String }</code> or <code>List { elements: Vec&lt;ListElement&gt; }</code> and turn them into the appropriate HTML tree.</li>
<li>Writing out the HTML tree — which would take an <code>DomNode { tag: DomTag, attributes: Vec&lt;DomAttribute&gt;, children: Vec&lt;DomNode&gt; }</code> and turn it into a
String that can be written into a file.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can imagine some scaffolded code for this to look like:</p>
<pre><code>enum MarkdownNode {
  Heading1(Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt;), // corresponding to a #
  Heading2(Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt;), // corresponding to a ##
  Blockquote(Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt;), // corresponding to series of &gt;
  // ...
}

struct MarkdownDoc { nodes: Vec&lt;MarkdownNode&gt; }

enum HtmlTag { P, H1, /* ... */ }
struct HtmlAttribute { key: String, value: String }
enum HtmlNode {
  Tagged { 
    tag: HtmlTag,
    attributes: Option&lt;Vec&lt;HtmlAttribute&gt;&gt;,
    children: Option&lt;Vec&lt;HtmlNode&gt;&gt;
  },
  Literal {
    child: String
  }
}

fn string_to_markdown(input: String) -&gt; Result&lt;MarkdownNode, Error&gt; {}

fn markdown_to_html(md: MarkdownDoc) -&gt; Result&lt;HtmlNode, Error&gt; {}

fn html_to_string(html: HtmlNode) -&gt; String {}
</code></pre>
<p>It took me about an hour of reading the specification to realize that
implementing a parser for the entire syntax would easily take me over a week,
and I don't have that kind of time. It would likely be a very error prone
process as well.</p>
<p>A very fun thing to work on, for sure, but after understanding this specific
problem better, I can <em>tolerate</em> the complexity of bringing in a 3rd party
Markdown compiler into the table.</p>
<h4>2. Templating</h4>
<p>Templating can take many shapes and forms. From full blown programming language
support in the style of <a href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb">ERB (Embedded RuBy)</a>, to string
matching and replacing in more mundane forms.</p>
<p>Considering I do not need to perform any specific logic, my templating needs
are closer to a string-matching followed by some splitting and joining.</p>
<p>I have a <code>template.html</code> file that somewhere in the middle has a keyword that I
want replaced with the actual content of the essay I'm writing.</p>
<p>In pseudocode, this should be enough to achieve my goal:</p>
<pre><code>do_template(template, content) do
  [before, after] = template.split_at_word("$$document")
  return [before, content, after]
end
</code></pre>
<p>How exactly we are finding the word to be replaced by the content is less
important, but from the vast bibliography out there I keep a copy of <a href="https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/FPMbook">Flexible
Pattern Matching in Strings</a> that is a good resource to
implement some of these algorithms.</p>
<p>Once you know where to split the template to inject your content, the rest is
just string concatenation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, modern programming languages excel at providing us with string
manipulation tools, so putting it together took almost as much code as the
pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>// assume content and template are strings already
let compiled = template.replace("$$document", content);
</code></pre>
<p>For my use-case, the complexity of having an entire incrementally-rendering
component framework like React, to reuse components across pages that would
achieve the same effect, is simply <strong>not tolerable</strong>.</p>
<h4>3. Only doing work that needs to be done</h4>
<p>A lot of the tools we work with do the same thing over and over again.
Sometimes that is okay. Sometimes that is mandatory.</p>
<p>For my use-case, because I'd like to keep the output of the compilation
versioned, the compilation process should only redo the work that needs to be
done.</p>
<p>This has the side-benefit that recompiling these documents should be relatively
fast, since I tend to work on a single document at a time. Occasionally a
change in a template file would trigger only the recompilation of the documents
using it, …</p></section></section></div>

It’s from a university hospital in Nantes. Incidentally, he was the person who <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://covexit.com/shock-testimony-of-professor-raoult-at-french-national-assembly/" target="_blank">received the</a> most money from Gilead, a large pharmaceutical company, in the past 6 years.</p> <p>Here I propose to put together, piece by piece, the puzzle of what I consider the biggest farce in modern history. I don’t worry about producing a short text. It will have analyzes, including new ones, and from different points of view.</p> <p>It involves science, healing, politics, geopolitics, mass and group psychology. With the scenario set, it is not difficult to predict good and bad things that will happen in the coming months and years.</p> <p>Throughout the text, the reader will understand the most important thing: the circumstance of how this false narrative was put together. The reader will also be prompted, by itself, to conclude whether the treatment proposed by Didier Raout works or not.</p> <p>And you will also understand how the majority of the North American scientific class, from Latin America and Europe, regions of the globe under strong influence from the USA, were directed to an incredibly gross error.</p> <p>In addition to the facts and figures, which are accompanied by external links, all I write are my own opinions, based on the facts, in first person, from my point of view, of how I see the world going completely insane in front of me.</p> <p>I am not afraid to sign my name when publishing it, even though I know that the almost unanimity of Brazilian scientists are against the application of these drugs and repeat that “there is no scientific evidence” of the functioning.</p> <p>And one thing I’m sure will attract attention. The fact that I have to give examples with incredibly basic logic, as if I were talking to children, to explain the facts. It is necessary. The farce has gone so far that I need many examples and analogies to bring reason back.</p> <p>Signed, I make it available to cover me, today or in the future, if my analyzes prove to be incorrect, after all, it is not a simple or light claim.</p> <h2>In February there is carnival</h2> <figure><img src="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA.jpeg" alt="china and europe" srcset="https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA.jpeg 1000w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://truthabouthcq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_SW5PoDNYiufb9qKtgEEqBA-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure> <p>From China and Europe came reports of large numbers of dead people and entire cities blocked, with people in confinement, preventing the transmission of the coronavirus.</p> <p>On the top street of my house, in Atibaia, in the interior of São Paulo, 60 km from the state capital, the carnival took place.</p> <p>For four days, loud music came through my window.

It was an open bar, something normal in our tropical climate, where half the people are on the street and the other half inside the establishment.</p> <p>It was the farewell of a musician friend. Samba and jazz were in the repertoire. He was already hired to go to Australia, where he would board a tourist ship. It would be one of the attractions. He was excited. I didn’t want to discourage him, but it was strange that the company was still confident, until that day, that new trips would come out, even with the Diamond Princess <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemia_de_COVID-19_no_navio_Diamond_Princess" target="_blank">case</a>, off the coast of Japan.</p> <p>I no longer held hands to greet anyone. I ran away from close contacts, always stayed outside, and washed my hands constantly. They laughed and found it strange. Some called me paranoid.</p> <p>I soon made a bad prediction: that all bars would be empty and closed in a short space of time. I decided not to leave anymore. I didn’t want to be bothered by crowds. I didn’t want to be a joke either. Our state and municipal governments had not yet taken action against the virus.</p> <p>At home, it remained to read, to follow the news and scientific publications that began to appear frequently. I have a habit, healthy or not, of going deeper into research, and reading studies, when I’m interested in a subject. I don’t like to just wait and see, one or the other news, superficially, in the mass media.</p> <p>The craze for going to medical research sites to read papers came from a few years earlier. In 2016 I broke a bone in an accident. Practically three months lying, with little mobility, without drinking, and with an IPAD in my hand, I read all the studies on my recovery, to the point that, in a chat, shortly afterwards, with an orthopedist professor at an important medical school, he says he has never seen a patient know so much about his problem. “This one studied more than my students”, he joked with a friend.</p> <h2>Piece 1: the hydroxychloroquine solution appears</h2> <p>March 17, 2020</p> <p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hydroxychloroquine_final_DOI_IJAA.pdf" target="_blank">The study ran the internet.</a> He had this impressive chart.

            <section>

  <p>Last year, I <a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2019/11/woodville-renderman-challenge.html">participated in one of Pixar’s RenderMan Art Challenges</a> as a way to learn more about RenderMan <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3182162">(Christensen et al. 2018)</a> and as a way to get some exposure to tools outside of my normal day-to-day toolset (Disney’s Hyperion Renderer professionally, Takua Render as a hobby and learning exercise).
I had a lot of fun, and wound up doing better in the “Woodville” art challenge contest than I expected to!
Recently, I entered another one of <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com/news/renderman-shipshape-art-challenge">Pixar’s RenderMan Art Challenges, “Shipshape”</a>.
This time around I entered just for fun; since I had so much fun last time, I figured why not give it another shot!
That being said though, I want to repeat the main point I made in my post about the previous “Woodville” art challenge: I believe that for rendering engineers, there is enormous value in learning to use tools and renderers that aren’t the ones we work on ourselves.
Our field is filled with brilliant people on every major rendering team, and I find both a lot of useful information/ideas and a lot of joy in seeing the work that friends and peers across the field have put into commercial renderers such as RenderMan, Arnold, Vray, Corona, and others.</p>

  <p>As usual for the RenderMan Art Challenges, Pixar <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com/shipshape-pup-asset">supplied some base models</a> without any uvs, texturing, shading, lighting or anything else, and challenge participants had to start with the base models and come up with a single compelling image for a final entry.
I had a lot of fun spending evenings and weekends throughout the duration of the contest to create my final image, which is below.
I got to explore and learn a lot of new things that I haven’t tried before, which this post will go through.
To my enormous surprise, this time around my entry <a href="https://renderman.pixar.com/news/renderman-shipshape-art-challenge-final-results">won first place in the contest</a>!</p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/shipshape_full_4k.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/preview/shipshape_full.jpg" alt="Figure 1: My entry to Pixar's RenderMan Shipshape Art Challenge, titled &quot;Oh Good, The Bus is Here&quot;. Click for 4K version. Base ship, robot, and sextant models are from Pixar; all shading, lighting, additional modeling, and environments are mine. Ship concept by Ian McQue. Robot concept by Ruslan Safarov. Models by Cheyenne Chapel, Aliya Chen, Damian Kwiatkowski, Alyssa Minko, Anthony Muscarella, and Miguel Zozaya © Disney / Pixar - RenderMan &quot;Shipshape&quot; Art Challenge."></a></p>

  <p><strong>Initial Explorations</strong></p>

  <p>For this competition, Pixar provided five models: a futuristic scifi ship based on an Ian McQue concept, a robot based on a Ruslan Safarov concept, an old wooden boat, a butterfly, and a sextant.
The fact that one of the models was based on an Ian McQue concept was enough to draw me in; I’ve been a big fan of Ian McQue’s work for many years now!
I like to start these challenges by just rendering the provided assets as-is from a number of different angles, to try to get a sense of what I like about the assets and how I will want to showcase them in my final piece.
I settled pretty quickly on wanting to focus on the scifi ship and the robot, and leave the other three models aside.
I did find an opportunity to bring in the sextant in my final piece as well, but wound up dropping the old wooden boat and the butterfly altogether.
Here are some simple renders showing what was provided out of the box for the scifi ship and the robot:</p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/robot_base.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/robot_base.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Robot base model provided by Pixar, rendered against a white cyclorama background using a basic skydome."></a></p>

  <p>I initially had a lot of trouble settling on a concept and idea for this project; I actually started blocking out an entirely different idea before pivoting to the idea that eventually became my final image.
My initial concept included the old wooden boat in addition the scifi ship and the robot; this initial concept was called “River Explorer”.
My initial instinct was to try to show the scifi ship from a top-down view, in order to get a better view of the deck-boards and the big VG engine and the crane arm.
I liked the idea of putting the camera at roughly forest canopy height, since forest canopy height is a bit of an unusual perspective for most photographs due to canopy height being this weird height that is too high off the ground for people to shoot from, but too low for helicopters or drones to be practical either.
My initial idea was about a robot-piloted flying patrol boat exploring an old forgotten river in a forest; the ship would be approaching the old sunken boat in the river water.
With this first concept, I got as far as initial compositional blocking and initial time-of-day lighting tests:</p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_012.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/preview/progress_012.jpg" alt="Figure 4: Initial &quot;River Explorer&quot; concept, daylight lighting test."></a></p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_013.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/preview/progress_013.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Initial &quot;River Explorer&quot; concept, dusk lighting test."></a></p>

  <p>If you’ve followed my blog for a while now, those pine trees might look familiar.
They’re actually the same trees from <a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2018/10/bidirectional-mipmap.html">the forest scene I used a while back</a>, ported from Takua’s shading system to RenderMan’s PxrSurface shader.</p>

  <p>I wasn’t ever super happy with the “River Explorer” concept; I think the overall layout was okay, but it lacked a sense of dynamism and overall just felt very static to me, and the robot on the flying scifi ship felt kind of lost in the overall composition.
Several other contestants wound up also going for similar top-down-ish views, which made me worry about getting lost in a crowd of similar-looking images.
After a week of trying to get the “River Explorer” concept to work better, I started to play with some completely different ideas; I figured that this early in the process, a better idea was worth more than a week’s worth of sunk time.</p>

  <p><strong>Layout and Framing</strong></p>

  <p>I had started UV unwrapping the ship already, and whilst tumbling around the ship unwrapping all of the components one-by-one, I got to see a lot more of the ship and a lot more interesting angles, and I suddenly came up with a completely different idea for my entry.
The idea that popped into my head was to have a bunch of the little robots waiting to board one of the flying ships at a quay or something of the sort.
I wanted to convey a sense of scale between the robots and the flying scifi ship, so I tried putting the camera far away and zooming in using a really long lens.
Since long lenses have the effect of flattening perspective a bit, using a long lens helped make the ships feel huge compared to the robots.
At this point I was just doing very rough, quick, AO render “sketches”.
This is the AO sketch where my eventual final idea started:</p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_015.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_015.jpg" alt="Figure 6: Rough AO render &quot;sketch&quot; that eventually evolved into my final idea."></a></p>

  <p>I’ve always loved the idea of the mundane fantastical; the flying scifi ship model is fairly fantastical, which led me to want to do something more everyday with them.
I thought it would be fun to texture the scifi ship model as if it was just part of a regular metro system that the robots use to get around their world.
My wife, Harmony, suggested a fun idea: set the entire scene in drizzly weather and give two of the robots umbrellas, but give the third robot a briefcase instead and have the robot use the briefcase as a makeshift umbrella, as if it had forgotten its umbrella at home.
The umbrella-less robot’s reaction to seeing the ship arriving provided the title for my entry- “Oh Good, The Bus Is Here”.
Harmony also pointed out that the back of the ship has a lot more interesting geometric detail compared to the front of the ship, and suggested placing the focus of the composition more on the robots than on the ships.
To incorporate all of these ideas, I played more with the layout and framing until I arrived at the following image, which is broadly the final layout I used:</p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_019.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_019.jpg" alt="Figure 7: Rough AO render &quot;sketch&quot; of my final layout."></a></p>

  <p>I chose to put an additional ship in the background flying away from the dock for two main reasons.
First, I wanted to be able to showcase more of the ship, since the front ship is mostly obscured by the foreground dock.
Second, the background ship helps fill out and balance the right side of the frame more, which would otherwise have been kind of empty.</p>

  <p>In both this project and in the previous Art Challenge, my workflow for assembling the final scene relies heavily on Maya’s referencing capabilities.
Each separate asset is kept in its own .ma file, and all of the .ma files are referenced into the main scene file.
The only the things the main scene file contains are references to assets, along with scene-level lighting, overrides, and global-scale effects such as volumes and, in the case of this challenge, the rain streaks.
So, even though the flying scifi ship appears in my scene twice, it is actually just the same .ma file referenced into the main scene twice instead of two separate ships.</p>

  <p>The idea of a rainy scene largely drove the later lighting direction of my entry; from this point I basically knew that the final scene was going to have to be overcast and drizzly, with a heavy reliance on volumes to add depth separation into the scene and to bring out practical lights on the ships.
I had a lot of fun modeling out the dock and gangway, and may have gotten slightly carried away.
I modeled every single bolt and rivet that you would expect to be there in real life, and I also added lampposts to use later as practical light sources for illuminating the dock and the robots.
Once I had finished modeling the dock and had made a few more layout tweaks, I arrived at a point where I was happy to start with shading and initial light blocking.
Zoom in if you want to see all of the rivets and bolts and stuff on the dock:</p>

  <p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_032.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2020/Jul/shipshape/progress_032.jpg" alt="Figure 8: AO render of my layout going into shading and lighting. Check out all of the crazy detail on the dock that I modeled!"></a></p>

  <p><strong>UV Unwrapping</strong></p>

  <p>UV unwrapping the ship took a ton of time.
For the last challenge, I relied on a combination of manual UV unwrapping by hand in Maya and using <a href="https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/houdini-game-dev-tools-auto-uvs/">Houdini’s Auto UV SOP</a>, but I found that the Auto UV SOP didn’t work as well on this challenge due to the ship and robot having a lot of strange geometry with really complex topology.
On the treehouse in the last challenge, everything was more or less some version of a cylinder or a rectangular prism, with some morphs and warps and extra bits and bobs applied.
Almost every piece of the ship aside from the floorboards are very complex shapes that aren’t easy to find good seams for, so the Auto UV SOP wound up making a lot of choices for UV cuts that I didn’t like.
As a result, I basically manually UV unwrapped this entire challenge in Maya.</p>

  <p>A lot of the complex undercarriage type stuff around the back thrusters on the ship was really insane to unwrap.
The muffler manifold and mechanical parts of the crane arm were difficult too.
Fortunately though, the models came with subdivision creases, and a lot of the subd crease tags wound up proving to be useful hints towards good places to place UV edge cuts.
I also found …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<p>I've been very surprised and delighted over a number of years now by Microsoft's strong efforts in open
    source. I understand the skeptics, I was on Slashdot when they tried to sue Linux out of existence and I think only
    time will tell. I figure MS contributing is better than them hunting Linux distributions for sport. So I was mostly
    onboard for Microsofts efforts and I've especially found Visual Studio Code useful.</p>
<p>To settle a few things. When I tweeted on this subject I only got the response that I should use vim. Thanks. Great.
    I can and do on use vim. That misses a number of points. Visual Studio Code is an immensely popular editor and
    likely the most common recommendations to new developers. The primary reason I've used Visual Studio Code is
    that it has an incredibly compelling solution for remote pairing in the form of LiveShare. I've used that for a
    while with great success mentoring, coaching and generally working with other developers of varying experience and
    editor preferences. Most programmers can handle a "normal" editor like VS Code while something like Emacs
    or Vim depends a lot more on what they've learned.</p>
<p>I also ended up enjoying the Remote series of extensions for developing effectively inside remote servers or local
    containers.</p>
<h2>These things are proprietary</h2>
<p>At some point I read a piece of license that said that LiveShare could only be used with the Visual Studio family of
    products. "Huh, that sounds weird, VS Code is open source right?"</p>
<p>Sure enough. VS Code is fully MIT. The binary distribution has a separate license to allow telemetry and protect
    Microsoft trademarks and stuff. Nothing particularly weird, I can't really get worked up about telemetry, I know
    some can. But the extensions.. These extensions are in my book core differentiators that makes VS Code compelling.
    For me it is definitely part of what pushes it beyond the much leaner Sublime (paid, closed source) I was using
    before.</p>
<p>These extensions have a license limiting them and their online service parts to only be used with the Visual Studio
    family of products. This is the <a href="https://microsoftdocs.github.io/live-share/license/eula.html" title="License for LiveShare">license for LiveShare</a> and this is the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/preview-license" title="License for Remote">license for Remote</a>.</p>
<p>For me LiveShare is the most important thing. Google Docs style collaborative code editing, terminal sharing, port
    sharing and a bunch more features. I know Atom had an extension like this, I haven't checked the licensing there
    or tried it recently.</p>
<p>Remote is a very strong extension as well for anyone working on a server over SSH or in a container. It helps by
    installing extensions on the destination to allow language servers and such. I've seen it do terrible things to
    servers sometimes but it is very useful and generally works well.</p>
<p>It makes me uneasy to accept VS Code as an "open" project in any wider meaning of the word when compelling
    features are legally locked to only work inside the family of Visual Studio products. It makes me less certain that
    this isn't the Extend in Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. It also frustrates me that this prevents someone from
    building a compatible plugin for VIM or any other editor. This would be much more powerful if it could be in all the
    IntelliJs as well.</p>
<p>You'll find a repo for <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share" title="LiveShare on GitHub">LiveShare on GitHub</a> but it is only for documentation and issue tracking. There
    is no code. Same for <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release" title="Remote on GitHub">Remote</a>.</p>
<h2>The entire marketplace is proprietary</h2>
<p>Some additional salt in this particular wound is that the use of the Marketplace of VS Code extensions is also
    proprietarily licensed. So all these open source developers are shoving their extensions into a competitive
    advantage for one of the world's largest tech firms. And they disallow other uses of the marketplace. Even if
    the letter of open source is followed there is none of the openness, collaborative or community essence that I think
    exemplifies open source and free software projects.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? I guess it protects from the competition. Such as the <a href="https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium" title="VS Codium">VS Codium</a> project which provides VS Code
    binaries without the proprietary parts. But also, as a consequence of this, without the Marketplace of extensions.
    There is an open source alternative called <a href="https://open-vsx.org/" title="Open VSX">Open VSX</a>, but since
    it isn't the canonical one it is missing a bunch of extensions and the big Liveshare and Remote ones are still
    not allowed.</p>
<p>This also blocks the <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server" title="code-server">code-server editor</a> that
    allows running VS Code in the browser from using it which otherwise would have been perfect for me to do development
    on an iPad Pro. I can still use that but a lot of packages are not in Open VSX.</p>
<h2>What about lock-in?</h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code is marketed with LiveShare and Remote as powerful extensions. VS Code is also marketed as open
    source. It is easy to use the editor, install the extensions and be under the impression that you are using an open
    source software suite where Microsoft simply hosts the peering service for identifying and connecting you and your
    collaborator.</p>
<p>But the peering service is not the only closed part. The extensions are not open source projects as far as I can find
    and they are licensed during distribution in a way that disallows using them with anything but Visual Studio
    products.</p>
<p>This leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. I wasn't sold on having an Electron-based editor to begin with but
    VS Code was substantially leaner than Atom so I've been mostly accepting it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p><img src="https://codingossip.github.io/assets/images/testing.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Testing software is one of the most complex tasks in software engineering. While in traditional software engineering there are principles that define in a non-ambiguous way how software should be tested, the same does not hold for machine learning, where testing strategies are not always defined. In this post, I elucidate a testing approach that is not only highly influenced by one of the most recognized testing strategies in software engineering - that is test-driven development. But also seems to be an approach that is agnostic from the family of machine learning models under testing, and adapts very well to the typical production environments that lead to the large scale AI/ML services of today.</p> <p>After reading this post, you will learn how to set up a testing strategy that works for machine learning models with production in mind. <em>Production in mind</em> means that the team you are operating in is heterogeneous, the project under testing is developed together with other data scientists, data engineers, business customers, developers, and testers. The goals of a good testing strategy are to achieve production readiness and improve code maintainability.</p> <p>An appropriate name of the approach is <em>Test-First</em> machine learning, in short TFML, because everything starts from writing tests, rather than models.</p> <h2 id="steps-of-tfml">Steps of TFML</h2> <p>A characteristic of TFML is to start from writing tests, instead of machine learning models. The approach is based on mocking whatever is not yet available so that different actors involved in the project can proceed with their tasks anyway. It is known that data scientists and data engineers run at a different pace. Mocking a particular aspect of the world that is not yet available not only mitigates such difference but also reduces blockers within larger teams. This, in turn, increases efficiency. Below are the five essential steps of a TFML approach.</p> <h3 id="1-write-a-test">1. Write a test</h3> <p>As the name suggests, Test-First in TFML indicates that everything starts with writing a test. Even for a feature that does not yet exist. Such a test is usually very short and should stay so. Larger and more complex tests should be broken down to their essential and testable components. A test can be written after understanding the feature’s specs and requirements that are usually discussed earlier during requirement analysis (e.g. use cases and user stories).</p> <h3 id="2-validate-a-test">2. Validate a test</h3> <p>A working test will fail or pass for the right reasons. This is the step in which such reasons are defined. Defining the happy path is essential to defining what should be observed and considered a success.</p> <h3 id="3-write-the-code">3. Write the code</h3> <p>In this step, the code that leads to the happy path is actually written. This code will cause the test to pass. No other code, beyond the test’s happy path, should be provided. For example, if a machine learning model is expected to return 42, one can just return 42 and force the test to succeed here. If time constraints are needed, adding <code>sleep(milliseconds)</code> is also acceptable. Such mocked values will provide engineers with visible constraints such that they can proceed with their tasks as if the model was complete and working.</p> <h3 id="4-run-tests">4. Run tests</h3> <p>Adding new tests should never break the previous ones. Having tests that depend on each other is considered an anti-pattern in software engineering.</p> <h3 id="5-add-functionality--cleanup--refactor">5. Add functionality (+ cleanup + refactor)</h3> <p>When values are mocked, success conditions are defined and tests are running, it’s time to show that the ML model under testing is training and performing predictions. Related to the example above, some questions that should find an answer in this step are:</p> <ul> <li>Is the test breaking the constraints we set previously?</li> <li>Is our ML model returning 84 rather than 42?</li> <li>How about time constraints?</li> </ul> <p>Traditionally, in this step developers perform code cleanup, deduplication, and refactoring (whenever it applies), to improve both readability and maintainability. This strategy should be applied to ML developers too.</p> <hr> <p>Falling in the trap of <em>alternative</em> approaches is easier in machine learning due to its nature and the enthusiasm of data scientists who <code>connect-train-analyze</code> data in no time.</p> <p>The most common approach in the data science community is probably the <em>Test-Last</em> approach a.k.a. <em>code now, test later</em>. This approach can be extremely risky in ML model development, since even for a trivial linear regression there might be just too many moving parts, compared with traditional software (e.g. UI, API calls, data streams, databases, preprocessing steps, etc.) As a matter of fact, the <strong>Test-First</strong> approach encourages and forces developers to put the minimum amount of code into modules depending on such moving parts (e.g. UIs and databases) and to implement the logic that should belong to the testable section of the codebase.</p> <p>One important pitfall to avoid is <em>developer bias</em>. Tests created in a Test-First environment are usually created by the same developer who is writing the code being tested. This can be a problem e.g. if a developer does not consider certain input parameters to be checked. In that case, neither the test nor the code will verify such parameters. There is a reason why in traditional software development, testing engineers and developers are usually not the same individuals.</p> <h2 id="tfml-anti-patterns">TFML anti-patterns</h2> <p>Below are some anti-patterns in TFML.</p> <h3 id="test-dependence">Test dependence</h3> <p>Tests should be standalone. Tests that depend on others can lead to cascading failures or success out of the developer’s control.</p> <h3 id="test-model-precisely">Test model precisely</h3> <p>As in traditional software engineering, testing precise execution behavior, timing or performance can lead to test failure. In machine learning, it is even more important to consider soft constraints because models can be probabilistic. Moreover, the ranges of output variables and input data can change. Such a dynamic and sometimes loosely defined behavior is the norm rather than the exception in ML.</p> <h3 id="test-models-mathematical-details">Test model’s mathematical details</h3> <p>Testing model implementation details such as statistical and mathematical soundness are not part of the TFML strategy. Such details should be tested separately and are specific to the family of the model under consideration.</p> <h3 id="large-testing-unit">Large testing unit</h3> <p>The testing surface should always be minimal for the functionality under test. Keeping the testing unit small gives more control to the developer. Larger testing units should be broken down into smaller tests, specialized in one particular aspect of the models to be tested.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>The TFML approach forces developers to spend initial time defining the testing strategy for their models. This in turn facilitates the integration of such models in the bigger picture of complex engineering systems where larger teams are involved. It has been observed that programmers who write more tests tend to be more productive. Testing code is as important as developing software core functionality. Testing code should be produced and maintained with the same rigor as production code. In ML all this becomes even more critical, due to the heterogeneity of the systems and the people involved in ML projects.</p>  </div> </article>  </div></div>]]>

  <p>Slow database queries are a common performance bottleneck for Ruby on Rails apps. Simplifying a complex query is often not possible due to the underlying business logic. Instead, you can extract parts of a query, cache and reuse them to improve performance. In this tutorial, I’ll describe a range of techniques on how to do it.</p>

<p>We will cover more advanced ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL topics like <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>, and query plan visualizer tool.</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="when-subquery-caching-makes-sense-for-slow-activerecord-queries">When subquery caching makes sense for slow ActiveRecord queries?</h2>

<p>Subquery caching is a bit more convoluted solution for optimizing slow queries. Before you decide to implement it you should double-check if more straightforward fixes could help instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add missing database indexes and to avoid inefficient <code>Seq Scan</code> on large collections</li>
  <li>make sure that the database server is adequately scaled and has a decent cache hit rate. You can use <a href="https://github.com/pawurb/rails-pg-extras#cache_hit" target="_blank">RailsPGExtras gem</a> to validate that</li>
  <li>check if PostgreSQL configuration is correct for the type of the database server that you’re using. <a href="https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/" target="_blank">PGTune</a> is your friend here</li>
  <li>validate that your queries are not locking for too long, e.g., because of <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/rails-mistakes-downtime#detecting-deadlocks">too wide ActiveRecord transaction scope</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can read out my other blogpost for an overview of <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/slow-rails-queries">tips for optimizing slow Rails queries</a>.</p>

<p>If none of the above approaches helps, let’s discuss how you can split slow queries into the reusable parts.</p>

<h2 id="sample-database-structure">Sample database structure</h2>

<p>How to determine which part of a query to cache?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there’s no simple answer to this question. It’s totally dependent on your application’s logic.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, we will assume the following database structure to explore some common scenarios:</p>

<p><img alt="Sample PostgreSQL database structure" title="Sample PostgreSQL database strucutre" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/db-structure-for-cache-e7bbfcd8e5d7021b8291218f8b87e6d88dc4ab670a8f15885bb1c23ce57a8b11.png"></p>





<p><code>app/models/user.rb</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>User</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:group_assignments</span><span>,</span> <span>dependent: :destroy</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:groups</span><span>,</span> <span>through: :group_assignments</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:posts</span>

<p><code>app/models/group.rb</code></p>

<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code>app/models/post.rb</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>Post</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>

<p><code>app/models/group_assignment.rb</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>GroupAssignment</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>

  <span>belongs_to</span> <span>:user</span>
  <span>belongs_to</span> <span>:group</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>User</strong> can belong to many <strong>Groups</strong> with a different role via the <strong>GroupAssignment</strong> join model. <strong>Posts</strong> are published in a <strong>Group</strong> by a <strong>User</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s now explore potential slow queries that could originate in a system with similar schema.</p>

<h2 id="analyzing-slow-queries">Analyzing slow queries</h2>

<p>We will focus on optimizing a single controller. It returns not approved posts that were published in groups that a current user is an admin in. It also validates if a user is an admin in at least one group.</p>

<p>A similar complexity level requiring data from four and more tables to execute a single query is common in non-trivial Rails apps.</p>

<p>We’re using <code>eager_load</code> because relation tables are used for both filter query and post’s JSON structure. It ensures that a single query will be executed to fetch and instantiate all the records eliminating N+1 issue. You can check out <a href="https://scoutapm.com/blog/activerecord-includes-vs-joins-vs-preload-vs-eager_load-when-and-where" target="_blank">this blog post</a> for more details on differences between <code>joins</code>, <code>includes</code> and <code>eager_load</code> ActiveRecord methods.</p>

<p><code>app/models/moderation_controller.rb</code></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>PostsModerationController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>

<p><code>admin_groups</code> returns a relation object so two queries are merged together. The final query from <code>posts_to_moderate</code> method generates the following SQL:</p>

<p>I doubt you want to analyze this output line by line. I'm pasting to for reference to compare with the output after the optimization</p>


<p>You can also analyze your query using a <a href="http://tatiyants.com/pev/#/plans/new" target="_blank">visualizer tool</a>. Check out my <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/slow-rails-queries">other tutorial</a> for tips on how to do it.</p>

<p><img alt="PostgreSQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE visualizer query plan" title="PostgreSQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE visualizer query plan" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/visualizer-query-plan-46217140544fdf24208b6f1744776a70c530b3bd0a3e86265c172edc9c413066.png"></p>

<p>All the tests were carried out on a database seeded with ~200k objects in each table.</p>



<p>When analyzing the visualizer plans, it’s always worth noting how many <code>Join</code> operations the query performs. One way to speed up query execution is to limit the number of joins.</p>

<p>BTW all the tools mentioned above are useful if you already know which queries you want to put under the microscope. To discover the actual bottleneck queries in your application, you can use <a href="https://scoutapm.com/" target="_blank">ScoutAPM</a>. First, display the endpoints sorted by % of processing time consumed. Then you can deep dive into analyzing which action spends significant time in the database layer and precisely what queries are the most time-consuming.</p>

<p>Now that we know how to find and analyze bottleneck queries let’s learn how to split them into more performant and <em>cacheable</em> pieces.</p>



<p>The simplest extraction you can do is to fetch IDs of admin groups and reuse them for both authorization method and posts fetching. You don’t even need the actual group objects. You can read only the join model, significantly reducing the complexity. Just make sure to have all the foreign keys in place. You can read more about ensuring data integrity on the database level in <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/rails-postgresql-data-integrity">my other blog post</a>.</p>

  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This implementation will still perform two queries like the initial one, but they will be significantly less complex. Results of the query checking admin memberships are reused in posts fetching query, reducing the need for two join operations!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.functorial.com/posts/2018-03-12-You-Might-Not-Need-The-Virtual-DOM.html">Last time</a>, I tried to convince you that you might not need the virtual DOM, and that many common UI patterns can be reproduced with a completely <em>static</em> page, with changes only happening at the leaves of the tree - attributes and text nodes. For some trickier UI patterns, I added back a limited form of dynamic behavior, by allowing elements with dynamic lists of children.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not terribly surprising that this is possible, since it is, after all, what we used to do before React popularized the virtual DOM (using things like Mustache templates).</p>
<p>The static DOM approach has some limitations of its own, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic arrays are optimized for modification at the <em>end</em> of the array. Modifications in the middle of an array can trigger a cascade of updates to nodes at the end of the array. In practice, this is not a big problem, but for large arrays it can become a performance issue. One solution to this problem is to create an alternative structure for looping, where the inner template does either not have access to its index, or where the indices do not correspond to the position of the element in the parent array.</li>
<li>In order to trigger a UI change, however small, we need to construct a new model for the entire static DOM component. Again, in practice, this is not a big problem, but it does make it harder to do certain things. For example, if we wanted to send model changes to the server for evaluation, we would have a hard time.</li>
<li>Every change is potentially observed by every node in the static DOM. We can use tricks like filtering out duplicate events from our event streams, but this takes unnecessary time and CPU cycles. Recall, the motivation for the static DOM was that we intuitively <em>knew</em> which elements should receive the events for small model changes such as changing a single text node. The challenge is to convince the machine that this connection between submodels and elements is obvious!</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, I'd like to suggest a different approach, which solves these problems but keeps the benefits of the static DOM approach.</p>
<h2>Enter the Incremental Lambda Calculus</h2>
<p>The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0658">"A Theory of Changes for Higher-Order Languages"</a> by Cai, Giarrusso, Rendel and Ostermann states the following in its abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the result of an expensive computation is invalidated by a small change to the input, the old result should be updated incrementally instead of reexecuting the whole computation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds a lot like it applies to our problem! Once we've computed the initial state of the DOM, a small change to the model should result in a small change to the DOM.</p>
<p>In fact, as we'll see, the incremental lambda calculus will provide a solution to all three of the problems listed above.</p>
<p>"A Theory of Changes..." proceeds by interpreting the types and terms of the lambda calculus in a new context where each type is augmented with a <em>change structure</em>.</p>
<p>For our purposes, a change structure is equivalent to a monoid acting on the values of the type. I implement change structures using the following type class:</p>
<pre><code>class Monoid m &lt;= Patch a m | a -&gt; m where
  patch :: a -&gt; m -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>This declaration states that there is a functional relationship between carrier types <code>a</code> and change structures <code>m</code>, which must be <code>Monoid</code>s. I use a functional dependency to express the change structure as a function of the carrier type. In practice, this means using newtypes in quite a few more places, but makes type inference more pleasant.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>Last a</code> monoid acts on values of the type <code>a</code> via the newtype <code>Atomic a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import Data.Maybe.Last

newtype Atomic a = Atomic a

instance patchAtomic :: Patch (Atomic a) (Last a) where
  patch (Atomic a) (Last m) =
    case m of
      Nothing _ -&gt; Atomic a
      Just b    -&gt; Atomic b
</code></pre>
<p><code>mempty</code> does nothing, keeping the current value, and when composing several <code>Last a</code> values, the last one wins. <code>Atomic a</code> is a value of type <code>a</code> with a trivial change structure, where the value is either not changed at all, or changed completely.</p>
<p>The paper also defines change structures for tuples (in which the two components can change independently), functions, and other structures such as <em>bags</em> (sets with duplicate elements permitted).</p>
<p>By interpreting each type and term former in this context, the paper is able to interpret any term of the simply-typed lambda calculus as as <em>incremental</em> function. An incremental function is one which can either be evaluated normally, or given a change to the input, can produce a change to the output.</p>
<h2>An Embedded DSL</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://github.com/paf31/purescript-incremental-functions"><code>purescript-incremental-functions</code></a> library, I use a different approach, keeping the change structure concept, but implementing incremental functions using an <em>embedded DSL</em>. In particular, I use an approach based on <em>higher-order abstract syntax</em>, in which incremental functions are represented using regular PureScript functions.</p>
<p>It should perhaps not be surprising (if you've read my <a href="http://blog.functorial.com/posts/2017-10-08-HOAS-CCCs.html">other blog post</a>, anyway) that it is possible to give an embedding of incremental lambda calculus in terms of higher-order abstract syntax, but the embedding I use here is in fact <em>not</em> the one I describe in that blog post - it is much simpler.</p>
<p>The key data structure we'll need is a <code>Jet</code>:</p>
<pre><code>type Jet a =
  { position :: a
  , velocity :: Change a
  }
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>Jet</code> is a value of type <code>a</code>, paired with a change of type <code>Change a</code>, where <code>Change a</code> is the change structure acting on <code>a</code>. I say "<em>the</em> change structure", since the functional dependency on <code>Patch</code> makes it unique.</p>
<p><code>Change</code> is defined using something like an <em>associated type</em>. In PureScript, unlike in GHC Haskell, we don't have associated types, but we can make a crude approximation by packaging up the (unique) type under a fundep as an abstract data type and using <code>unsafeCoerce</code> to construct values (safely!):</p>
<pre><code>data Change a

fromChange :: forall a da. Patch a da =&gt; Change a -&gt; da
fromChange = unsafeCoerce

toChange :: forall a da. Patch a da =&gt; da -&gt; Change a
toChange = unsafeCoerce
</code></pre>
<p>We should think of the value <code>Jet { position: x, velocity: dx }</code> as being positioned currently at <code>x</code>, and <em>about to move</em> by the amount <code>dx</code>. This might be reminiscent of dual numbers, from automatic differentiation, in which we pair a number with its rate of change.</p>
<p>Given the definition of <code>Jet</code>, the encoding of incremental functions is simple: an incremental function from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code> (with their associated change structures) is represented by a function from <code>Jet a</code> to <code>Jet b</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example - an incremental function from <code>Atomic</code> values of type <code>a</code> to <code>Atomic</code> values of type <code>b</code>, constructed from a regular function from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>:</p>
<pre><code>mapAtomic :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Jet (Atomic a) -&gt; Jet (Atomic b)
mapAtomic f { position, velocity } =
  { position: Atomic (f (un Atomic position))
  , velocity: toChange (map f (fromChange velocity))
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the result will change only when the input changes.</p>
<p>This is a simple example, but we can create incremental versions of many standard functions: maps, folds, <code>filter</code>, <code>zip</code>, and so on. <code>purescript-incremental-functions</code> defines a small standard library of incremental data structures such as arrays, maps and records, and incremental functions like these.</p>
<p>To illustrate an important point, here is another example - an API for an incremental map data structure and a function to <code>map</code> a function over it:</p>
<pre><code>data IMap k a

data MapChange a da
  = Insert a
  | Remove
  | Update da

type MapChanges k a da = Map k (MapChange a da)
-- ^ a potential change for each key

map
  :: forall k a da b db
   . Ord k
  =&gt; Patch a da
  =&gt; Patch b db
  =&gt; (Jet a -&gt; Jet b)
  -&gt; Jet (IMap k a)
  -&gt; Jet (IMap k b)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that jet functions are used here to construct a <em>higher-order incremental function</em>, since the (incremental) function being mapped is being passed in as an argument.</p>
<p>Since jet functions are just regular functions, we can compose them like functions, use lambda abstraction to form new functions, and so on. We are propagating changes by passing them from one function to the next. For example:</p>
<pre><code>mapAtomic (_ + 1)
  :: Jet Int -&gt; Jet Int

map (mapAtomic (_ + 1))
  :: Jet (Imap k Int)
  -&gt; Jet (IMap k Int)

\f -&gt; map (map f)
  :: (Jet a -&gt; Jet b)
  -&gt; Jet (IMap k1 (IMap k2 a))
  -&gt; Jet (IMap k1 (IMap k2 b))
</code></pre>
<p>If we squint enough to see through the <code>Jet</code> type constructors, this DSL is very close to plain old functions, but where our data structures have been switched out for their incremental equivalents. Of course, we're limited to those basic functions which we can write incrementally as jet functions.</p>
<h2>Laws for Incremental Functions</h2>
<p>Every incremental function can be represented as a jet function, but not every jet function is a valid incremental function. We require the following condition to hold for a jet function <code>f :: Jet a -&gt; Jet b</code>:</p>
<pre><code>patch (lower f a) db = lower f (patch a da)
</code></pre>
<p>where</p>
<pre><code>lower :: (Jet a -&gt; Jet b) -&gt; a -&gt; b
lower f a = (f { position: a, velocity: mempty }).position
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>db = (f { position: a, velocity: da }).velocity
</code></pre>
<p>That is, if we <code>lower</code> the function <code>f</code> to a function on regular (non-changing) values, and apply it to a <code>patch</code>ed value, we should get the same result as applying the <code>lower</code>ed function, and patching the result with a patch generated by the jet function.</p>
<p>Note, however, that the following condition, which might seem intuitively obvious, <em>does not</em> hold in general:</p>
<pre><code>(f { position: a, velocity: mempty }).velocity == mempty
</code></pre>
<p>That is, jet functions are not required to take constant jets to constant jets. The reason is that a jet function might close over some already-changing value from its environment, in which case changes in the result would already be "baked in" to that jet function.</p>
<h2>Change Structures as Models for Mutation</h2>
<p>Change structures tell us how changes act on values, as pure functions, but we can use those pure functions to model impure changes to the real world.</p>
<p>For example, the paper talks about how incremental lambda calculus could be used to model <em>self-maintaining database views</em>. In this case, our values would represent <em>relations</em> and changes would represent updates on those …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before I set my eyes on the Redux source code, I naively thought OOP is superior than FP(Functional Programming) as a programming paradigm. But this is not right. As we know that FP is dedicated to forming a easy to understand and clear workflow without those obscure abstracted objects and relations. It's much closer to human's procedural mode of thinking.</p><p>Now <code>React</code> has already got hooks which can handle the "states" properly event without <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a>. The demand for <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a> could be declining but its code base is still worth learning. Especially for those who wants to enlighten themselves in functional programming. So, I guess it's never a bad idea to learn from a good example even though it is "obsolete" (not at all).</p><p>When I started reading the <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a> source code, I immediately felt the power of this unfamiliar usage of my familiar programming language. It feels like exploring an acient cave with a torch lighting up the paintings and found the great secret.</p><p>In order to know more about what Redux benefits from FP, I researched the <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a> source code and created a mini version of it.</p><blockquote><p>Never be afraid of reinventing the wheel.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Contents:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#recap-how-redux-works">Recap How Redux Works</a></li><li><a href="#redux-approach-comparison-fp-vs-oop">Redux Approach Comparison: FP vs OOP</a></li><li><a href="#wonderful-redux-fp-design">Wonderful Redux FP Design</a><ul><li><a href="#createstore">createStore</a></li><li><a href="#combinereducers">combineReducers</a></li><li><a href="#applymiddleware">applyMiddleware</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#redux-middlewares">Redux Middlewares</a><ul><li><a href="#redux-thunk">Redux Thunk</a></li><li><a href="#redux-logger">Redux Logger</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#a-demo-app">A demo app</a></li><li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#references">References</a></li></ul><h2 id="recap-how-redux-works"><a href="#recap-how-redux-works">Recap How Redux Works</a></h2><p>There are 4 basic key points for <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a>:</p><ol><li>Create a store for data and let the view subscribe to it</li><li>The view dispatches an action to submit the changs</li><li>The reducer changes the state based on the action type</li><li>Finally return the new state and triggers the view to change</li></ol><p>This is the classic diagram explaining how <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a> works:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b1117a23634125a8e2195b0dfc8fc1a29c511fac/3f628/assets/static/redux.b474ba6.ff6f3365031ebcab6ddfefc3aadeb376.jpg" width="1088" alt="redux diagram" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1088 573' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-7e552fcbb64e466973e8c4226e516330'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-7e552fcbb64e466973e8c4226e516330)' width='1088' height='573' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2ciVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAAiCAYAAADvVd%2bPAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAEqklEQVRo3tWZ2U7sMAyG%2b/5vgcQ1V4C4AIkbQCAh9n3f931fc/RFco8n0zZOGEBEstppUrv%2bYzu2p3h5eXFvb2/u4%2bPDRO/v7453Xl9fy2sVhWus/KEY7yo5ufwLlL%2b5uXGnp6fu/PzcnZ2dVRJzrLm6uvKAWT5QwH18fIzy13IsAOv55%2bfnKF9NT09P5fsFyi8sLLjd3V23vb3dSKxZWlryHwmSMQuQ%2bdXVVbexseF2dnai/FnL/efnpwkALBLeFv7Mb25uehliyQU7g2DrQHkYMSwuwO4j0Dp4j/UAwM5aLGxxcdGlDDZRrLhAIdBhgEqT7zOOj489YDzjA2Wn6%2bjh4cGtrKyYfJNxd3fnAbDwl3kUAhBAa%2bLPPHosLy//BwCfEABkUTh4Js9PTk7c0dFRy/o6koF5VvENZTDu7%2b%2b9mVr4C2jwRyHNp44/77RYQAgAg127vLx019fX/l7PHR4eusnJSX/FFbCGOmJ%2bcHDQjY%2bPlx8BH3gTe25vb/2O4yYykDcxMeEODg6i/Pf29tzIyIgbGhpqUxbLFhkaFBMACMdMMEXu9Y6i%2bMzMjI%2bm3GMNIfEcV%2bEDu7q63OjoaPlhmCB8Cbx8CP5LHNIAADDPmvhDrOnp6XG9vb1tloqMtbU1737iviYAYiYUukDMp7/iAk0xqckF6tzYDECTMAmCEqVjQRCFJAhq362SIQDkBEEUCuOD5i0EqG0ApByDev13HIMolXoMolD2MUhmNz8/73cWfxfCzDF3/Yw1vMzVkgjJlXeIB/it5hcSMjHn9fV1MwDsKBZGwAz5I5OrPOfKM%2bJOmQiBBCAgHMVYROTs7%2b933d3dPkpLUGPNxcVFciqMWQv/GAG6KG5NhUltq/hwmqAw93oOqyxTYUFR/EWCydzcnBsbG/P3uljKKYZSiq1OFUNYENYEmGFMaCmGdN4ugQUlQQp/5z4MRqHwWC0QC5RVlGIBdTxwDayvak1pAVVMQWx/f9%2bbj/i6dUd%2bm8IiDACaXLaoehkAJJD8JQDCHQ4BqNKhqKqtUVpSTXGBFL/8LeXlqvMDgnhVg6bWArgyOBkgCYJ/xQLk%2byVtl991G1iERxaIkRcQQTEhzuSULtBPBsG6I3Fra8t/O7kBgRAdqDEaLUAmWMgJAAjS/dGRNMckwzQ1VuLmuJt2YUl6KNokh9FtMJMLSOLTZD7WRAhQJbO0JEI5FhDmBIBJNYjiZheQKww4BiGd8uZYgERjCi6CahMhD3O19gRjOUGYB0QtQOcB4TGYG5A60RPMjT3JeUAIADtSlQmmkABg7QlKOfxVudoCsgBAeXzS0ptrIoRLdVfXs9NNDD5Yym1AyJXLIAZ8yQJmZ2fLElJigpWkFOVImpqaauvKSL%2bOXdZz/B4YGHDDw8NlSZsiX9ZyRa6u/MwAiO/qOjqHiPzs5vT0dIuSXDmjqTjhr%2beQ39fX55up0qPIkQ0IFHNhXIgCkPt/W12bCz6pLiB/vDT1BFP/x6yjIrXETM3mdBBs6tl9RxAMdTFbQCfz8u/sCXaCip%2bozviPgaCke/pVhM/TEpc2%2bp8GIOwJStPTEjh/svz%2bEQuQYsgSNHOLoVz6Bye%2b7fLOqLjeAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC' /%3e%3c/svg%3e" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b1117a23634125a8e2195b0dfc8fc1a29c511fac/3f628/assets/static/redux.b474ba6.ff6f3365031ebcab6ddfefc3aadeb376.jpg" data-srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d23ede7d66304da8179f8bd5b5cb30d1a54c39df/29340/assets/static/redux.82a2fbd.ff6f3365031ebcab6ddfefc3aadeb376.jpg 480w, https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b1117a23634125a8e2195b0dfc8fc1a29c511fac/3f628/assets/static/redux.b474ba6.ff6f3365031ebcab6ddfefc3aadeb376.jpg 1088w"></p><p>From the diagram above, it's easy to find the keywords: <code>action</code><code>store</code><code>reducer</code><code>view</code><code>subscribe</code> and <code>dispatch</code>.

The return value is consistent which made the program returnings foreseeable during or after the execution.</p><p>OOP made a solid structure which defined all the attributes a data model should contain. It makes it easy to modify or configure the data model.</p><p>In <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a>, the <code>reduers</code> and <code>middlewares</code> are usually defined only once. It means, we don't need the ability to update these properties and we don't hope them to be altered during the runtime. As for FP approach, it utilizes the <code>closure</code> technique that kills the possbility of exposing the internal properties. With some fantastic FP techniques (curry, compose, pipe), it's even making the program much more human-readable than OOP.</p><p>I would say FP should be the best fit for such scenario. Of course, the FP I'm talking about here is far from the real functional programming like Haskell. But at least the idea of utilizing FP techniques in Javascript is something to follow.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/66984ccd5661fa81bc4c1806c64e980181165a7d/88b43/assets/static/haskell.cbab2cf.82d9f5b0912290333a547a32e17d3642.jpg" width="1024" alt="haskell functional programming" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1024 576' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-52e08e1070b234d120b65ac6e29a8487'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-52e08e1070b234d120b65ac6e29a8487)' width='1024' height='576' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAkAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQCAwUGAQj/xAAwEAABBAEDAQYCCwAAAAAAAAABAAIDEQQSITFRBRMiQWFxJKEGFBUyQlKCkrHB8P/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/EABkRAQEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABERIhQf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A%2bqSQASdgEvj5uLki8fIilHVjgf8AcFMEWCFz0oyIJ5ceETuhvTqPeucQR%2ba6vc8enRBuwzxTAGJ7XAixSsWFJmZ0DmiKLVDVNLoJHPqq8Vedp77R0yujdj5biDVtgdp46%2baUPoN0aFlUwTiV8je7kZoNW9tA%2b3VXEAgggEHyQcl2J9O%2bzO04JXd3kxSQl3eMEZk00au2WCPboVt9mdt4Pac7ocN0zntbrOqF7BV1y4BOY%2bLj44Ax4IogBpGhgbQ5rZXLVs8Hj70Oq7ralh4WaYXPgnleckGu7kna43WwsNA6LdSpzCL%2bHm29Bv8ANZGXDLKdDpZpmt2IrJa675/D0NrQfJDHGwPy5ACDTjyfkifID2lrsfII33Ya49QVWC173fD5Zo1es1x5eLhXlaupsxe9Z4M7KIIq2uA/rlMwwGN5cZpX7VTyK9%2bEnqD374uYC3TvrIu/1b15qyGNkkztUWSw/etzzp59/RXesQ8hQjibGXab8Rs2bU1kCX%2bpYodqGPFq330jzQhDQMLFHGPF%2b0dK/jZWxRRwgiJjWAmyGirKEIJoQhAIQhB//9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/66984ccd5661fa81bc4c1806c64e980181165a7d/88b43/assets/static/haskell.cbab2cf.82d9f5b0912290333a547a32e17d3642.jpg" data-srcset="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2c16467debebdf254444700dab6213bb45ece8a2/b30b3/assets/static/haskell.82a2fbd.82d9f5b0912290333a547a32e17d3642.jpg 480w, https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/66984ccd5661fa81bc4c1806c64e980181165a7d/88b43/assets/static/haskell.cbab2cf.82d9f5b0912290333a547a32e17d3642.jpg 1024w"></p><h2 id="wonderful-redux-fp-design"><a href="#wonderful-redux-fp-design">Wonderful Redux FP Design</a></h2><p>In Redux, there is no class at all (In the earlier versions, it was once based on <code>Class</code>).

And this is exactly what FP expects a function to behave:</p><blockquote><p>Pure with no side effects.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>createStore</strong>: returns new <code>Object</code> { getState, dispatch, subscribe }</li><li><strong>combineReducers</strong>: returns new <code>Function</code></li><li><strong>applyMiddleware</strong>: returns new <code>Function</code></li></ul><p>To explain the <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redux</a> design in an easy way, I implemented only the very core part of the APIs above.

<p>  The Kassel district court found biology professor Ulrich Kutschera guilty of insulting homosexuals because of statements in an interview.  His statements are not covered by the freedom of science. </p>

<div itemprop="articleBody" data-qa="Article.Text">
<p><span>D</span>he district court in Kassel sentenced biology professor Ulrich Kutschera on Monday for insulting homosexuals.  It imposed a fine of 6,000 euros.  The court did not consider the accusation of incitement to be valid.  However, Kutschera’s statements are also not covered by the freedom of science, said the judge: “It depends on the context.” This is how the evolutionary biologist spoke in an interview and not in a lecture.  The verdict is not yet legally binding.</p>
<p>The evolutionary biologist was reported for an interview that appeared on the kath.net portal in 2017.  In it, Kutschera commented on “Marriage for All”, ie marriages between people of the same sex.  Among other things, the professor at the University of Kassel associated the right of adoption for homosexual couples with pedophilia and child abuse.  The public prosecutor accused him of attributing a fundamental tendency to sexually abuse children to homosexuals under the pretext of “life science facts”.</p>

<p>Kutschera stood by his quotes.  However, he accused critics and the public prosecutor of misinterpreting statements and taking them out of context: “The entire charge completely ignores what is said in the interview,” he said.  The prosecution failed to recognize that he referred to an experiment on gender identity in the text and that he used the term pedophilia in the sense of its author as “consensual loving acts” – delimited from child sexual abuse.  Basically, Kutschera is concerned about one thing, his lawyer said: “He is concerned about psychological problems in children from same-sex partnerships.”</p>
<p>The judge did not accept the reference to the use of technical terms: “The general public understands it as it is in general language use.”</p>
<h3>“Outrage statements by Ulrich Kutschera”</h3>
<p>This was also the view of homosexuals who acted as witnesses in court.  Among other things, a 53-year-old Berlin doctor testified before the district court, who had reported Kutschera.  He did this “because I feel that my human dignity has been violated.” With his statements, Kutschera exceeded the limits of freedom of expression and science.</p>

<p>After the trial, Kutschera’s employer, the University of Kassel, said: “Ulrich Kutschera’s statements are outrageous.” But the first-instance verdict was not yet final.  For civil servant university lecturers, the Hessian Disciplinary Act applies, according to which a possible disciplinary procedure is suspended until a legal judgment in the same matter has reached a final judgment.  A procedure for the successor of Kutschera is “on a very good way”.</p>
<p>Hesse’s Minister of Science Angela Dorn (Greens) said the ruling shows that freedom of expression works in Germany.  “It finds its limits where people and entire groups of people are insulted and disparaged.” If the judgment becomes final, the University of Kassel “as a service authority will have to check whether there are any disciplinary consequences,” said Dorn.  “I am sure that she will do this carefully.”</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The main options are <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/espeak">espeak</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuspeech/">Gnuspeech</a>,
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/spd-say.1.html">spd-say</a>, MBROLA, PicoTTS and the <a href="http://festvox.org/">festvox</a> project
which <a href="http://festvox.org/festival/">festival</a> and <a href="http://www.festvox.org/flite/">flite</a> are part of.
While I found espeak to be the simplest system to use, festival produced the best results when used with the right voices.
This post shall outline the various ways festival can be used and the steps required to achieve good results.</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>Install festival:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>festival festvox-us-slt-hts</code></pre></figure>

<p>Use festival’s interactive mode:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">festival <span>-i</span>
festival&gt; <span>(</span>voice.list<span>)</span>
festival&gt; <span>(</span>voice_cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts<span>)</span> 
festival&gt; <span>(</span>SayText <span>"Don't hate me, I'm just doing my job!"</span><span>)</span>
festival&gt; <span>(</span>intro<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Run commands from file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">festival&gt; <span>(</span>load <span>"hello.scm"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Use festival’s batch mode:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">festival <span>-b</span> <span>'(voice_cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts)'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>'(SayText "The temperature is 22 degrees centigrade and there is a slight breeze from the west.")'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Use festival’s batch mode to run file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">festival <span>-b</span> hello.scm</code></pre></figure>

<p>Pipe text into festival’s tts mode:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo </span>hello | festival <span>--tts</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Pipe text to festival’s tts mode from Python with subprocess:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>subprocess</span> <span>import</span> <span>PIPE</span><span>,</span> <span>Popen</span>
<span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>'We love Raspberry.'</span>
<span>process</span> <span>=</span> <span>Popen</span><span>([</span><span>'festival'</span><span>,</span> <span>'--tts'</span><span>],</span> <span>stdin</span><span>=</span><span>PIPE</span><span>)</span>
<span>process</span><span>.</span><span>stdin</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>
<span>process</span><span>.</span><span>stdin</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
<span>process</span><span>.</span><span>wait</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Use Python wrapper of festival’s C++ API:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>festival-dev
pip <span>install </span>git+https://github.com/krisfris/pyfestival</code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>festival</span>
<span>festival</span><span>.</span><span>sayText</span><span>(</span><span>'hello'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Festival also has a C, C++ and a client-server API. See <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual/festival_28.html#SEC126">API</a>.</p>

<h3 id="voices">Voices</h3>

<p>The <code>voice_cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts</code> voice (used above) can be installed easily and isn’t bad but
the Nitech HTS voices are better. HTS stands for <em>hidden-markov-model-based speech synthesis system</em> and Nitech is the Nagoya Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>The voices were not available on the original site at the time of writing this post thus I uploaded them to a GitHub repository.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Clone the github repo with the voices</span>
git clone git@github.com:krisfris/nitech-hts-voices.git

<span># Enter directory</span>
<span>cd </span>nitech-hts-voices

<span># Extract  files</span>
<span>for </span>t <span>in</span> <span>`</span><span>ls</span><span>`</span> <span>;</span> <span>do </span><span>tar </span>xvf <span>$t</span> <span>;</span> <span>done</span>

<span># Install voices</span>
<span>sudo mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /usr/share/festival/voices/us
<span>sudo mv </span>lib/voices/us/<span>*</span> /usr/share/festival/voices/us/
<span>sudo mv </span>lib/hts.scm /usr/share/festival/hts.scm

<span># List all available voices</span>
<span>for </span>d <span>in</span> <span>`</span><span>ls</span> /usr/share/festival/voices<span>`</span> <span>;</span> <span>do </span><span>ls</span> <span>"/usr/share/festival/voices/</span><span>${</span><span>d</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>;</span> <span>done</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To set a voice as default voice edit the <code>/etc/festival.scm</code> file and add the following line:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>(</span><span>set</span><span>!</span> voice_default <span>'voice_nitech_us_rms_arctic_hts)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><em>Note:</em> The Nitech voices are not compatible with festival versions greater than 2.1 which is from 2010. The default festival version on Ubuntu 20.04 is 2.5.</p>

<h3 id="flite">Flite</h3>

<p>Flite is a small, fast and more portable (albeit less customizable) speech synthesis engine for festival voices.
Install it with <code>sudo apt install flite</code>. Download more voices:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd
mkdir</span> .config/flite <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> .config/flite
wget <span>-r</span> <span>--no-parent</span> <span>--no-directories</span> <span>--accept</span> flitevox http://www.festvox.org/flite/packed/flite-2.0/voices/
<span>echo</span> <span>"Hello World!"</span> | flite <span>-voice</span> ./cmu_us_axb.flitevox</code></pre></figure>

<p>The downside is, you can’t use voices from festival with flite directly.
Instead you will need to convert them manually which requires time and programming knowledge.
See <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/doc/flite_8.html">Converting FestVox Voices</a>.</p>

<p>Personally, I would stick to festival unless the speed and small size of flite are
actually required.</p>

<h3 id="emacs">Emacs</h3>

<p>The festival manual mentions a simple way of using festival from emacs.
See <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual/festival_11.html#SEC37">Emacs interface</a>.</p>

<p>There is also an ubuntu package called <code>eflite</code> which is an emacspeak server based on flite.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Since the Nitech voices don’t work with newer festival versions you will have to settle for 
the <code>cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts</code> voice. If you don’t mind going commercial,
using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/">AWS Polly</a> is likely a better choice.

<p><strong><u>A Money Mystery</u></strong></p>



<p>I have been unemployed for 10 months now and my net worth is greater today than it was when I quit my job. The purpose of this piece is to explain how that has happened.</p>



<p>First, I want to be clear about a few ways in which I did not make money. I did not receive any government money through unemployment nor from the stimulus checks. Unemployment money is not for people who quit their jobs voluntarily and the stimulus checks were not for people who made more than $99,000 in 2019. I have not had any paid job at any point in the last 10 months. I did not start a profitable business at any point during that time. I have not made any money from this blog. My only material source of income has been through the appreciation of investments that I have made on my own, but that is not the part the matters most.</p>



<p><strong><u>The Water Bucket Analogy</u></strong></p>



<p>What matters most is how I have kept from losing money.</p>



<p>To explain, let me introduce a simple analogy. Think about a bucket of water with a hose that fills it and a hole near the bottom where the water leaks out. The water in the bucket represents your money and the speed at which it leaks out of the hole is the speed at which your money is spent. Most people have a paying job. That’s the hose.</p>



<p>People want to increase their net worth over time and so naturally they think about how they can get more water faster from the hose. The better place to start, however, is to focus on limiting the leakage. People’s general focus on the hose rather than the hole is well demonstrated by the fact that anyone you ask will be able to tell you how much money they make by some unit of time but almost no one will be able to tell you the same in terms of their costs. They probably know the cost of their rent or mortgage payments and a number of other standalone expenses (by varying units of time) but very few will be able to tell you how much money they spend on an average day including their monthly, annual, and other periodic expenses spread out over the course of the respective period. I certainly could not have answered that question myself a year ago but doing so seemed like the sensible place to start.</p>



<p><strong><u>Base Burn Rate</u></strong></p>



<p>I knew when I quit my job in banking that in order to keep my cash burn in check I would need to get my expenses in order. I had turned the hose off so I needed to manage the hole. I started with my subscriptions (monthly and annual payments). I looked at the recurring expenses on my credit card and bank statements. I cancelled almost all of them. I had to add one significant one, health insurance, which my employer had been paying previously. I went with the second cheapest plan I could find from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield for $287/month. Next time I would instead go with the second cheapest plan from Oscar for $293/month because I like newer companies in broken industries and they tend to offer a better customer experience.</p>



<p>My next largest recurring payment was my phone bill. I went into the Verizon store and asked what the differences were between my current plan and the cheapest one I could possibly have. The only difference of any significance was the inability with the lower plan to use a hotspot. That infrequently used function was not nearly worth the ~$80/month difference in plans. I cut my phone bill in half to $78/month.</p>



<p>Below are the rest of my monthly and annual expenses as they stand today. As you will see, if I didn’t actively spend any money, these passive expenses alone would result in only a $15/day average burn. I call this my <strong><em>base burn rate</em></strong>. <em>Note: this figure was closer to $60 when I was living in New York pre-covid (+ rent, WiFi, utilities) and between $30-$60 when I was traveling in Europe and Asia (+ hostels/Airbnbs), but right now I am fortunate to be living with my family for free</em>.</p>

<p>Not bad right? It gets better…</p>



<p><strong><u>Passive Income</u></strong></p>



<p>I think about my investments in terms of three categories – crypto, stocks, and real estate. Real estate is unique among the three in that it pretty predictably generates cash flows each month. This is because our monthly rents collected from tenants are more than enough to cover the monthly mortgage payments, the cost of our property manager (10% of rent), and any necessary maintenance and/or repairs that she facilitates on our behalf over the course of a given month. Subtracting those expenses from the total rent collected each month and splitting the balance with my good friend and co-owner Kyle leaves me to expect $319/month (assuming the average amount of monthly repairs) which comes out to about $10/day. This is a far cry from the passive income of a real estate magnate but it is solid for a first property and not insignificant for me when it is the only dependable income that I have. Most importantly, this passive income offsets two-thirds of my base burn rate at the moment.</p>



<p>With my base burn rate and passive income figured out, I can calculate what I call my <strong><em>net base burn rate</em></strong> which in this case is equal to $5/day,</p>



<p><strong><u>3 Basic Principles</u></strong></p>



<p>After minimizing my base burn rate and estimating my passive income to calculate my net base burn rate, the next category I considered was comprised of the regularly re-occurring but variable expenses that cost me the most. This includes food, drinks, transportation, and entertainment. I came up with a few principles to help myself spend less in these areas. That said, I believe one of the best things money can buy is the ability not to have to worry about money so rather than force any hard rules upon myself I mostly just keep these principles in mind and try to be reasonable most of the time. <em>Note: these principles were most applicable when I was traveling and then living in New York pre-covid.</em></p>



<ol type="1"><li>Food – don’t drink a lot at restaurants. You are there for the food and the company.</li><li>Drinks – drink less and mostly at yours or friends’ places. The lower your tolerance, the cheaper the fun.</li><li>Transportation – walk when you can. Subways are usually quicker and always cheaper than cars.</li></ol>



<p><strong><u>Exceeding Expectations</u></strong></p>



<p>The goal is not to be watching your wallet all the time. It is to figure it out, then forget about it. Knowing my net base burn rate of $5/day leads to an annual burn of less than $2,000 allows me to live and spend confidently because I know if I ever want to slow my burn I can basically do so simply by doing nothing (therefore slowing my active spending). I don’t <em>need</em> to drink alcohol or go golfing and I could easily eat for a few dollars per day if I was willing to eat less healthfully and not go out for a while. Fortunately, I have not had to sacrifice any of these things. If I did have to, I know that I could, but I would probably just go and get a job at that point and realistically well before that point ever came.</p>



<p>In order to quit my job in the first place, I had to be willing to endure some level of burn in exchange for the freedom of time that I was buying for myself. I was confident that I could offset some of it with my investments in crypto and stocks, and the non- cash flow part of my real estate investment (the appreciation of the value of my equity in the property). Never would I have anticipated what has happened to date. I am pleased to say that between Bitcoin’s surge this week, Amazon’s last month, the appreciation of my Kentucky property’s value, and some other smaller stock and crypto investments along the way, my investments have now offset the entirety of my burn over the last 10 months. My net worth is slightly greater today than it was the day I quit my job, and it is not because I’ve been a hermit or lived a miserably frugal life. Quite the contrary. I traveled the world for a few months, had a four-month lease in New York City and stayed in a couple hotels before that, got a month-long Airbnb in Georgia with Lauren, have eaten well, been golfing a lot lately, and the list goes on. Not every day is roses. I would be skeptical of anyone who says that is the case. But I have not often if ever but rarely felt restrained moneywise. I have been enjoying my time quite a bit.</p>



<p>When I quit my job, I figured I would burn a good chunk of my savings in a few months and expected I would feel the need to get a job after several if not before then. I thought it would be well worthwhile to burn that money in exchange for the time that I would buy for myself to do whatever I wanted. I was right in the sense that this time has proven valuable to me but wrong in another. It hasn’t cost me a dime.</p>

    <p>As most reasonable people are familiar with the Harry Potter books,
their content serves as ideal material for building a mnemonic system.
The mnemonic major system, in particular, is used to memorize number sequences.</p>

<p>In order to implement the steps outlined in this post you need the content of the Harry Potter books (or other book(s) if you prefer).
In a previous post I showed you how to
<a href="https://darkshadow.io/2020/06/29/building-a-fantasy-book-db.html">download fantasy books and extract their text</a>.
Among the downloaded data were the Harry Potter books which I will use in this post.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-learn-the-sound-number-mapping">Step 1: Learn the sound-number mapping</h3>

<p>In the mnemonic major system each number from 0 to 9 is associated with one or more
consonant sounds. Use the following table as a reference.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Number</th>
      <th>Sounds (IPA)</th>
      <th>Letters with example words</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>

<p>In English, letters are pronounced in different ways depending on the context,
that’s why some letters are repeated in different rows. But in the end,
only the sound matters, not the spelling.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples for words, their IPA representation and the number they encode.</p>

<p>I’m going to show you how to write a training program to internalize
the concept of mapping sounds to numbers in Step 4. But first, you need the ability
to convert text automatically to numbers. This happens in 2 steps. First, the text is converted
to IPA. Then, the IPA is converted to numbers.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-converting-ipa-to-numbers">Step 2: Converting IPA to numbers</h3>

<p>The process of converting IPA to numbers is very simple. I iterate through the IPA chars
and if there is a number associated with the char I append the number to the result.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Mapping from number to sounds

<p>For example, <code>major_decode_from_ipa('dɪfəkəlt')</code> yields <code>[1, 8, 7, 5, 1]</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, I define a couple functions for converting number sequences to and from strings.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>numseq_to_str</span><span>(</span><span>numseq</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Convert number sequence to string."""</span>

<span>def</span> <span>str_to_numseq</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Convert string to number sequence."""</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>s</span> <span>if</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>isdigit</span><span>()]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For example, <code>numseq_to_str([1, 8, 7, 5, 1])</code> yields <code>'18751'</code>.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-converting-text-to-ipa">Step 3: Converting text to IPA</h3>

<p>In order to automatically convert text to IPA (and then to numbers) you need to use an IPA
dictionary.</p>

<p>Python’s <a href="https://pypi.org/project/eng-to-ipa/">eng-to-ipa</a> package is able to convert text to
IPA using the <em>Carnegie-Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary</em>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>eng_to_ipa</span>

<span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>'“I’ll bring up some sandwiches.”'</span>  <span># Sentence from the HP books

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>ipa</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This yields:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html">['“i’ll* brɪŋ əp səm sandwiches.”*']</code></pre></figure>

<p>According to the docs, eng-to-ipa will reprint words that cannot be found in the CMU dictionary
with an asterisk. Thus, <code>“i’ll</code> and <code>sandwiches.”</code> have not been found. Clearly, the punctuation is the issue.
I preprocess the text in order to ease the conversion to IPA.</p>

<p>And…</p>

<p>As you can see, there are 3 ways to pronounce this sentence depending on whether you like
to pronounce <code>sandwich</code> with <code>m</code>, <code>n</code> or <code>nd</code>. In order to use the major system effectively,
you should use the version that sounds most natural to you.</p>

<p>Let’s look at another example.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eng_to_ipa</span><span>(</span><span>preprocess</span><span>(</span><span>'Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!'</span><span>),</span> <span>retrieve_all</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html">['wɛl ɪf jur ʃʊr bɛtər bi gryffindor*', 'wɛl ɪf jʊr ʃʊr bɛtər bi gryffindor*']</code></pre></figure>

<p>The word <code>gryffindor</code> was not found in the CMU dictionary, which can be expected.
After a quick search for the word’s pronunciation I found <a href="https://youglish.com/pronounce/gryffindor/english">YouGlish</a>
which uses YouTube videos to find IPAs. While their API is not free, a limited number of IPA’s can be scraped

<p>I have shown that for many words there are several possible pronunciations, from which you need to choose
your preferred one, and that some words are not in the CMU dictionary and
require scraping the IPA from another source or are not available at all.
For these 2 reasons, you will need to build your own personal IPA dictionary.</p>

<p>I’m going to build my IPA dictionary by iterating through the words of the Harry Potter books
and adding each word and the corresponding IPA to my dictionary.</p>

<p>First, I define
some functions for managing my dictionary (a simple JSON file in this case).</p>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>Feedback loops are so important. (If you’re not sure what that is, I’d recommend <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781603580557">“Thinking in Systems”</a>.) </p>



<p>These loops help systems improve. If you don’t have feedback, you’ll improve more slowly, in my experience. Why? Because you won’t know what you are doing that is good and what is garbage. It’s really hard to evaluate that kind of stuff yourself. You can do it, it just takes time and perspective.</p>



<p>And of course, you want to do more of what is good. Here are some kinds of feedback loops which have helped me.</p>



<ul><li>tests</li><li>one to ones</li><li>public writing</li><li>being a contractor</li></ul>



<p>Automated tests are a really tight feedback loop. You can make changes to code and know if you’ve blown things up. (Type systems are another tight feedback loop preferred by some.) This is helpful in many situations, including when you are <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/01/20/on-debugging/">debugging a problem</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/03/16/how-to-manage-one-to-ones/">One to ones</a> are a great way to gather feedback from your manager on problems, challenges and situations that you have faced. By doing it in a one to one (rather than a one off meeting), you’ll build context and history around these. After all, the tenth time you bring up the fact you find front-end development challenging indicates that this is a pattern, and you should evolve yourself or the position to help with the challenge. When you have your meeting, make sure you ask for feedback explicitly. When you get it, avoid being defensive. If you make it hard to get feedback, you’ll get less.</p>



<p>Public writing, especially <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2018/12/10/start-a-blog/">a blog</a>, is a great way to get feedback. You’ll be able to put your thoughts out in public. This can be scary and frustrating; some communities are more gentle about feedback than others. But the act of writing forces you to make the implicit explicit. And sharing that knowledge is a great way to get feedback. (Even a lack of response is feedback; what you were writing didn’t resonated with the audience you shared it with.)</p>



<p>I think everyone should <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2018/11/12/try-contracting/">try being a contractor</a>. First it makes you appreciative of everyone else in a business, because when you are contracting, you often have to take on roles outside of development (sales, accounting, marketing). But for the purposes of this post, contracting is a great way to get feedback from the market. You’ll learn about which skills are in demand and what organizations will pay for those skills. Of course, you can find this out as an employee, but if you are a contractor, especially a short term one, you’ll be interacting with possible hiring managers much more often than as an employee. And the feedback loop is brutal and blunt: do they hire you or not. </p>



<p>Feedback loops are a key way to find out whether what you are doing is working or not. Seek them out. </p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>
