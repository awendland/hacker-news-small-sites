<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <p>We, humans, tend to have a very tough time taking breaks and regenerating. We tend to set for ourself goals that are either too hard to achieve or straight up take too much of our time.</p>
<p>We have all been there. We decide to learn an additional skill, or we decided to lose that last weight that has been bringing us down.</p>
<p>The problem starts when we have outlined the goal, and we decide on the path of reaching it. We get motivated to start by motion which as a result, at the beginning we fill that we are superhumans. That can cause you to overestimate your free time and capabilities.</p>
<p>How many of us quit the gym completely, just because going there every day was not sustainable? How many of us stopped learning a new language because cramming study sessions on the weekends is not healthy and neither fun? Raise your hands. I know that I did both of those.</p>
<p>I have been a victim for underestimating how much time could the task take and the effort that will be required to finish it. I am <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/why-small-habits-11-12-2020">raising a hand for that.</a></p>
<h2>How human usually deal with no energy</h2>
<p>So if you constantly do something too challenging, you are draining your energy instead of getting the boost of cognitive resources. That, of course, can not go forever and at one point you will realise that you are not able to do the task and even the idea of starting makes you want to do anything, but that.</p>
<p>That is the point at which people can either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit</li>
<li>Preserver and quit in a week</li>
<li>Take a break and quit in a month</li>
<li>Change the task completely so that it is sustainable</li>
</ol>
<p>As you could imagine, the 4th option is the optimal one. But it is also the one that is chosen the least. </p>
<p>If you have driven yourself to the point of hate, it will be tough to make you like the habit ever again.</p>
<p>The worst part of our lives is that this is an essential step in understanding how to become more efficient. I don’t know a single person that has become productive and coincidentally achieved greatness in life but hasn’t burned out at least once.</p>
<p>Why is that? It seems to start small and improve everything with little steps(which is <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-58565-5_6">proven to be the best way to achieve great goals</a>), you have to fail in achieving something couple of times.</p>
<p>This knowledge is not programmed into our brain or genes. That is why we need to learn on our own mistakes to understand the right course of actions.</p>
<h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
<p>I understand that some people don’t want to do anything that is not immediately satisfactory. I understand that good habits are boring and not fun at all. </p>
<p>The main reason they are not fun is that the effect and the result are postponed so much into the future that our brain, due to smartphones and social media, has been reprogrammed to expect low-cost dopamine hits in everything that we do. </p>
<p>Why do people still perform good, boring habits, then?</p>
<p>Because in the long run, the total amount of dopamine that you get will increase with every time you do the task, and eventually it will snowball into the most amazing feeling you will ever experience.</p>
<p>Writing a chapter of a book is boring and most likely is <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/when-productivity-increases">extremely unrewarding</a>. You spent your time researching, writing and editing. It was super boring and maybe even painful. There is literally no dopamine there.</p>
<p>But, once you write your book, the combined effect of all the sessions will hit your right in the face with the most amazing and happy feeling ever. Maybe even that book will let you retire and become the happiest human on earth, who knows?</p>
<p><img alt="progress vs happiness" src="https://i.gyazo.com/ee36f0c65178aca1860c7e924f182fc2.png"></p>
<p>The thing is that every good habit is like this. Don’t underestimate what you can achieve by just doing <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/impact-through-motion">the right thing, consistently.</a></p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en-GB" dir="ltr"><div><p>Tacit functions apply to implicit arguments. This is in contrast to the explicit use of arguments in <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dfns" title="Dfns">dfns</a> (<code dir="ltr"><span>⍺</span> <span>⍵</span></code>) and <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Tradfns" title="Tradfns">tradfns</a> (which have named arguments). Some APL dialects allow to combine functions into <b>trains</b> following a small set of rules. This allows creating complex derived functions without specifying any arguments explicitly.
</p><p>Known dialects which implement trains are <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dyalog_APL" title="Dyalog APL">Dyalog APL</a>, <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dzaima/APL" title="Dzaima/APL">dzaima/APL</a>, <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Ngn/apl" title="Ngn/apl">ngn/apl</a> and <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/NARS2000" title="NARS2000">NARS2000</a>.
</p>


<h2><span id="Primitives">Primitives</span></h2>
<p>All <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Primitive_functions" title="Primitive functions">primitive functions</a> are tacit. Some APLs allow primitive functions to be named.
</p>
<div dir="ltr"><pre><span></span>      <span>plus</span> <span>←</span> <span>+</span>
      <span>times</span> <span>←</span> <span>×</span>
      <span>6</span> <span>times</span> <span>3</span> <span>plus</span> <span>5</span>
<span>48</span>
</pre></div>
<h2><span id="Derived_functions">Derived functions</span></h2>
<p>Functions derived from a monadic operator and an operand, or from a dyadic operator and two operands are tacit functions:
</p>
<div dir="ltr"><pre><span></span>      <span>Sum</span> <span>←</span> <span>+</span><span>/</span>
      <span>Sum</span> <span>⍳</span><span>10</span>
<span>55</span>

      <span>Dot</span> <span>←</span> <span>+</span><span>.</span><span>×</span>
      <span>3</span> <span>1</span> <span>4</span> <span>dot</span> <span>2</span> <span>7</span> <span>1</span>
<span>17</span>
</pre></div>
<h2><span id="Derived_operators">Derived operators</span></h2>
<p>A dyadic operator with its right operand forms a tacit monadic operator:
</p>
<div dir="ltr"><pre><span></span>      <span>1</span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span>⍣</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>10</span>
<span>12</span>
      <span>Twice</span> <span>←</span> <span>⍣</span><span>2</span>
      <span>1</span> <span>+</span><span>Twice</span> <span>10</span>
<span>12</span>
</pre></div>
<h2><span id="Trains">Trains</span></h2>
<p>A train is a series of functions in isolation. An isolated function is either surrounded by parentheses or named. Below, <code dir="ltr"><span>⍺</span></code> and <code dir="ltr"><span>⍵</span></code> refer to the arguments of the train. <code dir="ltr"><span>f</span></code>, <code dir="ltr"><span>g</span></code>, and <code dir="ltr"><span>h</span></code> are functions (which themselves can be tacit or not), and <code dir="ltr"><span>A</span></code> is an array. The arguments are processed by the following rules:
</p>
<h3><span id="Forks">Forks</span></h3>
<p>A 3-train is a <i>fork</i>:
</p>

<p>The <i>left tine</i> of a fork can be an array:
</p>

<h3><span id="Atops">Atops</span></h3>
<p>A 2-train is an <i>atop</i>:
</p>

<p>Only <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dzaima/APL" title="Dzaima/APL">dzaima/APL</a> allows <code dir="ltr"><span>(</span><span>A</span> <span>h</span><span>)</span></code>, which it treats as <code dir="ltr"><span>A</span><span>∘</span><span>h</span></code>.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> See <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Bind" title="Bind">Bind</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Debugging">Debugging</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dyalog_APL" title="Dyalog APL">Dyalog APL</a>, analysis of trains is assisted by a <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/User_command" title="User command">user command</a> <code dir="ltr"><span>]</span><span>Boxing</span> <span>on</span></code>. This is achieved by executing the command <code dir="ltr"><span>]</span><span>Boxing</span> <span>on</span></code> and then entering a train without any parameters. A structure of the train will be displayed.
</p><p>For example, the "accursed train" from the section below can be analysed like this:
</p>
<div dir="ltr"><pre><span></span>      <span>]</span><span>Boxing</span> <span>on</span>
<span>Was</span> <span>OFF</span>
      <span>((</span><span>+</span><span>.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>⊢~</span><span>∘.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>)</span><span>1</span><span>↓⍳</span><span>)</span>     <span>⍝ the train to be analysed</span>

<span>└───────────────────────────────┴───────┘</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, a train can be represented in form of a tree:
</p>
<div dir="ltr"><pre><span></span>      <span>]</span><span>Boxing</span> <span>on</span> <span>-</span><span>trains</span><span>=</span><span>tree</span>

     <span>┌───┴───┐</span>  
   <span>┌─┴─┐</span>   <span>┌─┼─┐</span>
   <span>⍨</span> <span>┌─┼─┐</span> <span>1</span> <span>↓</span> <span>⍳</span>
 <span>┌─┘</span> <span>⊢</span> <span>~</span> <span>⍨</span>      
 <span>.</span>     <span>┌─┘</span>      
<span>┌┴┐</span>    <span>.</span>        
<span>+</span> <span>×</span>   <span>┌┴┐</span>       
      <span>∘</span> <span>×</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Or fully parenthesised:
</p>
<div dir="ltr"><pre><span></span>      <span>]</span><span>Boxing</span> <span>on</span> <span>-</span><span>trains</span><span>=</span><span>parens</span>
<span>Was</span> <span>OFF</span> <span>-</span><span>trains</span><span>=</span><span>box</span>
      <span>((</span><span>+</span><span>.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>⊢~</span><span>∘.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>)</span><span>1</span><span>↓⍳</span><span>)</span>     <span>⍝ the train to be analysed</span>
<span>(((</span><span>+</span><span>.</span><span>×</span><span>)</span><span>⍨</span><span>)(</span><span>⊢~</span><span>((</span><span>∘.</span><span>×</span><span>)</span><span>⍨</span><span>)))(</span><span>1</span><span>↓⍳</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<h2><span id="Examples">Examples</span></h2>
<p>One of the major benefits of tacit programming is the ability to convey a short, well-defined idea as an isolated expression. This aids both human readability (<a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Semantic_density" title="Semantic density">semantic density</a>) and the computer's ability to interpret code, potentially executing special code for particular <a href="https://aplwiki.com/index.php?title=Idiom&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Idiom (page does not exist)">idioms</a>.

Similarly, <code dir="ltr"><span>(</span><span>+</span><span>.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>⊢~</span><span>∘.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>)</span></code> is also a 4-train and interpreted as the atop <code dir="ltr"><span>+</span><span>.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>(</span><span>⊢~</span><span>∘.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>)</span></code>. 
</p><p>Thus the accursed train is interpreted as <code dir="ltr"><span>((</span><span>+</span><span>.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>(</span><span>⊢~</span><span>∘.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>))(</span><span>1</span><span>↓⍳</span><span>))</span><span>17</span></code>. Having read the train, we now evaluate it monadically.
</p>
<div dir="ltr"><pre><span></span>      <span>((</span><span>+</span><span>.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>(</span><span>⊢~</span><span>∘.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>))(</span><span>1</span><span>↓⍳</span><span>))</span><span>17</span> <span>⍝ Accursed train as an atop over a fork atop a fork</span>

<p>Note that <code dir="ltr"><span>((</span><span>⊢</span><span>⍨∘.</span><span>×</span><span>⍨</span><span>)</span><span>1</span><span>↓⍳</span><span>)</span></code> is a train computing primes up to the given input.

December 11, 2020 | http://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/bit-manipulation-with-c-20 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/bit-manipulation-with-c-20">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent">
				<p>This post concludes my presentation of library features in C++20. Today I write about the class<code> std::source_location</code> and a few functions for bit manipulation.</p>

<h2 id="h1-std-source-location"><img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/BitManipulation/TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage2.png" alt="TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage2" width="650" height="265"><code>std::source_location</code></h2>
<p><code>std::source_location</code> represents information about the source code. This information includes file names, line numbers, and function names. The information is precious when you need information about the call site, such as for debugging, logging, or testing purposes. The class <code>std::source_location</code> is the better alternative for the predefined C++11 macros <code>__FILE__</code> and<code> __LINE__</code> and should, therefore, be used.</p>
<p>The following table shows the interface of <code>std::source_location</code>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/BitManipulation/sourceLocation.png" alt="sourceLocation" width="500" height="161"></p>
<p>The call <code>std::source_location::current()</code> creates a new source location object<code> src. sr</code>c represents the information of the call site. Now, no C++ compiler supports <code>std::source_location</code>. Consequently, the following program <code>sourceLocation.cpp</code> is from <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/source_location">cppreference.com/source_location</a>.</p>

<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->
<div>
<pre><span>// sourceLocation.cpp</span>
<span>// from cppreference.com</span>

<span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
<span>#include &lt;string_view&gt;</span>
<span>#include &lt;source_location&gt;</span>
 
<span>void</span> <span>log</span>(std<span>::</span>string_view message,
         <span>const</span> std<span>::</span>source_location<span>&amp;</span> location <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>source_location<span>::</span>current())
{
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"info:"</span>
              <span>&lt;&lt;</span> location.file_name() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>':'</span>
              <span>&lt;&lt;</span> location.line() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>' '</span>
              <span>&lt;&lt;</span> message <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;
}
 
<span>int</span> <span>main</span>()
{
    log(<span>"Hello world!"</span>);  <span>// info:main.cpp:19 Hello world!</span>
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>The output of the program is part of its source code.</p>
<p>C++20 makes it quite comfortable to access or manipulate bits or bit sequences.</p>
<h2 id="h2-bit-manipulation">Bit Manipulation</h2>
<p>Thanks to the new type std::endian, you get the endianness of a scalar type.</p>
<h3 id="h2-1-endianness">Endianness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Endianness can be big-endian or little-endian. Big-endian means that the most significant byte comes first; little-endian means that the least significant byte comes first.</li>
<li>A scalar type is either an arithmetic type, an <code>enum</code>, a pointer, a member pointer, or a <code>std::nullptr_t</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The class <code>endian</code> provides the endianness of all scalar types:</p>
<div>
<pre><span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>endian</span>
{
    little <span>=</span> <span>/*implementation-defined*/</span>,
    big    <span>=</span> <span>/*implementation-defined*/</span>,
    native <span>=</span> <span>/*implementation-defined*/</span>
};
</pre>
</div>

<ul>
<li>If all scalar types are little-endian, <code>std::endian::native</code> is equal to <code>std::endian::little</code>.</li>
<li>If all scalar types are big-endian,<code> std::endian::native</code> is equal <code>to std::endian::big</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even corner cases are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>If all scalar types have <code>sizeof</code> 1 and therefore endianness does not matter; the values of the enumerators <code>std::endian::little</code>, <code>std::endian::big</code>, and <code>std::endian::native</code> are identical.</li>
<li>If the platform uses mixed endianness, <code>std::endian::native</code> is neither equal to <code>std::endian::big</code> nor <code>std::endian::little</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I perform the following program <code>getEndianness.cpp</code> on an x86 architecture, I get the answer little-endian.</p>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre><span>// getEndianness.cpp</span>

<span>#include &lt;bit&gt;</span>
<span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {

    <span>if</span> constexpr (std<span>::</span>endian<span>::</span>native <span>==</span> std<span>::</span>endian<span>::</span>big) {
        std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"big-endian"</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;
    }
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> constexpr (std<span>::</span>endian<span>::</span>native <span>==</span> std<span>::</span>endian<span>::</span>little) {
        std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"little-endian"</span>  <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;      <span>// little-endian</span>
    }

}
</pre>
</div>

<p><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/if"><code>constexpr if</code></a> enables it to compile source code conditionally. This means that the compilation depends on the endianness of your architecture.

<p>The following table gives you the first overview of all functions.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/BitManipulation/bitInterface5.png" alt="bitInterface5" width="600" height="222"></p>

<p>The functions except of <code>std::bit_cast</code> require an unsigned integer type (<code>unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long,</code> or<code> unsigned long long</code>).</p>
<p>The program<code> bit.cpp</code> shows the usage of the functions.</p>

<h2 id="h3-what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>Additionally to coroutines, C++20 has much to offer for concurrency First, C++20 has new atomics. The new atomics exists for floating-point values and smart pointers. C++20 also enables waiting on atomics. To coordinate threads, semaphore, latches, and barriers come into play. Also, the <code>std::thread</code> was improved with <code>std::jthread</code>. The execution of a&nbsp;<code>std::jthread </code>can be interrupted and joins automatically in its destructor.<code><br></code></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>Colab is one of the best products to come from Google. It has made GPUs freely accessible to learners and practitioners like me who otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford a high-end GPU.</p>
<p>While the interface is very easy to use, there are many lesser-known and undocumented features in colab. In this post, I will share those features that I’ve discovered from basic usage and their official talks.</p>
<h2 id="1-scratchpad-notebook">1. Scratchpad Notebook</h2>
<p>It’s a pretty common scenario that we have a bunch of cluttered untitled notebooks created when we try out temporary stuff on colab.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-clutter.png" alt="Clutter of Untitled Notebooks in Colab"><br>
To solve this, you can bookmark the link given below. It will open a special <strong>scratch notebook</strong> and any changes you make to that notebook are not saved to your main account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/empty.ipynb">https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/empty.ipynb</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="2-timing-execution-of-cell">2. Timing Execution of Cell</h2>
<p>It’s pretty common that we manually calculate the difference between start and end times of a piece of code to gauge the time taken.</p>
<p>Colab provides an inbuilt feature to do this. After a cell is executed, just hover over the cell run icon and you will get an estimate of the execution time taken.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-cell-hover.png" alt="Execution Time by hovering on run cell"></p>
<h2 id="3-run-part-of-a-cell">3. Run part of a cell</h2>
<p>You can also run only a part of the cell by selecting it and pressing the <code>Runtime &gt; Run Selection</code> button or using the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl + Shift + Enter</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-run-few-lines.gif" alt="Running specific line in colab"></p>
<h2 id="4-jupyter-notebook-keyboard-shortcuts">4. Jupyter Notebook Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>If you are familiar with keyboard shortcuts from Jupyter Notebook, they don’t work directly in Colab. But I found a mental model to map between them.</p>
<p>Just add <code>Ctrl + M</code> before whatever keyboard shortcut you were using in Jupyter. This rule of thumb works for the majority of common use-cases.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Action</th>
<th>Jupyter Notebook</th>
<th>Google Colab</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Add a cell above</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>Ctrl + <strong>M</strong> + A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Add a cell below</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>Ctrl + <strong>M</strong> + B</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>See all keyboard shorcuts</td>
<td>H</td>
<td>Ctrl + <strong>M</strong> + H</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Change cell to code</td>
<td>Y</td>
<td>Ctrl + <strong>M</strong> + Y</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Change cell to markdown</td>
<td>M</td>
<td>Ctrl + <strong>M</strong> + M</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interrupt the kernel</td>
<td>II</td>
<td>Ctrl + <strong>M</strong> + I</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delete a cell</td>
<td>DD</td>
<td>Ctrl + <strong>M</strong> + D</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Checkpoint notebook</td>
<td>Ctrl + S</td>
<td>Ctrl + <strong>M</strong> + S</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Below are some notable exceptions to this rule for which either the shortcut is changed completely or kept the same.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Action</th>
<th>Jupyter Notebook</th>
<th>Google Colab</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Restart runtime</td>
<td>00</td>

</tbody>

<h2 id="5-jump-to-class-definition">5. Jump to Class Definition</h2>
<p>Similar to an IDE, you can go to a class definition by pressing <code>Ctrl</code> and then clicking a class name. For example, here we view the class definition of the Dense layer in Keras by pressing Ctrl and then clicking the <code>Dense</code> class name.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-goto-class.gif" alt="Demo of jumping to class definition"></p>
<h2 id="6-open-notebooks-from-github">6. Open Notebooks from GitHub</h2>
<p>The Google Colab team provides an official chrome extension to open notebooks on GitHub directly on colab. You can install it from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo">here</a>.</p>
<p>After installation, click the colab icon on any GitHub notebook to open it directly.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-from-github.png" alt="Extension for opening github notebook in colab"></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also manually open any GitHub notebook by replacing <code>github.com</code> with <code>colab.research.google.com/github</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>https://<strong>github.com</strong>/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/00_notebook_tutorial.ipynb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>https://<strong>colab.research.google.com/github</strong>/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/00_notebook_tutorial.ipynb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An even easier way is to replace <code>github.com</code> with <code>githubtocolab.com</code>. It will redirect you to a colab notebook.</p>

<h2 id="7-run-flask-apps-from-colab">7. Run Flask apps from Colab</h2>
<p>With a library called <a href="https://github.com/gstaff/flask-ngrok">flask-ngrok</a>, you can easily expose a Flask web app running on colab to demo prototypes. First, you need to install <code>flask</code> and <code>flask-ngrok</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>!</span><span>pip</span> <span>install</span> <span>flask</span><span>-</span><span>ngrok</span> <span>flask</span><span>==</span><span>0.12</span><span>.</span><span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, you just need to pass your flask app object to <code>run_with_ngrok</code> function and it will expose a ngrok endpoint when the server is started.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>Flask</span>
<span>from</span> <span>flask_ngrok</span> <span>import</span> <span>run_with_ngrok</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>Flask</span><span>(</span><span>__name__</span><span>)</span>
<span>run_with_ngrok</span><span>(</span><span>app</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>route</span><span>(</span><span>'/'</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>hello</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>'Hello World!'</span>

<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>'__main__'</span><span>:</span>
    <span>app</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-flask.png" alt="Example of running flask-ngrok"></p>
<p>You can try this out from the package author’s <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/gstaff/flask-ngrok/blob/master/examples/flask_ngrok_example.ipynb">official example</a> on Colab.</p>
<h2 id="8-switch-between-tensorflow-versions">8. Switch between Tensorflow versions</h2>
<p>You can easily switch between Tensorflow 1 and Tensorflow 2 using this magic flag. <br>
To switch to Tensorflow 1.15.2, use this command:</p>

<p>To switch to Tensorflow 2.2, run this command:</p>

<p>You will need to restart the runtime for the effect to take place. Colab recommends using the pre-installed Tensorflow version instead of installing it from <code>pip</code> for performance reasons.</p>
<h2 id="9-tensorboard-integration">9. Tensorboard Integration</h2>
<p>Colab also provides a magic command to use Tensorboard directly from the notebook. You just need to set the logs directory location using the <code>--logdir</code> flag. You can learn to use it from the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/docs/tensorboard_in_notebooks.ipynb">official notebook</a>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>%</span><span>load_ext</span> <span>tensorboard</span>
<span>%</span><span>tensorboard</span> <span>--</span><span>logdir</span> <span>logs</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-tensorboard.png" alt="Embedded Tensorboard in Colab"></p>
<h2 id="10-gauge-resource-limits">10. Gauge resource limits</h2>
<p>Colab provides the following specs for their free and pro versions. Based on your use case, you can switch to the pro version at $10/month if you need a better runtime, GPU, and memory.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Version</th>

<p>You can view the GPU you have been assigned by running the following command</p>

<p>For information on the CPU, you can run this command</p>

<p>Similarly, you can view the RAM capacity by running</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="11-use-interactive-shell">11. Use interactive shell</h2>
<p>There is no built-in interactive terminal in Colab. But you can use the <code>bash</code> command to try out shell commands interactively. Just run this command and you will get an interactive input.</p>

<p>Now, you can run any shell command in the given input box.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-bash.png" alt="Using interactive shell in colab"></p>
<p>To quit from the shell, just type <code>exit</code> in the input box.</p>

<h2 id="12-current-memory-and-storage-usage">12. Current memory and storage usage</h2>
<p>Colab provides an indicator of RAM and disk usage. If you hover over the indicator, you will get a popup with the current usage and the total capacity.</p>

			<p><span>T</span>he one law of physics that virtually all scientists believe will never be found to be wrong is the second law of thermodynamics. Despite this exalted status, it has long been associated with a great mystery and a bleak implication. The mystery is that all the known laws of nature except one do not distinguish a temporal direction. The second law, however, asserts the existence of an all-powerful unidirectionality in the way all events throughout the universe unfold. According to standard accounts, the second law says that entropy, described as a measure of disorder, will always (with at most small fluctuations) increase. That’s the rub: Time has an arrow that points to heat death.</p><p>Surprisingly, evidence that a more nuanced account is needed is hiding in plain sight: the universe itself. Very soon after the Big Bang, the universe was in an extremely uniform state, which since then has become ever more varied and structured. Even if uniformity equates to order, that initial state was surely bland and dull. And who can see disorder in the fabulously structured galaxies or the colors and shapes of the trees in the fall? In fact, the sequence in which two of the greatest discoveries in science were made resolves the paradox: The second law was discovered eight decades before the expansion of the universe.</p><figure data-alt="Barbour_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17977_f1b4a1e8b4c12f7c7f2e390c76b4cc12.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>BOTH SIDES NOW:</strong> Two people walking down opposite sides of Mount Fuji would see the terrain change in much the same way. To author Julian Barbour, the hikers’ perceptions offers an apt analogy for how beings on either side of what he calls a “Janus Point” in the universe would experience moving orderly in time.</span><span>Martina Badini / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>The time lag is critical for one simple reason. The laws of thermodynamics, discovered in 1850 by William Thomson (later ennobled to Lord Kelvin) and Rudolf Clausius, emerged from a brilliant study that Sadi Carnot (son of Napoleon’s greatest general) published in 1824. In a slim booklet that laid out all but one of the foundational principles of thermodynamics, he sought to establish the maximum efficiency steam engines could achieve. Steam engines can only function if their working medium is confined in a cylinder. This led all early work on thermodynamics to be based on systems in a conceptual box. Clausius’s discovery and definition of entropy—one of the wonders of science—relied totally on infinitesimal changes from one equilibrium state of a confined system to another. The pioneers of statistical mechanics, the theoretical framework created above all by Clausius, James Clerk Maxwell, and Ludwig Boltzmann to provide a microscopic atomistic explanation of phenomenological thermodynamics, invariably considered models of gas molecules trapped in a box and forced to bounce off its walls and each other.<br></p><p>A rich conceptual framework, completely valid and immensely fruitful for confined systems, developed out of this simple model, and reached its definitive form in the work of J. Willard Gibbs. The model proved the existence of atoms and molecules, established their sizes, determined the incredible number of them in a grain of sand, and struck the death knell of Newtonian classical physics. That was when Planck discovered the first quantum effect in 1900. What’s more, both the first and second law appeared to be founded on a rock-solid principle: the impossibility of creating perpetual motion machines.</p><blockquote><p>I don’t deny the arrow of time. But the “box mentality” has led us to misunderstand what is happening in the universe.</p> </blockquote><p>It’s therefore not surprising that few, if any, scientists have disagreed with the great astrophysicist Arthur Eddington’s warning, “If your theory is found to be against the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation.” Einstein, surely a greater scientist than Eddington, was more cautious. A few years before his death, Einstein said of thermodynamics, “It is the only physical theory of universal content which I am convinced that, within the framework of applicability of its basic concepts, will never be overthrown.” The caveat is all important: Do conditions in an expanding universe remain within the framework of applicability?<br></p><p>That is what I question. I don’t suggest we can ever alter the facts that Thomson and Clausius first brought to light. Neither you nor I are going to get younger or see a shattered cup miraculously reassemble itself and jump back onto the table. There is a pervasive unidirectionality, an arrow of time, about the way things happen in the universe. Kelvin, the first to recognize its significance, called it “a universal tendency in nature to the dissipation of mechanical energy.” I don’t deny the existence of the arrow, but I do suggest that the “box mentality” has led us to misunderstand what is happening in the universe and even blinded us to the beauty that it is creating. A one-way street need not lead to a scrap yard; it might bring us to a finely landscaped park.</p><p>Compare two situations. First, the molecules in their box. If, every now and then, you open it to look at them, you can be sure to find them filling the box uniformly and going through their habitual routine—bumping into each other with random outcomes. Nothing of interest develops. This, nevertheless, was the model used to interpret mundane measurements of pressure and temperature. It led to all those marvelous discoveries and much of the technology on which today we so depend. No wonder it inspired confidence.</p><p>But now picture the box in space with its walls suddenly removed. What will the molecules do? The answer’s in Siegfried Sassoon’s poem “Everyone Sang”:</p><p>As prisoned birds must find in freedom, Winging wildly across the white<br>Orchards and dark-green fields; on – on – and out of sight.</p><p>In mathematical rather than poetic terms, the molecules soon cease to interact and fly apart, maintaining forever their release velocities and getting ever further from each other. In fact, a simple calculation may surprise you: The speed with which the molecules move apart approximates ever better the law of galactic recession that Hubble announced in 1929. This simple Big Bang model does not look like disorder on the increase.</p><p><span>T</span>here is a greater mismatch between entropic disorder and reality in the very heart of Newton’s theory of universal gravitation. He achieved fame by explaining not only Kepler’s laws of planetary motion but also the fall of an apple. However, the problem of three bodies—he had in mind the earth, sun, and moon moving in their mutual gravitational fields—gave him headaches. Although a famously difficult problem, in 1772 the great mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange made some progress, including a significant discovery about the behavior of a “three-body universe” that was later shown to be true for any number of bodies. It concerns what is now called the center-of-mass moment of inertia, <i>I</i>. This measures the extent of the system—for bees it would be about the diameter of a swarm—and behaves in a characteristic universal way if a single condition is satisfied: The total energy of the system is not negative.</p><blockquote><p>The beauty is in the ratios, and they persist forever even in the expanding universe.</p> </blockquote><p>To understand what the behavior is, assume with Newton that time flows forever forward from past to future. Then what Lagrange found is that <i>I</i> decreases from infinity in the distant past, passes through a unique minimum, and grows to infinity in the distant future. I call this unique minimum a Janus Point. The Roman divinity can be invoked because he looks simultaneously in two opposite directions of time at once. What he sees is striking. In the region around the threshold on which he traditionally stands, the distribution of the particles (especially when there are many) is more uniform than anywhere else on the timeline of the universe. Then, in both directions, the particles cluster, taking on a shape that is more ordered and forming “galaxies.” From his vantage point, Janus can see this, but if you, being a mere mortal, were in such a universe you would necessarily be on one or the other side of the Janus point and could not “see through it” to the other side. You would find that the laws of nature around you do not distinguish a direction of time but that your universe gets ever more clumpy in one direction.</p><p>There is a precise, mathematically significant quantity that may be called complexity and increases (with small fluctuations) in both directions from Janus. The big difference from what entropy does is that growth of complexity reflects an increase of order, not disorder. The effects in confined and unconfined systems are the exact opposites of each other. Moreover, the increase of complexity in unconfined systems follows directly from the governing dynamical law whereas entropy increases in confined systems for statistical reasons.</p><div>

</div><p>Traditional arguments assume that somehow, for an as yet unfathomable reason, the universe gets in a special state of low entropy and correspondingly high order that is then remorselessly destroyed. A model often given is molecules confined to a little box in the corner of a big box. That’s the special initial condition. Now lift the lid of the little box; the laws of dynamics allow two quite different outcomes. It’s conceivable, but barely so, that the molecules will collect in the corner of the little box and then be in an even more special state. But it is statistically more likely that the molecules will spread out into the large box and eventually fill it uniformly. This is a statistical explanation of the entropic arrow. Applied to the whole universe, a special initial condition of this kind has been dubbed the “Past Hypothesis” by the philosopher of science David Albert. The difficulty is that nothing in the known laws of nature explains the special initial condition.</p><p><span>L</span>et’s now think about the Janus point. It’s unique and a special point.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The regex literals optimization avoids running the regex engine on parts of the input text that cannot possibly ever match the regex.</p>

<p>An example of a regex this can be applied to is <code>\w+@\w+\.\w+</code>, where the algorithm <em>quickly</em> finds the first <code>@</code>, then matches <code>\w+</code> backwards to find the start of the match, and then matches <code>\w+\.\w+</code> forward to find the end of the match. It then finds the second <code>@</code>, starting from the end of the previous match, and so on. This is a fairly naive (and incorrect) implementation, but it gives the idea of how it works.</p>

<p>I’ve recently implemented it in my pet project <a href="https://github.com/nitely/nim-regex/pull/68">nim-regex</a>, an NFA based regex engine that runs in (super)linear time. The results show it’s around ~100x faster than before in some benchmarks. It’s up to ~60x faster than PCRE when the optimization kicks in. The tests are based on <a href="https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark">mariomka/regex-benchmark</a>.</p>

<p>This is not to be confused with <em>Chivers’ String Prefix Optimization</em>.</p>

<h2 id="literals-optimization">Literals Optimization</h2>

<p>Since nim-regex has to guarantee linear time, I’ll describe optimizations that are guaranteed to take linear time. We must also ensure the matches are not overlapped.</p>

<p>Here’s a high-level description of the algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We pick a literal that is <code>memchr</code>‘ed to skip parts of the text.</li>
  <li>The prefix is the regex part before the literal; none of the
characters or symbols within the prefix must match the literal.</li>
  <li>The prefix is ran backwards to find the start of the match.</li>
  <li>A full scan is ran from the start of the match
until a character that cannot be matched is found (safe break point)
or the end is reached. The scan tries to start the match at every character (NFAs can do this in linear time).</li>
  <li>Go to step one and repeat from the last scanned char. Make the prefix
match until the previous last scanned char.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two important constraints to picking a literal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“none of the characters or symbols within the prefix must match the literal”</em>, why? consider the regex: <code>\d\w+x</code>, and the input text: <code>xxxxxxxxxxx</code>; this would take quadratic time, as the prefix will match until the start of the string every time. What about the limit? while the limit does avoid the excessive matching, sometimes we’d need to match past the limit, ex: regex: <code>\d\w+x</code>, and text: <code>1xxx</code>. If we add this constraint, the literal becomes a delimeter, and these cases are solved.</li>
  <li>The literal cannot be part of a repetition, nor it can be part of an alternation. For example: <code>(abc)*def</code> the first literal candidate is <code>d</code>, since <code>(abc)*</code> may or may not be part of the match. Same thing for alternations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the main algorithm in <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nim"><span>func</span> <span>findAll</span><span>(</span>
  <span>matches</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span> <span>Matches</span><span>,</span>

    <span>limit</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>  <span># rather pointless since the literal is a delimiter</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>litIdx</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>matchPrefix</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>regex</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>limit</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>:</span>
      <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>litIdx</span><span>+</span><span>1</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
      <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>findSome</span><span>(</span><span>matches</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>regex</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>matches</span><span>.</span><span>len</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>i</span>  <span># this is used as "start" to resume the matching</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A given character may be consumed only twice, once by the backward prefix match, and a second time by the forward scan. Hence the algorithm runs in linear time.</p>

<p>I may describe how <code>matchPrefix</code> and <code>findSome</code> work, how to construct the reversed NFA in the right order, and how to pick the literal in a future article. The nim-regex code contains descriptions of the algorithms, though.</p>

<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/nitely/nim-regex/tree/master/bench">benchmarks</a> regexes are based on <a href="https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark">mariomka/regex-benchmark</a>. The only difference is the regexes are pre-compiled, so just the matching is tested. The results show nim-regex is ~63x faster than PCRE in the email test, and ~2x faster in the URI and IP tests.</p>

<p>Why is nim-regex so fast in the email case? The regex engine doesn’t run as often. There are orders of magnitud more IP/URI candidates than email candidates (<code>@</code> chars within the text) to match. In the former case the time is dominated by the regex engine, while in the latter case it’s dominated by searching the char literal.</p>

  <p>Note Nim’s PCRE is at the top of the mariomka/regex-benchmark. I ran those benchmarks, and IIRC nim-regex was just a bit faster, mainly because the non-macro regex engine is slower (see the above results), and the regex compilation is also tested.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="other-optimizations">Other optimizations</h2>

<p>Here are other possible optimizations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Picking a literal —even if the prefix matches it— should take linear time as long as the prefix is bounded (i.e: does not contain repetitions), ex: <code>\d\wx</code>.</li>
  <li>Picking a literal within a “one or more” repetition/repetition group should be possible, since <code>(abc)+</code> matches the same as <code>abc(abc)*</code>.</li>
  <li>It’s better to pick the last literal within the first literal sequence, since that way we always try to match as many literals as possible early on, and potentially fail early. We want to keep the prefix regex as short as possible, so the picking a literal in the first sequence is best.</li>
  <li>Alternations can be optimized this very same way in some cases, ex: <code>bar|baz</code>, since both alternations have <code>ba</code> in common, <code>a</code> can be picked as the literal.</li>
  <li>Alternations can be optimized in other cases. PCRE seems to use <code>memchr</code> or similar for up to two alternation terms. A DFA could be used to quickly match candidates instead of <code>memchr</code>, as that’s a more general solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Literals optimization is not a general optimization as it does not work on every regex, but when it does, it can greatly improve the matching speed.</p>

<p>Can a backtracker like PCRE implement this? PCRE in particular already has some sort of similar optimization, but it’s not as good/fast as this one. Backtrackers cannot implement this as described here exactly, but they can do something similar that requires backtracking. If they provide a resumable <code>find</code> function, then probably yes.</p>

<p>Hopefully, more regex engines will implement these sort of optimizations, so they are more compelling alternatives to backtrackers such as PCRE.</p>

<p>While listening to a <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/12/02/bgp-with-andree-toonk/">podcast discussing BGP</a> I heard the fact that AWS owns more than $2B worth of IP addresses. I knew AWS was massive but this came as a big shock so I decided to do some digging around. I came across a <a href="https://ipv4marketgroup.com/ipv4-pricing/">site</a> that listed the market prices of IP addresses and the range looks to be anywhere from $20 to $30 per IP depending on the block size. Now it was time to figure out the IP addresses owned by Amazon. I figured this would be difficult but lucky for us AWS actually <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">publishes</a> their entire set of IP addresses as JSON.</p>

<p>The work is simply to download the JSON and then convert the CIDR blocks to the number of IPs and add them all up. As of today, December 11, 2020 AWS self reports owning 109,847,486 IPV4 addresses - at a price of $20 this is almost $2.2B and at $30 it’s almost $3.3B. That’s wild.</p>

<p>This is the date that I, <a href="https://twitter.com/itsdevdaniel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Lasek</a>, have launched Hustld. It's meant to be a community of business owners (specifically SaaS owners) who tell their story on how they got started. My goal was to target individuals who want to create their own companies and who might require guidence or inspiration from other entrepreneurs.&nbsp; I only got 5 interviews and soon after I decided I wanted to work on other projects. I closed down the server and stopped the site.</p>

<p>Here we are today. I remembered that I had purchased a server for a year on AWS and enjoyed when users visited Hustld to read business interviews. In addition I want to log my journey of Hustld and how I plan to grow it. I am turning Hustld into an "<a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-open-startup-f4446984189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open start up</a>". I will share all my progress on my twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/itsdevdaniel">@itsdevdaniel</a>) and write blogs on here. As of right now the site is not monetized in anyway but I do plan do add some sponsored posts, subscription and cool features in the future! My primary goal as of now isn't MRR (Monthly Reccuring Revenue) it is the # of interviews I can get per month. I am hoping to get at least 5 interviews before 2021 and 10 interviews in January 2021.</p>
<div><p>If you are a business owner (Saas preferred) and would like me to interview you <a href="https://hustld.com/contact">send me a message</a>.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information). These prior data serves as the constrains to the probability distribution.</p>



<p>Given the second law of thermodynamics (principle of increase of entropy), isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy, maximum entropy distributions become the most natural distributions under certain constrains. In this blog post, I would like to discuss entropy maximization and a couple of maximum entropy distributions.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="gaussian-integral">Gaussian Integral</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>I will skip the proof here, since the proof from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral">Wikipedia</a> is not that difficult to understand.</p>

<h4 id="useful-integrals">Useful Integrals</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} d(-x^2) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}\\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x d (e^{-x^2}) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( x e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \Big) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( 0 - \sqrt{\pi} \Big) \\
&amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Notice that here we used integral by parts.</p>

<h3 id="entropy-maximization">Entropy Maximization</h3>

<h4 id="discrete-probability-distribution">Discrete Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Suppose $P$ is a discrete probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further have some constrains on $P$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two constrains are trivial given $P$ is a probability distribution. The third constrain is optional and it indicates a constrain on the entire system. Notice that there could be more than one constrain if $m &gt; 1$.</p>



<p>We would like to maximize the entropy.</p><p>

\[\max_{P} H(P) = \max_{P} \Big( - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \Big)\]

</p><p>Letâ€™s try to solve this optimization problem. We would use Lagrange multiplier for the constrains.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) + \lambda_0 \Big(\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \sum_{x \in X}^{} \Big(P(x) r_i(x) - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) &amp;= \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)}\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="continuous-probability-distribution">Continuous Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Similarly, suppose $P$ is a continuous probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With the following constrains</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) dx = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, to maximize the entropy, we maximize the Lagrangian for the continuous case.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx + \lambda_0 \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$. We will also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a> to compute the derivative, which is slightly more complicated. Without going into all the details, we have the following derivatives.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \int_{X}^{} \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \big( P(x) \log P(x) \big)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } dx \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h3 id="maximum-entropy-distribution-examples">Maximum Entropy Distribution Examples</h3>

<h4 id="roll-dice">Roll Dice</h4>

<p>A conventional dice has 6 faces. $X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So, the maximum entropy probability distribution of getting each face of the dice is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{0} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 6 } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="uniform-distribution">Uniform Distribution</h4>

<p>The only constrain we put on a distribution is $X = [a, b]$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So the maximum entropy probability distribution is actually uniform distribution.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \int_{a}^{b} e^{0} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ b - a } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="gaussian-distribution">Gaussian Distribution</h4>

<p>We could also derive Gaussian Distribution using entropy maximization. The constrains for the maximum entropy distribution are</p>

<ul>
  <li>$X = (-\infty, \infty)$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x P(x) dx = \mu$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mathbb{E}[X]^2 = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mu^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 P(x) dx - \mu^2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul>

<p>which translates to</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m = 2$</li>
  <li>$r_1(x) = x$, $\alpha_1 = \mu$</li>
  <li>$r_2(x) = x^2$, $\alpha_2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \big( \lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2 \big) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \Big[ \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2^2} \Big] \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2} \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Here we assume $\lambda_2 &lt; 0$, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\

</div>


<p>SINGAPORE —&nbsp;Back in August, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with a group of economists in Beijing. “In the coming period, we will face more and more headwinds,” he <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-08/25/c_139314902.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">explained</a>, using unusually blunt language. Without naming names, Xi talked about China’s worsening trade and technology war with the United States under President Donald Trump, set against a backdrop of growing certainty in Beijing that America is bent on containing his nation’s geopolitical rise.</p>



<p>But then came the interesting part. “Since the beginning of this year, I have said on many occasions that we must promote the formation of a new development pattern, in which domestic and international cycles are the mainstay, and the domestic and international dual cycles promote each other,” Xi said. To an outsider, this might seem unremarkable, cloaked as it is in the elliptical phraseology that often marks Chinese economic ideas. But the “dual circulation” strategy Xi outlined actually represents a radical new understanding of globalization and of China’s place within it.</p>



<p>More than just a buzzword, dual circulation describes the deeply pessimistic worldview that has settled over Beijing. Once China’s leaders saw opportunity in globalization. Now, they expect the U.S. and its allies to deny China the technology it needs to build “a modern socialist country” by mid-century, meaning a wealthy superpower fit to rival the U.S. Although likely to be less pugilistic, Beijing rightly believes an incoming Biden administration will also press forward with policies designed to stop advanced technologies finding their way into Beijing’s hands. Chinese thinking has long valorized self-reliance, dating back to ideas developed by former Chinese leader Mao Zedong during the country’s civil war, which ended with the foundation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Now, Trump’s tariffs, as well as his campaigns against companies like Huawei and TikTok, have given new impetus to the modern form of self-reliance Xi dubs “internal” development.</p>



<p>Many experts have noted a changing Western consensus on China, as leaders in Washington abandoned the idea that economic modernization would inevitably lead to political liberalization in Beijing. But there has been a comparable shift in China’s internal conversation on the West too. Beginning with semiconductors but potentially expanding to all manner of other areas, China now expects it will have to develop technologically on its own. Xi’s new theory now sits at the heart of the country’s <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-10/29/c_139476451.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">14th five-year plan</a>, which covers development from 2021 to 2025, and was unveiled in draft form in October. The result will accelerate China’s decoupling from the West, while also increasing the importance of trading links forged with other parts of the world — for instance, via Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative. Put more bluntly, while the world was distracted by the drama of the U.S. presidential election, Xi quietly unveiled an economic strategy fit for a new Cold War. Both for China and for globalization itself, the results are likely to be profound.&nbsp;</p>

      “China expects the U.S. and its allies to act ever more aggressively to deny China the technology it needs.”    </p>

</div>




<hr>



<p>To see how much China’s consensus has changed, recall Xi’s <a href="https://america.cgtn.com/2017/01/17/full-text-of-xi-jinping-keynote-at-the-world-economic-forum" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">remarks</a> at Davos in 2017. There, he portrayed globalization not as a threat, but as an inevitability. “The global economy is the big ocean that you cannot escape from,” he suggested. “China will vigorously foster an external environment of opening-up for common development.” Just as Trump was turning against the idea, China would act as steward of the existing global order. It would even help to remedy many of the problems that rapid integration had caused, Xi argued, from economic inequality to climate change.</p>



<p>Three years later and, under <a href="https://research.nus.edu.sg/eai/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/EAIC-20-20201020.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">dual circulation</a>, things look much different. The idea splits the world into two systems. First comes external circulation, meaning China’s global trade, but also the way it invites foreigners into its domestic economy. This was the focus of Xi’s Davos remarks and the approach that powered his country’s decades of rapid growth, transforming China into an exporting powerhouse. The second component is then internal circulation, meaning domestic demand from Chinese consumers, but also domestic supply chains and “made in China” technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This division shares something in common with “<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/40-years-of-china-opening-up" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">reform and opening up</a>,” a phrase that has dominated China’s economic thinking for decades. That idea suggested Beijing should reform its domestic (or internal) economy to make it more market-led, while also opening up to the (external) world via globalization, gaining new ideas, production techniques and technologies along the way. Dual circulation also echoes longstanding attempts to wean China off a growth model dominated by exports and infrastructure investment and build instead the kind of consumption-led economy common in rich countries.</p>



<p>Such attempts have been only partially successful. A decade ago, about <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/private-consumption--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=China's%20Private%20Consumption%20accounted%20for,an%20average%20share%20of%2049.7%20%25." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">34%</a> of China’s economy came via domestic consumption, less than <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/final-consumption-expenditure-etc-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html#:~:text=(%25%20of%20GDP)%20in%20United,compiled%20from%20officially%20recognized%20sources." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">half the level</a> in the U.S. at the time. By 2019, this has reached just <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/private-consumption--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=China%20Private%20Consumption%3A%20%25%20of%20GDP,-1952%20%2D%202019%20%7C%20Yearly&amp;text=China%20Private%20Consumption%20accounted%20for,an%20average%20share%20of%2049.7%20%25." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">39%</a> — progress, of a sort, but hardly dramatic. When the phrase dual circulation first emerged earlier this year, many saw it as merely yet one more push toward this long-term objective of Chinese internal economic rebalancing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is China’s deteriorating geopolitical environment that marks dual circulation as a decisive break from the past, however. “China thinks there is a good prospect of even worse relations with the U.S. and its friends in the coming years,” I was told recently by Li Mingjiang, a Chinese political scientist based in Singapore and long-time observer of Beijing’s intricate political economy. “So, it needs to do something about it.”</p>



<p>It is not hard to see why. Trump’s tariffs and battles over soybeans generated more headlines, but it is advanced technology that really matters in Beijing. China is a global tech leader in some sectors, from online payments to artificial intelligence. But it lags in others. Despite its geopolitical heft, it still remains a firmly middle-income economy, with a gross domestic product per capita of roughly <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=china+gdp+per+capita&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG865SG865&amp;oq=china+gdp&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i67l3j0j69i60j69i61.4682j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">$9,700</a> — about on par with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG865SG865&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03pfVp34z407DFWSFnQvjkGHb2akQ%3A1605820539834&amp;ei=e-C2X7m2Munfz7sP5ZGlgAE&amp;q=kazakhstan+gdp+per+capita&amp;oq=Ka+gdp+per+capita&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB46BAgAEEdQoaoBWMmrAWCUswFoAHADeAGAAesBiAGeApIBBTEuMC4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Kazakhstan</a> and roughly half that of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG865SG865&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03pfVp34z407DFWSFnQvjkGHb2akQ%3A1605820539834&amp;ei=e-C2X7m2Munfz7sP5ZGlgAE&amp;q=kazakhstan+gdp+per+capita&amp;oq=Ka+gdp+per+capita&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB46BAgAEEdQoaoBWMmrAWCUswFoAHADeAGAAesBiAGeApIBBTEuMC4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Greece</a>. Access to cutting-edge technology is critical in changing this, especially as its economy moves away from the kind of basic exported manufactured goods that have long dominated its growth model.</p>



<p>Over recent decades, China has had many routes to acquiring such technology. Often, it simply bought it, as when Chinese companies snapped up everything from Rolls Royce jet engines to Qualcomm semiconductors. Foreign businesses rushed to set up Chinese operations, often as part of local joint ventures, eager to tap into a vast consumer market. Chinese businesses bought foreign technology groups, while Chinese academics and scientists built partnerships at the world’s best universities. Beijing <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/publications/getting-beyond-forced-technology-transfers-analysis-and-recommendations-intangible" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">employed</a> darker methods too, from forced technology transfer to outright intellectual property theft. But there were always plenty of legitimate avenues to go with them.&nbsp;</p>

</div>




<p>Now, many of these routes are closing fast. Rather than tariffs, America’s “entity list” has proved its most potent weapon. Back in 2016, President Barack Obama first used this process in <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/publications/getting-beyond-forced-technology-transfers-analysis-and-recommendations-intangible" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">accusing</a> ZTE, China’s second-largest telecoms supplier, of selling U.S. technologies to Iran, crippling the Chinese company in the process. Trump then escalated this approach, banning U.S. businesses from trading with dozens of Chinese enterprises, from state-owned giants to niche artificial intelligence providers with links to Xinjiang and its embattled Muslim Uighur minority. More recent <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/08/commerce-department-further-restricts-huawei-access-us-technology-and" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">measures</a> unveiled this August hit foreign suppliers too, for instance stopping semiconductor operators in Taiwan from selling to Chinese entities. Huawei has been one high-profile victim, leading experts to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdd2a70f-ecd2-4aff-b6c7-c0624bfdeebb" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">question</a> whether China’s state-linked tech champion can survive.</p>



<p>What started with semiconductors is unlikely to end there, however, hence dual circulation’s underlying pessimism. Under Trump, the U.S. has unveiled a range of further measures limiting China’s technology access, from its 2018 <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/briefings/2018/02/the_export_controlreformactof2018risksan.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Export Control Reform Act</a> to more targeted measures in areas like geospatial imagery software. Allies in Europe are being cajoled to follow suit. Many Western governments have also acted to stop China from buying up advanced tech companies entirely, while also <a href="https://www.chinacenter.net/2020/china_currents/19-3/scholars-or-spies-u-s-china-tension-in-academic-collaboration/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">limiting</a> academic collaborations with Chinese partners. The recent battle over TikTok was illustrative too, showing how rapidly the U.S. has lowered the bar on what counts as a national security threat, a category that now includes not just critical 5G telecoms architecture of the sort provided by Huawei, but also jocular teenage social media platforms.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, U.S. strategists are particularly vexed by China’s doctrine of “<a href="https://www.floridadaily.com/marco-rubio-introduces-bill-to-keep-chinese-military-companies-from-accessing-american-capital-markets/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">military-civil fusion</a>,” which mandates that technologies acquired by China’s private sector must be shared with its armed forces. The problem is that, when you look hard enough, almost anything can potentially be seen as a dual-use technology, from nuclear equipment and renewable energy batteries to civilian aircraft, drones and autonomous vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>For over two decades, the JVM (and thus Java) has ruled supreme while other runtimes have come and gone. Ruby, Python, .Net, NodeJS, have all tried to take the throne. But the JVM offered something none could: a multi-threaded, JIT-compiled, high-performance, fully backward compatible runtime.</p><p>That the JVM hasn't kept up with the times, can be demonstrated with a simple example. Say you write a small command-line utility function in Java that has dependencies on a few jars. How does one package and distribute this utility? One could look at StackOverflow to see which plugin of your favorite build system is currently popular to create a Fat Jar. However, the official 'Java way' to package your code and its dependencies is still the good old .war file. A faster moving organization would have acknowledged how users like to ship their code. They would have extended the .jar file format (or introduced a new file format) to be able to package dependencies in a standardized manner. But no such thing on the horizon with Java.</p><p>Java is moving faster than ever now, one might say. It does get 2 minor releases a year now. (Though, does anyone really use the features of non-LTS Java versions?). Sure the module system in Java 9 allowed the JVM to shed some of its weight, but major additions to the JVM which would put it on par with competition still seem to be a long way away. Project Valhalla, which was supposed to introduce 'Value Types' to Java, was announced back in 2014 and still has no release date. Project Loom, which brings green threads, was announced in 2018 and is in a similar state. Want to interop with native code, one still has to deal with the insanity of 20-year-old JNI interfaces.</p><p>One also wonders, even after these features are introduced, how compelling would they be to use compared to their implementations in other languages/runtimes. Java's Achilles heel after all is the need to maintain backward compatibility. Its that backward compatibility requirement that got us the Java Streams API, where instead of <code>myList.map(...)</code> one has to write the monstrosity that is <code>myList.stream().map(...).collect(Collectors.toList()</code>.</p><p>There was a time where Java was the best choice for almost everything. GWT on the frontend, Spring on the backend. Databases like Hadoop, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Spark, all written on top of the JVM. Java also had the absolute best IDE in Eclipse and Intellij, making it a reason to choose Java over other languages in a professional environment.</p><p>What's different in the 2020s is that over the last decade, languages/runtimes have evolved to become best in class for specific domains. They took their learnings from the JVM, finally realizing that type safety is needed and performance is important. They ackonowledged that one language/runtime doesnt fit all needs.</p><ul><li>Want to write a large, complicated UI? ReactJS and Typescript allow you to do that while providing a type system even more expressive than the JVM.</li><li>Want to write a web server? Golang allows you to handle thousands of requests at a time without the need for a thread per request. It makes concurrency so easy, the equivalent in Java would be an order of magnitude more complex.</li><li>Want to write a big data database? Rust has you covered. Deal with huge amounts of data without needing to battle the GC and interact with low-level system calls without battling with JNI or <code>sun.misc.Unsafe</code>.</li></ul><p>With all these languages being fully typed, Jetbrains now has been able to make equally good IDE for those languages too.</p><p>From 2020 onwards, the JVM doesn't seem to be the best choice for anything. It will continue its legacy as a big, heavyweight, one size fits all VM. Good at everything, but never the best. The future is polyglot and it's free of the JVM.</p>

<![CDATA[Measuring Memory Usage in Rust]]>

December 11, 2020 | https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/12/04/measuring-memory-usage-in-rust.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/12/04/measuring-memory-usage-in-rust.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="preamble">
<div>

<p>This post documents a couple of fun tricks we use in rust-analyzer for measuring memory consumption.</p>
<p>In general, there are two broad approaches to profiling the memory usage of a program.</p>
<p><em>The first approach</em> is based on “heap parsing”.
At a particular point in time, the profiler looks at all the memory currently occupied by the program (the heap).
In its raw form, the memory is just a bag of bytes, <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>.
However the profiler, using some help from the language’s runtime, is able to re-interpret these bytes as collections of object (“parse the heap”).
It then traverses the graph of objects and computes how many instances of each object are there and how much memory they occupy.
The profiler also tracks the ownership relations, to ferret out facts like “90% of strings in this program are owned by the <code>Config</code> struct”.
This is the approach I am familiar with from the JVM ecosystem.
Java’s garbage collector needs to understand the heap to search for unreachable objects, and the same information is used to analyze heap snapshots.</p>
<p><em>The second approach</em> is based on instrumenting the calls to allocation and deallocation routines.
The profiler captures backtraces when the program calls <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> and constructs a flamegraph displaying “hot” functions which allocate a lot.
This is how, for example, <a href="https://github.com/KDE/heaptrack">heaptrack</a> works (see also <a href="https://github.com/cuviper/alloc_geiger">alloc geiger</a>).</p>
<p>The two approaches are complementary.
If the problem is that the application does too many short-lived allocations (instead of re-using the buffers), it would be invisible for the first approach, but very clear in the second one.
If the problem is that, in a steady state, the application uses too much memory, the first approach would work better for pointing out which data structures need most attention.</p>
<p>In rust-analyzer, we are generally interested in keeping the overall memory usage small, and can make better use of heap parsing approach.
Specifically, most of the rust-analyzer’s data is stored in the incremental computation tables, and we want to know which table is the heaviest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Rust does not use garbage collection, so just parsing the heap bytes at runtime is impossible.
The best available alternative is instrumenting data structures for the purposes of measuring memory size.
That is, writing a proc-macro which adds <code>fn total_size(&amp;self) → usize</code> method to annotated types, and calling that manually from the root of the data.
There is Servo’s <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/tree/2d3811c21bf1c02911d5002f9670349c5cf4f500/components/malloc_size_of"><code>malloc_size_of</code></a> crate for doing that, but it is not published to crates.io.</p>
<p>Another alternative is running the program under valgrind to gain runtime introspectability.
<a href="https://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/ms-manual.html">Massif</a> and and <a href="https://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/dh-manual.html">DHAT</a> work that way.
Running with valgrind is pretty slow, and still doesn’t give Java-level fidelity.</p>
<p>Instead, rust-analyzer mainly relies on a much simpler approach for figuring out which things are heavy.
This is the first trick of this article:</p>

</div><div>
<h2 id="archimedes-method"><a href="#archimedes-method"></a>Archimedes' Method</h2>
<div>
<p>It’s relatively easy to find out the total memory allocated at any given point in time.
For glibc, there’s <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mallinfo.3.html">mallinfo</a> function, a <a href="https://docs.rs/jemalloc-ctl/0.3.3/jemalloc_ctl/stats/struct.allocated.html">similar API</a> exists for jemalloc.
It’s even possible to implement a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html"><code>GlobalAlloc</code></a> which tracks this number.</p>
<p>And, if you can measure total memory usage, you can measure memory usage of any specific data structure by:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>measuring the current memory usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dropping the data structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>measuring the current memory usage again</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The difference between the two values is the size of the data structure.
And this is exactly what rust-analyzer does to find the largest caches: <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/b988c6f84e06bdc5562c70f28586b9eeaae3a39c/crates/ide_db/src/apply_change.rs#L104-L238">source</a>.</p>
<p>Two small notes about this method:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s important to ask the allocator about the available memory, and not the operating system.
OS can only tell how many pages the program consumes.
Only the allocator knows which of those pages are free and which hold allocated objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When measuring relative sizes, it’s important to note the unaccounted-for amount in the end, such that the total adds up to 100%.
It might be the case that the bottleneck lies in the dark matter outside of explicit measurements!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<h2 id="amdahls-estimator"><a href="#amdahls-estimator"></a>Amdahl’s Estimator</h2>
<div>
<p>The second trick is related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%E2%80%99s_law">Amdahl’s law</a>.
When optimizing a specific component, it’s important to note not only how much more efficient it becomes, but also overall contribution of the component to the system.
Making an algorithm twice as fast can improve the overall performance only by 5%, if the algorithm is only 10% of the whole task.</p>
<p>In rust-analyzer’s case, the optimization we are considering is adding interning to <code>Name</code>.
At the moment, a <code>Name</code> is represented with a small sized optimized string (24 bytes inline + maybe some heap storage):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>struct</span> <span>Name</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>text</span><span>:</span> <span>SmolStr</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Instead, we can use an interned index (4 bytes):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>struct</span> <span>Name</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>idx</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, just trying out this optimization is not easy, as an interner is a thorny piece of global state.
Is it worth it?</p>
<p>If we look at the <code>Name</code> itself, it’s pretty clear that the optimization is valuable: it reduces memory usage by 6x!
But how important is it in the grand scheme of things?
How to measure the impact of <code>Name</code>s on overall memory usage?</p>
<p>One approach is to just apply the optimization and measure the improvement after the fact.
But there’s a lazier way: instead of making the <code>Name</code> smaller and measuring the improvement, we make it <strong>bigger</strong> and measure the worsening.
Specifically, its easy to change the <code>Name</code> to this:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>struct</span> <span>Name</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>text</span><span>:</span> <span>SmolStr</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// Copy of `text`</span>
    <span>_</span><span>ballast</span><span>:</span> <span>SmolStr</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, if the new <code>Name</code> increases the overall memory consumption by <code>N</code>, we can estimate the total size of old <code>Name</code>s as <code>N</code> as well, as they are twice as small.</p>
<p>Sometimes, quick and simple hacks works better than the finest instruments :).</p>

  </figure>   <p>We are talking about a task that has had a strong development in recent times, especially thanks to the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning"><strong>Deep Learning</strong></a>.
The use of very deep neural networks has greatly increased and improved the effectiveness of entity recognition tools. <br>
Before the advent of Deep Learning, the most used tool was the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">Hidden Markov Model</a>,
a statistical model based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>, but that did not guarantee
the same performance as today's Deep Learning-based models. <br>
Two examples of training models for entity recognition will be shown later in the article, both based on the use of algorithms
made with neural networks.</p><p>The task of the Named Entity Recognition is addressed through approaches of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning"><strong>supervised type</strong></a>,
and for this reason it is necessary to have a set of labeled data available in order to train a model to recognize entities.
Each textual content must be labeled with the list of tokens and related tags for each entity that is to be recognized in the text.</p><p>There are several formats to represent a training dataset for Named Entity Recognition. Let's see the two most used.</p><p>A first format is the one called <strong> BILUO </strong> scheme, where the different parts of the entities are mapped according to the scheme in Figure 2.
Entities are tagged with the semantic category preceded by one of the defined prefixes.</p><figure>

This is because, through the multi-prefix scheme, they specify more detailed information in the text, which improves the capabilities of
learning of the Machine Learning algorithm used. <br>
But even using the IOB and jsonl format, very often it is possible to achieve noteworthy performance. <br>
Switching between formats is relatively simple and can be accomplished by defining rules-based procedures
easy intuition.
In addition, many NLP libraries already define predefined functions to transform your dataset into the desired format.</p><p>To label and transform data into one of these formats, there are ad hoc tools called <strong> annotators </strong>.
An annotator allows you to upload your data as plain text and then label it in a graphical environment which makes the annotation process more agile.
Annotators allow you to label data for NER, but also for textual classification tasks rather than sequence-to-sequence tasks.</p><p>In the case of NER, an annotator presents a graphic like the one below in the figure, with functionalities that allow

state of the art.
These tend to be generic datasets, with entities labeled with semantic categories relating to personal names, organizations, locations, dates,
temporal entities; however, it is also possible to find datasets labeled, concerning to more specific domains.
These datasets are almost always in English, but very often this problem can be overcome by using machine translation tools before carrying out
the activity of Named Entity Recognition, translating the content from the Italian language to the English language, and vice versa.</p><p>Here is a list of some of the tagged datasets on the net:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus?select=ner_dataset.csv"><strong>Annotated Corpus for Named Entity Recognition</strong></a>: dataset

Natural Language Processing. These tools provide both pre-trained templates that are easy to use and quickly integrate into your code, and the
possibility to train new ones with your own data, using predefined modules that simplify the training of new Machine Learning tools. <br>

<p>I didn’t used to enjoy TDD.  I thought I understood it - I’d tell people it was a useful practice and I’d go through all the motions when demonstrating it to them; but when push came to shove I’d quietly drop it as soon as I needed to do anything taxing.</p>

<p>I’ve always felt some embarrassment about this, possibly even guilt. The people I admired and looked up to as developers seemed so adamant that it is the right way to write software. They commanded such respect within the organisations and communities that they worked, and I wanted to be like them; calm, confident and measured , no project too daunting.</p>

<p>Yet, try as I might, I just couldn’t work out what their secret was. Why did they find TDD so enjoyable? Why did I get lost every time I tried to make an honest go of it? Why did I feel like such an imposter?</p>

<p>I think part of the problem was the apparent simplicity of the process. You write test code before you write production code. How hard can it be? It doesn’t help that people who have mastered the practice make it look effortless. The thing is… it’s not effortless. Not to start with anyway. I think the biggest pothole on the road to TDD enlightenment is the idea that you are suddenly going to feel enlightened. Like anything TDD takes practice and experience.</p>

<p>We get better at things little by little, step by step. The premise behind TDD is simple, but its application is nuanced. It’s okay (and normal) for things not to be perfect when you’re just starting out. If you find yourself stuck, don’t get hung up on it. Take a break from TDD and do what you need to do to move on. Writing code that is missing a few tricky tests is much more valuable than having something unfinished that no one gets to use.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until I started to forgive myself for not doing perfect TDD all the time that I started to get better at it. You need to give yourself room to make mistakes and learn what’s easy, and what’s difficult. If you don’t allow yourself to do things sub-optimally and move on, it’s impossible to look back and reflect upon how you might do it differently next time.</p>

With that experience, I've created a checklist to help ensure my technical interviews are effective and empathetic. Read on for the list!</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2 id="before-the-interview">Before the interview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read their resume and any prep materials you have (cover letter, notes from previous interviews, etc).</li>
<li>If it's a videocall, make sure your mic and webcam work - and turn your camera on!</li>
<li>Respect the candidate by showing up on time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intros">Intros</h2>
<ul>
<li>Introduce yourself and smile when you do!</li>
<li>Ease the candidate in by having them talk about an interesting project they've worked on.
<ul>
<li>It'll help candidates calm their nerves by thinking about something they're already comfortable with.</li>
<li>Always respond positively to what they say!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set ground rules before diving into the question: Do you need working code? Can they Google things? What languages can they use? What are you looking to get out of the question?</li>
<li>Your interview question should have a clear CTA. After posing your question, candidates should know exactly what their next steps are.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-technical-question">The technical question</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remember what it's like to be on the other side. Interviews are always stressful and scary: be empathetic and do whatever you can to reduce that stress!</li>
<li>Guide candidates through the question. If they're stuck, help them out. You'll get better signal by seeing them approach the whole problem.
<ul>
<li>In particular - help candidates with standard library calls. Having the standard library memorized or not isn't good signal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take notes: it's hard to remember what happened in an interview after the fact.</li>
<li>Try to end on a positive note: if we end in the middle of a section, I like to connect where they are with where I wanted them to go.</li>
<li>As you close the question, tie it back back to a real-world problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing-out">Closing out</h2>
<ul>
<li>Leave 5-10 minutes for them to ask you questions - and make sure to end on time.</li>
<li>Have answers to common questions prepared. Some common questions:
<ul>
<li>Why did you join Company X?</li>
<li>What's an interesting problem you've worked on at Company X?</li>
<li>What's something you don't like about Company X?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thank them for their time.</li>
<li>Submit your interview feedback ASAP.</li>

      <div>

        <div>
          
<p>We’ve all been lied to about piracy. Many of us have been made to believe that online “pirates” rob artists of their livelihood, while Intellectual Property (IP) law exists as a means of protecting the rights of individual creators to make a profit and protect their integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What the rise of tech monopolies in the last decade has shown us is the opposite: IP law mostly serves corporate interests, while anyone who participates in digital public preservation, archiving and sharing is increasingly criminalized as a “pirate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IP legal regime wasn’t created as an idealistic attempt to protect the rights of creators, but rather to grease the wheels for the further expansion of capital. Here’s how IP law has been used to create monopolies, crush the public domain and hurt the artists its proponents say it serves.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>IP Laws And Monopolies</strong></h3>



<p>IP — that is, copyright, trademark, patents and to a lesser extent, trade secrets — didn’t really come into vogue until the latter half of the 19th century, notably in England.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At first, when competition was high, industrialists largely opposed expanded trademark and patent protections. Yet as monopolies and cartels grew, they began to support extra protections on trademarks. This is because, <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2003/01/01/the-political-economy-of-intellectual-property/">according</a> to Marxist economist Michael Perelman, these companies needed more robust legal frameworks for protecting intangible assets such as brand exclusivity, and patents were also incredibly useful for companies in the United States looking to circumvent the Sherman Antitrust Act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The term “intellectual property” wasn’t <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/iphistory.pdf">used regularly</a> until the post-Second World War economic decline, when companies that had been opposed to state overreach in the past came to view property rights as a means to increase profits.</p>



<p>In the late 1980s, IP began to be even further expanded, at a dizzyingly rapid pace. Since then, scholars and activists have been warning that this expansion is serving monopoly capital in the growing tech sector.</p>



<p>Central European University sociological researcher Jakob Rigi has <a href="https://www.triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/487/667">written</a> about how information itself, especially in the digital age, has nearly zero value because it requires little to no labour cost to reproduce (unlike, say, an iPhone). As a result, it’s nearly impossible to extract profit from information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, these tech multinationals are now wielding IP law to extract rents by selling access to, and exclusivity of, information — not by selling the information itself. Trademarks, patents and copyrights are instrumental for monopoly capital because they allow these large companies to extract rents in the form of subscriptions, franchises and licensing fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the TRIPS agreement, which brought IP law into multilateral trading, was <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/trips">ratified</a> in 1994. In 1998, United States President Bill Clinton signed the DMCA into law, which is still being <a href="https://www.highlandernews.org/34672/disney-lobbies-congress-change-copyright-laws/">tweaked</a> to privilege rights holders.</p>



<p>This dynamic has only been heightened in the past decade, with the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP Act being brought to the U.S. House floor in 2011 with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_organizations_with_official_stances_on_the_SOPA_and_PIPA#:~:text=The%20Stop%20Online%20Piracy%20Act,unions%20in%20the%20cable%2C%20movie%2C">backing</a> of ISPs and established entertainment industry cartels.</p>



<p>These acts were shelved a year later due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/18/2715300/sopa-blackout-wikipedia-reddit-mozilla-google-protest">vociferous resistance</a> from a huge array of tech companies (including Amazon and Google), which were, at that point, still in a period of high competition. However, now that some of these companies have succeeded in conquering the “Wild West” of the Internet and establishing monopolies, they’ve totally inverted their position.</p>



<h3><strong>IP Laws To Crush The Public Domain</strong></h3>



<p>As time wears on, and IP law is used to criminalize all forms of file-sharing and sampling, it becomes increasingly clear that the focus on “piracy” and illegal file-sharing is only a pretext at wearing down what still exists of the public domain to squeeze it for profit. This is because the companies using IP law in this way need to enclose and privatize what remains of the cultural commons to keep up their rate of profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2002, University of Gothenburg associate professor Johan Söderberg <a href="https://firstmonday.org/article/view/938/860">pointed out</a> that digital activists were fighting a major corporate tide against what remained of fair use and the Creative Commons. This has continued, and there are numerous examples of companies cracking down in the past decade alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, Reddit co-creator Aaron Swartz took his own life after prosecutors pursued charges against him carrying sentences of up to 35 years in federal prison for illicitly downloading nearly five million academic documents off of JSTOR. This happened even though JSTOR <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/the-brilliant-life-and-tragic-death-of-aaron-swartz-177191/">refused</a> to press charges after Swartz returned the documents he’d downloaded (for reasons unknown, it was actually MIT that let the case go forward).</p>



<p>Then, there’s the ongoing lawsuit to destroy the Internet Archive, brought forward by major publishers such as HarperCollins and Hachette. The suit was in response to the Internet Archive launching the National Emergency Library at the outset of the pandemic, which is a temporary lending program to assist students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs claim that the Internet Archive “illegally” scans the books it lends, which is not only a deliberate misrepresentation of special exceptions for libraries in the Copyright Act, but, according to The Nation writer Maria Bustillos <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/publishers-are-taking-the-internet-to-court/">betrays</a> a “rentier mentality” that could unravel these protections.</p>



<p>Moreover, in late October, Amazon <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/amazon-argues-users-dont-actually-own-purchased-prime-video-content">filed</a> to dismiss a complaint from an Prime Video user who claimed the tech giant had engaged in “unfair competition and false advertising” for reserving the right to lock or remove on-demand content after it had been purchased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amazon’s motion argues that Prime customers don’t purchase the content they view. Rather, they purchase a “limited license” to consume the content. Already-existing IP law enables Amazon, which in its younger days had opposed SOPA and PIPA, to extend its domain into content streaming via a subscription model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly after, Twitch — an Amazon subsidiary, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-nears-deal-to-acquire-twitch">purchased in 2014</a>— found itself on the receiving end of ire for its handling of a sudden influx of DMCA notices (in all likelihood prompted by a pandemic-related <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/this-is-how-covid-19-is-affecting-the-music-industry/">drop</a> in recording industry profits this year.) In an official <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/11/11/music-related-copyright-claims-and-twitch/">blog post</a> published on November 11, the live-streaming service magnanimously describes new rules imposed on streamers to comply with copyright claims on background music, including muting in-game music.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These rules and tools were criticized for being haphazard, draconian and confusing, which led Twitch to issue a slight mea culpa before explaining that users can avail themselves of rights-cleared music libraries including Soundtrack, which they just so happen to own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consequences of these digital turf battles over licensing between corporate giants inevitably falls on users, while the spoils of profit and ownership go to the monopolies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of IP to enclose information and sell access in exchange for a rent obviously has wide-ranging effects. When all human knowledge is eventually privatized, public archiving, preservation, curation and skill-sharing will be outlawed, and there will be <a href="https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/1600882251-zoom-cancels-scheduled-videoconference-with-palestinian-hijacker-leila-khaled">total</a> corporate control of speech rights.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>IP Law Hurting Artists</strong></h3>



<p>Even the recent history of IP law shows that many of us, including artists, have been led astray chasing the windmills of “piracy” while monopolies expand into new frontiers. High profile cases like <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/features/metallica-vs-napster-the-lawsuit-that-redefined-how-we-listen-to-music/">Metallica vs. Napster</a><em> </em>or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/14/8039413/megaupload-conviction-felony-nomm-kim-dotcom">Megaupload</a> are instructive, both in terms of the precedents they’ve set and how they’ve helped tech and entertainment companies control the narrative about what’s keeping artists poor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it’s reasonable to claim that such third party companies do profit from infringement (unlike the Internet Archive, digital libraries or public domain sites, which rely on work that’s either licensed, out of copyright and otherwise legally obtained), it’s as legitimate to claim that the corporations suing them are just as guilty of theft<strong> </strong>through IP farming, onerous contracts with obscenely low rates and sometimes outright plagiarism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These monopolies succeeded in part by destroying file-sharing sites and refining and monetizing the streaming model once they were mostly out of the way. Intellectual property rights are as robust as ever, and the rise of music streaming has actually led to a music industry recovery that <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/music-industry-sales/">began</a> in 2017, after about 15 years of decline following the death of the CD thanks to new, untamed digital technology. Yet somehow artists continue to lose both money and control over the work they make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The recent Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW) “Justice at Spotify” <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2020/10/union-of-musicians-and-allied-workers-demands-equity-justice-at-spotify-initiative">campaign</a> demonstrates that the rise of rentier platforms has: lowered the value of creative material to a greater extent than online piracy could ever achieve; made it more difficult for original creators to retain ownership of their work; concentrated the value of this work into fewer hands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UMAW <a href="https://www.unionofmusicians.org/justice-at-spotify-demands">list of demands</a> states, “Music workers create all of the enormous wealth Spotify accumulates for its CEO, its investors, and the major labels. But we artists continue to be underpaid, misled, and otherwise exploited by the company.” </p>



<p>UMAW calls for a restructuring of Spotify’s payment model, a 1-cent minimum payout per stream and for Spotify to <a href="https://variety.com/2020/music/news/spotify-amazon-songwriter-royalties-court-appeals-1203528044/">stop fighting artists</a> in court over rate hikes.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>The obvious answer to the question of monopoly capital and the legal regimes it uses to keep itself in power is usually some form of antitrust policy to break them up and increase competition. But we know from history that the nature of capitalism makes these boon periods temporary, volatile and prone to monopolism regardless of the law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As writer Gavin Mueller has <a href="https://www.boundary2.org/2018/07/mueller/">noted</a>, the “cyberlibertarian” bent of preserving market competition and even enabling piracy to favour small business is largely “petty producer fantasies” that ignore the capitalist cycles that lead to monopolies in the first …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

	  <p><a href="https://www.hadabot.com/">Hadabot</a> is a low-cost robot kit for students, software engineers, makers to learn <a href="https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/">ROS2</a> and robotics in a hands-on manner. Our robot kits are easy to build, extensible, and customizable. The Hadabot software stack consists of an open source web browser-based coding environment to make the hacking experience frustration-free.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hadabot.com/">Hadabot ROS2 "Turtle" robot kits are available for purchase</a>!</p>
<hr>
<p>In a previous post, we showcased the <a href="https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim/">ROS 2 turtlesim</a> running with the <a href="https://navigation.ros.org/">Navigation2 (aka Nav2)</a> package. That exercise required the use of the <a href="https://wiki.ros.org/tf2">tf2</a> which manages all <a href="https://blog.hadabot.com/ros2-navigation-tf2-tutorial-using-turtlesim.html#what-is-tf2">the various coordinate frames of a robotics application</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, instead of turtlesim, we'll have Nav2 direct a physical Hadabot Turtle differential drive robot to a goal pose - position and orientation. This exercise will bring together rviz, tf2, Nav2 with our past writeups about the <a href="https://blog.hadabot.com/implement-ros2-odometry-using-vscode-in-web-browser.html">Turtle robot's odometry and kinematics</a>. We'll touch upon:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How we compute odometry for Nav2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Nav2 parameters we tweaked</p>

        </p>

<h5>Rviz to visualize the Nav2 go-to-goal Hadabot Turtle example</h5>
<p>If you successfully ran the example, you'll notice that the Turtle starts in the middle of the "arena" (ie map). Each grid-box represents 1 meter in physical distance. The red-axis presents the Turtle pointed forward. Since ROS uses a right-handed coordinate system, positive <span>\(\omega\)</span> rotation results in the Turtle turning counter-clockwise. </p>
<p>For the video example, the goal pose was 1 meter to the Turtle's left, with a 90 degree orientation from its initial orientation. </p>
<p>Notice the Turtle didn't end up exactly 1 meter to its left, nor was it oriented exactly 90 degrees from its initial pose. This is due to 2 reasons due to nothing happening exactly in the real world (this is not a simulation anymore Dorothy) - (1) the Hadabot Turtle's speed sensors have errors which accumulates over time resulting in odometry drift, and (2) Nav2 goal checker allows for a tolerance in both distance and orientation from the specificed end-goal.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. How we construct TF2 messages from odometry</h3>
<p>The Hadabot Turtle publishes each wheel's rotational velocity in radians per second. With the measured wheelbase and wheel radius of the Turtle, we apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead-reckoning</a> to determine how far each wheel has traveled in meters.</p>
<p>Once we know how far each wheel has traveled for our differential drive model, we can compute the linear distance and angular rotation <span>\((v, \omega)\)</span> for a unicycle model, which allows us to update the current pose and velocities of our Hadabot Turtle as an <a href="http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html">Odometry ROS message</a>. All this is done in the <em>hadabot_controller.cpp</em> file.</p>
<p>Then we use effectively the same code as the turtlesim example to extract the pose information from the Odometry message and publish that out as tf2 messages which is used by Nav2 and rviz.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. Setting up Nav2 for the Hadabot Turtle</h3>
<p>Nav2 is a complex ROS 2 package with a number of sub-packages / components around 3 main capabilities - localization, planning/controller, and mapping. For our go-to-goal example, we mainly use the planning/controller component.</p>
<p>There are conceptually 2 types of planners in Nav2 - a global planner, and a local planner. The global planner computes a global trajectoy to get to our goal pose. The local planner references the global plan to determine the best linear and angular velocity for the robot to undertake to safely move along the global trajectory. </p>
<p>The global planner (as of 2020-12) defaults to a variation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search</a> based planner. The local planner is called the <a href="https://vimeo.com/236487972">DWB planner, initially created by David Lu back in the ROS 1 days</a>, which implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_window_approach">Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) algorithm</a> created by Dieter Fox, Wolfram Burgard, and Sebastian Thrun. The DWB planner is driven by "critics" which vote on various local trajectories to undertake. Each critic "cares" about a certain behavior (ie avoiding abstacles, avoiding oscillation, going fast, etc). The local trajectory with the highest vote wins and that results as the Twist message command to direct the robot's current velocities.</p>
<p>Configuring Nav2 for our go-to-goal example involved tuning the parameters for the planning/controller. The ones we tweaked for the Hadabot Turtle are the max velocities of our robot, and controller update frequency (to update frequently enough but not so much that it floods our "hobbyist" network capabilities). There are many other <a href="https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/index.html">Nav2 parameters we can consider and tune</a>, which can be a series of posts and exercises on its own. </p>
<hr>
<h3>4. Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this post, we did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Showed a example of running a physical real-life Hadabot Turtle robot using ROS 2 Nav2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We described how we use dead-reckoning to compute the Turtle's pose and velocities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We talked a bit about Nav2 and what we tweaked to get our goal-to-goal example to work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In future posts, we can take this exercise down 2 separate threads - (1) to walk through some of the Nav2 parameters in more detail, start looking closer at Nav2, or (2) to showcase a Hadabot Turtle with a skirt of range-sensors (add-on for the base Turtle kit) to further explore localization and then SLAM with Nav2.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are working with various professors to create a more structured ROS 2 robotics syllabus and curriculum.</p>

            <p><strong>Dec 9, 2020</strong></p>
            
            <p>It turns out that sales tax has a huge, gigantic, terrible flaw: It punishes specialized businesses. A value added tax (VAT) has no such problems.</p>

<p>The US has sales tax. Most of the planet has VAT.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/VAT_map_updated.png" alt="VAT map"></p>

<p>Maybe it’s not the most important issue in the world, but it’s just so <em>clear</em>. Sales tax is dumb and VAT is better.</p>



<p>Many people apparently believe that in the US today, sales tax is only paid by final consumers. <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">THIS IS FALSE</a></strong>. It varies hugely by state, but the current situation is a hybrid between a “pure final retail consumer only” sales tax and what the toy model below describes. You can debate if it’s “sales tax” or “gross receipts tax” or whatever, but it’s a fact that <em>businesses pay tax on business inputs</em> all the time. You can find proof of this <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/standcomm/sccomfc/Business-Inputs-Study.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41788786">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_receipts_tax#United_States">here</a>.</p>

<p>I emphasize that the explanation below is a toy, intended to illustrate in the simplest possible way how specialization gets punished when transfers are taxed in proportion to their values. The current reality not <em>nearly</em> this bad due to many complex exemptions, as I discuss at the end. But the flaw described <em>does</em> exist and <em>does</em> punish specialization. I beg you: <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">IF YOU THINK THE US DOESN’T HAVE TAXES WHERE THE SAME UNIT OF VALUE IS TAXED MULTIPLE TIMES PLEASE READ THIS LINK.</a></strong></p>

<p>OK, let’s continue.</p>



<p>Say you decide to get into the decorative <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/12/09/sales-tax-creates-more-unnecessary-pain-than-value-added-tax/(https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/09/11/comparative-advantage-and-when-to-blow-up-your-island/)">coconut</a> manufacturing business.</p>

<p>You’re good at painting coconuts. You find a friend who is good at picking them, and another who’s good at making coconut paint. You find a third friend who’s a genius with applying finishing lacquer and a fourth who runs a store.</p>

<p>You buy coconuts and paint, apply the paint, then sell to the finisher. He applies lacquer and sells to a retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/supply_chain.jpg" alt="supply chain"></p>

<p>After negotiating prices, you settle on $1 for a raw coconut, $1 for a coconut’s worth of paint, $3 for a painted coconut, $4 for a finished coconut, and $5 retail. This works out to everyone making $1 of profit.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/market.jpg" alt="market"></p>

<p>Here’s a table showing the accounts:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost of inputs</th>
      <th>Profit</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Raw coconuts</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Paint</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Painted coconut</td>
      <td>$2 (raw coconut+paint)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Finished coconut</td>
      <td>$3 (painted coconut)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>
      <td>$4 (finished coconut)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>For a while, everything runs beautifully. Every day you wake eager to help capture more beauty in coconut form — and then the government announces a 20% sales tax. Whenever you sell something, you need to pay 20% of the sale price to the government.</p>

<p>You talk it over. Everyone feels they still deserve to make the same $1 profit as before. Since you now pay $1.20 for a raw coconut and $1.20 for paint, you need to mark up to $3.40 before tax, and $4.08 after.</p>

<p>After everyone marks up their prices in this way, here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/sales_tax.jpg" alt="sales tax"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>

      <th>Profit</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th>Price after tax</th>

    <tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Finished coconut</td>
      <td>$4.08</td>
      <td>$1</td>

      <td>$6.10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>
      <td>$6.10</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$7.10</td>
      <td>$8.52</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Your customers aren’t thrilled about the increase in price, but what are they going to do — live <em>without</em> painted coconuts? So they pay the higher price, the government gets its tax, and life continues.</p>



<p>A few months later, your unscrupulous  cousin hears about your business. He’s the jealous type and decides to try stealing your customers. He opens a store and finds four friends to help make coconuts. Unlike you, however, he hires everyone as <em>employees</em>. He sells the coconuts for $6 ($5 plus tax) and gives everyone $1 per coconut in wages.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/integrated.jpg" alt="integrated"></p>

<p>Your cousin and friends don’t appreciate the subtle art of coconut decoration. Everyone agrees yours are better but they start to complain: Why are you charging $8.52 when a slightly worse product is available for only $6? Slowly, your loyal customers drift away and you go out of business.</p>

<p>How could this happen? Your team was asking for the same profit while doing a better job! Yet everyone is left with your cousin’s knock-off coconuts.</p>



<p>Suppose the government had instead announced a 20% VAT. With a VAT, whenever you sell something, you only pay tax on the sale price <em>minus the price of the stuff you bought to make it</em>.</p>

<p>As before, you’ll need to pay $1.20 for raw coconuts and $1.20 paint. You charge $3.40 for painted coconuts, now you’re only taxed on the profit of $3.40-$2.40=$1.00. The price with tax is now $3.60.</p>

<p>Here are the final prices as they go through through the system. Everyone is making a profit of $1, so everyone pays a tax of $0.20.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Painted coconut</td>
      <td>$2.4</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$3.40</td>
      <td>$3.60</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Finished coconut</td>
      <td>$3.60</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$4.60</td>
      <td>$4.80</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>
      <td>$4.80</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$5.80</td>
      <td>$6.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The final price is $6.00. Since your coconuts are better, your cousin won’t be able to drive you out of business with his low-grade stuff.</p>



<p>What happened? Your cousin created a <em>vertically integrated</em> business. A sales tax is collected every time someone buys something. If you just do it yourself, no tax is collected.</p>

<p>Are vertically integrated businesses bad? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>However, take your chain of independent independent artisans making and selling coconut products. Imagine someone invents a paint that customers prefer. You almost <em>have</em> to switch, or some other painter will drive you out of business. Contrast this with cousin’s integrated business making all coconuts. In theory, the inventor could convince your cousin to hire him or license the paint process. If he won’t be convinced, the only way for that paint to get to customers is if the inventor develops an entire independent coconut manufacturing chain. Vertical integration means there are price signals at fewer points during production, which tends to make it harder for innovations to thrive.</p>

<p>There are times where vertical integration is better. (If everyone is independent, a lot of time is spent on negotiations!) That’s perfectly fine. What we <em>don’t</em> want is to artificially encourage vertical integration even when it’s less efficient, which sales tax does.</p>



<p>Another advantage of the VAT is it tends to be easier to enforce. When I sell something, I need to provide certificates proving I paid VAT on my inputs. This gives everyone an incentive to ensure compliance in the previous layer of the chain. With a sales tax, the government needs to watch every single transaction.</p>

<p>Of course, people know sales tax is distortionary. Many exceptions exist to minimize the worst distortions. For example, a retailer usually won’t pay sales tax on a manufactured good they intend to a consumer in the same form. Without this exception, we’d probably have a crazy economy where manufacterers sell directly to consumers. The messy patchwork of exceptions reduces the problems with sales tax but doesn’t eliminate them.</p>

<p>I think there are two major reasons to oppose replacing sales tax with VAT. The first is a Leninist “worse is better” attitude. If you think <em>all taxes are bad</em> then you’d want to keep them painful and visible so people will be maximally annoyed by them. The second is that VAT is complicated to administer, particularly when sales tax can be different in each local area. This might be true, but I find it a bit hard to believe. VAT is more self-enforcing and sales taxes are <em>already</em> a nightmare, particularly for anyone selling to different cities/states. If we’re keeping the sales tax to keep things simple, where’s the payoff?</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>Corporate and academic networks are closed by design, with routers
and firewalls forwarding and filtering content going to and from
the wider internet.  For security reasons this is an absolute
necessity, as the guardkeeping prevents unwanted incoming connections
to the networked devices.</p>

<p>However, it is often necessary to connect to internal devices or
services from the outside.  This could be the case if an employee
needs to access a shared database on the company network, or a
subscription website only allows full access from a certain range
of IP addresses.  Network administrators usually offer virtual
private network (VPN) access to achieve such goals.  Unfortunately,
VPN access occasionally requires particular software that may not
work on all operating systems.  In other cases, the network
administrators may enforce strict requirements to the remote systems
before allowing VPN access.</p>

<pre><code> ###### Closed Network ######
 #                          #
 #  +----------+      +----------+             +----------+
 #  |  Office  |      | Router/  |      ?      | Outside  |
 #  | Computer |&lt;~~~~&gt;| Firewall |    ?   ?    | Computer |
 #  +----------+      +----------+             +----------+
 #                          #
 ############################
</code></pre>

<p>So what do you do if you need outside access to a network, have no
administrative rights over the router and firewall, and cannot (or
don't want to) access via VPN?  Fortunately, OpenSSH, the widely
used secure shell (SSH) implementation, offers simple and secure
solutions to this problem.  Almost all Linux/BSD/UNIX/MacOS systems
come with OpenSSH preinstalled, so you might already have it on
your system.</p>

<p>If you can access the closed network from the outside via SSH, this
makes things straightforward as described in Scenario 1 below.  If
not, see Scenario 2.</p>


<h2>Scenario 1: SSH access available from the outside</h2>

<p>Some networks are configured to allow outsiders to connect to an
internal SSH server through port forwarding on the network router:</p>

<pre><code> ###### Closed Network ######
 #                          #
 #  +----------+      +----------+      +----------+
 #  |  Office  |  SSH | Router/  |  SSH | Outside  |
 #  | Computer |&lt;~~~~~| Firewall |&lt;~~~~~| Computer |
 #  +----------+      +----------+      +----------+
 #                          #
 ############################
</code></pre>

<p>For the purposes described here, this is an ideal situation since
it is easy to create a tunnel that connects the outside computer
with the internal network via SSH.  The following command creates
the tunnel when executed on the outside computer:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -D 1337 -C -N company-domain.com
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the port number specified with the -D option should be
greater than 1000 when running as an unpriviledged (non-root) user.
The -C option turns on compression, which is useful for slow network
connections at the cost of little CPU overhead.</p>

<p>With the SSH tunnel in place, you can make most webbrowsers and
other network programs on the outside computer use the tunnel for
all their network traffic by pointing them to the SOCKSv5 proxy
"socks://localhost:1337".  This allows access from programs on the
outside computer to any device within the closed network.  Connections
to the wider internet utilizing the tunnel will originate from an
IP address associated with the closed network, achieving the
objectives stated above.</p>


<h2>Scenario 2: SSH access unavailable from the outside</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, outside SSH access to corporate networks is becoming
increasingly rare.  However, the OpenSSH toolset again offers a
solution if you have a persistent SSH server outside of the network
at your disposal:</p>

<pre><code> ###### Closed Network ######
 #                          #
 #  +----------+      +----------+      +---------+      +---------+
 #  |  Office  |  SSH | Router/  |  SSH | Outside |  SSH | Outside |
 #  | Computer |&lt;~~~~&gt;| Firewall |&lt;~~~~&gt;| Server  |&lt;~~~~~| Laptop  |
 #  +----------+      +----------+      +---------+      +---------+
 #                          #
 ############################
</code></pre>

<p>As long as you can initiate *outgoing* SSH connections from inside
the closed network to your outside SSH server, you can create a
reverse ssh tunnel and utilize it in a similar manner as in the
previous scenario.  On the office computer, create a reverse tunnel
to the outside server:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -f -N -R 10022:localhost:22 outside-server.com
</code></pre>

<p>As long as the above command runs, you can initiate new SSH connections
from the outside server to the office computer with the command
`ssh -p 10022 localhost`.  If you're working from an outside laptop,
you can utilize this reverse tunnel to connect to the office computer
and network.  Add the following configuration to `~/.ssh/config`
on the outside laptop:</p>

<pre><code>Host office_computer
    ProxyCommand ssh -q outside-server.com nc localhost 10022
</code></pre>

<p>With the above configuration, it is very easy to establish a SSH
connection from the outside laptop to the office computer:</p>

<pre><code>ssh office_computer
</code></pre>

<p>As in the previous example, you can use this setup to create a SSH
tunnel all the way from the outside laptop to the office computer:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -D 1337 -C -N office_computer
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this creates a SOCKSv5 proxy that you can use for tunneling
network traffic from the outside laptop to the closed network.  It
is useful to automatically monitor the tunnel status using pgrep(1),
and reinitialize it if the ssh command unexpectedly quits.</p>

<p>When Chinese tech giant ByteDance acquired LA-based <a href="http://musical.ly/">Musical.ly</a> in 2019 to create TikTok, they didn't think the U.S. federal government would even note the transaction.</p>
<p>Then, an obscure group of Treasury Department regulators wrote a report.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/tech/tiktok-deadline-trump-november/index.html">TikTok is sitting in legal purgatory</a>, under pressure from the White House, as companies like Oracle and Microsoft attempt to carve off pieces of it from ByteDance. Should the sale fall apart, there's a real possibility the Department of Justice will sue ByteDance to force a divestment.</p>
<p>The TikTok saga is the tip of the iceberg. As recently as 2017, Chinese venture investors were breaking records, putting in billions of dollars across hundreds of deals in U.S. based startups. By 2019, those numbers had fallen by about half, as this graph from Preqin shows.</p>
<p><img src="https://contrarycap.com/images/content/cfius-graph.png" alt="/images/content/cfius-graph.png"></p>
<p>Simultaneously, regulators <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-grindr-m-a-beijingkunlun/chinas-kunlun-tech-agrees-to-u-s-demand-to-sell-grindr-gay-dating-app-idUSKCN1SJ28N">forced the divestment of Grindr</a> and <a href="https://www.stayntouch.com/news/stayntouch-remains-committed-to-customers-and-growth-after-trump-administrations-order">StayNTouch</a>, and blocked a $1.2B deal between Moneygram and Ant Financial.</p>
<p>What happened? <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/foreign-investment-risk-review-modernization-act-2018">FIRRMA happened</a>.</p>
<p>This law, passed in August 2018, gave significant new powers to a traditionally toothless Treasury agency, and turned it into one of the most important players in the tech world. We're talking about <strong>the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS.</strong></p>
<p>Almost immediately after Congress beefed up CFIUS, there were reports of previously solid deals that began falling apart as VCs and entrepreneurs became cold on working with foreign sources of capital.</p>
<p>Their new reluctance was well-founded. CFIUS 2.0 has created a lot of risk for entrepreneurs and investors that work with foreign-based capital. This post is a guide on when CFIUS comes into play, and a breakdown of how this Treasury agency has changed venture investing in the last two years.</p>
<h2><a name="its-the-critical-technology"></a>It's the Critical Technology</h2>
<p>The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) didn't get a lot of press coverage when President Trump signed it into law in August 2018, but it made CFIUS powerful.</p>
<p>It expanded their jurisdiction to cover a much larger spread of investments made by foreigners — defined as people who aren't citizens or legal residents of the U.S. — compared to before. Previously, CFIUS review was almost always voluntary, and the agency only reviewed deals where a foreign investor would take a majority stake in a company. FIRRMA gave CFIUS the ability to evaluate any investment in a private company, <em>even a minority stake</em>, so long as all one or more of these triggers apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>The business receiving investment "owns, operates, manufactures, fabricates, or services critical infrastructure"</li>
<li>If the company works with a "critical technology" (this includes 27 broad categories, like artificial intelligence, autonomous mobility, battery technology, Fintech, VR, and cybersecurity)</li>
<li>If the company maintains or collects exploitable, sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens.
<ul>
<li>Grindr's sale to a Chinese company in 2016 prompted this, and in March 2019, CFIUS ordered Kunlun Tech to divest Grindr over expected concerns about access to personal data. That's right - CFIUS can launch an investigation and force divestment any time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If CFIUS identifies a security risk, the White House can block a deal or force a divestment. <a href="https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2020/02/new-cfius-regulations-finally-take-effect">This article</a> from the law firm Holland and Knight gives a deeper dive on the regulations and covers some of the nuances, like the <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=bc12e415-9a3f-4f66-a14a-5006c91a8005">exempted countries</a>.</p>
<p>CFIUS has had a significant impact in early-stage investing, because lot of VC deals fall the agency's broad definition of critical technology.</p>
<p>If you're an entrepreneur working in their critical technology space, and you try to take on foreign funding, what happens?</p>
<p>Before 2018, nothing. Now, both parties (the company and the investors) are legally obligated to apply for review by CFIUS. They give out big fines for failing to apply, and they work with the FBI to monitor for deals that tried to sneak through without review. They reject any applications where the investment would pose a "national security risk" - which puts Chinese-based investments under high scrutiny given geopolitical tensions.</p>
<p>This might not sound too onerous, and CFIUS reportedly approves a fair percentage of applicants. The issue is time - CFIUS reviews can take up to 90 days. Entrepreneurs that are raising need a fast yes/no from investors, and many haven't been willing to submit to the delays and scrutiny that come with taking foreign capital. Investors are also advising their companies to hunt for capital elsewhere, instead of from a foreign source that might lead to a CFIUS review or a block.</p>
<p>Now, there is a caveat here. CFIUS only comes into play in a non-controlling investment if the foreign investor gains access to "material nonpublic technical information", or "has substantive involvement in the U.S. business's decision-making with respect to the technology, infrastructure, or data."</p>
<p>This leaves room for a lot of exemptions. For example, a VC firm with American general partners could have all foreign-based LPs, and as long as those LPs were kept in the dark on their portfolio companies (and you can bet the FBI will monitor that) the firm would be in the clear. A "silent money" investor, who gives capital but has no real involvement in the business, would also be safe. But, most founders want more from their investors than capital, and most investors aren't going to make a deal where a single update email could lead to regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>So while there are potential workarounds, the broad definition of "critical technology" and the long review process is chilling certain foreign investment in U.S. startups.</p>
<h2><a name="cfius-makes-their-mark"></a>CFIUS Makes Their Mark</h2>
<p>Let's not overstate it. Despite CFIUS, billions in foreign capital is still flowing through the U.S. startup ecosystem. They try to approve most applications within a month, and the committee has reviewed then approved hundreds, if not thousands, of deals.</p>
<p>At the same time, a lot less deals are being made by Chinese-based investors compared to before. U.S. investors and entrepreneurs aren't accepting their money with such ease, and prospective Chinese investors are deciding the headache just isn't worth it. Given how broad the "critical technology" category is, too many of their deals are required to file the application. For example, Alibaba, which has invested billions in U.S. based startups since 2013, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9f2aaea0-4ae2-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5">made no publicly disclosed investments in the U.S.</a> in 2019. In fact, publicly disclosed investments in US start-ups by Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent fell 84 per cent from 2018, according to an analysis by PitchBook. A number of Chinese VC firms, like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/14/kai-fu-lee-sinovation-ventures-retreats-from-us-amid-trade-dispute.html">Sinovation Ventures</a>, have completely stopped making U.S. investments.</p>
<p>Why have Chinese investors been especially hard hit? It's because CFIUS makes a final decision on whether or not to approve a deal based on national security risk. Current political tensions, the Chinese Communist Party's deep involvement in "private" Chinese companies/investors, and the Communist Party's publicly-admitted habit of IP theft, puts investments stemming from China in a high risk category, according to the federal government.</p>
<p>Post-FIRRMA, the environment has changed so much that Chinese investors are willingly opting out of the U.S. market. Their logic is that successful entrepreneurs running hot startups have plenty of options for financing that won't trigger a review by the U.S. government, so a China-based VC firm is unlikely to get in to the best deals, anyway.</p>
<p>Theodore Schleifer has a <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511540/silicon-valley-foreign-money-china-saudi-arabia-cfius-firrma-geopolitics-venture-capital">solid piece in Recode on foreign cash in Silicon Valley</a>, and collected some interesting words from VCs on how they are cautioning their portfolio companies:</p>
<p>One venture capitalist active in financing companies in frontier technologies said he now assumed that his portfolio companies could never raise money from foreign investors from now on. A second said his firm recommended to a CEO that going through CFIUS review in order to take Chinese capital was not worth the headache. Schleifer writes that "Some in Silicon Valley have even undertaken projects to identify all venture firms primarily backed by the Chinese government — crafting their own private investor blacklists."</p>
<p>These investors are playing it safe for good reason. Ultimately, the new CFIUS, combined with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/14/tensions-with-china-are-rising-whats-next-step/">rising U.S.-China</a> tension, has made it riskier and much more burdensome for entrepreneurs to work with foreign investors. It's also made it riskier for VCs to take on foreign LPs, unless said LPs are truly passive and kept almost completely in the dark on how their portfolio companies are performing. The years of CFIUS flying under the radar have come to an end, and they're going to be a big player in the tech world for decades to come.</p>

<p>The Zoo first opened in 2002.  It was made into a wiki in 2005, and hosted at the University of Waterloo from 2012 to 2020.
</p><p>Errors?  Omissions?  Misattributions?  Your favorite class not here?  Then please contribute to the zoo as you see fit by <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Special:UserLogin" title="Special:UserLogin"> signing up</a> and clicking on the edit links.  Please include references, or better yet links to papers if available.
</p><p>To create a new class, click on the edit link of the class before or after the one that you want to add and copy the format of that class.  (The classes are alphabetized by their tag names.)  Then add the class to the table of contents and increment the total number of classes.  After this, you can use the side edit links to edit the individual sections. For more on using the wiki language, see our <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/index.php?title=Help:Contents&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Help:Contents (page does not exist)"> simple wiki help page</a>.
</p><p>If you would like to contribute but feel unable to make the updates yourself, email the zookeeper at scott at scottaaronson.com.

            <p>TORONTO -- 
	As part of Canadaâ€™s vaccine rollout, the federal government has announced that anyone who experiences a severe adverse reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine will be eligible for compensation â€” a first in Canadaâ€™s history.</p>
<p>
	The no-fault program was announced Thursday, as Canada gets ready to roll out the first of seven new vaccines.</p>
<p>
	â€œSerious side-effects are incredibly rare,â€� Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a press conference Thursday. â€œIn the very unlikely event of an adverse reaction though, we want to make sure Canadians have fair access to support. So today, I can announce that weâ€™re creating a federal support program around vaccine safety for all Canadians and for all vaccines. This includes COVID-19 vaccines that will be rolled out soon.â€�</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>
	Before a vaccine reaches the public, it will have gone through clinical trials involving thousands of people. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which Health Canada approved Wednesday, used more than 40,000 people in its final phases of testing. Although side-effects did occur for some participants, almost all were temporary, and the vaccine has been deemed safe for the general public.</p>
<p>
	Serious reactions are not impossible, however. In the U.K., two people with a history of severe allergic reactions to things such as vaccines, medicine or food <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/u-k-to-refine-allergy-warning-on-pfizer-vaccine-sparked-by-two-adverse-reactions-1.5223107" target="_blank">suffered serious reactions to the Pfizer vaccine this week.</a> The situation is still being investigated to figure out what triggered the reactions.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2020/12/government-of-canada-announces-pan-canadian-vaccine-injury-support-program.html" target="_blank">In a news release on todayâ€™s compensation program</a>, the federal government pointed out that the chances of someone experiencing a truly serious adverse reaction are â€œextremely rare -- less than one in a million.â€�</p>
<p>
	Trudeau added in the press conference that the program was â€œbased on the model that Quebec has had for the last 30 years and follows the lead of all other G7 countries.â€�</p>
<p>
	More than 20 countries already have vaccine injury support programs, according to the press release, with Canada being the last G7 country to follow suit.</p>
<p>
	â€œCanadians can have confidence in the rigour of the vaccine approvals system, however, in the rare event that a person experiences an adverse reaction, this program will help ensure they get the support they need,â€� Health Minister Patty Hajdu said in the release. â€œI will work with my provincial and territorial counterparts to set this program in place quickly.â€�</p>
<p>
	So far, no details have been released on how one would qualify for the program, or how much they could be eligible for in response to a permanent injury as a result of taking a vaccine.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>For reference, this was <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/emacs-user-survey-2020.org">the survey questions</a> in org-mode format.</p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-raw.csv">Raw data</a>
          <ul>
            <li>the reconciled data from both webform and email submissions</li>
            <li>absolutely no change made aside from a few instances where PII and email addresses were redacted</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-clean.csv">Cleaned up data</a><br>
          It might get updated in the future, but right now it was derived from the raw data in a best-effort attempt:
          <ul>
            <li>removed negative years in "For how many years have you been using Emacs?"</li>
            <li>unified responses for "How did you hear about this survey?" as Hacker News, Emacs China and Emacs News weren't part of the options</li>
            <li>unified responses for "Which theme do you use?", especially around spelling</li>
            <li>general cleanup and unified of responses which only differed by punctuation and casing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Statistics about the survey</h2>
      
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>There is a lot of data to look at in many different ways. For now, I performed a simple question-by-question analysis using a <a href="https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-survey/blob/main/2020/Emacs%20User%20Survey%202020.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, since free text was available for most questions, it can be hard to categorize some of the results. For multiple choice questions, I did a best effort attempt to bundle responses with low cardinality into an "other" section, which can get quite big in some cases! I also did not attempt to graph anything for pure free text questions. I encourage anyone who is curious to inspect the full responses, either in the notebook or looking at the data directly. The omitted free text questions are:
        </p><ul>
          <li>If you use org-mode, for what purpose?</li>
          <li>Do you use a language server with lsp-mode or eglot? With what languages?</li>
          <li>Do you use an Emacs debugger interface? What do you use? (Gdb, dap-mode etc)</li>
          <li>What are some of the Emacs improvements you are the most interested in?</li>
          <li>What do you think are Emacs' greatest strengths?</li>
          <li>Can you recall any difficulties you faced initially learning Emacs?</li>
          <li>What is the one thing you would like Emacs to do differently?</li>
          <li>If there is another survey in 2021, would you be opposed to it containing optional &amp; general demographics questions?</li>
          <li>Do you have a preferred platform for filling out the survey in the future?</li>
          <li>Do you have general feedback about the survey process?</li>
        </ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><figure><img alt="Steam network of a Pennsylvania coal power plant" height="433" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-12-10/banner.jpg" width="650"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a_PDPUPuNZ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Adams</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>We recently improved the PostgreSQL wire protocol in QuestDB to support ingesting
messages via Kafka streams. At its heart, the implementation uses an
IODispatcher component, which we thought readers might find interesting to hear
about. This component is a generic core subsystem that is now used to handle all
incoming network connections to QuestDB.</p><p>In this article, you will find out how we achieved garbage-free execution and
how we handle multiple TCP network connections on a single thread, allowing us
to reliably run in multi-tenant mode and directly decouple functionality from
the number of available threads.</p><h2>Flow control<a href="#flow-control" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When we have multiple nodes on a network, there are usually disparities in their
performance in computing power and network bandwidth. Some nodes can read
incoming packets at different rates than others, or conversely, some nodes may
be able to send data at a different rate.</p><p>Let's say we have a network with two nodes; a sender and a receiver. If the
sender can produce a lot more data than the receiver can read, the receiver is
likely to be overwhelmed. We're in luck, though, as TCP uses a built-in flow
control protocol that acts as a pressure valve to ensure the receiver is not
affected by such cases.</p><p>Control flow manifests itself in different ways, depending on whether the
network socket is blocking or non-blocking. If the receiver can process data
faster than a sender, a non-blocking socket is identical to a blocking one, and
the receiver thread would be parked while no data is read. There's not much
concern about this situation if it happens infrequently, but the park and unpark
is a waste of resources and CPU cycles if the receiver is under heavy load.</p><p>Let's assume the receiver gets 0-length data on a non-blocking socket, indicating
no data has arrived from the sender; there are two options:</p><ol><li>Loop over reads continuously, waiting for data to arrive on a socket.</li><li>Stop looping and consult our parser on two possible actions to take: park for
more reads or switch to write.</li></ol><p>The first option is quite wasteful, so we went with the second approach. To park
socket read operations without blocking the thread, we need a dedicated system
to enqueue the socket and notify us when the socket has more data to read. On
the OS kernel level, IO notification utilities exist as <code>epoll</code> on Linux,
<code>kqueue</code> on FreeBSD and OSX, and <code>select</code> on Windows. In QuestDB, we've
implemented a dispatcher that operates exactly as these IO notification systems
for enqueuing sockets, and we named it IODispatcher.</p><h2>Java NIO and garbage collection<a href="#java-nio-and-garbage-collection" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As you would expect from cross-platform languages, the IO Notification system
must be abstracted away to make application code portable. In Java, this
abstraction is called <code>Selector</code>. If we were to oversimplify a typical
interaction with the IO Notification system, it would essentially be a loop.
More often than not, this is an infinite loop, or rather, it executes
continuously during the server's uptime.</p><p>Since we are on a quest to have everything garbage-free, Selector presents a
problem right away - the output of the selector is a set of keys, coming from a
concurrent hash map via an iterator. All of this allocates objects on every
iteration of the loop. If you are not careful, this allocation continues even
when the server is idling. The behavior is intrinsic to the Java Non-blocking
I/O (NIO) implementation and cannot be changed.</p><p>To send or receive data from the network, Java mandates ByteBuffer instances.
When looked at in a vacuum, ByteBuffer may seem like a reasonable abstraction.
But if we look closer, it's easy to see it's a bit confused. It is a concrete
class instead of an interface, meaning that the whole NIO is stuck with the
provided implementation. The API is inconsistent as the OS requires memory
pointers for send and receive methods, but ByteBuffer does not provide an
explicit semantic for each case. So how does ByteBuffer translate to a memory
pointer?</p><p>When your data is on the heap, there is a memory copy for each socket IO. When
ByteBuffer is direct, there is no copy, but there is an issue releasing memory
and general Java paranoia about language safety.</p><div><p>Native Java socket write implementation</p></div><p>Considering the allocating nature of the Selector, that Java NIO libraries are a
layer above the OS, and how computationally expensive the overhead is with
ByteBuffer, we decided to go out on a limb and interact directly with the OS via
the Java Native Interface (JNI). This worked for QuestDB insofar as the API is
non-allocating outside of the normal bootstrap phase and lets us work with the
memory pointers directly.</p><div><p>QuestDB's JNI call for sending data to a socket</p></div><h2>QuestDB's thread model<a href="#questdbs-thread-model" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Starting threads is expensive, and they're more often than not just wrappers for
the connection state. QuestDB operates a fixed number of threads to isolate the
database instance to specific cores and reduce the overhead of starting and
stopping threads at runtime. The actual threads are encapsulated by a WorkerPool
class.</p><p>The worker pool's idea is to have a simple list of "jobs" that all workers will
run all the time. Jobs themselves encapsulate "piece of work" and do not have
tight loops in them. Hence a job can simply return if IO is not available or the
queue is full or empty.</p><p>We have a notion of a "synchronized job." It is different from the definition of
"synchronized" in Java in that the QuestDB's thread never blocks. However,
synchronized jobs guarantee that only one thread can execute a job instance at
any moment in time.</p><h2>Introducing QuestDB's IODispatcher<a href="#introducing-questdbs-iodispatcher" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>IODispatcher is QuestDB's implementation of the IO Notification loop. We have
implemented <code>epoll</code>, <code>kqueue</code>, and <code>select</code>, so this works cross-platform. The
appropriate implementation is automatically chosen at runtime based on the OS.
The IODispatched API is message-driven via QuestDB's implementation of
non-blocking and non-allocating queues. These queues are outside of the scope of
this article, but you can read about them in our community
<a href="https://questdb.io/blog/2020/11/26/http-server-contribution">contribution from Alex Pelagenko</a>.</p><figure><img alt="A diagram of QuestDB's IODispatcher" height="284" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-12-10/iodispatcher-diagram.png" width="650"><figcaption>IODispatcher and queues for events, interest, and disconnections</figcaption></figure><p>IODispatcher is a synchronized job. It consumes queues on the left and publishes
to the queue on the right. Let's take a look at the components in the diagram
above with an outline of their purpose:</p><p><strong>IO Event Queue:</strong> Single publisher, multiple consumer queue. It is the
recipient of the IO events from as in epoll, kqueue, select. The events are
socket handles and the type of operation the OS has associated them with, e.g.,
read or write. The IODispatcher plays the publisher role, and any number of
worker threads are the consumers.</p><p><strong>Interest Queue:</strong> Multiple publisher, single consumer queue. Worker threads
publish socket handles and operations to this queue when IO is unavailable,
e.g., socket read or write returns zero. The IODispatcher will enqueue the
socket handle for more reads or writes as defined by the operation.</p><p><strong>Disconnect Queue:</strong> Multiple publisher, single consumer queue. Worker threads
publish socket handles to this queue destined to be disconnected from the server
and have their resources reused by other connections. The worker thread does not
disconnect the socket by itself because multiple threads may attempt to access a
data structure that is not thread-safe.</p><h3>Configuration<a href="#configuration" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We disregarded ByteBuffer for not being an interface, so it would only be fair
for us to have interfaces in key places. One of these places is configuration,
which provides IODispatcher with basics such as:</p><ul><li>The IP address of the network interface</li><li>Port to bind to</li><li>Bias</li><li>Buffer sizes</li><li>Network facade</li><li>Clock facade</li><li>Connection context factory</li></ul><p>It's necessary to explain bias here, which might not be so obvious. When the TCP
connection is first accepted, it is enqueued for IO right away. The bias
provides an expectation of the initial operation of a connection, such as read
or write. For example, most TCP protocols would have 'read bias', which means
that connecting clients will have to send data before the server replies
anything. You can probably think of a protocol that requires the server to
respond first before the client sends anything - in this case, the bias will be
'write'.</p><p>Network &amp; clock facades have static implementations for production runtime, but
for tests, they can be both spot-implemented to simulate OS failures and produce
stable timestamps.</p><h3>Connection Context<a href="#connection-context" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Connection context is a Java object that encapsulates the connection state,
which is protocol-specific. It is stored together with the socket handle and
managed by IODispatcher via the context factory. We talked a little about the
QuestDB thread model and that workers are very likely to execute the same job
instance simultaneously unless the job is synchronized. In this scenario, the
only place a job can reliably store a state is the connection context.</p><h3>Protocol Parsers<a href="#protocol-parsers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Protocol parsers are used by worker threads to make sense of the incoming data.
QuestDB has a convention that all protocol parsers must be streaming, e.g., they
never hold on to the entirety of the data sent over the network. These parsers
are typically state machines, with state held in connection context. This type
of parser allows fully real-time ingestion of large data segments, such as text
file import.</p><h3>Worker Threads<a href="#worker-threads" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Worker threads are required to consume the IO event queue. You might see already
that the IODispatcher neither reads nor writes connected sockets itself. This is
the responsibility of the worker threads.</p><p>Worker threads almost always use protocol parsers to interpret socket data. They
must continue to work with the socket until the socket cannot read or write
anymore. In which case, the worker threads either express "interest" in further
socket interaction or disconnects the socket. In this situation, IODispatcher is
not on the execution path during most of the socket interaction.</p><h2>Summary<a href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In this article, we've covered our approach to implementing non-blocking IO
using what we think is a …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Can we build a fully-fledged Federated Learning system in less than 20 lines of code? Spoiler alert: yes, we can.</p><p><a href="https://flower.dev/">Flower</a> was built with a strong focus on usability. This blog post shows how we can use Flower and <a href="https://tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> to train <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381">MobilNetV2</a> on <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10</a> - in just 19 lines of code.
The system will start one server and two clients, each holding their own local dataset.</p><h2>Flower client</h2><p>Let's first build the client in <code>client.py</code>.
The client starts by importing Flower (<code>flwr</code>) and TensorFlow, compiling the model (MobileNetV2), and loading the data (CIFAR-10):</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>import</span><span> flwr </span><span>as</span><span> fl
</span><span></span><span>import</span><span> tensorflow </span><span>as</span><span> tf
</span>
<span></span><span># Load and compile Keras model</span><span>
</span><span>model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2((</span><span>32</span><span>, </span><span>32</span><span>, </span><span>3</span><span>), classes=</span><span>10</span><span>, weights=</span><span>None</span><span>)
</span><span>model.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>"adam"</span><span>, </span><span>"sparse_categorical_crossentropy"</span><span>, metrics=[</span><span>"accuracy"</span><span>])
</span>
<span></span><span># Load CIFAR-10 dataset</span><span>
</span>(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()
</code></pre></article></div><p>This should look familiar to anyone who has prior experience with TensorFlow or Keras.
Next, we build a Flower client called <code>CifarClient</code> which is derived from Flower's convenience class <code>KerasClient</code>.
The abstract base class <code>KerasClient</code> defines three methods that clients need to override.
These methods allow Flower to trigger training and evaluation of the previously defined Keras model:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># Define Flower client</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>CifarClient</span><span>(</span><span>fl.client.keras_client.KerasClient</span><span>):</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>get_weights</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> model.get_weights()
</span>
<span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>fit</span><span>(</span><span>self, weights, config</span><span>):</span><span>
</span>        model.set_weights(weights)
<span>        model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=</span><span>1</span><span>, batch_size=</span><span>32</span><span>, steps_per_epoch=</span><span>3</span><span>)  </span><span># Remove `steps_per_epoch=3` to train on the full dataset</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> model.get_weights(), </span><span>len</span><span>(x_train), </span><span>len</span><span>(x_train)
</span>
<span>    </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>evaluate</span><span>(</span><span>self, weights, config</span><span>):</span><span>
</span>        model.set_weights(weights)
<!-- -->        loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>len</span><span>(x_test), loss, accuracy</span></code></pre></article></div><p>Flower's <code>KerasClient.fit</code> method receives weights from the server, updates the model with those weights, trains the model on the locally held dataset (<code>x_train</code>/<code>y_train</code>), and then returns the updated weights (via <code>model.get_weights</code>).
Note that you can do a quick "dry run" by passing <code>steps_per_epoch=3</code> to <code>model.fit</code> - this will only process three batches per epoch instead of the entire dataset.
Remove <code>steps_per_epoch=3</code> to train on the full dataset (this will take longer).</p><p>The <code>evaluate</code> method works similarly, but it uses the provided weights to evaluate the model on the locally held dataset (<code>x_test</code>/<code>y_test</code>).
The last step is to create an instance of <code>CifarClient</code> and run it:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># Start Flower client</span><span>
</span><span>fl.client.start_keras_client(server_address=</span><span>"[::]:8080"</span><span>, client=CifarClient())</span></code></pre></article></div><p>That's it for the client. We create the model, load the data, implement a subclass <code>KerasClient</code>, and start the client. Let's build the server script next.</p><h2>Flower server</h2><p>In a new script called <code>server.py</code>, we add the following two lines to start a Flower server that performs three rounds of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf">Federated Averaging</a>:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>import</span><span> flwr </span><span>as</span><span> fl
</span><span>fl.server.start_server(config={</span><span>"num_rounds"</span><span>: </span><span>3</span><span>})</span></code></pre></article></div><p>That's it! We can now run our system. Are we still within our lines of code limit? Lines of code (excluding blank lines or comments): 19 <!-- -->🎉</p><h2>Running the system</h2><p>First, we start the server:</p><p>Next, we open a new terminal and start the first client:</p><p>Finally, we open another new terminal and start the second client:</p><p>This should result in the following output in terminal 2 or 3 (one of those running <code>client.py</code>).
We can see that three rounds of federated learning improve the accuracy to about 46% on the training set and 28% on the test set (if we train on the full dataset, so no <code>steps_per_epoch=3</code>).
There's obviously lots of room for improvement, for example, by doing more rounds of federated learning and by tuning hyperparameters. </p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>DEBUG flower </span><span>2020</span><span>-12</span><span>-04</span><span> </span><span>18</span><span>:</span><span>57</span><span>:</span><span>18</span><span>,</span><span>259</span><span> | connection.py:</span><span>36</span><span> | ChannelConnectivity.IDLE

Now that I’m a few months in, my journal has since become a trusty sidekick, the daily ritual of its care and feeding now an essential, calming practice. Journaling is how I both start and end my day. It is how I reflect on the activities of the previous week, the highs and lows of the previous month, how I track all of my tasks and todos and remember important events. Writing things down on paper in a structured way has genuinely helped me focus, remember things, think more clearly, maintain other habits, and even pare down my commitments in ways I was never able to achieve with more sophisticated digital tools. And over the years I have tried <em>a lot</em> of digital tools—<a href="https://todoist.com/">todo lists</a>, <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">journaling apps</a>, <a href="https://www.onenote.com/">notetaking apps</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/">apps that transcend these boundaries</a>. I still use these tools, but they have become secondary, playing a supporting role to a <a href="https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebook-medium-a5-hardcover-251-numbered-pages-5-3-4-x-8-1-4-in.html">simple, black dotted notebook</a> that has since become the star of my daily routine.</p><p>The allure and promise of so many digital productivity tools is that they purport to be better than the analog tools from which they derive inspiration. In some ways this is true; they offer near-ubiquitous ease of access, better searchability, collaboration support with distant colleagues, protection against data loss, etc. But computational devices—be they laptops, desktops, phones, tablets—remain fairly poor instruments for the act of <em>thinking</em>. In this, nothing seems to top the simplicity of paper and pen.</p><p>There are several reasons for this:</p><ul><li><p>First, paper is <em>approachable</em> in a way that a blank screen is not. It is disposable. It invites mark-making, doodling, folding, crumpling and tossing. Something about the tangiblity of paper feels less intimidating during those tenuous first moments when you’re trying to coax your mind to focus and action. But beyond that it encourages fiddling, which in turn stimulates the mind in a way I haven’t found replicable with digital devices. Without a better way of describing it, paper is simply more human.</p></li><li><p>Second, paper is <em>immediate</em>. There is no machine to power on, no app to find and open. It’s just right there, available and ready to absorb a thought. Assuming you have a pen handy, the number of obstacles you have to overcome from moment you have a thought to recording that thought is essentially zero.</p></li><li><p>Finally, paper encourages <em>focus</em>. It is a single-purpose object without unnecessary distractions. Whether you’re taking notes in a notebook or papering your wall with post-it notes, analog tools create an environment that won’t distract you from the task of thinking. There are no notifications, no icons tempting you to browse the web or check Twitter.</p></li></ul><p>A few days ago I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrhBaR2fNjQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=TheGeneralist">watched a panel conversation</a> put together by Mario Gabriele of <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/">The Generalist</a> on independent research, tools for thought and internet academia. The conversation opens with the question: “What is your favorite tool for thought?” Several of the panelists respond by sharing favorite analog tools—reams of dot-matrix printer paper, four-color pens, books, post-it notes. When any panelist did share a digital tool—<a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na</a> or <a href="">Google Scholar</a>, for instance—it was a tool used for purposes of information gathering and organization rather than creating, assembling, drawing, searching for patterns, the hard work of thought.</p><p>Computing just isn’t there yet.</p><p>The devices <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022035044/http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/SciAmDraft3.html">Mark Weiser once dreamed about</a> have become reality, with input modalities on par with the expressive fidelity of paper and pen. And perhaps one day we will invent better tools for augmenting thought beyond digital facsimiles of analog solutions. But not without much more investment in this space. Over two decades ago, during the heyday of labs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_%28company%29">Xerox PARC</a>, computing tools for thinking, productivity and creativity felt richly explored and researched. Today, the bulk of the tech world has focused on, as <a href="https://twitter.com/_adamwiggins_">Adam Wiggins</a> asserts in the conversation mentioned above, social media, video, search, and other consumer-focused endeavors. The promise of computing to serve human creativity, thought, and productivity feels, these days, somewhat quaint—a whisper of some bygone era lost in a cacophony of services competing for ever-smaller slices of attention.</p><p>There’s a lot of room to innovate, but lately the industry feels like it’s lost all ambition here.</p></article></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="project-requirements">Project requirements</h2>

<p>I decided that I wanted to build a spaced-repetition training app, rather than reuse a general-purpose spaced-repetition flash-card system such as Anki, because the project would benefit from domain-specific knowledge. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exercises have large numbers of variants, such as “short-hop” vs “full-hop”, or “facing left” vs “facing right”, which should be tracked separately.</li>
  <li>Many of the exercises have natural dependencies on others: they shouldn’t be attempted unless a certain underlying fundamental skill has been mastered.</li>
  <li>Exercises to train one character don’t necessarily confer the same skill for other characters. Some exercises may only be applicable to some characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to make an app to automate the spaced repetition regimen I was attempting to follow by hand, which I could then share with others.</p>

<p>Here were my engineering requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should be mobile-first, but preferably also available on desktop.</li>
  <li>Should be local-first, or at least not require creating an account to use.</li>
  <li>Should be architected to support sync between devices, although the sync itself was not a requirement for the first iteration.</li>
  <li>Should have approximately zero hosting costs.</li>
  <li>Should be hosted on of a stable platform which doesn’t require monitoring (e.g. not my home computer).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="domain-name">Domain name</h2>

<p>I wanted to choose between a permutation like the following for the domain name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>smashtraining.com</li>
  <li>ssbtraining.com</li>
  <li>smash.training</li>
  <li>ssb.training</li>
  <li>smash.fit</li>
  <li>ssb.fit</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, I used <code>ssb.fit</code> because 1) <code>smash.training</code> got taken (!) and 2) I wanted to optimize for typing it in on a mobile device, even though the name is less memorable. This lack of memorability unfortunately manifested in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyHand/comments/gp9sem/wtf_was_that_smash_training_website_called/frkscwe/?context=3">this Reddit thread titled “WTF was that smash training website called?”</a>. However, another commenter writes “ssb.fit is better, short for mobile”, perhaps vindicating the original choice.</p>

<p>It’s unfortunate that the domain name and the website title don’t exactly match up. Many people seemed to address it as “ssb.fit” hence, so maybe that’s what the project should have been called too (rather than “Smash Training”).</p>

<h2 id="user-studies-and-ui">User studies and UI</h2>

<p>I conducted several user studies with friends and family, including some people who had played Smash before and some who hadn’t.</p>

<h3 id="ui">UI</h3>

<p>The first main thing I iterated on was the design of the exercise tracker widget. I originally based it off of the <em>Stronglifts</em> app:</p>

<figure>
        <a href="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/stronglifts.png"><img src="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/stronglifts.png" alt="Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app." title="Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app."></a>
        <figcaption><p>Advertisement screenshot of the Stronglifts workout app.</p>
</figcaption>
      </figure>

<p><em>Stronglifts</em> has you note down how many repetitions of the exercise you succeeded at (out of five). However, the <em>Smash Training</em> paradigm is different, and has you repeat the exercise for a length of time and rate your accuracy.</p>

<p>I experimented with a “smiley-face” UI rather than a rep-count UI, as in Stronglifts, along with a few other options. After a lot of feedback from friends, I arrived at a slider-based widget like this:</p>

<figure>
        <a href="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/smash-training-exercise-widget.png"><img src="https://waleedkhan.name/blog/assets/posts/smash-training-retrospective/smash-training-exercise-widget.png" alt="Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget." title="Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget."></a>
        <figcaption><p>Screenshot of the Smash Training exercise widget.</p>
</figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>This uses a slider approach (with five possible notches), and renders a description of what each notch corresponds to, i.e. “all or nearly all reps correct”.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p>The second main thing was the ordering of the elements in the “Learn exercise” page. Each exercise has a step-by-step description of how to do the exercise, what controller inputs must be performed, background on the technique and its importance, a video tutorial, etc.</p>

<p>My assumption was that most people would read very little of it, so I should put the most important items first. However, various users disagreed on which item was the most important. There was no strong consensus, but the end result was this ordering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step-by-step exercise description.</li>
  <li>Controller inputs.</li>
  <li>Technique overview.</li>
  <li>The rest of the documentation elements (not as important).</li>
</ul>

<p>There were also hints on these steps such as how to enter the Training Stage to perform the exercises. Some users missed these steps altogether, and were left confused on how to perform the exercise. Unfortunately, I was unable to design a UI that mitigated this problem.</p>

<h2 id="tech-stack">Tech stack</h2>

<p>I chose to write a web-app, since they are cross-platform and I already had some familiarity with the area. In particular, I didn’t want to spend money on an iOS developer license, but I also didn’t want to exclude iOS users. (Post-hoc analytics indicate that the ratio of Android-to-iOS users is about 2:1, which consitutes a significant cohort for iOS.)</p>

<h3 id="build-system">Build system</h3>

<p>All Javascript web-app bundling solutions are fundamentally terrible, and Webpack is no exception. But it works.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/commit/f621f02af95da697435cb720563b590d57f38b87">I encountered one mysterious bug in Babel during development</a>, which I was unable to isolate. I worked around it by targeting only newer browsers, after which the problem disappeared.</p>

<p>I used <code>vue-cli-service</code> as a wrapper around the build, test, and lint actions, as recommended by Vue. But I found it hard to configure and debug. When I had an issue with tests not properly compiling an imported module, <a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/blame/d0c31a33ab880e8c58824c0f58247c8bd8f38485/src/utils.ts#L38-L44">I gave up and reimplemented the function I needed myself</a>.</p>

<h3 id="typescript">TypeScript</h3>

<p>I also used <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, since I find its static typing system useful for maintenance purposes.</p>

<p>TypeScript support for Vue was not ideal. Many Vue patterns are not easy to express in TypeScript. Libraries like <a href="https://github.com/istrib/vuex-typescript"><code>vuex-typescript</code></a> exist, but require a lot of boilerplate in order to get static typing support. The <a href="https://github.com/paroi-tech/direct-vuex"><code>direct-vuex</code></a> library had less boilerplate, but <a href="https://github.com/arxanas/smashtraining/commit/9a8c0c0baf05d048a564b11f62afdfafc9f66a62">I couldn’t figure out how to test it</a>.</p>

<p>TypeScript was generally pleasant to work with, although in the project, I pushed it to its extremes and it was unable to keep pace. In my case, it was unable to track associated/mapped types adequately. It’s perhaps exemplified by this <code>@ts-ignore</code> comment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>TechVariantOf</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>extends</span> <span>TechId</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// @ts-ignore "Type 'x' cannot be used to index type 'AllTechVariants'."</span>
  <span>// Strangely, the correct type is calculated here anyways, and can be used for</span>
  <span>// exhaustiveness-checking later.</span>
  <span>[</span><span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>keyof</span> <span>AllTechMetadata</span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>][</span><span>"</span><span>variants</span><span>"</span><span>]]:</span> <span>AllTechVariants</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>];</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also ran into <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/13215#issuecomment-531632919">this issue</a> when working on the same thing.</p>

<p>Given that this is reasonably advanced type-level hackery, I was generally happy with TypeScript’s ability to describe the data domain.</p>

<h3 id="vue">Vue</h3>

<p>I chose to use <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> as the front-end web framework, since I had heard good things about it from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. In particular, I wanted an opinionated framework, so as to spend less time configuring things myself.</p>

<p>When I used it, Vue promoted the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html">“single-file component”</a> system, in which HTML, CSS, and Javascript are mixed into the same file. It was not a great experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This complicates the build process, as something has to convert these single-file components into assets consumable by the browser.</li>
  <li>The mental model is an extra layer of indirection, as these single-file components are themselves compiled into Javascript classes, but also contain Javascript classes in the script portion of the file.</li>
  <li>The tooling support was poor. For example, go-to-definition doesn’t work on the HTML components, despite the fact that they’re ultimately backed by Javascript classes.</li>
  <li>TypeScript does not check the HTML components.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would have preferred to use a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html">JSX</a> solution, as it removes some of the indirection and has better tooling support.</p>

<p>I wish Vue had fewer ways to do things. For example, attributes on HTML elements can be set with the normal <code>=</code> syntax, but also with a leading <code>:</code> (expression evaluation) or a leading <code>@</code> (callback) for brevity. In comparison, React with JSX only has <code>=</code> for all of these situations.</p>

<h3 id="vuetify">Vuetify</h3>

<p><a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/">Vuetify</a> is a library to provide Material Design UI for Vue. The presence of a solid, all-in-one Material Design library was one other reason why I chose to use Vue. The library and documentation are both very good, and I was able to prototype my app (from a UI perspective) effectively. I would strongly recommend it if you’re using Vue.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/pull/8877">I opened one pull request</a> for the documentation, which was merged promptly, <a href="https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/10140">and +1’d one documentation issue</a>, which has a workaround but unfortunately remains unresolved.</p>

<h3 id="netlify-for-hosting">Netlify for hosting</h3>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to host the front-end of the website using its free tier, and stored data locally for the user. This worked well, as Netlify knew how to build and deploy my Vue project, and had good Github integrations.</p>

<p>Another option would have been Github Pages, which would have made the project dependent on fewer underlying services, but also would have required me to write a build step of my own.</p>

<h3 id="custom-database">Custom database</h3>

<p>I stored data locally on the client using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"><code>localStorage</code> APIs</a>. I was careful to design the data schema such that it was append-only and such that each record had a unique ID, the idea being to make it easy to merge changes from multiple clients. However, this alone makes it difficult to delete records without some more thought.</p>

<p>I later discovered <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> as a distributed document-store in exactly the manner I had already architected my application, but including sync and delete capabilities. I also discovered the <a href="https://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a> library, which exposes a CouchDB interface and allows you to store your data locally or sync it remotely. It also supports more backends than just <code>localStorage</code>.</p>

<p>I wish I had used PouchDB from the beginning! Now I’m stuck with an inefficient, feature-lacking implementation of it, which would …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Clicking on an application opens up the corresponding Spark UI. That’s it!</p><h2>How Does It Work? Is It Secure?</h2><p>This project consists of two parts:</p><ul role="list"><li>An <a href="https://github.com/datamechanics/delight" target="_blank">open-source</a> Spark agent which runs inside your Spark applications. This agent will stream non-sensitive Spark event logs from your Spark application to our backend.</li><li>A closed-source backend consisting of a real-time logs ingestion pipeline, storage services, a web application, and an authentication layer to make this secure.<br></li></ul><figure id="w-node-6a6ad7bcf1a5-19fe54b3"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5fb2b739e125da142c5bbf46_ezgif.com-gif-maker.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The agent collects your Spark applications event logs. This is non-sensitive information about the metadata of your Spark application. For example, for each Spark task there is metadata on memory usage, CPU usage, network traffic (<a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e724862760345325327026c/5fc104251c29738912ed5a94_Sample%20Event%20Log%20Delight.png" target="_blank">view a sample event log</a>). The agent does not record sensitive information such as the data that your Spark applications actually work on. The agent does not collect your application logs either -- as typically they may contain sensitive information.<br></p><p>This data is encrypted using your personal access token and sent over the internet using the HTTPS protocol. This information is then stored securely inside the Data Mechanics control plane behind an authentication layer. Only you and your colleagues from your Google/GSuite organization will be able to see your application in our dashboard. The collected data will automatically be deleted 30 days after your Spark application completion.&nbsp;</p><h2>What’s Next?</h2><p>The release of this free and cross-platform hosted Spark History Server is our first step towards building a Spark UI replacement tool called <a href="https://www.datamechanics.co/delight" target="_blank">Data Mechanics Delight</a>. This will be a free and cross-platform Spark UI replacement with new metrics and visualizations that will "delight" you! Our announcement in June 2020 to build a Spark UI replacement had indeed generated a <a href="https://www.datamechanics.co/blog-post/building-a-better-spark-ui-data-mechanics-delight" target="_blank">lot of interest</a> from the Spark community. We’re targeting the next release for January 2021.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5ef23be7c40e3df997a03146_gif4.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We know the current release is far from what Delight fans expect, but we hope it will still be valuable to the Spark community, as the Spark History Server is not always easy to set up. More importantly, the current release means we have built most of the base infrastructure of the project -- the Spark agent, a real-time logs collection pipeline, a storage system, an authentication layer and a webapp. We will now gradually add the new screens and visualizations that the community awaits.<br></p><p>The next release of Delight, scheduled in January 2021, will consist of an overview screen giving a bird’s-eye view of your applications’ performance. Links to specific jobs, stages or executor pages will still take you to the corresponding Spark UI pages until we gradually replace these pages too.

    <p>Hey,</p>

<p>no no, wait, <strong>why not</strong>?</p>
<p>see, with CI/CD being part of Kubernetes through projects like Argo and Tekton,
where you declare what your pipeline/workflow will be in terms of Kubernetes
resources, we’re now able to get that nice pizza for the team after a
successfull release.</p>

<h2 id="installation">installation</h2>
<p>being a legit Kubernetes custom resource, you install it just like you would
install Tekton, kpack, or anything like that: you submit a manifest that
contains the <code>CustomResourceDefinition</code> objects to Kubernetes, a <code>Deployment</code>
that materializes the controller as a container in a pod, and then … that’s
it!</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller
cd pizza-controller

kapp deploy -a pizza-controller -f ./config/release.yaml


# OR .. plain old kubectl
#
kubectl apply -f ./config/release.yaml
</code></pre><h2 id="but-thats-dumb">but, that’s dumb</h2>
<p>i disagree</p>
<p>I think it’s a pretty cool example of the concepts behind extending
kubernetes via custom resources, and something that might bring you some
thoughts of ways in which you could bring the
declarative nature of Kubernetes objects plus the level-triggered approach to
controllers to bring to Kubernetes the ability to request external resources.</p>
<p>for instance, projects like <a href="https://crossplane.io/">crossplane</a> give you pretty
much that, except that instead of ordering a pizza, you’re ordering … a
database (or things like that).</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h2>
<p>are you <em>really</em> into ordering pizza using <code>kubectl</code>?</p>
<p>like, really? are you sure?</p>
<p>here’s what’s missing:</p>
<ul>
<li>well, any .. tests :horse:</li>
<li>order tracking (it’s <code>xml</code>-based - SOAP stuff)</li>
<li>being more flexible with non-canadian folks (it’s currently hardcoded for
Canada, but could easily be changed)</li>
</ul>
<p>at the moment I got my pizza .. development finished :sweat_smile: maybe you’ll
carry it forward? head to <a href="https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller">https://github.com/cirocosta/pizza-controller</a></p>

<p>It's been a really long ride at <a href="http://cloak.ist/">Cloakist</a>.</p><p>I've been through the highest highs, and the lowest lows.</p><p>But now, looking back on it all, with $9.99 coming into my bank account every month <em>just like clockwork</em>, I can definitively say:</p><p>It's all been worth it.</p><p>Here is the story of how I managed to turn 7 years of my life into cold, hard cash.</p><p>And not just any amount of cash.</p><p>$9.99 so far.</p><h2 id="you-can-t-succeed-without-starting">You can't succeed without starting</h2><p>7 years ago, I was just another incredibly privileged highly-skilled software developer whose parents can support him indefinitely meaning he doesn't have to get a proper job and can risk it all on starting a business, even though his Uncle Les offered him a good, stable living as a junior accountant at his firm, as his mum never goddamn stops reminding him.</p><p>Today, I am the CEO of a successful startup.</p><p>How did I get there?</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>I started.</p><p>One day, I woke up and navigated to <a href="https://godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com</a>.</p><p>You might not have heard of it if you aren't a software developer.</p><p>It's a place you go to buy startup websites.</p><p>It's really that simple. You think of a name, and then you go there and type it in.</p><p>In <em>seconds, </em>you'll have results showing you whether your name is available.</p><p>For me, it took a few tries to get it right. I started off trying <code>business.com</code> Â&nbsp;because I wanted my business to have a name that made it clear that it was a business.</p><p>But it was already taken.</p><p>So I moved onto <code>company.com</code>. That was taken too.</p><p>Eventually I landed on https://cloak.ist.</p><p>The journey had started.</p><h2 id="the-long-hard-slog">The long hard slog</h2><p>But boy, it was one hell of a journey.</p><p>This is where another key startup concept comes in:</p><p><em>The pivot.</em></p><p>I wasn't always banking hot, fresh Benjamins from selling custom domains as a service, like I do now.</p><p>I went through 365 different products <em>a year</em> before I settled on custom domains.</p><p>You might be thinking 'Huh, strange â€“ that's the exact number of days in a year'.</p><p>You've hit the nail on the head.

That was a particularly hard pivot to make.</p><p>There were many, many clients in the plus-age category who needed ambulatory assistance with regards to pedestrian activity.</p><p>In other words, they needed help crossing the road.</p><p>And there was teaching coding to the kids at the local primary school, until the bullying became too much for me to handle.</p><p>But here's why none of those NCaaS offerings could ever have worked:</p><p><em>I wasn't getting recurring revenue.</em></p><p>None of my customers came back for a second time.</p><p>It wasn't anything to do with me.

<![CDATA[Implementing Rust's dbg! in Python]]>

December 11, 2020 | https://rtpg.co/2020/12/11/dbg-in-python.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rtpg.co/2020/12/11/dbg-in-python.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Rust has an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-next/dbg-macro.html">amazing dbg macro</a> that lets you quickly set up an expression printer that will also put in the source line. It also returns the value of the expression so you can even easily inline the printing when you want to! </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>dbg!</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span>
<span>//      ^-- prints: [src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Doing a bunch of Python, I <em>want this</em> in Python as well. I want a debug macro, one that gives me the file location + the expression used to calculate the value.</p>
<p>My <em>ideal</em> would be to have a function where <code>dbg(foo.bar[1])</code> that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>print <code>[source line] foo.bar[1] = &lt;the value&gt;</code></li>
<li>return the value so we can use it within expressions easily</li>
</ul>
<p>When doing this by hand I always reach for <code>f</code>-strings, to do something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"foo.bar[1]=</span><span>{</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is annoying because you end up typing the same expression twice, you can't inline it, and it just doesn't look very cool.</p>
<p>The first thing when trying to implement this is to come to terms with Python's lack of macros. You can't really mess with the syntax tree, so you're really only operating on calculated values. So it's really hard to capture an expression <em>and its result</em> in a single operation because, well, your expressions get evaluated.</p>
<p>So it'll be hard, to print <code>some_expr = &lt;result of some_expr&gt;</code> without providing the string of <code>some_expr</code> at one point.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, thanks to <code>eval</code>, you can flip this idea on its head. You <em>need</em> the string for the expression, but you don't need the expression itself!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'bar'</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar'[]"</span><span>))</span> <span># prints 3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>One step backwards, let's now go two steps forward. We can start writing our <code>dbg</code> helper function</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"bar"</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar']"</span><span>)</span>  <span># foo['bar'] = 3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far so good, we have a nice pretty printer here at the cost of two quotation marks.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn't work perfectly:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span> <span># expr = expr</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turns out that when calling <code>eval</code> without arguments we are evaluating <em>within the scope of <code>dbg</code></em>. Our examples work because <code>dbg</code> is defined alongside our expressions (so <code>foo</code> is accessible within <code>dbg</code>) but it's susceptible to name shadowing or outright not being able to calculate the expression because it could be defined in a different scope</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span># we're calculating the result here....</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span># but actually want to calculate</span>
<span># the result within this scope</span>
<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>eval</code> by default will evaluate the expression within the current frame. But we can pass in our own globals and locals to instead evaluate the expression within an arbitrary environment</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"x"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"x"</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span><span>}))</span> <span># gives 4</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So let's reproduce the caller's environment to get us the right results. Enter <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html"><code>inspect</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four main kinds of services provided by this module: type checking, <em>getting source code</em>, inspecting classes and functions, and <em>examining the interpreter stack</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's try out <code>inspect.stack()</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>inspect</span>

<span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>code_context</span><span>)</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar']"</span><span>)</span>

<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span>

<span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Passed"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>trying this out, we get the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>Passed</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since this is in a function call we'll actually need to go up the stack one frame (<code>inspect.stack()[1]</code>) to get the proper line:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>'dbg("foo[</span><span>\'</span><span>bar</span><span>\'</span><span>]")</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>'dbg("expr")</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>'if dbg("True"):</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>Passed</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK, now we are getting closer to where we need. the second element in our stack is where we'll also get the file path and the line number. Let's clean this up a bit and now we get:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Here we have the full file path... one might do a trick here to stick with the file name:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>frame</span>
    <span>filename</span> <span>=</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>filename</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"[</span><span>{</span><span>filename</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>{</span><span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>lineno</span><span>}</span><span>] </span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK so with this we end up with the following nice printed output</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK so this is good on the formatting. But we still haven't fixed <code>eval</code>! That's a tiny fix this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>frame</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>f_globals</span><span>,</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>f_locals</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This gets us the right values, properly evaluating <code>expr</code> from the calling scope instead of <code>dbg</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span> 
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>f_globals</code> and <code>f_locals</code> on the frames is still one of my favorite Python features. It lets basically anyone write very good debugging tools without having to do a bunch of magic.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, if you're an IPython user you can add this to <a href="https://switowski.com/blog/ipython-startup-files">a startup script</a>  over in <code>~/.ipython/profile_default/</code> and make this available in any interactive shell.</p>
<p>For those who value silly things like correctness, performance, and intellectual integrity your journey ends here. This is a nice little helper that you can use in your projects, and there's nothing else for you to see here.</p>
<p>For those who like to live dangerously, I have something to show you.....</p>
<p>



So.</p>
<p>Inside the frame, we have a bunch of information, but one thing that's pretty nice for explorative debugging is the <code>code_context</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>code_context</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
<span># prints dbg('foo["bar"]')</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we actually have the source line from the <code>dbg</code> call built in!</p>
<p>Let's imagine going back a bit to our "idealized" debug function:</p>


<p>Now, if we ran such a function, the body would receive the <em>value</em> of <code>foo['bar']</code> and not the expression. <em>But</em> thanks to the stack we could theoretically recover the original expression! </p>
<p>This gets a bit tricker if you want to do more clever stuff like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>my_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>"()"</span><span>)))</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span><span>:</span>
   <span>do_stuff</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But let's try to work this out from first principles a bit.</p>
<p>If you have the source code line with the <code>dbg</code> call, how can you recover the expression being debugged?</p>
<p>The first thing is just to find the beginning of the expression. That's pretty easy, just look for <code>dbg(</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>if dbg(my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:
   ^^^^
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we find the beginning of the expression, right? And since a function call in Python is an open parentheses, some expressions, then a close parentheses, we just have to find the close parentheses and we have the string fragment representing our expression. Let's apply the logic here:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>if dbg(my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre></div>

<p>Great! Our expression is <code>my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "(</code>. Definitely what we wanted. Yep.</p>
<p>This is one of those things where the only way to parse out an expression is to actually parse it out. Simple string matching won't cut it, especially when you start getting inner function calls in the mix.</p>
<p>You could write a simple parser, try and count parens, open quotes, escaping in quotes, all the fun little games. But honestly I want a thing that works, and I don't want to think about it too hard.</p>
<p>I just want to find out where the expression is in this string.</p>
<p>So here's my amazing plan to deal with this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:'</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5'</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == '</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")'</span><span>)</span>
<span># doesn't fail =&gt; I have my expression!</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I just start with the longest possible string, and slowly shrink it until I find something that looks like an expression. Because the <code>)</code> from the debug call imbalances everything I'm like... 80% sure that this way of finding the expression is correct.</p>
<p>There are some edge cases that make this strategy not work. For example if you do something like:</p>


<p>You have two <code>dbg</code>s on the same line, so it's hard to know <em>which</em> call you're in, because you're only provided the line number. (On some other project I spent a lot of time hand-wringing on this exact problem and could not find a solution, even with tricks like counting executions. I'm fairly convinced this is equivalent to the halting problem somehow)</p>
<p>And to be honest my solution here isn't battle-tested, it just feels right and works with the complicated expressions I've thrown at it. But it was a fun thing to write and now the following works:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>])</span>
<span># [pyhelpers.py: 49] foo["bar"] = 3</span>

<span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>my_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>"()"</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span><span>:</span>
<span># [pyhelpers.py: 52] my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()") = 5</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Success"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>No more stringifying silliness, no more calls to <code>eval</code>, just a really silly parsing hack that has no real foundation except my gut feeling. </p>
<p>Good enough for me!</p>
<p>the final implemetaion is below:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""</span>
<span>    Recover the expression giving the result, and then</span>
<span>    print a helpful debug statement showing this</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a financial index that <strong>rates data sets</strong> by their markets' performance (<strong>liquidity</strong> and <strong>equality of liquidity shares</strong>). <strong>Check out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">website</a></strong> and the minimalistic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/changelog.txt">blog</a>, or keep on reading the article.</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/rugpullindex.png" alt="A screenshot of the
rugpullindex.com website"></p>
<h2 id="why-building-a-data-set-index">Why Building a Data Set Index?</h2>
<p><strong>Would you pay a stranger on the internet</strong> to buy a data set their offering without knowing them or ever having seen the data? Tough decision! But that's precisely the type of situation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> users face in its newly-launched decentralized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">data set market</a> [3].</p>
<p>I'll spare you most of the details of how it all works and say this: 2020's most transforming technology has been <strong>on-chain markets</strong>. In particular, the implementation that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://uniswap.org/">uniswap.org</a> is using called <strong>automated market makers</strong>.</p>
<p>Simply put, they work by incentivizing users to <em>pool</em> a pair of assets at a ratio they deem as the assets' current prices. These users, I herein call them <strong>liquidity providers</strong>, e.g., pool 1 ETH and 540 USDC, so that when a buyer of either asset comes along, they can immediately trade 1 ETH for 540 USDC or 540 USDC for 1 ETH. This principle works fantastically at scale, as the pool incentivizes liquidity-providing by charging buyers and sellers a small fee, which is distributed by the pool to each liquidity provider, respectively [1].</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/marketmakers.png"></p>
<p>This model has been so successful that there've been days where decentralized trading on Uniswap outperformed volumes on Coinbase! Which, of course, has lots of implications on the cryptocurrency space. I think it's no overstatement to say that automated market makers may be <strong>the killer app for crypto</strong>.</p>

<p>But there's one implication I've been particularly keen on exploring: all <strong>the openly-accessible data produced by on-chain markets</strong>. See, if you ever tried building a trading bot, you'll have noticed the terrible resolution publicly-available market data has. You might have also noticed that it's quite difficult even to find data at all. It's not by accident. <strong>Trading data is valuable</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="rating-a-data-set-by-its-markets-performance">Rating a Data Set by its Market's Performance</h2>
<p>Remember when I asked you at the beginning of this article about <strong>buying a data set from a random stranger on the internet?</strong> Well, it turns out that Ocean Protocol is now betting on the same technology that made Uniswap successful. They allow users to publish a data set, along with a fungible <strong>data token</strong> and an integrated <strong>automated market maker</strong>. Meaning, you can now buy access to a data set by purchasing tokens. These tokens get priced by liquidity providers providing a ratio of OCEAN Tokens to <em>data tokens</em>.</p>
<p>However, just because data sets are now available for sale on the market, doesn't mean you know they're valuable! After all, if ebay.com didn't have a rating system for sellers, how would you know which seller to trust?</p>
<p>On ebay.com, you know which seller to trust because you can see how many articles they've sold and what each buyer's experience was. It's a simple identity-based rating system.</p>
<p>But within the anarchistic world of cryptocurrencies, there are no working identity-based rating systems! Instead, the space is filled with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account">sock puppets</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">sybils</a>. <strong>Then, without buying a data set first, how are we supposed to know if a data set is valuable or an outright scam?</strong></p>
<h2 id="introducing-rugpullindex.com">Introducing rugpullindex.com</h2>
<p>That's where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> comes into play. <strong>We crawl all of Ocean Protocol's data token pools daily</strong> and rate each market's liquidity provider distribution by its equality using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficient</a>. While ranking markets based on their liquidity is common industry-practice, calculating a Gini score for each market's liquidity provider shares isn't. The idea behind this is that the more liquidity providers with an equal share back an asset in the market, the less likely it is for a "rug pull" attack to happen (details <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/multi-repo-issue/issues/30#issuecomment-726132174">here</a>). By factoring in a pool's relative liquidity, it allows us to derive a score <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>100</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0 &lt; s &lt; 100</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>For users of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>, this <strong>yields a few attractive benefits</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They can now choose to adjust their data set investments based on market data.</li>
<li>They can decide to invest in data sets relative to their performance on to <em>increase their diversivication and hence lower their exposure risk</em>. And finally;</li>
<li>If they're unsure about <strong>sending a random stranger on the internet money for a data set</strong>, they can check out the data set's market performance to make an informed decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a widely-known fact that index-based investment yields superior results compared to stock picking [2]. The same is true when <em>investing</em> in data, which makes me excited about working on this project.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-future-hold">What Does The Future Hold?</h2>
<p>I have many ideas for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> and not as much time as I'd like to have. However, my overarching goal is to make the ranking so reliable that I can build a smart contract-based index fund on top of it.</p>
<p>I think that rating assets based on their markets' performance is valuable occupation in itself. Not only within the data set market but beyond. I'm particularly interested in rating a wide range of on-chain asset markets, but I'm also thinking about rating more on-chain intellectual property markets. I'm eager to crawl more data and explore. Until then, I hope you're having fun using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Transcript: </strong>Lecture two will attempt to answer one of the paradoxes I raised in the first lecture – and this will be a specific form of it – and that’s a rather famous charge in philosophy. In fact this is the charge of relativism and one of the things that professional philosophers do in order to display their professional credentials is to respond to the relativist and to the sceptic. Nietzsche has been accused of being a relativist. One form of this accusation is a kind of mislabelling – in my opinion it’s a mislabelling – of Nietzsche’s view about the function of truth and lie. He opposes that to true and false. Truth and lie. The function of that within philosophical discourse. He has an account of that we are going to discuss. <span id="more-53"></span></p>
<p>One of the ways that philosophers have mislabelled this position is “perspectivism”, and the reason I hate that label is like “relativism”, it makes someone think that someone – in this case Nietzsche, or someone else – might hold the absolutely ridiculous view that every view was as good as every other view. That is a complete straw person argument. No-one has ever – or does now – hold the view that every view is as good as every other view.</p>
<p>So whenever the spectre of relativism is raised, you know, by someone for you, either in the popular press or in a university setting, the first small thing that should come to your mind is there aren’t any. So the refutation in a certain sense is bound to miss at least one point, namely that you are not arguing against anyone. Now it could be the case that my audience today, or the audience that will watch the tapes, I will find someone in the United States, or across the world that will hold the view that every other view is as good as every other view. But if I do, it will be very idiosyncratic, and in my experience so far, no.</p>
<p>Nietzsche is not a relativist, and I think perspectivism is also an unfortunate term to describe Nietzsche’s style of thinking. Because perspectivism calls up the idea that, “Well, I am right from my perspective, and you are right from your perspective, and everybody is right from their perspectives”, and I also don’t believe that that’s a view that anyone can hold or has ever held. I think, and this is the the way I will try to discuss Nietzsche’s paradox in terms of relativism, is that…</p>
<p>Nietzsche was opposed to what might be called the dogmatism of not only the Western Philosophical tradition, but the Western Theoretical tradition in general. Its dogmatism in this regard. Believing… about its beliefs that they were good not only for them and their tribe… because after all Western Civilisation is a big word… it’s a strange word… you know, big words and strange words, but, after all it is just a very large tribe with very large armies and lots of televisions… and a large historical project, but still its a tribe. Big, big tribe.</p>
<p>I think Nietzsche considered it dogmatic to hold that your beliefs – or the beliefs of your tribe – were binding on all. That is the way I want to present Nietzsche’s perspectivism. In other words, he didn’t believe that all beliefs were equally good, interesting, or whatever. In fact, I am sure he considered some of his own beliefs to be far more interesting than for example, the beliefs of John Stuart Mill, who he referred to as “That blockhead”. Or I think that he found his views more interesting than the views of the English Utilitarians in general, about whom he said “No human beings want to be happy. Only the British want that”. [crowd laughter]. So I think he thinks his views were more interesting than those.</p>
<p>And I think where the dogmatism for Nietzsche came in was when you search for views… and then develop your beliefs, and then think that they should be binding on all. This is not a criticism that you shouldn’t have beliefs, or that all your beliefs are no better than anyone else’s. It’s just the further belief about your beliefs that everyone else should believe the same damn way. So it’s a meta-belief, if you will. A belief about your beliefs.</p>
<p>In fact I think that it’s perfectly consistent to believe a wide number of things with a great deal of passion, and then believe about those beliefs that you could be wrong. I hope that’s not a further paradox, I do not think that it is. It seems to me to be perfectly consistent to believe something passionately, to believe it in a very deep way and have a belief about that belief that “Well, you know. I could be wrong.”</p>
<p>So the dogmatism that Nietzsche is after runs very deep in our theoretical traditions. I can’t overestimate this. It’s a dogmatism that has continued throughout what might be called the project of the West, and it’s even built into the Socratic pursuit. When Socrates asks the question “What is X?”, and what fills in the “X” are those famous Greek ideals; virtue, excellence, beauty, goodness, and so on. Now Nietzsche had the highest respect for Socrates, and as I just said, as I said before, Nietzsche considered him to be an <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exemplary" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exemplary', 'exemplary']);">exemplary</a> person, coupled with Plato’s construction of him, they in a way were ideal for Nietzsche.</p>
<p>But the dogmatic part of Socrates was that Socrates wanted – for Nietzsche – Socrates wanted an answer to the question “What is X”, like what is beauty, goodness, truth, excellence. It wouldn’t be good for just Socrates, or good for the Greeks, but once discovered had to bind everyone. In other words, it wouldn’t be enough just to believe it, which seems… what Nietzsche calls the gay, happy theorist to be enough, to just find a belief that you can live with and believe. No, the theoretical enterprise of the West is imperialistic in a way. It’s got to find a belief that others then have to believe, and that he considered dogmatic.</p>
<p>This by the way you may notice is not – in my view – a relativist position at all. Because it’s not inconsistent with the view that you think your beliefs – precisely because they are your beliefs – are superior to some other beliefs. In fact I take it to be banally the case that if you didn’t think that, they wouldn’t be your beliefs. In other words, somebody comes up to you and gives you some other ones and you go “Oh hell, those are better than mine”. Then they will be yours after you have heard them out, right? So it seems fairly natural that you believe your beliefs. The dogmatic assumption is that everyone else should believe your beliefs. And this is not relativism. There have been some modern philosophical names attached to this position called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism', 'fallibilism']);">fallibilism</a>, and yet Nietzsche is too interesting in a certain way to be called that either.</p>
<p>In other words, I want to present Nietzsche not specifically within that philosophical context, but I do want to present him as addressing it, which he does. And anyone who has ever addressed any issue in philosophy knows that the irritating thing is how the simplest questions can turn into philosophical ones. Sometimes philosophers realise that what we do is ask a series of rhetorical questions that come up whenever people are very frustrated. In other words, we ask questions like “What the hell does that mean?”. You know, generally in a fight – a domestic fight – a rhetorical question. “I can’t do the dishes now” – “Well what the hell does that mean?”. Well, the philosopher takes that rhetorical question and just places it in a foreign context. Someone goes “There’s an object” and you go “Object… what the hell does that mean?” [crowd laughter]. In the other context, the remark had a home and a meaning, and so it means that the person’s <em>pissed</em>, I guess. Or <em>upset</em>, okay. In this other context though, “What does it – you know – does it mean?” doesn’t seem to have any purchase.</p>
<p>About those, sort of, metaphysical beliefs, Nietzsche was no metaphysician. In fact, he thought that was, in a way, a very pompous thing to be. To try to answer those kinds of questions in a way binding for all. Now I call that a kind of <em>imperialism</em>, and I didn’t use that political term without thinking about it for a while. It’s the kind of imperialism – this dogmatic tradition against which Socrates saw himself fighting – is the kind of imperialist tradition we might have in some of our educational institutions when we have an African-American student who speaks eloquent rap street language talk. And I am not trying to say that’s all that African-Americans speak. Some of them are Neo-Conservatives that garble around as bad as others. Paleo-Conservatives. You know, some are just as unfortunately stupid as their Anglo-American, or Anglo-Saxon counterparts.</p>
<p>No, but I mean I am talking now about, you know, someone who does… says “ain’t” and repeats themselves, rhymes and things. Well, in a way it’s just imperialistic to think that that is somehow less profound than the Cambridge accent that discusses in detail the problem of relativism. It is not only a class and a racial bias, it’s just stupid. Because, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James', 'William James']);">William James</a> once said “The trail of the human serpent is over all”. There are many forms of life, many cultures, many ways to look at things. And Nietzsche at his best expresses in his work that diversity and that complexity of the many ways to interpret, to speak.</p>
<p>Now, “imperialistic” in this educational sense means that we want you to leave our institutions of higher learning talking like we talk and writing like we write. And we divide through by the issue of whether you think at all, because all the evidence we have for that is what you have said and what you have written. You may be not thinking at all, or thinking very bizarre thoughts, or you may be on some hallucinogenic drug, who knows what’s inside. But if you leave there writing like we write, talking like we talk – in short obeying relations of power – then you are educated. You certainly… and certainly Nietzsche saw this as conformity, and not connected with truth.</p>
<p>So …</p></div></div>

<p>I don't really need to send many calls back to my network at my house when I am away, but when I want to show someone the progress we are making on the family Minecraft Christmas village, it is nice to be able to call to a <a href="https://github.com/miclav/mapcrafter/tree/world116">Mapcrafter</a> server at my house.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X1eJAH2v7Wg/X9AD2Ct3cjI/AAAAAAAARVQ/o29jbVBMlLAWv1UAhF_DMsEsYiyKj052wCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/christmas_village.png"><img data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="2048" height="376" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X1eJAH2v7Wg/X9AD2Ct3cjI/AAAAAAAARVQ/o29jbVBMlLAWv1UAhF_DMsEsYiyKj052wCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h376/christmas_village.png" title="The Family Minecraft Christmas Village" width="640"></a></td></tr><tr><td>This is the current family Minecraft Christmas Village. The image is generated by Mapcrafter&nbsp;using <a href="https://github.com/skylerwlewis/realms-mapcrafter-renderer">this group</a> of Bash scripts.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now I don't have a business internet line at my house, so my IP can change theoretically at any time. I have looked at a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.noip.com/">few</a> <a href="https://dyndnss.net/eng/">services</a> offering Dynamic DNS, however, some didn't fit my needs. Also they all cost money, and my preference would be to not spend any money if I don't have to.</p><p>I found some projects on Github that communicate with the <a href="https://open-api.netlify.com/#tag/dnsZone">Netlify API</a> using an access token to update the domain entry dynamically, however, I had issues with the <a href="https://github.com/lytedev/netlify-ddns">projects</a> <a href="https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/netlify-dynamic-dns">I</a> <a href="https://github.com/lukehsiao/netlify-ddns-rs">tried</a>. I wanted to stick to apt for installing software, I didn't want to install Docker, and some of the domain updates were leaving duplicates domain entries. Since I've been playing with my Plex Media Server, I've been on a Bash script kick, so I figured I would try to create a Bash script for this I could run through cron.</p><p>The main tool for this job, other than Bash and the Netlify API, is <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>. It is a lightweight command-line tool for handling everything JSON-related. This script requires jq is installed, but shouldn't have any other dependencies. If you try it out, let me know what you think.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div id="post-body"><p><em>I first met Allan over a Zoom call about a week ago. I have been following <a href="https://allanmacgregor.com/">his blog</a> for some time and wanted to know more about his book draft about design patterns in Elixir. It wasn't until the call itself that I found out how many ideas we share - about the future of Elixir, its role as an alternative to present-day distributed solutions, and last but not least, its potential for the next generation of e-commerce solutions. </em></p><h2 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h2><p><strong>Allan:</strong> I'm a software engineer with 15 years of experience, based in Toronto, Ontario. I was born and grew up in Mexico, and over the last 11 years, I have been able to build a career and life in Canada.</p><p>Most of my professional career has been focused on e-commerce development, which I would say can be broken down into three main categories:</p><ul><li>Building user-facing experiences</li><li>Building e-commerce engines to map the business logic</li><li>Integrations with third-party systems</li></ul><p>Over ten years of e-commerce development, I had the opportunity to work with many notable brands in Canada and the US and solve many challenges in the space. I have also dabbled working with product companies in multiple capacities - from CTO to currently a Senior Engineering Manager at <a href="https://www.humi.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humi</a>.</p><p>In terms of technologies, I have had a chance to work with many different stacks and programming languages, notably PHP (LAMP), some Ruby on Rails, some Scala during my time at Hopper, and a bit of Elixir to tackle quick prototypes and transparent proxy for an e-commerce project.</p><p>Currently, I'm a Senior Engineering Manager at Humi, a great company in the HR and payroll space. I am also building a couple of micro-SaaS projects - the first one being <a href="https://siteguardian.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGuardian</a>, intended to be a complete solution for website monitoring and security. It should be close to beta release later this month.</p><figure><a href="https://siteguardian.dev/"><div><p>Siteguardian · Better Site Monitoring</p></div><p><img src="https://siteguardian.dev/images/siteguardian_logo-4a1bbe5ed6d4c7832ee675694a7aed47.svg?vsn=d"></p></a></figure><h2 id="what-brought-you-to-elixir">What brought you to Elixir?</h2><p><strong>Allan: </strong>I stumbled into Elixir in a bit of a weird way, going back to one of the problems that I mentioned on the e-commerce space — integration with third-party systems like ERP, OMS, and the like, — for that kind of problems, the idea of <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/index.html">Flow-based programming</a> made a lot of sense.</p><p>In essence, you structure your application to be a pipeline of black boxes that transform, filter, or handle the data in some way or another. Looking for implementations of this library, I landed on a library called <a href="https://github.com/antonmi/flowex">FlowEx</a>, which is written in Elixir. As I started diving deeper into the language, I honestly fell in love with it.</p><p>Elixir to me seems like this almost perfect mix of all the right qualities:</p><ul><li>Flexibility and power</li><li>Low Learning curve</li><li>Extensibility</li><li>Expressiveness</li></ul><p>If I had to pinpoint any particular quality of Elixir that caught my attention, it would be the expressiveness of the language - how much you can achieve with very little code.</p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>For me, the biggest challenge was adapting to a new paradigm and getting rid of the "bad" habits I picked up from working with Object-Oriented Languages. It is not the syntax that is different, but how you reason and think about the data flows in your program.</p><p>I guess the other challenging bit, which seems fairly common, was grasping the use of the Enum variable, Map, reduce, and the like. But once those things click, you are off to the races.</p><p>The other challenge that is still somewhat applicable is getting buying for the business or clients to use Elixir as a solution; however, I'm happy to see that it is gaining popularity and is being adopted by larger companies and teams.</p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>First, it is important to clarify what this next generation of e-commerce solutions looks like. We are currently in transition from the traditional catalog/search &gt; product page &gt; shopping cart &gt; checkout experience; and moving into a stage where e-commerce becomes ubiquitous, for example, integrated into an Instagram post or inside content.</p><p>This kind of change will present a couple of interesting challenges, both in terms of scalability / performance and architectures. The current generation of e-commerce platforms is fairly monolithic, or in the case of some of the SaaS offerings, fairly restrictive.</p><p>I can see an interesting future for Elixir and similar technologies to be used to develop the next generation e-commerce platforms and services; this is especially applicable when talking about integrations between OMS, Inventory systems, and Product Information Management systems.</p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>Absolutely! Right now, I'm working on a small SaaS project called <a href="https://siteguardian.dev/">SiteGuardian</a>, which aims to provide a robust solution for website site security and availability monitoring.</p><p>I chose Elixir for this project because first, I wanted to validate some architectural ideas and patterns that I'm researching for a book; and second, the Elixir stack allows me to build robust features and do so very efficiently.</p><p>To me, it is that perfect combination of development speed, robustness, and low operating costs that enables me to build a competitive micro-SaaS. Not to mention that my ability to iterate and build in this stack has been incredible compared to if was doing this in Laravel, or Ruby on Rails.</p><p>The second thing that I have in progress right now is a book on Elixir and design patterns. The idea is to explore and do a deep dive into the multiple variations of architectural and behavioral patterns that are relevant to functional programming and Elixir.</p><p>For anyone interested in the progress of the book, you can subscribe to my newsletter here: <a href="https://allanmacgregor.com/newsletter/">https://allanmacgregor.com/newsletter/</a></p><p><strong>Allan: </strong>For people considering using Elixir / Erlang, my word of advice is to give things time to sink in. Functional programming is likely to be a new idea and paradigm and might take a while to grok the concepts, but once you do, the time invested is going to pay off ten-fold.</p><hr><h2 id="references">References</h2><figure><a href="https://allanmacgregor.com/"><div><p>Hi, I’m Allan, this is where I write. - Allan MacGregor</p><p>Expert Software Engineer and Manager • Writer • Functional Programming Advocate</p><p><span>Allan MacGregor</span></p></div><p><img src="https://allanmacgregor.com/static/logo-white-3bbb2d0ba72789f13cdee16471616911.png"></p></a></figure><figure><a href="https://siteguardian.dev/"><div><p>Siteguardian · Better Site Monitoring</p></div><p><img src="https://siteguardian.dev/images/siteguardian_logo-4a1bbe5ed6d4c7832ee675694a7aed47.svg?vsn=d"></p></a></figure><figure><a href="https://github.com/antonmi/flowex"><div><p>antonmi/flowex</p><p>Flow-Based Programming framework for Elixir.

<p>Web crawling is a powerful technique to collect data from the web by finding all the URLs for one or multiple domains. Python has several popular web crawling libraries and frameworks.</p>
<p>In this article, we will first introduce different crawling strategies and use cases. Then we will build a simple web crawler from scratch in Python using two libraries: requests and Beautiful Soup. Next, we will see why it’s better to use a web crawling framework like Scrapy. Finally, we will build an example crawler with Scrapy to collect film metadata from IMDb and see how Scrapy scales to websites with several million pages.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-web-crawler">What is a web crawler?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">Web crawling</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">web scraping</a> are two different but related concepts. Web crawling is a component of web scraping, the crawler logic finds URLs to be processed by the scraper code.</p>
<p>A web crawler starts with a list of URLs to visit, called the seed. For each URL, the crawler finds links in the HTML, filters those links based on some criteria and adds the new links to a queue. All the HTML or some specific information is extracted to be processed by a different pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="web-crawling-strategies">Web crawling strategies</h2>
<p>In practice, web crawlers only visit a subset of pages depending on the crawler budget, which can be a maximum number of pages per domain, depth or execution time.</p>
<p>Most popular websites provide a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard">robots.txt</a> file to indicate which areas of the website are disallowed to crawl by each user agent. The opposite of the robots file is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps">sitemap.xml</a> file, that lists the pages that can be crawled.</p>
<p>Popular web crawler use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search engines (Googlebot, Bingbot, Yandex Bot…) collect all the HTML for a significant part of the Web. This data is indexed to make it searchable.</li>
<li>SEO analytics tools on top of collecting the HTML also collect metadata like the response time, response status to detect broken pages and the links between different domains to collect backlinks.</li>
<li>Price monitoring tools crawl e-commerce websites to find product pages and extract metadata, notably the price. Product pages are then periodically revisited.</li>
<li>Common Crawl maintains an <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/">open repository of web crawl data</a>. For example, the archive from October 2020 contains 2.71 billion web pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will compare three different strategies for building a web crawler in Python. First, using only standard libraries, then third party libraries for making HTTP requests and parsing HTML and finally, a web crawling framework.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-simple-web-crawler-in-python-from-scratch">Building a simple web crawler in Python from scratch</h2>
<p>To build a simple web crawler in Python we need at least one library to download the HTML from a URL and an HTML parsing library to extract links. Python provides standard libraries <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/urllib.html">urllib</a> for making HTTP requests and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html">html.parser</a> for parsing HTML. An example Python crawler built only with standard libraries can be found on <a href="https://github.com/xukai92/crawlerfromscratch/blob/master/spider.py">Github</a>.</p>
<p>The standard Python libraries for requests and HTML parsing are not very developer-friendly. Other popular libraries like <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">requests</a>, branded as HTTP for humans, and <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup</a> provide a better developer experience. You can install the two libraries locally. \</p>
<p><code>pip install requests bs4</code></p>
<p>A basic crawler can be built following the previous architecture diagram.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>The code is very simple but there are many performance and usability issues to solve before successfully crawling a complete website.</p>
<ul>
<li>The crawler is slow and supports no parallelism. As can be seen from the timestamps, it takes about one second to crawl each URL. Each time the crawler makes a request it waits for the request to be resolved and no work is done in between.</li>
<li>The download URL logic has no retry mechanism, the URL queue is not a real queue and not very efficient with a high number of URLs.</li>
<li>The link extraction logic doesn’t support standardizing URLs by removing URL query string parameters, doesn’t handle URLs starting with #, doesn’t support filtering URLs by domain or filtering out requests to static files.</li>
<li>The crawler doesn’t identify itself and ignores the robots.txt file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will see how Scrapy provides all these functionalities and makes it easy to extend for your custom crawls.</p>
<h2 id="web-crawling-with-scrapy">Web crawling with Scrapy</h2>
<p>Scrapy is the most popular web scraping and crawling Python framework with 40k stars on <a href="https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy">Github</a>. One of the advantages of Scrapy is that requests are scheduled and handled asynchronously. This means that Scrapy can send another request before the previous one is completed or do some other work in between. Scrapy can handle many concurrent requests but can also be configured to respect the websites with custom <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html">settings</a>, as we’ll see later.</p>
<p>Scrapy has a multi-component architecture. Normally, you will implement at least two different classes: <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html">Spider</a> and <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html">Pipeline</a>. Web scraping can be thought of as an ETL where you extract data from the web and load it to your own storage. Spiders extract the data and pipelines load it into the storage. Transformation can happen both in spiders and pipelines, but I recommend that you set a custom Scrapy pipeline to transform each item independently of each other. This way, failing to process an item has no effect on other items.</p>
<p>On top of all that, you can add spider and downloader middlewares in between components as it can be seen in the diagram below.</p>

<p>Scrapy Architecture Overview [<a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#data-flow">source</a>]</p>
<p>If you have used Scrapy before, you know that a web scraper is defined as a class that inherits from the base Spider class and implements a parse method to handle each response. If you are new to Scrapy, you can read this article for <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-with-scrapy/">easy scraping with Scrapy</a>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> scrapy.spiders <span>import</span> Spider

<span>class</span> <span>ImdbSpider</span>(Spider):
    name <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>imdb</span><span>'</span>
    allowed_domains <span>=</span> [<span></span><span>'</span><span>[www.imdb.com](www.imdb.com)</span><span>'</span>]

<span>def</span> <span>parse</span>(self, response):
    <span>pass</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Scrapy also provides several <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#generic-spiders">generic spider classes</a>: CrawlSpider, XMLFeedSpider, CSVFeedSpider and SitemapSpider. The <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#crawlspider">CrawlSpider</a> class inherits from the base Spider class and provides an extra rules attribute to define how to crawl a website. Each rule uses a <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/link-extractors.html#topics-link-extractors">LinkExtractor</a> to specify which links are extracted from each page. Next, we will see how to use each one of them by building a crawler for IMDb, the Internet Movie Database.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-example-scrapy-crawler-for-imdb">Building an example Scrapy crawler for IMDb</h2>
<p>Before trying to crawl IMDb, I checked <a href="https://www.imdb.com/robots.txt">IMDb robots.txt</a> file to see which URL paths are allowed. The robots file only disallows 26 paths for all user-agents. Scrapy reads the robots.txt file beforehand and respects when the <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#robotstxt-obey">ROBOTSTXT_OBEY</a> setting is set to true. This is the case for all projects generated with the Scrapy command startproject.</p>
<p>scrapy startproject scrapy_crawler</p>
<p>This command creates a new project with the default Scrapy project folder structure.</p>

                    <p>My problem in life is that if I am doing something, I tend to try to get the most out of it. That is what people call maximalism.</p>
<p>It has been present in the habits that I tried implementing as well. It has been present in a gym membership. It has been present in learning a new language. Basically, I couldn’t do anything a healthy amount and tried to do as much as I could straight away.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed it, even though in the potential that would allow me to get the most amount of results out of the action, it would also cause me to burn out very fast. Usually so fast, that the first results just started showing when I quit.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">James Clear Atomic Habits</a>, I understood that the biggest problem with positive habit-forming is exactly what I have been doing. It said that starting with a hard habit is what will make it less likely to stick. While on the other hand, making a habit small and easy is exactly what would make a habit stick and would allow you to scale it after a period of time potentially.</p>
<p>Going to the gym every day, 7 days a week for one hour was the initial goal I would usually set. Now it's: put running shoes and walk outside of your house for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Reading 50 books in a year, now became read a page per day.</p>
<p>Learn how to build Facebook. Now is: learn how to make this button blue.</p>
<p>Everything became smaller and much easier to do. The result? I have been in the habit of doing things for more than 3 months, and I would never go back.</p>
<h2>Why Maximalism is not always bad</h2>
<p>The good news for me is that I only have to battle with my inner understanding of the world when I start as long as I have started and the habit in the motion of slowly integrating with my life, I can also start to scale it slowly. That is how I started with everything so far and to be completely honest, I don’t see a reason to do it any other way.</p>
<p>The main issue of why positive habits are so much harder to integrate in comparison to the negative habits is because the rewards and the dopamine hits are postponed to some time in the future. Actually so far, that our short term brain doesn’t see it.</p>
<p>That is why by making a habit easy and maybe even pairing with some positive reward for yourself, would make the habit sticking more likely. </p>
<p>Make sure that what you do is good for you, before putting down the reward. <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/nano-problems-09-12-2020">Don’t reward yourself for doing yourself worse.</a></p>
<h2>Why small habits count</h2>
<p>Even though some habits have stayed for me <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/practice-makes-perfect-30-11-2020">very small</a>, the presence of that small habit in my life has <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/front-page-hn">changed me completely</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t understand why spending 10 minutes per day doing something can improve me so much, then I remembered James Clear maths example.</p>
<p>1.01^365 = 37.8</p>
<p>Which is crazy to think about, and it turns out it is also true in practice.</p>
<p>Even if you can only do 5 minutes of something per day, don’t postpone it. In a month or even a year, you will look back, and you will be a completely different, better person.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// PyTypeObject is a typedef for "struct _typeobject"</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>_typeobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>

<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he year was 2003, and the first human genome had been <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project" target="_blank">sequenced</a>.</p>
<p>By almost every metric, it was an extraordinary achievement. The completion of the Human Genome Project provided a starting point for scientists to study the “<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/" target="_blank">blueprint for building a person</a>”. Pharmaceutical companies suddenly possessed a genetic chart to design more targeted medicines. Archaeologists gained a roadmap to compare human genomes through the ages. Biologists acquired a lodestar to locate the genes governing health and behavior. The floodgates of the genomic era had officially opened. But the project also revealed a mystery.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, scientists <a href="https://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/5yrplan/index.shtml" target="_blank">estimated</a> that the Human Genome Project would unveil 100,000 human genes. But the sequencing results revealed a stark reality: humans only have 20,000 genes—<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=118530" target="_blank">10,000 fewer than a water flea</a>. It seems remarkable that humans—with our fancy bipedalism and oversized brains—could have fewer genes than a microscopic crustacean.</p>
<p>A lot has changed in the two decades since the Human Genome Project. The technology to sequence genes has gotten cheaper and faster. The first human genome sequence cost three billion dollars, involved thousands of scientists, and took 13 years to complete. Today, sequencing machines can read a human genome in less than a day for a few hundred dollars. But technology is not a substitute for knowledge, and scientists still don’t fully understand how the genome works.</p>

<p>Nestled in the back corner of the <a href="https://broadfoundation.org/grantees/the-broad-center-for-biological-science-at-caltech/" target="_blank">Broad Center for the Biological Sciences</a> at Caltech, our research laboratory aims to understand how genomes encode and express information. To find us on campus, look for the cubic building made from metal and travertine, with sweeping views of the San Gabriel mountains. On a clear day many months ago, before the pandemic confined us to untidy apartments, we could see Mt. Wilson Observatory from our offices. Its white telescopes dot the mountain’s summit, silhouetted against the rising sun. Inside the lab, our benches are cluttered with liquid-filled bottles and metal pipettes.</p>
<p>We study genomes, in part, because of the impact on our impressionable young minds when the Human Genome Project made national news back in 2003. The structure of DNA had been <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-of-dna-structure-and-function-watson-397/" target="_blank">established</a> fifty years earlier, thanks to herculean efforts from Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and others. Our understanding of genomes came a long way in those 50 years, from structure to sequence. But we know that there is more to learn.</p>
<p>About <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2017/01/09/illumina-promises-to-sequence-human-genome-for-100-but-not-quite-yet/#14098b8f386d" target="_blank">500,000 human genomes</a> have been sequenced since 2003. Sequencing machines are now commonplace at universities. Humming on tables, they look like space-age computer systems, with touch screens and tiny, pneumatic tubes. DNA is extracted from living cells, trillions of copies are made using a technique called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=matsiHSuoOw&amp;vl=en" target="_blank">PCR</a>, and the copied molecules are loaded (carefully!) into the machine. A few hours later, after the humming subsides, an interminable string of characters appears on the screen, made up of four letters: A, T, C, and G.</p>
<p>All genomes on earth are made up of these letters, called nucleotides. Each letter is a unique molecule—adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine—that links up to the others, forming a minimal alphabet. With these four letters, our cells construct words, or—in the context of biology—genes.</p>
<p>Much as a Xerox machine can make thousands of copies from a single document, genes are converted to messenger RNA in a process called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whV_CkKT7F0" target="_blank">transcription</a>, which then serves as a template to build proteins. The human genome encodes about 20,000 genes, which in turn produce proteins that fend off viral invaders, manage blood sugar levels, and everything in between.</p>
<iframe width="280" height="156" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8M198uHJd_8?start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>This short animation shows how transcription happens.</p>

<p>But we cannot “see” these dynamic changes with a DNA sequence. The order of letters in a genome tells us nothing about how a gene is controlled in the molecular confines of a cell. Gene expression is dynamic and changing. Genes are turned on and off as proteins are needed, and these changes over time may explain how genomes can give rise to the most beautiful of lifeforms. In other words, it may explain how we are human, despite a trifling 20,000 genes.</p>
<p>We study how genomes are controlled because we want to understand ourselves. In doing so, we are building upon more than 80 years of experimental history.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the 1940s, Jacques Monod and François Jacob, frantically working in a little laboratory in the Necker neighborhood of Paris, found that cells control protein numbers by turning genes “on” or “off”. Though their results seem obvious today (the best results always do), they shared the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1965/summary/" target="_blank">1965 Nobel Prize</a> in Physiology or Medicine for their work.</p>
<p>Genes are regulated by proteins called transcription factors, of which there are two types: activators, which bind to DNA near the start of a gene and increase the amount of mRNA copies made from a gene, much like loading more paper into a Xerox tray, and repressors, which decrease the amount of mRNA copies. Transcription factors hold dominion over the genome, controlling when each gene gets to make its Xerox copies.</p>
<p>Jacob and Monod’s findings provided a potential solution to the question that arose from the first human genome sequence, 60 years later. Perhaps an organism’s complexity is dictated not by how many genes are present in a genome, but rather by how those genomes are controlled, over time, by transcription factors.
To build upon the work of our scientific heroes, our lab at Caltech wanted to determine which type of transcription factor—activator or repressor—regulates each and every gene. To test our experiments, we decided to start with a small genome. We turned to a bacterium, <em>Escherichia coli</em>.</p>
<p>In the grand order of nature, <em>E. coli</em> is relatively simple, containing 4,000 genes and 200 transcription factors. But, despite its meager size, we still do not know how two-thirds of its genes are regulated.</p>
<p><img src="https://caltechletters.org/media/posts/2020-11-03-decoding-the-genome/ecoli_genome.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <i>E. coli</i> genome contains about 4.6 million nucleotides and 4,000 genes. In this diagram, genes that have known regulation (which means that we know which transcription factors regulate them) are marked in blue. For most genes (roughly two-thirds), we have no idea which transcription factors regulate or control them (marked in red).</p>
<p>Diagram by Niko McCarty</p>
<p>We knew that if we ever wanted to understand how even a small bacterial genome is regulated, a new experimental method would be needed. So we <i>created</i> one.</p>
<hr>
<p>When <a href="https://sites.uw.edu/theriotlab/members/" target="_blank">Nathan Belliveau</a> joined the lab, a few years ago, his objective was simple: find an easy way to determine how genes in <em>E. coli</em> are regulated.</p>
<p>Sitting at the bench, he harvested genetic material from <em>E. coli</em> and loaded the DNA into a sequencer. After a few years—and hundreds of trials—he <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/E4796" target="_blank">reported</a> the foundations of a radical method that would eventually enable our laboratory to figure out which transcription factors regulate hundreds, or thousands, of genes at a time. Nathan left the group in 2017, PhD in hand, and flew to colder climates. Bill Ireland and Suzy Beeler (an author of this article) took over the project.</p>
<p>They, too, spent years agonizing over the method. After using thousands of tubes of DNA and covering their benches in teetering stacks of bacteria-streaked agar plates, Bill and Suzy managed to extend Nathan’s findings to more than a hundred genes. In the process, they refined a powerful method that lends deep insights into the intricate, molecular machines that regulate genomes.</p>
<p>Here’s how the method works.</p>
<p>We begin by literally mail ordering short sequences of DNA—the regions immediately in front of a gene—where transcription factors typically bind. A computer helps us design mutated versions of each DNA sequence, randomly changing the letters until we have thousands of variants for each sequence. A company in San Francisco takes our digital letters, creates physical copies, and ships them in a little plastic tube to our laboratory. We then place these synthetic pieces of DNA inside of <em>E. coli</em> cells, and use a modified version of DNA sequencing to determine whether each “letter” change made a gene produce more or fewer Xerox copies.</p>
<p>If a DNA sequence produces very little RNA inside of the cell, this suggests that the letter change (or mutation) blocked transcription; it choked up the Xerox machine. It also indicates that an activator was probably binding to that DNA sequence, and the mutation prevented it from doing its job. Some mutations, however, increase the amount of RNA produced from a DNA sequence, suggesting that the mutation is preventing a repressor from binding.</p>
<p>By analyzing this data and running it through mathematical models, we can determine whether each gene is regulated by an activator or repressor, how many transcription factors regulate each gene, and where those transcription factors actually bind.</p>
<p>In other words, we can map the genome’s regulatory networks.</p>

<p>After performing this experiment on more than one hundred genes, we made some startling discoveries. In one case, we found a transcription factor with dual activity: it activated the transcription of one gene while repressing the transcription of another. We also identified transcription factors that are only active in certain environments; when <em>E. coli</em> is grown in the presence of a sugar, for example, a transcription factor called GlpR represses a handful of genes. Without the sugar, GlpR doesn’t work at all.</p>
<p>In our opinion, this <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55308" target="_blank">study</a> marks a major advancement in genomic research. But it didn’t come for free.</p>
<p>Throughout the last five years, we have failed repeatedly. We have mislabeled tubes and used ethanol instead of water to dilute DNA. We have dropped flasks, shattering glass and spilling bacteria on the floor. We have been frustrated, again and again. But we continued on, inching closer …</p></div></div>

        <p><span>P</span>rogrammers normally want to minimize the time their code takes to execute. But in 1962, the Hungarian mathematician Tibor RadÃ³ posed the opposite problem. He asked: How long can a simple computer program possibly run before it terminates? RadÃ³ nicknamed these maximally inefficient but still functional programs â€œbusy beavers.â€�</p>

<p>Finding these programs has been a fiendishly diverting puzzle for programmers and other mathematical hobbyists ever since it was popularized in Scientific Americanâ€™s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/computer-recreations-1984-08/" target="_blank">â€œComputer Recreationsâ€� column</a>&nbsp;in 1984. But in the last several years, the busy beaver game, as itâ€™s known, has become an object of study in its own right, because it has yielded connections to some of the loftiest concepts and open problems in mathematics.</p>
<p>â€œIn math, there is a very permeable boundary between whatâ€™s an amusing recreation and what is actually important,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/scott-aaronson" target="_blank">Scott Aaronson</a>, a theoretical computer scientist at the University of Texas, Austin who published a&nbsp;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3427361.3427369" target="_blank">survey</a>&nbsp;of progress in â€œBusyBeaverology.â€�<br></p>
<p>The recent work suggests that the search for long-running computer programs can illuminate the state of mathematical knowledge, and even tell us whatâ€™s knowable. According to researchers, the busy beaver game provides a concrete benchmark for evaluating the difficulty of certain problems, such as the unsolved Goldbach conjecture and Riemann hypothesis. It even offers a glimpse of where the logical bedrock underlying math breaks down. The logician Kurt GÃ¶del proved the existence of such mathematical terra incognita nearly a century ago. But the busy beaver game can show where it actually lies on a number line, like an ancient map depicting the edge of the world.</p><p><strong>An Uncomputable Computer Game</strong></p>
<p>The busy beaver game is all about the behavior of Turing machines—the primitive, idealized computers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf" target="_blank">conceived by Alan Turing in 1936</a>. A Turing machine performs actions on an endless strip of tape divided into squares. It does so according to a list of rules. The first rule might say:</p>
<blockquote>If the square contains a 0, replace it with a 1, move one square to the right and consult rule 2. If the square contains a 1, leave the 1, move one square to the left and consult rule 3.</blockquote>
<p>Each rule has this forking choose-your-own-adventure style. Some rules say to jump back to previous rules; eventually thereâ€™s a rule containing an instruction to â€œhalt.â€� Turing proved that this simple kind of computer is capable of performing any possible calculation, given the right instructions and enough time.</p>
<p>As Turing noted in 1936, in order to compute something, a Turing machine must eventually halt—it canâ€™t get trapped in an infinite loop. But he also proved that thereâ€™s no reliable, repeatable method for distinguishing machines that halt from machines that simply run forever—a fact known as the halting problem.</p>
<p>The busy beaver game asks: Given a certain number of rules, whatâ€™s the maximum number of steps that a Turing machine can take before halting?</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_448ca98db9d7b1349758c6545cdf7237.jpg" alt="nautilus tibor rado"><figcaption><span>Tibor RadÃ³, shown here in an undated photo, invented the busy beaver game as a way of making the theoretical notion of uncomputability concrete. </span><br><span>Courtesy of The Ohio State University Archives</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, if youâ€™re only allowed one rule, and you want to ensure that the Turing machine halts, youâ€™re forced to include the halt instruction right away. The busy beaver number of a one-rule machine, or BB(1), is therefore 1.</p>
<p>But adding just a few more rules instantly blows up the number of machines to consider. Of 6,561 possible machines with two rules, the one that runs the longest—six steps—before halting is the busy beaver. But some others simply run forever. None of these are the busy beaver, but how do you definitively rule them out? Turing proved that thereâ€™s no way to automatically tell whether a machine that runs for a thousand or a million steps wonâ€™t eventually terminate.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s why finding busy beavers is so hard. Thereâ€™s no general approach for identifying the longest-running Turing machines with an arbitrary number of instructions; you have to puzzle out the specifics of each case on its own. In other words, the busy beaver game is, in general, â€œuncomputable.â€�</p>
<p>Proving that BB(2) = 6 and that BB(3) = 107 was difficult enough that RadÃ³â€™s student Shen Lin earned a doctorate for the work in 1965. RadÃ³ considered BB(4) â€œentirely hopeless,â€� but&nbsp;the case was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1983-40-162/S0025-5718-1983-0689479-6/S0025-5718-1983-0689479-6.pdf" target="_blank">finally solved in 1983</a>. Beyond that, the values virtually explode; researchers have identified a five-rule Turing machine, for instance, that runs for 47,176,870 steps before stopping, so BB(5) is at least that big. BB(6) is at least 7.4 Ã— 1036,534.&nbsp;&nbsp;Proving the exact values â€œwill need new ideas and new insights, if it can be done at all,â€� said Aaronson.</p>
<p><strong>Threshold of Unknowability</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/" target="_blank">William Gasarch</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park, said heâ€™s less intrigued by the prospect of pinning down busy beaver numbers than by â€œthe general concept that itâ€™s actually uncomputable.â€� He and other mathematicians are mainly interested in using the game as a yardstick for gauging the difficulty of important open problems in mathematics—or for figuring out what is mathematically knowable at all.</p>
<p>The Goldbach conjecture, for instance, asks whether every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. Proving the conjecture true or false would be an epochal event in number theory, allowing mathematicians to better understand the distribution of prime numbers. In 2015, an anonymous GitHub user named Code Golf Addict&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a64213f391339236c2fe31f8749a0df6" target="_blank">published code</a>&nbsp;for a 27-rule Turing machine that halts if—and only if—the Goldbach conjecture is false. It works by counting upward through all even integers greater than 4; for each one, it grinds through all the possible ways to get that integer by adding two others, checking whether the pair is prime. When it finds a suitable pair of primes, it moves up to the next even integer and repeats the process. If it finds an even integer that canâ€™t be summed by a pair of prime numbers, it halts.</p>
<p>Running this mindless machine isnâ€™t a practical way to solve the conjecture, because we canâ€™t know if it will ever halt until it does. But the busy beaver game sheds some light on the problem. If it were possible to compute BB(27), that would provide a ceiling on how long weâ€™d have to wait for the Goldbach conjecture to be settled automatically. Thatâ€™s because BB(27) corresponds to the maximum number of steps this 27-rule Turing machine would have to execute in order to halt (if it ever did). If we knew that number, we could run the Turing machine for exactly that many steps. If it halted by that point, weâ€™d know the Goldbach conjecture was false. But if it went that many steps and didnâ€™t halt, weâ€™d know for certain that it never would—thus proving the conjecture true.</p>
<p>The rub is that BB(27) is such an incomprehensibly huge number that even writing it down, much less running the Goldbach-falsifying machine for that many steps, isnâ€™t remotely possible in our physical universe. Nevertheless, that incomprehensibly huge number is still an exact figure whose magnitude, according to Aaronson, represents â€œa statement about our current knowledgeâ€� of number theory.</p>
<p>In 2016, Aaronson established a similar result in collaboration with Yuri Matiyasevich and Stefan Oâ€™Rear. They identified a 744-rule Turing machine that halts if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is false. The Riemann hypothesis also concerns the distribution of prime numbers and is one of the Clay Mathematics Instituteâ€™s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/riemann-hypothesis" target="_blank">â€œMillennium Problemsâ€�</a>&nbsp;worth $1 million. Aaronsonâ€™s machine will deliver an automatic solution in BB(744) steps. (It works by essentially the same mindless process as the Goldbach machine, iterating upward until it finds a counterexample.)</p>
<p>Of course, BB(744) is an even more unattainably large number than BB(27). But working to pin down something easier, like BB(5), â€œmay actually turn up some new number theory questions that are interesting in their own right,â€� Aaronson said. For instance, the mathematician Pascal Michel&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01409968" target="_blank">proved</a>&nbsp;in 1993 that the record-holding five-rule Turing machine exhibits behavior similar to that of the function described in the Collatz conjecture, another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-mathematicians-still-cant-solve-the-collatz-conjecture-20200922/" target="_blank">famous open problem</a>&nbsp;in number theory.</p>
<p>â€œSo much of math can be encoded as a question of, â€˜Does this Turing machine halt or not?â€™â€� Aaronson said. â€œIf you knew all the busy beaver numbers, then you could settle all of those questions.â€�</p>
<p>More recently, Aaronson has used a busy-beaver-derived yardstick to gauge what he calls â€œthe threshold of unknowabilityâ€� for entire systems of mathematics. GÃ¶delâ€™s famous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-godels-incompleteness-theorems-work-20200714/" target="_blank">incompleteness theorems</a>&nbsp;of 1931 proved that any set of basic axioms that could serve as a possible logical foundation for mathematics is doomed to one of two fates: Either the axioms will be inconsistent, leading to contradictions (like proving that 0 = 1), or theyâ€™ll be incomplete, unable to prove some true statements about numbers (like the fact that 2 + 2 = 4). The axiomatic system underpinning almost all modern math, known as Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory, has its own GÃ¶delian boundaries—and Aaronson wanted to use the busy beaver game to establish where they are.</p>
<p>In 2016, he and his graduate student Adam Yedidia specified a 7,910-rule Turing machine that would only halt if ZF set theory is inconsistent. This means BB(7,910) is a calculation that eludes the axioms of ZF set theory. Those axioms canâ€™t be used to prove that BB(7,910) represents one number instead of another, which is like not being able to prove that 2 + 2 = 4 instead of 5.</p>
<p>Oâ€™Rear subsequently devised a much simpler 748-rule machine that halts if ZF is inconsistent—essentially moving the threshold of unknowability closer, from BB(7,910) to BB(748). â€œThat is a kind of a dramatic thing, that the number [of rules] is not completely ridiculous,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://math.osu.edu/people/friedman.8" target="_blank">Harvey Friedman</a>, a mathematical …</p></article></div>

You need to be deliberate about what you create. Your podcast gets its uniqueness from you, as you are the creator and director. </p><p>Your podcast is a result of your<strong> imagination</strong> and your <strong>ability to execute</strong>.</p><p>You must have a reason for starting your podcast, and this where the “WHY” and “WHAT” questions come in. The answer to these questions will help you create a podcast that is both unique to you but will also be able to add massive value to anyone that subscribes.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Why Do You Want To Start A Podcast?</strong></h3><p>There are various reasons for starting a podcast, and it varies per person. This question can have a lot of answers, but your conviction is the most important factor.</p><p><em>How much do you want to start a podcast?</em></p><p>Because if your answer is not a firm yes, then you may have challenges putting in the consistent effort to make it grow.</p><p><em>Why do you want to start a podcast?</em></p><p>There could be various reasons...<br></p><ul role="list"><li>To promote your business</li><li>To talk about your passion</li><li>To preach to the world</li><li>To share your message</li><li>To establish yourself as an authority</li><li>To have fun</li></ul><p>Whatever your reason is, you must be convinced.</p><p>This conviction will help you create a lasting relationship with your audience as you continue to execute over time when others fail to be consistent.</p><p>If&nbsp;you look at all the most popular podcasts... you will see that they have been running for years and even decades. This is what you must be prepared to do to generate a sizeable audience.</p><h3><strong>What Is The Topic Of Your Podcast?</strong></h3><p>It's now time to choose a theme/topic for your podcast. </p><p>This is the BIG one. It's make or break.</p><p>You MUST consider:</p><ul role="list"><li>Your passion on the topic</li><li>Your expertise and experience of the topic</li><li>The ability for your to monetise the topic</li></ul><p>Here at bCast, we are all about podcast profitability. We're not hobbyists. We know you need to get paid if you're going to do this for the long term and build a podcast worth listening to.</p><p>Now monetisation can come from advertising... so you don't necessarily need to have products or services in the niche or topic of your podcast... but you will need an intense passion.</p><p>Once you have spent a long time sitting in a dark room thinking about this... you then need to understand the #1 thing that will define the success or failure of your podcast:</p><p><strong><em>How are you different or better for a specific group of people?</em></strong></p><p>As if you are not... and you don't have a load of money to spend on Facebook Ads, it's going to be hard to make your podcast grow. Trust me... we know.</p><p>Maybe you only ask specific types of questions; perhaps you focus on a particular niche, perhaps you only interview three people at a time… it can be anything as long as it makes you different or better for a specific group of people.</p><p>If you are VERY particular about this… you will more than double your chances of succeeding.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Your Listeners?</strong></h3><p>Now that you have answered the WHY and WHAT, it is time to answer the WHO question.</p><p>Every podcast needs listeners, and in order for your podcast to grow... you must know exactly who your listeners are and where to find them.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-08046cb77a20-4992c8f8"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8d8ab496d65849f731ba00/5fa3cf937aa690314e79dafd__co8aVE5evZ3_Tzk8ZugkGqAFkT8oBN3HT-ksoEWq5FNU4yYXhOaV3P8uJZ27GaH8Ha-aIdbGh3PPQqOLLXsAZ-K6sSfKjXfmjcmVJW5xRfolNsufXY7OnFRKVLn4GMako-ZIAM_.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>You need to find out:</p><ul role="list"><li>Where they are&nbsp;</li><li>How old they are</li><li>What catches their attention</li><li>What they eat for breakfast</li><li>Who they hate</li><li>Who they love</li></ul><p>This is why it's normally a great strategy for you to actually BE&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;PERFECT&nbsp;LISTENER. This is a shortcut through this stage of the process as if this is the case, you should know the answers to all of those questions ;)</p><p>Once this is defined you then need to list out a number of places where these people hang out online:</p><ul role="list"><li>Blogs</li><li>Other podcasts</li><li>Facebook Groups</li><li>subReddits</li><li>Linkedin Groups</li><li>YouTube Channels</li></ul><p>We will need this list later in the process when we move through the launch and grow stages.</p><h3><strong>How Do You Name Your Podcast?</strong></h3><p>There are a number of strategies to follow here...</p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>Make it concise</em></strong></li></ul><p>Succinct podcast names land better as they convey the message most strongly.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>Do not neglect the relevant keyword</em></strong></li></ul><p><strong><em>‍</em></strong>If your podcast is about soccer, let the name convey that; this is important in searches, as your podcast name will pop up in searches related to your industry.</p><ul role="list"><li>‍<strong><em>Make it easy on the tongue</em></strong></li></ul><p><strong><em>‍</em></strong>You don’t want a twisted name, as you will mention it time and again on your podcast – it should be smooth to say.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>Keep it simple</em></strong></li></ul><p><strong><em>‍</em></strong>You don’t want the stress of explaining your podcast name every time. Embrace simplicity</p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>Look out for rhyme and alliteration opportunities</em></strong></li></ul><p>The best names of anything normally incorporate rhyme and/or alliteration... be on the look out for these opportunities and incorporate them if they arise.</p><p>To make this clearer... here are some great examples along with an explanation for why:</p><p><a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/sales-ops-demystified" target="_blank"><strong>Sales Ops Demystified</strong></a>: We include the core key word AND the value proposition of the show. It's clear and concise and succinctly tells the potential listener why they should listen.</p><p><a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/mobile-growth-pancakes" target="_blank"><strong>Mobile Growth and Pancakes</strong></a>: Keyword conscious and not boring. This podcast name is exciting, and a listener will want to hear what they have to say. It lays a foundation for what to expect, which is discussing mobile growth in a fun and slightly... different way.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/shine-a-podcast-by-star" target="_blank"><strong>Shine: a Podcast by Star</strong></a>: Simple and short. The host already directs the listener's thought from the first word. It also promotes the host, as a name is attached to the podcast and conveys an aspect of the hosts brand: shining through technology.</p><p><a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/be-more-a-podcast-by-peakon" target="_blank"><strong>Be More - a podcast by Peakon</strong></a>: If you want to be more, you have to listen. Everyone wants to be more, and this podcast name exploits that emotional aspect with this name: it's aspirational. The listener wants to know how they can "be more".&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How Do You Describe Your Podcast?</strong></h3><p>Research has shown that your <a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/promotion/podcast-discoverability/" target="_blank">podcast description</a> is the number one factor that new listeners consider when deciding whether to subscribe. When describing your podcast, you must be able to offer value to the listener quickly. You must tell in precise terms, what they stand to gain by listening to your show.</p><p>You also have to consider search engines as you construct e your podcast description. Your show description must be able to rank to stand a chance of getting any free exposure from Google. Include relevant keywords in the industry you cover.&nbsp;</p><p>When writing your description, you should consider attention span. You need to grab listeners' attention by putting the juicy points first. You also need to make fair use of the description by avoiding repetition.&nbsp;</p><p>Be concise, offer value, and grab attention with the first lines.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How Do You Pick The Right Category For Your Podcast?</strong></h3><p>The primary way podcast listeners discover podcasts is through searching within podcast listening apps. They navigate through different categories and topics and look for the best shows in that category – <strong>this is why</strong> you need to place your podcast in the right category. It will increase the chance that your perfect listener will discover your podcast.</p><p>You get three chances:</p><ul role="list"><li>1 Primary category</li><li>2 Sub categories</li></ul><p>I won't share much more on this as I assume you know the category in which your podcast should reside!</p><h3><strong>What Podcast Format Should You Adopt?</strong></h3><p>There are different formats for podcasts. The good thing is, you have creative control over the structure of your podcast. In most cases, the format you choose depends on the message you are trying to convey to your audience.&nbsp;</p><p>There are different types of formats:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Interview podcast:</strong> this format involves a host that brings guests on the show, and interviews them. These guests are usually experts in their field, and the host asks them relevant questions in their industry.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Monologue podcast:</strong> this format involves the host alone. The host will run solo and speak about their experiences and area of expertise. It is mostly educational and a teaching type of format.</li><li><strong>Co-hosted podcast:</strong> this format will involve two hosts that will have conversations. They share their experiences and have a back and forth when needed.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Story-based podcast:</strong> this format involves a host that tells a story like a drama to the audience. The story could be fiction or non-fiction. The host finds ways to spice it up through the use of different effects.</li></ul><p>That said, there is room for more than one format on your podcast. You could adopt different forms for different episodes, depending on the message you are trying to pass.</p><p>So why not start out with one... test, gather …</p></div></div></div></div>

A little exciting.</p><p>I’d been wanting to talk to Matt for a while, in part because the pope actually turned down my recent interview request (someone please tell him how book tours work).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37ce1cde-dec5-4068-8ca8-3359f838647c_1308x264.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37ce1cde-dec5-4068-8ca8-3359f838647c_1308x264.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37ce1cde-dec5-4068-8ca8-3359f838647c_1308x264.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:264,&quot;width&quot;:1308,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:51146,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>And in part because I consider him (Matt) one of the more interesting, iconoclastic, morally committed, unpredictable, critics-may-care thinkers today. In the course of a typical Twitter day, which is a week in human time, I agree with Matt, disagree with him, wish I had thought of something he said, regret something he said on his behalf, retweet something he wrote, and make a mental note to talk with him soon. So I did.</p><p>And there we were, talking about everything — his political education, why he goes back and forth between thinking of himself as a progressive and not, his highly influential recent book, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>” — when my phone began to crackle with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">news of an historic antitrust case against Facebook</a>.</p><p>Naturally, I began to ask Matt about it. What he said was so compelling that I’ve decided to break our interview into two issues of the newsletter. Today: Matt Stoller on Facebook, this important case, and how monopoly is mistaken as a policy issue when in fact it represents an existential question of whether we are actually a democracy.</p><p>Then, before long, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107144/">part deux</a>, the political education of Matt Stoller — thinker, writer, civil servant, trustbuster, Twitter beefer, and, presently, aspiring political philosopher.</p><p>Without shame, I’ll add, in the spirit of Matt’s ideas, that if you want to do your part to support small, independent media, and haven’t yet, consider subscribing to The Ink.</p><h3>“The way we do business is the way we do justice”: a conversation with Matt Stoller, part one</h3><p>ANAND: Right as we're talking, I get a news alert: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">Facebook illegally crushed competition by buying up its rivals, according to lawsuits filed by 48 states and federal regulators</a>.” So this is the big case that we've been waiting for. Can you explain to a person who has never focused on this issue before in their life, and who just uses Facebook to try to get with their high-school ex, why is this a big deal? What does this mean?</p><p>MATT: So Facebook is a financial conglomerate. People think of Facebook as that website you use or the app that you use, but really Facebook, as a political institution, is a financial conglomerate and owns dozens of different companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp and Facebook, the social network. And it's a giant advertising company. So they have roughly three billion users. And they try to get their users to do things that their advertisers want them to do, because that's how you sell advertising.</p><p>The business model is to divert revenue that used to go to newspapers and publishers to themselves. And so by manipulating people in this specific way that they do, which is to keep them using their system and keep surveilling them so that they can target them with ads, they are, in the process, crushing newspapers and publishers, who no longer have any financing, particularly local newspapers and niche publications like Black-owned newspapers.</p><p>So increasingly those kinds of publications don't exist. You don't have reporters covering state houses and city halls and whatnot. Instead, people are now consuming things that Facebook likes them to consume because it keeps them using, and it keeps them available to sell ads to them, which are anti-social publications or posts, like anti-vax stuff or QAnon or whatever it is.</p><p>So that's the basic problem. It's a $70-, $80-, $100-billion-a-year revenue company that's destroying newspapers and publishers all over the world and getting people to pass conspiracy theories to each other so that Facebook can make money on advertising.</p><p>ANAND: You're an anti-monopoly guy. If there were three or five companies in healthy competition with each other, all doing exactly what you just described, wouldn't it still be problematic? Is the issue here that there's only one of them of that heft, or would a competitive market with five such players still be incredibly troubling?</p><p>MATT: There's a lot more that you have to do than just break them up. But the answer is, it would improve things dramatically if they were broken up, and you don't have to imagine it.</p><p>There used to be a bunch of social networks. Facebook's main competitor was Myspace, but there were a bunch of others. There was BlackPlanet; there was Friendster. And the way that Facebook actually defeated Myspace was by promising a safer, more private experience. They defeated Myspace by saying, We will treat your data carefully; in fact, when we change the terms of service, we will let our users vote on the terms of service.</p><p>This was back in 2007, 2008, 2009. And once they killed their competition, and then they bought up nascent competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp, then they didn't have to compete by offering a higher-quality service, a.k.a one that was less intrusive in terms of surveillance. They could just surveil anybody they wanted, and you didn't really have a choice.</p><p>ANAND: Where do you think this case is going?</p><p>MATT: They’re going to aim to break up the company. The House Antitrust Subcommittee did this long investigation of big tech, which includes Facebook. And one of the things they found is that Mark Zuckerberg was writing emails saying they were buying these companies to block competition. And so that's evidence that the mergers were illegal, because you're not supposed to buy companies to block competition. That's a violation of the Clayton Act. My guess is that they're going to have a pretty good complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>ANAND: Based on the history of such cases, would your assumption be that Facebook is broken up within a period of years?</p><p>MATT: Yes.</p><p>However, we haven't enforced the law for 20 years, so it’s not entirely clear. The law at this point is crazy and incoherent because we haven't done enforcement, and to the extent that we have, judges have just made wildly inconsistent rulings.</p><p>ANAND: This kind of action that's being announced today is the epitome of a systemic, public response to a problem. And when I, like you, advocate for those types of things, I often hear this response that I'm sure you do, too, which is, “OK, that's fine, but what about individual actions?” A lot of people are like, “Yes, let’s delete Facebook.” Or: “Why aren't you supporting the Facebook boycott?”, and there are different views on it.</p><p>There are some people who make the argument that those kind of small personal things are sideshows, distractions, maybe even unhelpful, because they reduce the perceived need for bigger systemic change. I fall more into that camp. There are others who say it's a gateway drug, it's a waystation, like: “Delete Facebook and then work yourself up to a political response." How do you weigh in on that?</p><p>MATT: I think it's a bad vision of politics. It's not doing politics to say, “Me, as a consumer, I can change power arrangements based on what I consume or don’t.” That's a real 1970s consumer-rights Democrat vision of the world, and that's one in which you as a citizen are irrelevant.</p><p>A boycott is only political if the goal is a policy change. If you go in and you say, "Well, I don't like Facebook, I want to change Facebook, so I'm going to delete Facebook," that's not going to do anything. If it's part of some larger political action saying, "Well, I'm going to delete Facebook, and then I'm going to push policymakers to break it up," I mean, I guess that makes sense.</p><p>But the general view of these boycotts is that just not using Facebook is the political action. But that's actually not a political action.</p><p>ANAND: An issue like monopoly is different from, say, healthcare, where you don't have to explain to most people the problem with our healthcare system. How do you think about making the issue of monopoly real to people and vivid and relevant to their lives?</p><p>MATT: I'm going to challenge the premise. I don't think monopoly is an <em>issue</em>. I think monopoly is a worldview.</p><p>My book is called “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>.” Anti-monopolism is a lens through which you understand power, and particularly commercial power. That’s the lens that I see the world through. And I don't just focus on Facebook or Google. I’m focused on anti-monopolism in general. How you use business institutions to coerce and bully — or liberate — other people in your society.</p><p>There's a monopolist who controls the cheerleading industry, which is very weird. I just learned there is a private-equity company that is trying to monopolize the software that churches run. There is a monopoly of Ultimate Fighting Championship-style contests. And then in healthcare there are endless numbers of monopolists. Ultimately, what a monopolist is is a person or institution that is controlling and governing a market. It's a private government versus a public government.</p><p>ANAND: You’re saying it’s incompatible with democracy.</p><p>MATT: Right. It’s a different system. When Mark Zuckerberg says he’s going to arrange electoral discourse in this particular way, or going to start a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-first-20-members-of-facebook-supreme-court-2020-5">Supreme Court</a>, or going to ban this or allow that, he is operating as the global privacy commissioner. <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/4/9/17214752/zuckerberg-facebook-power-regulation-data-privacy-control-political-theory-data-breach-king">He even said</a>, "In a lot of ways Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company." That's a direct quote.</p><p>As a society, the way we do business is the way we do justice.</p><p>ANAND: Understanding how these platforms work, do you think that if Mark Zuckerberg wanted to tip an election, he could? Would that even be illegal under our current system?</p><p>MATT: I don't know if it's possible, but it's certainly legal if he decided to.</p><p>I listened to this podcast with Zuckerberg where he said — this was right before he became unpopular, so he was still being relatively …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><div><article role="main"><p>No, engineers don’t suck at time estimates - and generally speaking humans are better estimators than what most people believe. This seems rather surprising given all we’ve heard about the problems of bad time estimations, projects going overboard, etc and of course, your personal experience with software time estimates. But if people are really bad at estimation, how does that fit with our obvious evolutionary need to make quick decisions based on partial data? if we can’t estimate well how did we decide if a gap is wide enough to jump over, if an animal is worth the hunt, if a certain area is more likely to have water and shade? Without estimation skills we wouldn’t survive. So what’s going on?</p><p>One obvious explanation is that we are only good at estimating physical things such as sizes and distances. However, this does not seem likely given the large number of non-physical decisions we needed to make, like selecting a mate.
Another, more likely explanation is that the estimates are good, but the interpretation and usage of the estimates is flawed. In other (slightly cynical) words: the engineers are good at estimating, it’s the project managers who suck at using the estimates.</p><p>Let me explain.</p><p>“your estimate was wrong” - is something i’ve heard many times. But this sentence doesn’t make any sense… after all, an estimate is by definition not exact; in fact, if the results would always agree with estimates foul play would be immedialy suspected. If I estimated one day and the actual time was 1.5 days, was I “wrong”? most people would say I wasn’t. But if if the actual time was 20 days most people would argue I was wrong. Somewhere between one and 20 days there is an implicit “reasonable error” threshold we never discussed! I never gave an error margin for my estimate, did I?</p><p>Since we don’t expect an estimate to be an exact guess of the actual value, what do we expect from an estimate? When we make decisions based on estimates, we can only be right or wrong in our decision, you can’t be “a lot more right”. We need to guess a value beyond a certain threshold and within a certain tolerance, with high probability of being right because that our lives depend on that gap being just short enough for us to jump over. Decisions are almost always non-linear like that and it should not be surprising given the nature of knowledge and learning. We take in examples and extrapolate patterns and behaviours. Which means we are dealing with groups, and probability distributions. This may be surprising at first, because when you are estimating this one <em>particular</em> job, you don’t think of a distribution of a million other <em>different</em> jobs. An estimate is predicting the future in which we see the actual value.
</p><div><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/time-estimate.jpg" alt="/img/time-estimate.jpg"></p><a href="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/time-estimate.jpg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></figure></div><p>What we need to know, is that in a certain number of futures, say 90% of them, a value won’t be over or under a certain threshold. Or phrased mathematically, that the 90th percentile of the distribution of futures will be over (or under) a certain number. An estimate is a percentile! but which percentile? is it the median? the 99th?
For software time estimates it has been <a href="https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html">observed to be the median</a> (50th percentile), meaning to be right about half the times. Is this inherent? Estimates can desmonstrably be calibrated to higher percentiles by as little as <a href="https://www.tonym-v.com/blog/2019/10/2/improve-your-estimations-with-the-equivalent-bet-test">brief emotional self manipulation</a>; You could easily estimate the 90th percentile of many things - just read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business-ebook/dp/B00INUYS2U">How to measure anything</a>.</p><p>Usally when I tell this to people, they often respond with “we’ll train to estimate the average”. Sadly, this is not possible. The mean is a statistically “unstable” or “unrobust” aggregate, where as percentiles are “stable” or “robust”. Consider a group of task completion times [73, 67, 12, 38, 18, 11, 42]. The mean is ~37.29 and the median is pretty close, 38. But as soon as we get another measurement, say 293, the mean changes significantly to 69.25 while the median changes only slightly to 42. The mean is sensitive to outliers, and the more skewed and high variance the distribution the less robust and stable it will be.</p><p>Having estimated tasks, what do we do with them? We sum them up.</p><p>Either for project budget or for by enqueuing with the next tasks, we sum them. But wait, we know that percentiles are not additive! how can this ever work? it never does. Summing up percentiles compounds errors and with skewed distributions, and in particular heavy tailed distributions, the errors are very large. Let’s have a look at what a task completion time distribution would look like:</p><div><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/task-time-distribution.png" alt="/img/task-time-distribution.png"></p><a href="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/task-time-distribution.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></figure></div><p>A task has some minimum time it has to take, but beyond that it can pretty much take as long as inifinity. We all know from experience, that when things get out of control they go wayyyy out of control. Once you hit a rare bug, you might be chasing a wild goose for two months. That 10% over the estimate might be a day late or a year, the higher percentile you pick the more extreme the errors relatively.</p><p>To be honest, it’s old news; This has been known for a long time. Percentile based project predictions have been done as early as World War II, perhaps even before that - yet they remain fairly unknown in the industry. Not only are we ignorant of proven methods, we invent new ones which are outright harmful. Remember that burn down chart? the <em>backlog</em> is nothing more than a sum of time estimates! And every two weeks, sitting in the famous sprint retrospective people work to calibrate their estimates to the random walk sum of task completion times on the burndown chart. How do you calibrate a percentile to a sum? If the distribution is something like a log-normal distribution, the random walk sum will converge to the mean, and the median is relatively close to the mean - which is summable, and both are pretty stable. So by repeatedly calibrating estimates to the running-sum of task completion times (the backlog) you will converge close to the median. Now go tell your project manager there is a 50% chance of their project running late, anywhere between a day and eternity, and see how they respond. A 50% chance of uncapped delay is a useless estimate.</p><p><strong>Scrum is a training method for useless time estimates</strong>. It actively destroys your ability to manage your project.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against Agile; The spirit of Agile, some of the methods and ceremonies of Scrum have value. But Scrum <em>as a system</em> is actively harmful, especially in high variance situations where the work is far from the nice log-normal distribution. If you <a href="https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/the-burndown-chart-fallacy/">optimize for an arbitrary metric</a>, you will get arbitrary results. In ops/SRE and pure research many people have intuitive sense that Scrum and traditional project management are wrong, although they can’t quite articulate why. The reasons become very clear when we consider what happens to sum based project management methods if the task distribution becomes heavy tailed. A task that is one week late is likely to take <em>at least</em> one more week - is a common thumb rule in such domains; This is called a “Power law” and can be modeled by the famous Pareto distribution. The thing about the Pareto distribution is that its mean does not converge! In other words, using sum based planning methods with such distributions is equivalent to managing by rolling dice. A little worse actually, as dice are a cheap method of generating random numbers where as time estimates are intrusive and sometimes expensive. This isn’t a problem unique to Scrum, nor does it originate from it. The problem is the assumption of determinism and accuracy which is the prevaling “machine age” mindset. Pretty much all of the common project management tools have the same issue - have a look at a Gantt chart, it has no probability intervals or error ranges. They are all worse than useless. It shouldn’t be a surprise that despite people being bad at estimating large tasks naive estimates are reliably more accurate than project management tools.</p><p>Recognizing the probabilistic nature of the world is key. Probability isn’t a tool for making predictions, it is a tool for quantifiying uncertainty. Instead of managing resources (which are usually highly certain) we should be managing uncertainty, with probabilistic methods appropriate for the task. With this mindset, the first thing to do is understand the business context and the distributions involed: are you in a low or high variation domain? Industrial methods which aim to improve throughput and efficiency all assume low variance, sometimes actively force low variance by getting rid of outliers; this isn’t necessarily possible in your business context. Industrial methods are good when used in context, but horrible when used in high variability and unpredictable domains. For those we have other methods, which emphasize low latency and rapid adaptation. Instead of Scrum, you could try:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/">Monte-Carlo simulations based on time estimates</a></li><li><a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.1-chapter-07">Time boxing and bets</a></li><li>Latency optimizing methods which dispense with time estimates, like Kanban</li></ul><p>I’ve listed the methods above in order of rising uncertainty, Monte-Carlo simulations or time boxing would probably be easiest to start with. The biggest obstacle in implementing these is convincing managers that “predictability” isn’t so important as they imagine. For high variation domains it’s nothing more than a fantasy anyway.</p><p>So there you have it: people don’t suck at estimation. They suck at management 🤷</p><hr></article></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main-content"><article><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PRCyBqa.jpg" alt=""><div><section><p>Kubernetes has become the <em>de facto</em> container orchestrator since it's initial release in 2014. It is a great tool for managing diverse workloads in clusters of machines, possibly spanning multiple availability zones. As the usage grows, new requirements for how to deploy and operate specialized software emerges. The Operator pattern is one of the more prominent responses to these new requirements.</p>
</section><article><section><p>The Operator pattern is best described in the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">official Kubernetes documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Operator pattern aims to capture the key aim of a human operator who is managing a service or set of services. Human operators who look after specific applications and services have deep knowledge of how the system ought to behave, how to deploy it, and how to react if there are problems.</p>
<p>People who run workloads on Kubernetes often like to use automation to take care of repeatable tasks. The Operator pattern captures how you can write code to automate a task beyond what Kubernetes itself provides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Operators automate operation of applications and services with human know-how.</p>
<h2>How does an Operator work?</h2>
<p>An Operator consists at a minimum of one Custom Resource Definition (<code>CRD</code>) and a Controller. The <code>CRD</code> describes the various configuration options for this kind of resource. Given a custom resource for a <code>PostgresDatabase</code>, one might find options for specifying custom <code>StorageClass</code>es, resource allocation, backup schedule/destinations, authentication methods, etc.</p>
<p>Given an instance (<code>CR</code>) of <code>PostgresDatabase</code>, it's now the job of the controller to ensure that the desired state is reconciled with the cluster. In this example one can assume that the controller will create a <code>StatefulSet</code> for running the database itself, along with needed configuration in a <code>ConfigMap</code>, certificates for mutual TLS in a <code>Secret</code>. Backup can be done by either mounting and writing to a volume defined in the <code>CR</code> or injecting a sidecar for sending backups to another location.</p>
<p>Patching, reboots and failovers can be specified in the <code>CR</code> and taken care of by the controller, using methods recommended by experienced DBA's. The fact that complex operational knowledge can be encoded into the controller is a key enabler for many organizations that would like to run complex software, but not necessarily invest countless hours into learning the nitty-gritty details on how to operate it.</p>
<p>Like any other software there will be bugs and abstractions will leak. There's no silver bullet.</p>
<h2>How do I create my own Operator?</h2>
<p>As with the rest of the Kubernetes community, multiple solutions exists.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a declarative experience, check out <a href="https://kudo.dev/">KUDU</a></li>
<li>If you'd like a more official way to do it, see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder">kubebuilder</a></li>
<li>The most popular option seems to be <a href="https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk">Operator SDK</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As with most cloud native software, Go seems to be the lingua franca. There is nothing stopping you from writing an Operator in Java, C#, Python or any other language that can communicate with the Kubernetes APIs.</p>
<h2>Examples of known Operators</h2>
<p>The community has produced a lot of Operators for about everything one can imagine. These are some popular examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd">Argo CD</a> – a  declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">cert-manager</a> – automatically provisions TLS certificates via the ACME protocol. Can be used with certificate issuers such as <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>, <a href="https://www.buypass.no/ssl/resources/acme-free-ssl">Buypass</a> and <a href="https://zerossl.com/documentation/acme/">ZeroSSL</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator">Prometheus Operator</a> – often used in combination with <a href="https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus">kube-prometheus</a> for a batteries included monitoring suite</li>
<li><a href="https://kubedb.com/">KubeDB</a> – a real-life implementation of the <code>PostgresDatabase</code> example, plus support for MySQL/MariaDB/MongoDB/Redis/Memcached and more</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><sub><em>This article was originally published in</em>
<a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/the-september-2013-issue-of-physics-world-is-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Physics World</em></a> <em>September 2013, copyright IOP Publishing, reproduced here with permission.</em></sub></p><p><img src="https://smalldata.dev/images/baby_physics/header.jpeg" alt="header image - baby with avocado face"></p><hr><p><strong>I became a first-time father</strong> around the same time my postdoc contract ended. My wife had another year to finish her PhD, so I took a sabbatical to be a stay-at-home dad. My months away from research were intended to be full of fun projects. And relaxation. It was to be the Year of Naps – or so I thought.</p><p>Unfortunately, while physics problems have solutions that are constant, baby-related problems have solutions that are random and change from day to day. What had worked yesterday will not work today. Maybe it will work tomorrow. This is the gist of the Baby Universe. In this universe, time only means a start and a finish, and contains no information in-between. If the physicist-dad discovers a method to get the baby to eat her breakfast, it is unlikely to work by dinner. This is significant because eating is one of four fundamental dimensions of the Baby Universe, and the same principle of random solutions also applies to the other three: playing, crying and sleeping. (Some scientists consider pooping to be a separate dimension. However, I can assure you that this is always included as part of one of the other four.)</p><p><img src="https://smalldata.dev/images/baby_physics/sarah_photo.jpeg" alt="baby - who me?">
<sup>Photo credit :
<a href="https://www.sarahperryphotography.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Perry</a></sup></p><p><strong>The first challenge</strong> in my physicist-to-dad transition came with my inability to feed my daughter naturally. My thesis-writing wife’s fresh-pumped milk was in demand and its administration required complex algorithms for its optimal, timely use. Solid food, once introduced, posed a whole new set of problems, as each spoonful required extensive parental coercion. This may have had its upsides: recent research shows that the more you talk to your child, the higher the child’s IQ will be. The fine print that the researchers don’t mention is that this IQ boost comes at your expense, as you must donate those IQ points to the child via non-stop one-way conversations: “Look. Yams. Mmmmm. You like yams. You liked yams yesterday. Oooh, yaaaaaams.”</p><p>Later, my daughter acquired a rudimentary ability to feed herself, and the physics of the eating dimension became more complex. If I offer her a spoonful of food, she comes running to see what is on the spoon. If the food is not to her liking, she is scattered like a charged particle from a similarly charged hard sphere. But when, instead, a sticky ball of white rice is presented to her, it triggers a primal urge to make chaos. The “entropy of rice” principle dictates that the dispersion of rice across a 2D “table” is sudden, yet erratic. After adequate time, every grain of rice is scattered into a circle with a radius equal to one baby arm. Given infinite time, it is predicted that babies would not rest until every grain of rice was at every end of the universe.</p><p><img src="https://smalldata.dev/images/baby_physics/yogurt_face.jpeg" alt="baby - yogurt face">
<sup>Photo credit : Debby Shemella, aka Grandma (2012)</sup></p><p>As the preceding paragraph indicates, the “eating” dimension of the Baby Universe is closely coupled to the “playing” dimension. Before she could crawl or walk, my daughter would nevertheless want to change her position during playtime. She employed the theory of relativity to satisfy this urge: by moving her playmat from underneath her, she could therefore move herself off the mat. Once mobile, she liked to increase her potential energy by dragging herself up and onto whatever obstacle she could find. If stairs existed, that obstacle was most definitely stairs. This is unfortunate, because although babies understand gravity if they are dropping something (and can even anticipate the “Boom!” the object makes upon impact), they have no comprehension of gravity if they are the body upon which it is acting. It is therefore the physicist-parent’s job to decrease the baby’s potential energy whenever it grows too large, and it is the baby’s work to regain what was taken away.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbAYEdjcyjc" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p><sup><em>The
<a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PechaKucha</a> talk that started this research.</em></sup></p><p>The two remaining dimensions of the Baby Universe – crying and sleeping – are also tightly coupled. To deal with daytime crying sessions, I devised a “terror threat level” system of graded responses, with passivation techniques such as singing, dancing, guitar and something I copied from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCLp7zodUiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monty Python’s “Ministry of Silly Walks”</a>. For inducing sleep, I adopted similarly complex patterns of rocking, bouncing, walking, singing, shushing and waiting. Some of these patterns involved a Swiss ball – a large, inflated exercise ball that serves as a rocking chair for the 21st century. This ball has harmonic degrees of freedom in the side-to-side and front-to-back directions as well as the primary up-and-down one, and is essential for bouncing and rocking a baby to sleep. In addition, it is good for the physicist-parent’s core strength, and can be easily deflated and packed up before relocating for yet another postdoc.</p><p>Once the baby is asleep, the physicist-parent is faced with the challenge of escaping the room – in my case over creaky hardwood floors. Doing this before my daughter realizes she is asleep requires knowledge of the “path of least noise”. Once I have exited the room, though, I have a dilemma. No sounds come from the crib. Is my daughter asleep or awake? A measurement is required. As I silently slide on my socks into the dark room, my measurement wakes her and her original state remains unknown. This is Schrödinger’s baby.</p><p><strong>My time at home</strong> has been a great period in my life and I know I will miss this when I’m back at work. As I write this essay in my head, my daughter rests on my shoulder. Her breathing turns to snoring and I synchronize my own breathing to be in phase with hers. Together we plan all the things I need to do during her naptime. I definitely don’t have time for a nap of my own.</p><hr><p><img src="https://smalldata.dev/images/baby_physics/author_muse.jpeg" alt="author and muse">

But to tide you by until I'm back, I thought you might enjoy listening to my talk from PAX Australia 2019 about the lesser-known of the indie game publishing giants from before the time of Braid and Steam and all that other stuff we've had over the past 15 years.</p><p>The talk was called The Rise &amp; Fall of Ambrosia Software, '90s Mac Legends, and you can find accompanying slides at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/paxausambrosiatalk" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/paxausambrosiatalk</a> as well as my full script on the accompanying blog post at lifeandtimes.games. So please, enjoy, and I'll see you in a couple of weeks.</p><div><p><em>[note that this won't correspond exactly to the audio, as it was my written script rather than what I actually said. If you're looking at the slides, "[NEXT]" means go to the next slide.]]<br></em><br>Hello everyone. My name is Richard Moss, and today I'm going to talk to you about a company that's pretty near and dear to my heart, not only as someone who grew up playing some of their games — [NEXT] but also as the author of a book called The Secret History of Mac Gaming, which covers their history, along with lots of other games and game developers from the 1980s and 90s Mac gaming scene. [NEXT]</p><p>If you were a Mac gamer in the late 90s, chances are pretty high that you would have had at least one game in your collection that came from Ambrosia Software. [NEXT] They were heroes among the Macintosh faithful, one of only a few companies that made its games exclusive to the Mac. And arguably the best among them in terms of the quality of its output.</p><p>Games like [NEXT] Maelstrom, [NEXT] Escape Velocity, [NEXT] Ferazel's Wand, [NEXT] Apeiron, and [NEXT] Bubble Trouble were hallmarks of quality, even if most of them were essentially just jazzed-up versions of classic 80s games. And they had top-drawer offbeat gaming options, too, with titles like [NEXT] Avara, a kinda abstract-looking arena-style first-person shooter, and [NEXT] Harry the Handsome Executive, where you guide a middle management executive through an office electronics apocalypse while scooting around in a swivel chair.</p><p>For about 15 years or so, from 1993 to around 2008, the Ambrosia Software name was inseparable from quality Macintosh games. But then it faded rapidly into the background, for reasons I'll get to later, and finally the company closed its doors at the end of last year.</p><p>***</p><p>So in recognition of Ambrosia's achievements, which have slipped a bit under the radar outside of the old-school Mac faithful, I wanted to give you a tour through the company's rise and fall. </p><p>There's not enough time to cover everything, but I'll try to get to all the key stuff and you'll hopefully come away with a good sense of a) why Ambrosia Software matters to the history of computer games and b) what made Ambrosia special to the Macintosh flock. </p><p>I've got some interview clips, a bit of gameplay footage, some photos and old documents to help us along the way. I wanted to set up an emulator as well but just ran out of time unfortunately. And hopefully there'll be plenty of time at the end for questions and stories from you in the audience.</p><p>But before we go into rise and fall of Ambrosia, let's do some quick background. First, on Ambrosia founder Andrew Welch. Then second on the Mac gaming scene in the early 90s.</p><p>[NEXT] So, Andrew Welch. His dad owned a marketing company, and it was through that business that young Andrew planted the seed for what would become Ambrosia. When he was something like 12 or 13 years old, he found the company's library of books and documents on typography. He thought it was cool, so he learnt how to design his own typefaces on his Macintosh. Then, starting from age 14 or so, he sold them on America OnLine.</p><p>But most people doing this sold their fonts without any documentation at all, so there was no way to know after the fact who made it, how to pay for it, who to contact for support, and so on. So Andrew taught himself how to code a utility program that could wrap his fonts in a simple document reader thing.</p><p>He enjoyed coding so much that he kept doing it, and made various other utilities for his relatives. Then he went off to college to study photojournalism and in his spare time he created [NEXT] his first game, a Wheel of Fortune clone called Wacky Wheel.</p><p>[NEXT] [show it in action]</p><p>This was kind of par for the course with small Mac games at the time. There were lots of people putting out crappy little games as freeware or shareware, but even the rare good ones weren't really making anything more than pizza and beer money.</p><p>[NEXT] Or literally beer.</p><p>Quick definition of shareware: [NEXT] it's software that you give away, free, but you ask that if someone likes it they pay you a registration fee — which, depending on the exact implementation, might get that person customer support or free updates or maybe just remove the nag screen from the boot-up process.</p><p>[NEXT] This is a pretty typical shareware notice, taken from an early DOS game.</p><p>Over on the PC side, shareware had already taken off. [NEXT] Apogee Software and Epic MegaGames were making a fortune working with independent developers and selling their games in a clever twist of the standard shareware model called The Apogee Model. Instead of giving away the whole thing for free and requesting that people pay if they like it, Apogee and Epic's games were [NEXT] episodic — episode one distributed freely over the internet and BBSs and through mail-order floppy disks, and all subsequent episodes available to order for a set fee.</p><p>I'm actually writing a book about this stuff, so if you're curious to learn more ask me about it later.</p><p>And id Software were just starting to make their name at this point as well. [NEXT] Wolfenstein 3D dropped in 92, then [NEXT] Doom in 93, both published as shareware on PC through Apogee. </p><p>So the time was ripe for shareware to step up and hit the big time on the Mac side, too. The Mac was at the peak of its [NEXT] pre-iMac popularity. College kids across the United States had Macs set up in their dorm rooms, while creative professionals all around the world had taken up the Mac mantle and were keen for more time-wasters to get them through the lulls in their output.</p><p>But there weren't many games coming out — the porting industry, which took PC games and put them on Mac, was still in its infancy after struggling with the [NEXT] peculiarities of adapting games for the Mac's multi-window mouse and menu-driven interface. Truly cross-platform commercial computer games that had concurrent Mac and PC releases were still rare (though there were a few special ones like [NEXT] SimCity 2000), and Mac-first development had gone into a bit of a lull (for a variety of reasons) at the end of the 1980s — from which it had yet to fully recover.</p><p>So there was lots of room for a great new Mac-native game to stand out.</p><p>And, crucially for our story here, someone was wrong on the Internet. I'll let you hear this bit straight from Andrew: [NEXT]</p><p><em>AW: I think it was the summer after maybe my freshman year of college that someone had said — I think it was called the Mac IIci or something like that. It was one of the colour Macs that came out. And someone had said something about the fact that while it was too slow to do decent animation on — and by that point in time I had actually taught myself for Assembly language, as well. So I set out to prove this guy wrong, because it's always fun to try to prove someone on the Internet that they're wrong. <p>*laughs* So, yeah, so that's how I started writing — and I really wasn't sure what I was going to do yet — but I started writing some kind of animation stuff. I grew up going to a lot of the arcades where we played games like Asteroids and Centipede and that type of thing where after school I would get dropped off there and play. So I decided to make an Asteroids-based game.</p></em></p><p>[NEXT]<br>He asked a couple of friends to help him out with the graphics, and got together with a few of his college buddies and a microphone to make a bunch of silly noises and record stuff off the TV for sound effects.</p><p>They pulled liberally from pop culture, drawing tiny clips and references (without permission) from all over the place, kind of like the wall of sound that early hip-hop and remix culture had.[NEXT]</p><p>He called the game Maelstrom and put it online as shareware, published under the name Ambrosia Software — a name he pulled from Greek mythology. You could play it and share it freely, but it'd nag you to send in a cheque to register every time you booted the game. And a lot of people did. [NEXT]</p><p><em>everyday we would go to the mailbox and there'd be letters from all over the world. I just had a blast. I thought it was really really cool that I could do something just sitting in my room in upstate New York, which was where I was at the time. And I got these contacts from all over the world. I thought that was really really cool, and it was at a time where people were just starting to get connected online.<p>Like now it's no big deal — you can go on …</p></em></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We live in a digital era where the most precious commodity no longer is oil or gold, but data. But what if this data, including personal files, customer lists and company data, flight traffic information, or even sensitive hospital records were stolen? What would you do, or pay, to get it back?</p>
</section><article><section><p>Ransomware has been on the rise the past years, where criminals effectively take all the data on your computer hostage and demand a ransom to give it back to you. Refusing to pay may result in your data being lost permanently. </p>
<p>Everyone is a potential target for ransomware, including single individuals, small to large companies, and even public institutions. A disconcerting trend is the targeting of hospitals and the public sector. Only last year the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles was <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/02/18/california-hospital-ransomware-attack-hackers/">attacked by ransomware</a>, blocking the company’s access to their own network and crucial patient data for 10 whole days. The hospital ended up paying the ransom of $17 000 in bitcoin to decrypt the data. </p>
<p>The demands have also increased drastically the last few years, where the <a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/q2-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report">average ransom payment</a> having increased to an exorbitant $178 000 in Q2 of 2020. Some bigger companies also receive very high demands. For instance, Garmin was attacked in 2020 with an initial ransom demand of $10 million, which some <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/confirmed-garmin-received-decryptor-for-wastedlocker-ransomware/">sources</a> claim they chose to pay. And this does not include the costs of other factors such as downtime, loss of revenue, mistrust from consumers, and resources used to get everything up and running again. </p>
<p>Clearly, ransomware is a growing problem with an increase in both attacks and in the ransom demands themselves, as well as the targeting of sectors with the possible consequence of directly endangering lives. </p>
<p>But how to the criminals make their attacks so successful, either forcing a victim to pay or having to accept the loss of their data? The main principle of ransomware is that attackers will encrypt all the files rendering them unreadable, and only by buying the key to decrypt the files will they be accessible again. The first step to achieve this, is to obtain access to a computer or network in order to install the ransomware. </p>
<h2>How does ransomware get installed on my computer?</h2>
<p>Ransomware is a type of malware, which is a malicious piece of software that installs itself without permission on someone’s computer or even an organization’s whole system. The most common ways the attackers get access to your computer are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phishing – a cyber-attack imitating a trusted source, where an employee or private person is tricked into installing the malware without knowing it. This can be through clicking a link or downloading an attachment in a seemingly legit email.</li>
<li>Drive by downloads – visiting compromised websites that then installs the malware on your computer.</li>
<li>Security vulnerabilities – if systems are not up to date and are known to have weaknesses, then attackers will exploit these to install their malware. </li>
</ol>
<h2>How does ransomware encrypt my files?</h2>
<p>Once the ransomware is installed, it encrypts all the data on your computer. Unfortunately, the encryption methods used now are so complex that it is unfeasible to decrypt the files without the decryption key, which is known only to the attackers. To achieve a secure encryption of your data, the attackers use a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption. </p>
<h4>Symmetric encryption</h4>
<p>One of the oldest ciphers in history is the shift cipher, which shifts each letter a set number of times back or forth in the alphabet. Knowing this set number, also referred to as the “key”, is therefore enough to both encrypt and decrypt a text. Julius Caesar was believed to use a shift cipher, substituting each letter with the one 3 spaces to the right. This is one of the simplest examples of a symmetric encryption. </p>
<p>Today, there are more advanced versions, which can be broadly categorized as block ciphers (encrypts in byte-sized blocks) or stream ciphers (encrypts single digits). These methods are fast and only require the same key to encrypt and decrypt. </p>
<h4>Asymmetric encryption</h4>
<p>Asymmetric encryption is slower and uses two keys instead of one: one public and one private. The private key is only in the possession of the key pair owner, whereas the public one is widely distributed. When using the public key to encrypt a message it can only be decrypted using the private key, and vice versa.  </p>
<h4>Ransomware take advantage of both encryption methods.</h4>
<p>One of the most common ways a ransomware takes over your computer, is through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the ransomware is installed on a computer, it comes with an asymmetric public key, which it used to establish contact with the attackers’ server. All communication is encrypted using this asymmetric encryption, making it impossible to intercept and interpret the communication between the affected computer and the server. </li>
<li>The ransomware will then request a new asymmetric public key from the server, which is specific for the victim’s computer (making it impossible to share a key with other victims). </li>
<li>Once received, the ransomware also creates a symmetric key, which quickly encrypts all the files. </li>
<li>The symmetric key is then encrypted using the asymmetric key specific to the victim. This means that only the private key on the attackers’ server can be used to unlock the symmetric key, which again will decrypt all the files. </li>
</ol>
<p>This makes the whole process fast and yet very secure, and almost impossible to decrypt without paying the ransom. </p>
<h2>Victims of ransomware</h2>
<p>Originally, ransomware was used to target individuals, with a low enough ransom so most people would choose to pay. While individuals are still affected, organizations are targeted on a more regular basis, and can offer a more lucrative pay-off if successful. In fact, <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/05/12/the-state-of-ransomware-2020/">one study</a> showed that over half of the companies had been subjected to a ransomware attack in the past year, and that 73% of these attacks were successful. A recent trend also shows an increase in attacks targeting <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/28/politics/hospitals-targeted-ransomware-attacks/index.html">government institutions and hospitals</a>.  </p>
<h2>Costs and solutions</h2>
<p>An estimate shows that total ransom demands will reach a staggering <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-20-billion-usd-by-2021/">20 billion USD by 2021</a>. </p>
<p>While paying the ransom is strongly discouraged as it helps create a marked for extorting money in this manner, some still choose to pay the ransom to retrieve their data. One recent <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/05/12/the-state-of-ransomware-2020/">study</a> of 5000 IT people showed that about 26% chose to pay and that of these, 95% did actually get the decryption key needed to unlock their files again. Over half chose not to pay and instead used backups of their data, while the rest used other methods.</p>
<p>However, even though paying up may seem like the best way to get things restored again, it may actually double the costs of being affected. All organizations attacked by ransomware had a high cost due to downtime, network costs, lost opportunity etc. even without paying the ransom. In fact, the authors of this <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/05/12/the-state-of-ransomware-2020/">study</a> argue that the organizations that chose to pay  had the same costs as those who did not with getting their systems back online, except they also had the cost of removing the encryption in addition to their other expenses.</p>
<p>As most attacks are successful and as it is nearly impossible to decrypt your files after an attack, it’s best to try and prevent an attack in the first place. Good strategies include having regular and off-site backup of data, installing anti-ransomware on your system, training employees in recognizing phishing, and closing any technological vulnerabilites that could be exploited. Stay tuned for more on this and other good preventative measure in our next article.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p>This is the second part of a four part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">I</a>, III, IV) look at the Dothraki, the fictional horse-borne nomads of the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> / <em>Game of Thrones</em> series.  We’re looking at, in particular, the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that the Dothraki are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up in the face of research.  Our last part, “<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">Barbarian Couture</a>” looked at the influences that shaped the visual depiction of the Dothraki and found them badly wanting, more based in stereotypes and misconceptions than historical reality.</p>



<p>This week, we’re turning to the foundation of social structures: <strong>patterns of subsistence</strong> (<strong>which, to be clear, means in plain English: “how do they get food and basic resources?” </strong> That’s all subsistence is – how do you get enough resources to survive.)  Originally this was going to fit into a larger argument about culture, but I decided to break it out because we are <em>at long last</em> looking at the logistics and subsistence strategies of nomadic peoples.  Every time we have covered the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/10/collections-the-siege-of-gondor/">logistics </a>of <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">agrarian </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/10/04/collections-the-preposterous-logistics-of-the-loot-train-battle-game-of-thrones-s7e4/">armies </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">societies</a>, there has been a request to do a deeper dive into the way that Steppe nomads in particular, and nomads more generally, are different.  <strong>Well here it is!</strong></p>

And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>(Bibliography note before we dive in.  I am not going to run through everything I’ve glanced at here, but for those looking to read more on this or retrace my steps more generally, a good starting place on the Steppe peoples is T. May, <em>The Mongol Art of War</em> (2007).  There’s also more than a dash here of bits from K. Chase, <em>Firearms: A Global History to 1700</em> (2008) as well as T. Ratchnevsky, <em>Genghis Khan: His Life and Legacy</em>, trans. T.N Haining (1991).  For the Native Americans of the Great Plains, I have relied principally on A.R. McGinnis, <em>Counting Coup and Cutting Horses: Intertribal Warfare on the Northern Plains, 1738-1889</em> (1990), F.R. Secoy, <em>Changing Military Patterns of the Great Plains Indians (17th Century through Early 19th Century)</em> (1958), and A.C. Isenberg, <em>The Destruction of the Bison: An Environmental History, 1750-1920</em> (2020))</p>



<p><strong>As with the past essay, the key statement we are really assessing here is <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">this one by George R.R. Martin</a>:</strong></p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes… seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy.</p></blockquote>



<p>A statement which claims, quite directly, that the Dothraki are modeled primarily off of both Eurasian Steppe nomads and Great Plains Native Americans (with a ‘dash’ of fantasy).  Last time, we found that the <em>appearance</em> of the Dothraki fit almost entirely within the ‘dash’ of fantasy.  So this time we will begin to ask the same question about Dothraki culture –<strong> to what degree may it be said to be based in any <em>actual</em> historical horse-nomad cultures?</strong></p>



<h2>A Feast For People</h2>



<p>Now ‘culture’ is such a huge topic, it may well be asked why start with subsistence strategies. <strong> The answer is that in the pre-modern world, subsistence was one of, if not the, most dominant factor shaping culture</strong>.  After all, most people before the industrial revolution spent most of their time just doing the basic activities (herding, farming, spinning, weaving, cooking, etc.) that made survival possible!  Government structures, military organization, cultural values, marriage and fertility patterns, social structures all flow out of those things which most people were doing to survive, shaped by the needs of those subsistence strategies.</p>



<p>(A brief pedantic note: this sort of approach to history, beginning with big, slow changing patterns (what I often call here ‘structures’ – not a term I made up, by any means) like climate, geography, subsistence strategies, culture, etc. is generally associated with what is called the <em>Annales</em> school of history, which is a <em>method</em> of history.  This framework is often more interested in <em>La longue durée</em> (lit: ‘the (really) long term’) which is just a fancy French way of saying ‘a focus on the long-term historical structures (like those listed above) instead of short-term events (like wars, rulers, that sort of thing).’  As always, this sort of historical theory is a toolbox, not a dogma; different approaches to answer different questions.  But in this case, it is handy because of the way that the basic activities necessary for survival in a given climate form a sort of ‘bounding box’ for cultural possibility.)</p>



<p>What is particularly notable is with <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> is that our viewpoint character for Dothraki culture is a young woman who spends her time with the Dothraki in the <em>khalassar’s</em> (the Dothraki word for a tribe or clan) moving encampment.  Daenerys can only really view warfare second hand (at least in the books we get; the show is another matter), <strong>but she ought to be able to witnesses the subsistence system directly</strong>.  Even if she wasn’t involved in it directly (because she’s a high status queen), the daily work of survival would be going on all around her and in practice much of it would likely be at her direction as she exercises authority over lower-status individuals in the camp.</p>



<p>Now normally we would start this by looking at how subsistence strategies are represented in the books and show, but I think in this case it is going to be more helpful to begin with the historical subsistence systems <em>first</em>, since they are complex and we’re going to have several of them.  We’re actually going to start at the ending as well, with subsistence strategies of Native Americans on the Great Plains, for reasons that will be clearer once we’ve discussed it.</p>



<h2>A Changing of Patterns</h2>



<p><strong>The domesticated horse is not native to the Americas</strong>.  There is perhaps no more important fact when trying to understand how the horse-borne nomadic cultures of the Eurasian Steppe relate to those of the Great Plains.  The first domesticated horses arrived in the Americans with European explorer/conquerors and the settler-colonists that followed them.  Eventually enough of those horses escaped to create a self-reproducing wild (technically feral, since they were once domesticated) horse population, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustang">mustangs</a>, but they are not indigenous and mustangs were never really the primary source of new horses the way that wild horses on the Steppe were (before someone goes full nerd in the comments, yes I am aware that there were some early equines in the Americas at very early dates, but they were extinct before there was any chance for them to be domesticated).</p>

Mustangs are descendants mostly of Spanish horse breeds.  Notably, they tend to be smaller than many other breeds of European horses, even in cases where their domesticated forebears were larger breeds of draft horses or destriers.  This is because big stable-fed horses can’t survive on grass alone.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Horses arrived in the Great Plains form the south via the Spanish and moving through Native American peoples west of the Rocky Mountains by both trade and eventually raiding in the early 1700s</strong>.  Notably firearms <em>also</em> began moving into the region in the same period, but from the opposite direction, coming from British and French traders to the North and West (the Spanish had regulations against trading firearms to Native Americans, making them unavailable as a source).  Both were thus initially <em>expensive trade goods</em> which could only be obtained from outside and then percolated unevenly through the territory; unlike firearms, which remained wholly external in their supply, horses were bred on the plains, but raiding and trade were still essential sources of supply for most peoples on the plains.  We’ll get to this more when we talk about warfare (where we’ll get into the four different military systems created by this diffusion), but being in a position where one’s neighbors had either the horse or the gun and your tribe did not was an <em>extreme</em> military disadvantage and it’s clear that the ‘falling out’ period whereby these two military innovations distributed over the area was very disruptive.</p>



<p><strong>But unlike guns</strong>, which seem to have had massive military impacts but only minimal subsistence impacts (a bow being just as good for hunting bison as a musket, generally), <strong>the arrival of the horse had <em>massive</em> subsistence impacts</strong> because it made hunting <em>wildly</em> more effective.  But the key thing to remember here is: the horse was <em>introduced</em> to the Great Plains no earlier than 1700, horse availability expanded only slowly over the area, but by 1877 (with the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sioux_War_of_1876">Black Hills War</a>), true Native American independence on the Great Plains was functionally over.  <strong>Consequently, unlike the Steppe, where we have a fairly ‘set’ system that had already been refined for centuries, <em>all</em> we see of the Plains Native American horse-based subsistence system is rapid change</strong>.  There was no finally reached stable end state, as far as I can tell.</p>



<p>Though there is considerable variation and also severe limits to the evidence, it seems that prior to the arrival of the horse, most Native peoples around the Great Plains practiced two major subsistence systems: <strong>nomadic hunter-gathering on foot </strong>(distinct from what will follow in that it places much more emphasis on the gathering part)<strong> on the one hand and a mixed subsistence system of small-scale farming mixed seasonally with plains hunting seems to have been the main options pre-horse</strong>, based on the degree to which the local area permitted farming in this way (for more on those, note Isenberg, <em>op. cit.</em>, 31-40).  Secoy …</p></div></div>

This is a seismic step," said Dr. Sean O'Sullivan, a Tillsonburg, Ont., doctor and medical director of TheraPsil, a non-profit group that advocates for the therapeutic use of psilocybin.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This is permission from the Ministry of Health and the Minister of Health to allow therapists to forward their own training in psychedelic medicine."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/337/291/Sickboy-640x360.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>Sickboy</span><span>1:02:33</span><span>Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine</span></p></div></div></div><span>Thomas Hartle never used drugs before his Stage IV cancer diagnosis.

Since then, other exemptions have been given to patients who want to use magic mushrooms.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The exemptions for health professionals will allow those who want to treat patients with psilocybin&nbsp;to understand what it would feel like and how best to use it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>They are good for one year.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Psychedelic substances and treatment using these substances, such as&nbsp;psilocybin, is a growing area of scientific study and research. Because&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;is not an authorized therapeutic substance, the availability of rigorous scientific evidence demonstrating its safety and efficacy is limited," Health Canada said in a statement to CBC News.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The exemptions do not permit the health care professionals to prescribe or provide mushrooms containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;to another person. There are no drugs containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;that have been authorized&nbsp; by Health Canada. Health Canada's decision to grant these exemptions does not constitute an opinion or endorsement from Health Canada on&nbsp;psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, training, or the safety, effectiveness, or quality of&nbsp;psilocybin."</p>  <h2>Psychiatrists, nurses given exemptions</h2>  <p>"This is an immense step that the minister has taken, and a very wise step, a step that is totally congruent with the science and the published literature and is a very courageous move on her part and on our government's part," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Psychedelic therapies such as psilocybin and LSD have had negative reputations, in part because of the war on drugs, O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"The war on drugs has been an unmitigated disaster worldwide. It has criminalized behaviour that does not need to be criminalized. Cannabis has been legalized, and the sky has not fallen," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Those who have been given exemptions include psychiatrists associated with the University of Toronto, a community psychiatrist in Hamilton and his partner, as well as health professionals in Calgary and British Columbia.&nbsp;</p>  <p>O'Sullivan and his wife both got an exemption. He is a general practitioner and she is a therapist. He said it's important for doctors who could eventually prescribe psychedelics to be well versed in their effects.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Dr. Sean O'Sullivan is one of 16 health professionals who has been granted an exemption from Canada's drug laws to use magic mushrooms. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Sean O'Sullivan)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"You would not expect a guide to take any journey over any terrain with&nbsp;which the guide was not familiar. When it comes to psychedelics, the terrain is so unusual and so outlandish that it is absolutely imperative that the therapist have familiarity with the realms of the human unconscious that are visited under psychedelics because they can help guide the patient through situations that might seem utterly bizarre, even psychotic to an untrained therapist," O'Sullivan said.</p>  <p>"Great information can be obtained if you dissect and unpack that material that comes up under these medications."</p>  <p>Psilocybin&nbsp;allows the brain to put away the "default mode network," the part of our brain that worries about taxes and dinner and the shopping list, and dive deeper.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"If you look at your <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/seeking-seat-of-consciousness-in-dark-side-of-brain-1.1415607" target="_blank">default mode network</a>, you will find that the themes that come up are the same themes that came up last year and the year before and the decade before," O'Sullivan said. "Psychedelics disassemble the default mode network and they allow a person to have new experiences in a carefully controlled clinical setting. When the default mode network is put back together, it's not put back together in the same way as it was previously."</p>  <p>That's why a single dose of a psychedelic medicine can have more effect than years of talk therapy or medication, he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the core requirements of the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#the-kubernetes-network-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes networking model</a> is that every pod should get its own IP address and that every pod in the cluster should be able to talk to it using this IP address. There are several network providers (flannel, calico, canal, etc.) that implement this networking model.</p><p>As I started working on Kubernetes, it wasn’t completely clear to me how every pod is assigned an IP address. I understood how various components worked independently, however, it wasn’t clear how these components fit together. For instance, I understood what CNI plugins were, however, I didn’t know how they were invoked. So, I wanted to write this post to share what I have learned about various networking components and how they are stitched together in a kubernetes cluster for every pod to receive an IP address.</p><p>There are various ways of setting up networking in kubernetes and various options for a container runtime. For this post, I will use
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/flannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flannel</a> as the network provider and
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containerd</a> as the container runtime. Also, I am going to assume that you know how container networking works and only share a very brief overview below for context.</p><h2 id="some-background-concepts">Some Background Concepts</h2><h3 id="container-networking-a-very-brief-overview">Container Networking: A Very Brief Overview</h3><p>There are some really good posts explaining how container networking works. For context, I will go over a very high level overview here with a single approach that involves linux bridge networking and packet encapsulation. I am skipping details here as container networking deserves a blog post of itself. Some of the posts that I have found to be very educational in this space are
<a href="#container-networking">linked in the references below</a>.</p><h4 id="containers-on-the-same-host">Containers on the same host</h4><p>One of the ways containers running on the same host can talk to each other via their IP addresses is through a linux bridge. In the kubernetes (and docker) world, a
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veth (virtual ethernet)</a> device is created to achieve this. One end of this veth device is inserted into the container network namespace and the other end is connected to a
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linux bridge</a> on the host network. All containers on the same host have one end of this veth pair connected to the linux bridge and they can talk to each other using their IP addresses via the bridge. The linux bridge is also assigned an IP address and it acts as a gateway for egress traffic from pods destined to different nodes.

Flannel supports this through
<a href="https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2017-vxlan-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vxlan</a> which wraps the original packet inside a UDP packet and sends it to the destination.</p><p>In a kubernetes cluster, flannel creates a vxlan device and some route table entries on each of the nodes. Every packet that’s destined for a container on a different host goes through the vxlan device and is encapsulated in a UDP packet. On the destination, the encapsulated packet is retrieved and the packet is routed through to the destined pod.

Various container runtimes implement the CRI API and this allows users to use the container runtime of their choice in their kubernetes installation.</p><h3 id="what-is-cni">What is CNI?</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/cni" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNI project</a> includes a
<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spec</a> to provide a generic plugin-based networking solution for linux containers. It also consists of various
<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plugins</a> which perform different functions in configuring the pod network. A CNI plugin is an executable that follows the CNI spec and we’ll discuss some plugins in the post below.</p><h2 id="assigning-subnets-to-nodes-for-pod-ip-addresses">Assigning Subnets To Nodes For Pod IP Addresses</h2><p>If all pods are required to have an IP address, it’s important to ensure that all pods across the entire cluster have a unique IP address. This is achieved by assigning each node a unique subnet from which pods are assigned IP addresses on that node.</p><h3 id="node-ipam-controller">Node IPAM Controller</h3><p>When <code>nodeipam</code> is passed as an option to the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kube-controller-manager’s</a> <code>--controllers</code> command line flag, it allocates each node a dedicated subnet (podCIDR) from the cluster CIDR (IP range for the cluster network). Since these podCIDRs are disjoint subnets, it allows assigning each pod a unique IP address.</p><p>A kubernetes node is assigned a podCIDR when the node first registers with the cluster. To change the podCIDR allocated to nodes in a cluster, nodes need to be de-registered and then re-registered with any configuration changes first applied to the kubernetes control plane. <code>podCIDR</code> for a node can be listed using the following command.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl get no &lt;nodeName&gt; -o json | jq '.spec.podCIDR'
10.244.0.0/24
</code></pre><h2 id="kubelet-container-runtime-and-cni-plugins---how-its-all-stitched-together">Kubelet, Container Runtime and CNI Plugins - how it’s all stitched together</h2><p>When a pod is scheduled on a node, a lot of things happen to start up a pod. In this section, I’ll only focus on the interactions that relate to configuring network for the pod.</p><p>Once a pod is scheduled on the node, the following interactions result in configuring the network and starting the application container.

<a href="https://github.com/containerd/cri/blob/v1.11.1/docs/architecture.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containerd cri plugin architecture</a></p><h2 id="interactions-between-container-runtime-and-cni-plugins">Interactions between Container Runtime and CNI Plugins</h2><p>Every network provider has a CNI plugin which is invoked by the container runtime to configure network for a pod as it’s started. With containerd as the container runtime,
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/cri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containerd CRI plugin</a> invokes the CNI plugin. Every network provider also has an agent that’s installed on each of the kubernetes node to configure pod networking. When the network provider agent is installed, it either ships with the CNI config or it creates one on the node which is then used by the CRI plugin to figure out which CNI plugin to call.</p><p>The location for the CNI config file is configurable and the default value is <code>/etc/cni/net.d/&lt;config-file&gt;</code>. CNI plugins need to be shipped on every node by the cluster administrators. The location for CNI plugins is configurable as well and the default value is <code>/opt/cni/bin</code>.</p><p>In case of containerd as the container runtime, path for CNI configuration and CNI plugin binaries can be specified under <code>[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".cni]</code> section of the
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/cri/blob/master/docs/config.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">containerd config</a>.</p><p>Since we are referring to Flannel as the network provider here, I’ll talk a little about how Flannel is set up. Flanneld is the Flannel daemon and is typically installed on a kubernetes cluster as a daemonset with <code>install-cni</code> as an
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml#L172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">init container</a>. The <code>install-cni</code> container creates the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ronaknnathani/957a56210bd4fbd8e11120273c6b4ede" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNI configuration file</a> - <code>/etc/cni/net.d/10-flannel.conflist</code> - on each node. Flanneld creates a vxlan device, fetches networking metadata from the apiserver and watches for updates on pods. As pods are created, it distributes routes for all pods across the entire cluster and these routes allow pods to connect to each other via their IP addresses.

The network provider CNI plugin calls other base CNI plugins to configure the network. The interactions between CNI plugins are described below.</p><h3 id="interactions-between-cni-plugins">Interactions Between CNI Plugins</h3><p>There are various CNI plugins that help configure networking between containers on a host.

For every pod, it then creates a veth pair - one end of the pair is in the container’s network namespace and the other end is connected to the linux bridge on the host network. With Bridge CNI plugin, all containers on a host are connected to the linux bridge on the host network.</p><p>After configuring the veth pair, Bridge plugin invokes the host-local IPAM CNI plugin.

<p><strong>By Celso Dantas and Maxime Vaillancourt</strong></p>
<p>In the previous post about <a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-shopify-reduced-storefront-response-times-rewrite" target="_blank" title="How Shopify Reduced Storefront Response Times with a Rewrite" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">our new storefront rendering engine</a>, we described how we went about the rewrite process and smoothly transitioned to serve storefront requests with the new implementation. As a follow-up and based on readers’ comments and questions, this post dives deeper into the technical details of how we built the new storefront rendering engine to be faster than the previous implementation.</p>
<p>To set the table, let’s see how the new storefront rendering engine performs:</p>
<ul>
<li>It generates a response in less than ~45ms for 75% of storefront requests;</li>
<li>It generates a response in less than ~230ms for 90% of storefront requests;</li>
<li>It generates a response in less than ~900ms for 99% of storefront requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the new storefront rendering engine, the average storefront response is nearly 5x faster than with the previous implementation. Of course, how fast the rendering engine is able to process a request and spit out a response depends on two key factors: the shop’s Liquid theme implementation, and the number of resources needed to process the request. To get a better idea of where the storefront rendering engine spends its time when processing a request, try using the <a href="https://shopify.engineering/in-depth-liquid-render-analysis-shopify-theme-inspector-chrome-extension" target="_blank" title="How to Do an In-depth Liquid Render Analysis with Theme Inspector" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shopify Theme Inspector</a>: this tool will help you identify potential bottlenecks so you can work on improving performance in those areas.</p>

<figcaption>A simplified data schema of the application</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Before we cover each topic, let’s briefly describe our application stack. As mentioned in the previous post, the new storefront rendering engine is a Ruby application. It talks to a sharded MySQL database and uses Redis to store and retrieve cached data.</p>
<p>Optimizing how we load all that data is extremely important. As one of our requirements was to improve rendering time for Storefront requests. Here are some of the approaches that we took to accomplish that.</p>

<p>To reduce the number of network round trips to the database, we use <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/multi-statement.html" target="_blank" title="MySQL - 14.8.2 Multi-Statement" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MySQL’s multi-statement feature</a> to allow sending multiple queries at once. With a single request to the database, we can load data from multiple tables at once. Here’s a simplified example:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This request is especially useful to batch-load a lot of data very early in the response lifecycle based on the incoming request. After identifying the type of request, we trigger a single multi-statement query to fetch the data we need for that particular request in one go, which we’ll discuss later in this blog post. For example, for a request for a product page, we’ll load data for the product, its variants, its images, and other product-related resources in addition to information about the shop and the storefront theme, all in a single round-trip to MySQL.</p>

<p>As shown above, the new storefront rendering engine uses handcrafted, optimized SQL queries. This allows us to easily write fine-tuned SQL queries to select only the columns we need for each resource and leverage JOINs and sub-SELECT statements to optimize data loading based on the resources to load which are sometimes less straightforward to implement with a full-service object-relational mapping (ORM) layer.</p>
<p>However, the main benefit of this approach is the tiny memory footprint of using a raw MySQL client compared to using an object-relational mapping (ORM) layer that’s unnecessarily complex for our needs. Since there’s no unnecessary abstraction, forgoing the use of an ORM drastically simplifies the flow of data. Once the raw rows come back from MySQL, we effectively use the simplest ORM possible: we create plain old Ruby objects from the raw rows to model the business domain. We then use these Ruby objects for the remainder of the request. Below is an example of how it’s done.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Of course, not using an ORM layer comes with a cost: if implemented poorly, this approach can lead to more complexity leaking into the application code. Creating thin model abstractions using plain old Ruby objects prevents this from happening, and makes it easier to interact with resources while meeting our performance criteria. Of course, this approach isn’t particularly common and has the potential to cause panic in software engineers who aren’t heavily involved in performance work, instead worrying about schema migrations and compatibility issues. However, when speed is critical, we accept to take on that complexity.</p>

<p>An HTTP request for a Shopify storefront may end up requiring many different resources from data stores to render properly. For example, a request for a product page could lead to requiring information about other products, images, variants, inventory information, and a whole lot of other data not loaded on multi-statement select. The first time the storefront rendering engine loads this page, it needs to query the database, sometimes making multiple requests, to retrieve all the information it needs. This usually happens during the request at any given time.</p>
<figure><img alt="A flow diagram showing the Storefront Renderer's requests from  the data stores and how it uses a Query Book Keeper Middlewear to eager-load data" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-request-bookeeping-solution_adbd68eb-cc30-4be5-9bdf-104011224ad2.jpg?v=1607636269" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-request-bookeeping-solution_adbd68eb-cc30-4be5-9bdf-104011224ad2.jpg?v=1607636269">
<figcaption>Flow of a request with the Book-keeping solution</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As it retrieves this data for the first time, the storefront rendering engine keeps track of the queries it performed on the database for that particular product page and stores that list of queries in a key-value store for later use. When an HTTP request for the same product page comes in later (which it knows when the cache key matches), the rendering engine looks up the list of queries it performed throughout the previous request of the same type and performs those queries all at once, at the very beginning of the current request, because we’re pretty confident we’ll need them for this request (since they were used in the previous request).</p>
<p>This book-keeping mechanism lets us eager-load data we’re pretty confident we’ll need. Of course, when a page changes, this may lead to over-fetching and/or under-fetching, which is expected, and the shape of the data we fetch stabilizes quickly over time as more requests come in.</p>
<p>On the other side, some liquid models of Shopify’s storefronts are not accessed as frequently, and we don’t need to eager-load data related to them. If we did, we’d increase I/O wait time for something that we probably wouldn’t use very often. What the new rendering engine does instead is lazy-load this data by default. Unless the book-keeping mechanism described above eager-loads it, we’ll defer retrieving data to only load it if it’s needed for a particular request.</p>

<p>Much like a CPU’s caching architecture, the new rendering engine implements multiple layers of caching to accelerate responses.</p>
<p>A critical aside before we jump into this section: adding caching should never be the first step towards building performance-oriented software. Start by building a solution that’s extremely fast from the get go, even without caching. Once this is achieved, then consider adding caching to reduce load on the various components on the system while accelerating frequent use cases. Caching is like a sharp knife and can introduce hard to detect bugs.</p>
<h2>In-Memory Cache</h2>
<figure><img alt="A data scheme diagram showing that the Storefront Renderer and Redis instance are contained in a Kubernetes node. Within the Storefront Renderer is an In-memory cache. The Storefront Renderer sends Redis data. The Storefront Renderer sends data to two sharded data stores outside of the Kubernetes node: Sharded MySQL and Sharded Redis" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-renderer-data-schema-in-memory-cache.jpg?v=1607636398" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-renderer-data-schema-in-memory-cache.jpg?v=1607636398">
<figcaption>A simplified data schema of the application with an in-memory cache for the Storefront Renderer</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the frontline of our caching system is an in-memory cache that you can essentially think of as a global hash that’s shared across requests within each web worker. Much like the majority of our caching mechanisms, this caching layer uses the LRU caching algorithm. As a result, we use this caching layer for data that’s accessed very often. This layer is especially useful in high throughput scenarios such as flash sales.</p>
<h2>Node-local Shared Caching</h2>
<p>As a second layer on top of the in-memory cache, the new rendering engine leverages a node-local Redis store that’s shared across all server workers on the same node. Since the database is available on the same machine as the rendering engine process itself, this node-local data transfer prevents network overhead and improves response times. As a result, multiple Ruby processes benefit from sharing cached data with one another.</p>
<h2>Full-page Caching</h2>
<p>Once the rendering engine successfully renders a full storefront response for a particular type of request, we store the final output (most often an HTML or JSON string) into the local Redis for later retrieval for subsequent requests that match the same cache key. This full-page caching solution lets us prevent regenerating storefront responses if we can by using the output we previously computed.</p>
<h2>Database Query Results Caching</h2>
<p>In a scenario where the full-page output cache, the in-memory cache, and the node-local cache doesn’t have a valid entry for a given request, we need to reach all the way to the database. Once we get a result back from MySQL, we transparently cache the results in Redis for later retrieval based on the queries and their parameters. As long as the cache keys don’t change, running the same database queries over and over always hit Redis instead of reaching all the way to the database.</p>
<h2>Liquid Object Memoizer</h2>
<p>Thanks to the Liquid templating language, merchants and partners may build custom storefront themes. When loading a particular storefront page, it’s possible that the Liquid template to render includes multiple references to the same object. This is common on the product page for example, where the template will include many references to the product object: <br><code>{{ product.title }}</code>, <code>{{ product.description }}</code>, <code>{{ product.featured_media }}</code>, and others.</p>
<p>Of course, when each of these are executed, we don’t fetch the product over and over again from the database—we fetch it once, then keep it in memory for later use throughout the request lifecycle. This means that if the same product object is required multiple times at different locations during the render process, we’ll always use the same one and only instance of it throughout the entire …</p></div></div>
