<p>I remember writing software in the period roughly between 2005 and 2015 where sometimes it could feel like every week something new was thrown at us. We were transitioning from desktop to the web and then cloud and mobile. We were just getting good at Object-oriented programming when a shift towards Functional Programming required us to rethink our mental models around our code. Cloud scale computing brought us from solely using SQL databases to study and use NoSQL databases. We went from embracing XML and SOAP to transitioning to JSON.</p>
<div><p><h3>Focus on your customers, on business value and the developer experience. Do more, and keep things simple.</h3></p></div>

<p>Looking at JavaScript alone there was also a lot of turmoil. The language started almost as a toy language to glue together simple elements on a web page. Then it slowly but steadily grew into becoming the most widely used programming language on the web. It even moved on beyond the browser and started to conquer the server with Node.js. A realm where Java and .NET were dominant before, now had to create some room for people starting to use JavaScript on the server.</p>
<p>On the web, framework after framework was becoming popular. Much to the point where they are still being refactored away ten years later. I remember moving from jQuery to Backbone or Knockout. I used Ember a bit and then also Angular. All of these seemed to offer some improvements over what was previously there. There were still enough rough edges however. It was clear we were not there yet.</p>
<div id="enter-the-calm-and-how-we-used-the-sjgar-stack-for-the-first-time"><h3><a href="#enter-the-calm-and-how-we-used-the-sjgar-stack-for-the-first-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="enter the calm and how we used the sjgar stack for the first time permalink"></a>Enter the Calm and how we used the SJGAR stack for the first time.</h3></div>
<p>In 2015, I got the chance to work on a corporate startup project that was completely greenfield. We set out to create a platform with web and mobile apps with state-of-the-art user experience, and we wanted to fail or succeed fast. This meant we had to ensure a short time to market. We had to focus on developer experience and productivity. After having tried some pieces of technology on smaller projects, this was the perfect chance to put them together and figure out if they would play nicely together. In theory, it should all work, but previous experience had shown that you really need to start using them for a decent amount of time to figure out if the new advantages will really outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<div><p><h3>It worked. It really worked.</h3></p></div>
<p>We built a web application using React and an accompanying mobile app using React Native. The backend was built using AWS Serverless technologies. We used DynamoDB as the single source of truth for data. The built-in event triggering system was used to run some Node.js code in a Lambda to stream this data to a managed Elasticsearch cluster, so we could support the search and query capabilities we needed. We created a GraphQL API using the reference server implementation graphql-js (Apollo Server and Client weren't a thing back then). Again this was run in Lambda. To make sure the web application was performant enough for our end users we used a Lambda to implement Server Side Rendering (Gatsby and Next.js also weren't a thing back then). We also used the Serverless framework, a bit shaky at that time, to write our infra as code.</p>
<p>With a handful of full stack engineers we were able to deliver this project successfully to production. We could deliver new versions of our microservices independently, and we would do this multiple times a day.</p>
<p>It worked. It really worked.</p>
<p>We started with almost zero costs for infrastructure. The most expensive service was the Elasticsearch service. The other services would easily service our first customers on the free tier. I think we never spent over 100 euros a month. Without Elasticsearch it would probably not have been higher than 10 euros a month. We launched and started running ad campaigns to lure customers to our new offering. For these ad campaigns we were spending over a thousand euros per month. It was clear that we now could go to the business and tell them we could do innovation projects with IT running costs of close to zero.</p>
<p>I remember we were able to move some logic from the web app to the authentication provider (we used Auth0 back then since Cognito was still a bit too new) by just copying some JavaScript code. Similarly, we were able to move code from frontend to backend. More generally we were able to take what we learned in a certain context, and apply it to a different one. JavaScript allowed us to learn a single programming language and write code for the Web, Mobile and Cloud. React allowed us to use a single framework to structure applications and do the state management for both Web and Mobile. Using Flexbox we could even apply the same UI layout system in these apps. With the complex and time-consuming nature of layout work, it was great that we were able to reuse our knowledge and tools to enjoy a great productivity boost.</p>
<p>Going Serverless meant we did not have to spend time on managing servers. The code and the system would just work. No disks filling up, no security patches to be applied, no certificates to be updated. AWS had given us a platform with great performance and stability. Everything would just run.</p>
<p>After running this project in 2015 and 2016, in the end it was shuttered because it did not align with our business goals. Only later I came to realize this set of technologies would stand the test of time, and would do so pretty well.</p>
<div id="okay-this-thing-needs-a-name"><h3><a href="#okay-this-thing-needs-a-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="okay this thing needs a name permalink"></a>Okay. This Thing Needs A Name.</h3></div>
<p>Fast-forward a bit to when I joined my current team and company early 2019. We formed a new innovation department and dreamed of a future where we helped turn our 175-year-old financial company into a fintech. Teaming up with the department that was our business counterpart, in the first year we built and delivered a total of fourteen projects with a relatively common two pizza team. In the previous nineteen years of my career I had never witnessed anything like this. We built smaller projects like landing pages, but also large ones like a new platform to sell houses using data and AI. We also built a fairly complex API to serve as the backend for an IoT driven car insurance. We even managed to surprise ourselves and win a hackathon in our first year with a mobile app for planting trees.</p>
<div><p><h3>Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</h3></p></div>
<p>Many things fell into place to make this a success. For one, it were the amazing people we joined. I consider myself lucky to this day that we met them and were able to make all of these things happen. It was almost as if we started in a performing phase as a team, skipping the forming, norming and storming phases altogether.</p>
<p>Besides the people the technology played an important role here. Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</p>
<p>What was really cool was that we were able to deliver all these different types of applications using basically the same architecture. For the IoT insurance, the API we delivered we implemented a lightweight event sourced system using mainly DynamoDB and Lambda. We later added a future event system where we combined DynamoTTL and Step Functions to combine high and low resolution timers, all of which were inspired by a set of blog posts and a tweet we found on the web.</p>
<p>For the housing platform we combined Cognito, Azure AD, DynamoDB, Lambda, AppSync, S3 and CloudFront to deliver a platform that was highly performant. Gatsby helped us leverage React’s power to build statically rendered, SEO-friendly pages, hosted on S3 and made available to the wide internet using CloudFront and Route53. On the backend we created a GraphQL API to, on the one hand, power the build-time data requirements. On the other hand it also powered the real-time admin panel we needed for providing customers support.</p>
<p>There were many more projects that used very similar architectures. Five years after first having used these technologies we were still able to use them to build modern applications. In our hiring process I remember seeing the smiles on the faces of the engineers when we would mention our tech stack.</p>
<div><p><h3>Which parts are going to be successful for at least the next five years?</h3></p></div>
<p>There was this one thing I noticed though. Whenever I wanted to explain our technology stack, I was summing up this combination of technologies one by one. Time after time saying things like “Our stack is JavaScript based, uses the React ecosystem and runs on AWS Serverless... And oh yeah we use GraphQL as a BFF for our apps.” A couple of days later I would say something like “We build apps using React and use JavaScript/TypeScript. Our APIs are running on AWS Lambda using NodeJS.”. And then many more variations of these sentences.</p>
<p>Okay. This thing needs a name.</p>
<p>Back in the days we had the LAMP stack, and some time after that there was the MEAN stack. Acronyms that became part of our vocabulary to help explain the stack we were using, or even inspired greenfield projects to combine these technologies. People would think, hey, I recently have been hearing a lot of buzz around the MEAN …</p></div></div></div>

      <p>Oct 27, 2020</p>

      <p>
	In my <a href="https://zinascii.com/2020/the-amd64-fbt-handler.html">previous
	post</a> I described how FBT intercepts function calls and
	vectors them into the DTrace framework. That laid the
	foundation for what I want to dicuss in this post: the
	implementation of the <code>stack()</code> action and
	built-in <code>arg</code> variables. These features rely on
	the precise layout of the stack, the details of which I
	touched on previously. In this post I hope to illuminate those
	details a bit more with the help of some visuals, and then
	guide you through the implentation of these two DTrace
	features as they relate to the FBT provider.
      </p>

      <h2>A Correction</h2>

      <p>
	But first I must make a correction to my last post. It turns
	out the FBT handler <b>does not</b> execute on the IST stack.
	It runs on either the thread’s stack or the CPU’s high-level
	interrupt stack depending on the context of the kernel
	function call, but never on the IST.
	Rather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation">KPTI</a>
	uses the IST stack as a scratch space to perform its
	trampoline into the real handler. This little detail is
	important. Functions like <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code>
	have zero chance of working if run with the IST stack, for
	reasons which become obvious later. This also explains why the
	AMD64 handler pulls down the stack
	during <code>pushq&nbsp;%RBP</code> emulation: if it’s working
	on the same stack as the thread/interrupt, then it must make
	room for <code>RBP</code>. I can explain better with a visual.
	First, the diagram from the last post.
      </p>

      <figure>
	  
	  <figcaption><a name="fig1-int3-pre-handler">Figure 1. INT3 thread/interrupt state pre-handler</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	On the left we have a kernel thread, interrupt thread, or
	high-level interrupt running on CPU. On the right we have the
	“interrupt context” of the breakpoint exception, using the
	IST. The image is correct in that there are two different
	stacks in play, but what’s running on the right-hand side is
	not the <code>brktrap</code> handler. The right-hand side is
	running the KPTI trampoline, ensuring a CR3 switch when moving
	between the user/kernel boundary. The trampoline also provides
	a facsimile of the processor frame to the interrupted thread’s
	stack, making it none the wiser that KPTI was ever on the
	scene. So all the action happens on the left side, but what
	does the stack look like as we transition through the #BP
	handler on our way to <code>dtrace_invop()</code>?
      </p>

      <figure>
	  
	  <figcaption><a name="fig2-pre-fbt-stack">Figure 2. stack state from #BP to pre dtrace_invop()</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	In phase ① <code>mac_provider_tx()</code> is
	calling <code>mac_ring_tx()</code> while it is under FBT entry
	instrumentation. The last thing on the thread’s stack is the
	return address, and the CPU is about to execute
	the <code>int3</code> instruction.
      </p>

      <p>
	Phase ② is immediately after the CPU has finished execution of
	the <code>int3</code> instruction. The processor (via the
	spectre of the KPTI trampoline) has pushed a 16-byte aligned
	processor frame on the stack and has vectored into
	the <code>brktrap()</code> handler.
      </p>

      <p>
	Phase ③ is after some amount of execution of
	the <code>brktrp()</code> and <code>invoptrap()</code>
	handlers—remember, the #BP handler for DTrace mimics a #UD.
	This last phase shows the state just before the call
	to <code>dtrace_invop()</code>. At this point we’ve grown an
	entire <code>regs</code> structure on the stack and stashed a
	copy of the return address on top of this. The later used to
	populate <code>cpu_dtrace_caller</code>, a variable which
	becomes important later.
      </p>

      <h2>The stack() Action</h2>

      <p>
	The separation of probes and actions is a vital aspect of
	DTrace’s architecture. A firm boundary between these two makes
	DTrace more powerful than it ever could be if they were
	tightly coupled. Think about it, I can ask for the call stack
	in any probe, not just the probes that deem that information
	useful. The probes give you access to a context, and the
	actions give you access to data in that context. To limit the
	execution of actions to specific probes would limit the
	questions you can ask about the system. With this design the
	number of questions you can ask is virtually endless. And it
	turns out one of the more useful questions to ask is: “what
	the hell is running on my CPU”?
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>stack()</code> action allows you to record the call
	stack that lead to the probe site. In the context of FBT this
	will record the call stack of the kernel thread or interrupt
	executing an entry or return from this kernel function. You
	can also access the userland stack of a thread
	via <code>ustack()</code>, but I don’t cover that here.
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>stack()</code> action is implemented by
	the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code> function. To get there
	from <code>dtrace_invop()</code> requires a couple of more
	calls in the DTrace framework. Ultimately, the call stack to
	get there looks like this.
      </p>

      <figure>
	<div>

&lt;rest of call stack that lead here&gt;</code></pre>
	</div>
	<figcaption>call stack between dtrace_getpcstack() and dtrace_invop()</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	The implementation of <code>stack()</code> really starts
	with <code>DTRACEACT_STACK</code> inside
	of <code>dtrace_probe()</code>.
      </p>

      <figure>

      <p>
	The first argument is the address of the array used to store
	program counter values (aka function pointers). This array
	starts at some offset into the current DTrace buffer. The
	second argument if the size of that array. The third argument
	is the number of “artificial frames” on the stack, more on
	this later. The fourth argument is used to determine if the
	first (topmost) program counter in the call stack is the value
	passed in <code>arg0</code> to <code>dtrace_probe()</code>. An
	“anchored” probe is one that has a function name specified
	when calling <code>dtrace_probe_create()</code>. For example,
	the FBT provider uses the name of the kernel function as the
	probe’s function name, thus it is anchored on the kernel
	function. The profile provider, however, specifies no probe
	function name; it is not anchored and is a bit of a special
	case. I address this at the end of the post.
      </p>

      <p>
	This brings us to the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code>
	function. But first I’ll expand
	on <a href="#fig2-pre-fbt-stack">figure 2</a> to show our
	stack state as of source line 60 of the function.

      <p>
	To build the call stack we first need to be able to walk the
	stack. Luckily, illumos keeps frame pointers in the kernel,
	making this easy. But in this particular situation there is
	more to consider. First, we might have two stacks in play: the
	high-level interrupt’s stack as well as the stack of the
	thread it interrupted. Second, the DTrace framework and FBT
	provider have put their own frames between this code and the
	function that tripped this probe; we must exclude these
	“artificial” frames from the result. Finally, we need to make
	sure not to walk off the stack and into space, both for
	correctness and safety. Speaking of the stack,
	the <code>stacktop</code> variable is pointing to the “top” of
	the stack in terms of memory (on x86 stacks grow downwards).
	Logically speaking, <code>stacktop</code> is the bottom of the
	stack and the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code> frame is the
	top.

October 27, 2020 | https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/riaa-blitz-takes-down-18-github-projects-used-for-downloading-youtube-videos/">GitHub took down the repository</a> for the youtube-dl project. This came in response to a request from the RIAA—the recording industry’s lobbying and harassment body. youtube-dl is a tool for downloading videos. The RIAA argued that this violates the anticircumvention protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). While GitHub taking down the repository and its forks is true to the principle of minimizing corporate risk, it’s the wrong choice.</p>



<p> Microsoft—currently the world’s second-most valuable company with a market capitalization of $1.64 trillion—owns GitHub. If anyone is in a position to fight back on this, it’s Microsoft. Microsoft’s lawyers should have a one word answer to the RIAA’s request: “no”. <em>(full disclosure: I own a small number of shares of Microsoft)</em></p>



<h2>The procedural argument</h2>



<p>The first reason to tell the RIAA where to stick it is procedural. The RIAA isn’t arguing that youtube-dl is infringing its copyrights or circumventing its protections. It is arguing that youtube-dl infringes YouTube’s protections. So even if it is, that’s YouTube’s problem, not the RIAA’s.</p>



<h2>The factual argument</h2>



<p>I have some sympathy for the anticircumvention argument. I’m not familiar with the specifics of how youtube-dl works, but it’s at least possible that youtube-dl circumvents YouTube’s copy protection. This would be a reasonable basis for YouTube to take action. Again, YouTube, not the RIAA.</p>



<p>I have less sympathy for the infringement argument. youtube-dl doesn’t induce infringement more than a web browser or screen recorder does. There are a variety of uses for youtube-dl that are not infringing. Foremost is the fact that some YouTube videos are under a license that explicitly allows sharing and remixing. Archivers use it to archive content. Some people who have time-variable Internet billing use it to download videos overnight.</p>



<p>So, yes, youtube-dl can be used to infringe the RIAA’s copyrights. It can also be used for non-infringing purposes. The code itself does not infringe. There’s nothing about it that gives the RIAA a justification to take it down.</p>



<h2>youtube-dl isn’t the whole story</h2>



<p>youtube-dl provides a focal point, but there’s more to it. Copyright law is now used to suppress instead of promote creative works. The DMCA, in particular, favors the large rightsholders over smaller developers and creators. It essentially forces sites to act on a “guilty until proven innocent” model. Companies in a position to push back have an obligation to do so. Microsoft has become a supporter of open source, now it’s time to show they mean it.</p>



<p>We should also consider the risks of consolidation. git is a decentralized system. GitHub has essentially centralized it. Sure, many competitors exist, but GitHub has become the default place to host open source code projects. The fact that GitHub’s code is proprietary is immaterial to this point. A FOSS service would pose the same risk if it became the centralized service.</p>



<p>I saw a quote on this discussion (which I can’t find now) that said “code is free, infrastructure is not.” And while projects self-hosting their code repository, issue tracker, etc may be philosophically appealing, that’s not realistic. Software-as-a-Service has lowered the barrier for starting projects, which is a good thing. But it doesn’t come without risk, which we are now seeing.</p>



<p>I don’t know what the right answer is for this. I know the answer won’t be easy. But both this specific case and the general issues they highlight are important for us to think about.</p>

                <p>Take <strong>Uncle Bob's</strong> Clean Architecture and map its correspondences with <strong>Gary Bernhardt's</strong> thin imperative shell around a functional core, and you get an understanding of how to cheaply maintain and scale software!</p>
<p>This is what <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a> did. It's not every day that I find such clear insight.</p>
<p>I am honored to have found his <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/talks/#clean-architecture-python">presentation</a> and <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/slides/2014-07-pyohio/clean-architecture/">slides</a> explaining  <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture</a> and Gary Bernhardt's PyCon talks of <a href="https://archive.org/details/pyvideo_422___units-need-testing-too">2011</a>, <a href="https://pycon-2012-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fast_tests_slow_tests.html">2012</a>, and <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries">2013</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhodes offers such a distilled view, that he can show you these crucial concepts in 3 slides of code. I will go ahead and summarize what he said and add a tiny bit of my insight.</p>
<p>Copyright of all Python code on this page belongs to <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a>, and copyright of the diagram belongs to <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</a>. I use these under (hopefully) fair use (nonprofit and educational).</p>


<p>First of all, we need to be on the same page, in order to be able to understand each other. Here are the words I'll use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function: I use "function" or "pure function" to refer to a Python "function" that only uses its parameters for input, returns a result as output, and does not cause any other side-effects (such as I/O). <ul>
<li>A pure function returns the same output given the same inputs.</li>
<li>A pure function may be called any number of times without changing the system state - it should have no influence on DB, UI, other functions or classes.</li>
<li>This is very similar to a mathematical function: takes you from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> and nothing else happens.</li>
<li>Sadly we can't have only pure functions; software has a <strong>purpose</strong> of causing side-effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedure, Routine, or Subroutine: A piece of code that executes, that may or may not have side effects. This is a "function" in Python, but might not be a "pure function".</li>
<li>Tests: automated unit tests. By "unit" I mean not necessarily just a class, but a behavior. If you want, see more details in <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we have a piece of code that prepares a URL, then gets some data over the network (I/O), then validates the result (a word definition) and returns it.</p>
<p>This is a bit much: a procedure should ideally do one thing only. While this small-ish procedure is quite readable still, it is a metaphor for a more developed system - where it could be arbitrarily long.</p>
<p>The current knee-jerk reaction is to <em>hide</em> the I/O operations somewhere far away. Here is the same code after extracting the I/O lines:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 2</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>

    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>

<span>def</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>):</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>     <span># I/O</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>           <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>data</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Listing #2, the I/O is extracted from the top-level procedure. </p>
<p>The problem is, the code is still <strong>coupled</strong> - <code>call_json_api</code> is called whenever you want to test anything - even the building of the URL or the parsing of the result.</p>
<p><strong>Coupling kills software.</strong></p>
<p>A good rule of thumb to spot coupling is this: Can you test a piece of code without having to mock or dependency inject like Frankenstein?</p>
<p>Here, we can't test <code>find_definition</code> without somehow replacing <code>call_json_api</code> from inside it, in order to avoid making HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Let's find out what a better solution looks like.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 3</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>)</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>  <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?'</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>url</span>

<span>def</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>):</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the procedure at the top (aka. the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> of the program) is handling the I/O, and everything else is moved to <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> (<code>build_url</code>, <code>pluck_definition</code>). The <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> are easily testable by just calling them on made-up data structures; no Frankenstein needed.</p>
<p>This separation into an <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and <span><strong>functional core</strong></span> is an encouraged idea by Functional Programming.</p>
<p>Ideally, though, in a real system, you wouldn't test elements as small as these routines, but integrate more of the system. See <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a> to understand the trade-offs.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture chart</a> (Copyright Robert C. Martin aka. Uncle Bob) :
<img alt="The Clean Architecture" src="https://danuker.go.ro/images/CleanArchitecture.jpg"></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Use Cases</strong></span> and <span><strong>Entities</strong></span> (red and yellow circles of the chart) map to the <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> we saw earlier - <code>build_url</code> and <code>pluck_definition</code> from Listing 3, and the <span><strong>plain objects</strong></span> they receive as parameters and send as outputs. <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Interface Adapters</strong></span> (green circle) map to the top-level <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span>  from earlier - <code>find_definition</code> from Listing 3, handling only I/O to the outside (Web, DB, UI, other frameworks).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jj7ave/the_grand_unified_theory_of_software_architecture/gabst6z/?context=3">Update 2020-10-28</a>: A "Model" object in today's MVC frameworks is a poisoned apple: it is not a <a href="https://khanlou.com/2014/12/pure-objects/">"pure" object</a> or <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Humble%20Object.html">"humble" object</a>, but one that can produce side effects like saving or loading from the database. Their "save" and "read" methods litter your code with untestable side-effects all over. Avoid them, or confine them to the periphery of your system and reduce their influence accordingly (they are actually a hidden <span><strong>Interface Adapter</strong></span>) due to interacting with the DB.</p>
<p>Notice the arrows on the left side of the circles, pointing inwards to more and more abstract parts. These are procedure or function calls. Our code is called by the outside. <strong>This has some exceptions. Whatever you do, the database won't call your app. But the web can, a user can through a UI, the OS can through STDIN, and a timer can, at regular intervals (such as in a game).</strong> <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>The top-level procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>gets the input, </li>
<li>adapts it to simple objects acceptable to the system,</li>
<li>pushes it through the functional core,</li>
<li>gets the returned value from the functional core,</li>
<li>adapts it for the output device,</li>
<li>and pushes it out to the output device.</li>
</ol>
<p>This lets us easily test the functional core. Ideally, most of a production system should be pure-functional.</p>

<p>If you reduce the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and move code into the <span><strong>functional core</strong></span>, each test can verify almost the entire (now-functional) stack, but stopping short of actually performing external actions.</p>
<p>You can then test the imperative shell using <strong>fewer integration tests</strong>: you only need to check that it is <strong>correctly connected</strong> to the functional core.</p>
<p>Having two users for the system - the real user and the unit tests - and listening to both, lets you guide your architecture so as to <strong>minimize coupling</strong> and build a more <strong>flexible system</strong>.</p>
<p>Having a flexible system lets you implement new features and change existing ones <strong>quickly and cheaply</strong>, in order to <strong>stay competitive as a business</strong>.</p>
<p>Comments are much appreciated. I am yet to apply these insights, and I may be missing something!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2020-10-28:</strong> I have tried out this methodology in some small TDD Katas, and together with TDD, it works great. But I am not employed right now, so I can't say I've <em>really</em> tried it.</p>

<p><strong>MulticoreWare is a software development company that works on video compression, ML, heterogeneous computing, and championed the open-source x265 encoder in the past. They are now driving the x266 project to create an open-source VVC (Versatile Video Coding) encoder and use their experience from their UHDKit product to make it the premier open-source VVC encoder.</strong></p>




<h2><span id="Who_is_MulticoreWare"></span><strong>Who is MulticoreWare?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p><a href="https://multicorewareinc.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="MulticoreWare (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MulticoreWare</a> is a multi-faceted company with expertise in different verticals such as high-performance Video Compression, AI &amp; Video Analytics, ADAS (Automated Driver Assistance), etc. A common thread through these verticals is their ability to design and write high-performance code for various computing platforms. MulticoreWare’s background and experience are cool, in my opinion, and how they’ve nurtured and built a strong team in a very complex niche is admirable.</p>



<p>With teams in the US, India, China, and Germany, MulticoreWare is well-placed to don the role of a thought-leader in the open-source video codec world.</p>



<p>Let’s see why and what their plans are!</p>



<h2><span id="The_Road_To_x266_%E2%80%93_An_Open_Source_VVC_Encoder"></span><strong>The Road To x266 – An Open Source VVC Encoder</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG announced three new video codecs – VVC (Versatile Video Coding), EVC (Essential Video Coding), and LCEVC (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding). Of these three, VVC or H.266 is touted as the successor to H.265 (HEVC) and promises 50% more compression efficiency over HEVC but comes at a much higher complexity. Here’s a <a href="https://ottverse.com/vvc-evc-lcevc-mpeg-video-codecs/">brief explanation of all three</a> on OTTVerse.</p>



<p>But, first, let’s take a look at HEVC and the x265 encoder.</p>



<h3><span id="x265_and_HEVC"></span><strong>x265 and HEVC</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>MulticoreWare announced the <a href="https://x265.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">x265 project</a> back in 2013, and it was a success. x265 allowed video compression teams worldwide to get their hands on an efficient, standards-compliant HEVC encoder. x265 was made available under the open-source <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GNU GPL v2 license</a> and also offered by MulticoreWare under Commercial License Agreements.</p>



<p>But, having a good encoder clearly wasn’t enough. Because, fast-forward 7 years, and unfortunately, HEVC is still embroiled in patent-wars that seem destined to give it a “death by a thousand cuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEVC’s situation is rather unfortunate considering that HEVC had interesting features such as the use of quadtree-decomposition, large block sizes, the concept of TU, PU, and CUs, the Sample Adaptive Offset filter, new picture types, and several innovations which made it possible to compress 4K videos quite efficiently (in comparison to H.264/AVC).</p>



<h3><span id="The_x266_Project"></span><strong>The x266 Project</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Riding on the back of their x265 success, MulticoreWare has decided to pioneer the x266 project along the x265 project lines they worked on earlier. x266 will be an open-source project with the MulticoreWare video compression team’s full attention and the backing of an industry-consortium.</p>



<p>As with any new codec, there are always early adopters (both programmers and companies) willing to give it a try, evaluate, file tickets, and contribute code. But, to get the ball rolling, you need a reliable encoder that is not only standards-compliant but also reasonably fast and with enough presets and knobs to make the early-adoption both valuable and exciting (in a geeky-sense!)</p>



<p>I spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivakumarasu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shivakumar Narayanan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shivakumar Narayanan</a>, Senior Director – Marketing and Product Management at MulticoreWare, about the consortium, and this is what he had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Similar to when we did this for x265 consortium, to get key consortium members on board and invest in the development of this codec. These members will be founding partners with benefits when the codec (rather encoder is ready to release for the open-source world). Consortium members being strategic, will also play an important role in the shaping of this codec as well as prioritization of functionalities as it would pertain to their and their customers’ interests.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Industry involvement bodes well for the open-source community because <strong>video encoder implementation is both an art and a science.</strong></p>



<p>It helps to have a proficient team that understands and implements concepts such as wavefront parallelism, multi-threading, intrinsics, etc. to make codec implementations practical and useful. And, of course, people with “golden eyes” to spot issues with video quality as they occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MulticoreWare has such a team, and I feel they’ll bring their experience from x265 to the x266 development.</p>



<h3><span id="Expertise_from_UHDKit"></span><strong>Expertise from UHDKit</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Another product in MulticoreWare’s portfolio is <a href="https://x265.com/uhdkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UHDKit</a>. It is an extended encoding library built on top of the x264 (AVC) encoder and x265 (HEVC) encoder libraries. It has a better performance and feature-set than the vanilla x264, x265, and svt-av1 encoders. UHDKit comes in-built with powerful features such as a “control system for video compression” that dynamically adjusts settings to achieve better video quality based on the computing platform’s spec. </p>



<p>Additional features include fast ABR encoding (to get the bitrate ladder faster!) and high-performance live encoding, all this on software, without any requirement for additional hardware accelerators. It can be used as a standalone encoding library or can be invoked via the FFmpeg framework, which makes it seamlessly integrate into any software encoding/ transcoding pipeline.</p>



<p>I am sure some of this expertise from building UHDKit will rub off on the x266 encoder development.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Do_I_Get_my_hands_on_x266"></span><strong>How Do I Get my hands on x266?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Currently, MulticoreWare is working closely with x266 Consortium members and after a few months, it will be available to them.</p>



<p>Upon enquiring about the open-source implementation, here’s what MCW had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>For the larger open source community, it will be made available when we have reached critical mass required for its first release. As we near readiness, we will update here on how you can get hold of it.</em></p></blockquote>

  <p><span>08 Apr 2020</span></p><p>When you run the Ubuntu installer, there’s an option to dual-boot Ubuntu with an
existing Windows installation. There’s also an option to encrypt your Ubuntu
installation, but <em>only if you erase everything and install ubuntu</em>. There’s no
automatic way to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 with encryption. And while
there are plenty of tutorials for dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows, many of them
are outdated – often referencing an MBR partition table – and almost none of
them seem to address encrypting your Ubuntu partition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dual-booting with encrypted storage should not be this hard in 2020.</p>

  <p>–Me, while figuring out how to do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality, once you figure it out, it’s not that hard. The tricky thing is that
this isn’t well-documented <strong>anywhere</strong>! So I’m hoping to fix that with this
tutorial blog post. Honestly, if you know enough about Ubuntu to set up a
dual-boot with Windows, it’s only a little bit harder to do it with encryption.
I prepared this tutorial on a Dell Latitude e7450, and I fine-tuned it when I
tested it on my Dell Precision 5510. So it should work with almost no
modification on most Dell systems, and with only minor modifications
(particularly around BIOS setup) on most other types of computers.</p>

<h2 id="references">References</h2>

<p>To write this guide, I compiled information from several sources. Here are some
of the most useful references I found:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon/db2c9e5f6cc73bb37812a19a40e137bc">XPS 15 9560 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon">luispabon</a>. I followed these notes pretty
closely, but modified some partition sizes and names based on other guides.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon/221bdb597cf32b46c50ffab96dbec08a">XPS 15 9570 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon">mdziekon</a>, upon which the above is based.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019">Full Disk Encryption HowTo 2019</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is a great resource, but deals with
encryption without dual-booting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ManualFullSystemEncryption">Manual Full System Encryption</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is longer, and isn’t focused on
dual-booting, but provides great details on the way certain things work.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that this method doesn’t encrypt <code>/boot</code>. While there are
valid reasons for encrypting /boot, the graphical installer does not encrypt it
when you do a graphical install with LUKS. As such, I’m matching that precedent,
and keeping the simplicity of an unencrypted /boot partition. Thus, the guide
I’ve compiled below is just about the <strong>simplest way to have a LUKS encryption
with dual-boot.</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-encryption-is-important">Why encryption is important</h2>

<p>I began using encrypted storage on all my personal computers 5 or 6 years ago
after noticing that all the companies I’d worked for required it, and had good
reason to. Laptops get lost and stolen all the time. They’re high-value items
that are small and easy to carry. And when a thief gets your laptop, there’s
tons of valuable information on it that they can use or sell. Even if you use a
password to log in, it’s easy for an attacker to gain access to your data if
your disk isn’t encrypted – for example, by using a live USB stick. And once
they have that data, they might get access to online accounts, bank statements,
emails, and tons of other data. For me, an encrypted hard disk isn’t optional
anymore – its a necessity.</p>

<h2 id="an-overview">An Overview</h2>

<p>So what are we going to do? This tutorial will help you set up a system to
<strong>dual-boot Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10</strong>. (I haven’t tested it, but it should
work with most other modern versions (~16.04+) of Ubuntu or Windows.) The system
will use a GPT hard disk with UEFI (your BIOS must support UEFI). The Ubuntu
partition will be encrypted with LUKS.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The Windows partition can optionally
be encrypted with BitLocker. I’m going to keep the Ubuntu installation as close
to a “default” installation as possible – no fancy tricks like a separate
<code>/home</code> partition, but it should be somewhat easy to add that yourself if you
really want to.</p>

<p>I’m going to start with a blank hard disk, installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu
from scratch. If you already have Windows installed and you want to keep it, you
should be able to shrink your windows partition and join us in phase 3 (though
you might want to skim phases 1 and 2 to understand what we did).</p>

<p>To give you a broad overview of where we’re headed, here’s what we’re going to
do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prepare the installation media and computer</li>
  <li>Install Windows 10</li>
  <li>Create an encrypted partition for Ubuntu</li>
  <li>Install Ubuntu</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, as with any new OS installation, you should back up any important
data before proceeding. <strong>The instructions below will erase all the data on your
hard disk.</strong> Proceed at your own risk; I’m not responsible for any damage or
data loss.</p>



<p>Since we’re installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu from scratch, we’ll need a USB
stick for each. If you don’t already have a computer running Ubuntu or Windows,
making the installation media will be a little harder – but there are tutorials
for that and I’ll let you figure it out on your own.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Windows Installer USB stick.  The easiest way is to use the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/">Windows
10 Media Creation Tool</a> from a
computer that’s already running Windows.</li>
  <li>Create an Ubuntu 20.04 USB stick. The easiest way is to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">download the
ISO</a> and use the Startup Disk Creator on a
computer that’s already running Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Great! We’ve got our USB sticks ready to go! One final thing before we get
started – we need to make sure our BIOS is set up correctly. In particular, we
want to make sure we’re using UEFI to boot our OS.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/dell-bios.jpg" alt="The Dell BIOS"></p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Ensure your computer is running the latest BIOS available. This is important
because an out-of-date BIOS can have bugs, and those bugs sometimes affect
things like UEFI, non-Windows operating systems, or other components we’ll be
touching.</li>
  <li>Edit your BIOS settings. The following names are probably specific to Dell
BIOS, but other manufacturers will have similar settings.
    <ol>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Boot Sequence</code>, make sure your <code>Boot
List Option</code> is set to <code>UEFI</code>.</li>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Advanced Boot Options</code>, I disabled
<code>Legacy Option ROMs</code>. It’s important that both OSes install in UEFI mode.
(You can probably enable this when installation is complete if you care).</li>
      <li>Under <code>Security</code>, <code>TPM Security</code> must be enabled if you
want to easily set up BitLocker in Windows.</li>
      <li>I disabled <code>Secure Boot</code>. I’m not sure if this is absolutely required, and
you can try leaving it on or re-enabling it when you’re done if you want.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that our BIOS is configured for UEFI, we’re going to set up our hard disk.</p>

<div>
<p><b>For this tutorial, your BIOS must support UEFI!</b></p>
<p>Most modern computers support this, but if yours doesn't this tutorial won't
work for you. You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing only Linux with encryption using the graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Installing only Windows with encryption.</li>
  <li>OR Dual-booting Linux and Windows without encryption using Ubuntu's graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Finding another tutorial or figuring out how to do this with an MBR disk.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ol start="5">
  <li><strong>Completely erase</strong> your hard disk and set it up for UEFI by doing the
following.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
    <ol>
      <li>Boot your Ubuntu USB stick and use <code>Try without installing</code>.</li>
      <li>Open a terminal. Make it fullscreen while you’re at it.</li>
      <li>Figure out what your primary hard disk is called. It will probably be
either <code>/dev/sda</code> or <code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>. Importantly, it’s <strong>not</strong> <code>/dev/sda1</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1p1</code> – those are partitions of the disk. One way to figure out what
yours is called is to run <code>lsblk</code> and look at the disk size. Throughout the rest
of this guide, I’m going to refer to <code>/dev/sda</code>. <strong>If yours is not
<code>/dev/sda</code>, replace <code>/dev/sda</code> with your own (perhaps <code>/dev/sdb</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>) for the rest of this guide.</strong></li>
      <li>
        <p>Run the following commands. This will initialize the drive as a GPT drive
and create a 550M EFI system partition formatted as FAT32.</p>

        <div><div><pre><code>$ sudo su
# sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sda
# sgdisk --new=1:0:+550M /dev/sda
# sgdisk --change-name=1:EFI /dev/sda
# sgdisk --typecode=1:ef00 /dev/sda
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>OK, phase 1’s complete. We have our installation media ready to go and the
computer’s BIOS and hard drive is set up correctly. Next, we’ll install Windows.</p>

<h2 id="phase-2-install-windows">Phase 2: Install Windows</h2>

<p>In this phase, we’re going to install Windows. Note that when we do this, we’re
going to leave some unallocated space to install Linux later. This is a good
approach because the Windows installer will mess with our partitions a little
bit, and its easier to let it do so before finalizing our Linux partitions.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/windows-installer.jpg" alt="The Windows installer"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Boot from your Windows Installer USB stick.</li>
  <li>Choose a <code>Custom (advanced)</code> install to get to the Windows partitioning tool.</li>
  <li>Create a new partition. The size of this partition should be the amount of
disk space you want to use for Windows. In this example, I did 80G since the SSD
on my computer is relatively small. If unsure, do about half of your hard
disk.</li>
  <li>Windows will warn you that it is going to create an extra system partition.
This is good.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>Install Windows onto the partition you just made. There’s no need to format
any partitions – the Windows installer will take care of that for you.</li>
  <li>When the Windows installation is finished, log in and enable BitLocker on
drive <code>C:</code>. This will automatically create yet another partition on your disk
(a Windows recovery partition) - which is why we’re doing it before
partitioning for Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, you can start using Windows. But I’d avoid doing too much setup
or personalization yet so you don’t have to do it again if something goes wrong
below. If you want to double check your partitions, this is what you’ll be left
with after installing Windows and enabling BitLocker:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo sgdisk --print /dev/sda
Disk /dev/sda: 500118192 sectors, 238.5 GiB

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048         1128447   550.0 MiB   EF00  EFI
   2         1128448         1161215   16.0 MiB    0C01  Microsoft reserved ...
   3         1161216       167825076   79.5 GiB    0700  Basic data partition
   4       167825408       168900607   525.0 MiB   2700
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="phase-3-partition-the-drive-for-ubuntu">Phase 3: Partition the drive for Ubuntu</h2>

<p>This is the trickiest phase since this is where we need to manually set up our
encrypted disks for Ubuntu. We’re going to make it work very similar to …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>To talk about what no-code is good for, we need to first take a digression on what makes no-code fundamentally different from “yes-code” software.</p>
<h2 id="the-grain-of-abstractions">The grain of abstractions</h2>
<p>Software – yes-code software – has been around for a while. One of the things we’ve learned as an industry is how to write software <em>that gracefully evolves</em>. We’re not perfect – sad, legacy systems still proliferate – but we as a technical industry have learned how to build and evolve software systems against changing requirements and constraints that span years and decades.</p>
<p>When we first solve a problem with software, we write some code against the constraints of that particular day. We don’t necessarily know how the problem is going to change. Maybe there will be different customers or stakeholders tomorrow, or maybe the product will expand to serve a related, but different, problem space. We need to be able to change software to accommodate changing circumstances without rewriting it, and that is fundamentally what <em>software engineering</em> is: how to change software systems. <em>Change</em> is the name of the game.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten decent at change. We’ve built tools like Git and patterns like continuous integration and code autoformatting to make it easier to change code and remain stable. We’ve learned how to operate large software teams, especially in open source. We’ve also learned to use better abstractions. Abstractions are conceptual wrappers that isolate different parts of a codebase – say, a data source from a user interface – so that one part may change while another doesn’t. In general we have started to figure out how to make the DNA of software systems resilient against the changing tides of time.</p>
<p>No-code seems to reject a lot of those learnings, for better or worse. I haven’t seen any no-code company or product that allows source control (and I’ve seen many no-code companies, but you’re welcome to prove me wrong.) I have yet to find no-code products that allow for natural construction of abstraction between layers of a no-code workflow. No-code software is also scarily ill-prepared for large scale development: we have software systems being worked on by tens of thousands of engineers – what does it look like for a team of 1000 engineers to be working on a set of thousands of no-code workflows? Chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional software has learned the abstractions and patterns that make software resilient and adaptable to change and scale. No-code software is not ready for changing constraints nor development scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite these limitations, I think no-code has a few niches where making tradeoffs in adaptability and scale allows no-code tools to be much, much better. So, given this, <em>when is no-code useful?</em></p>
<h2 id="1-transitionary-ephemeral-software">1. Transitionary, ephemeral software</h2>
<p>The obvious answer, and one I had before our conversation, was <em>transitionary</em> software, software with <em>a defined lifetime</em>. If your software system has a finite, pre-defined lifetime and team, it doesn’t need to worry about changing constraints or team growth. It just needs to worry about solving a problem well, now.</p>
<p>Lots of software has predictably finite lifetime: a product prototype for an early-stage company, a game or app used as a part of an interactive online ad, a quick sketch or solution to patch a particularly urgent problem in a product, an app built for an event or a conference or a recruiting cycle or a quarterly goal tracker… all of these are projects with a pre-defined, maximum lifetime. They don’t need to last or grow or change – they just need to work now, and by giving up some of the adaptability of software abstractions of code, no-code software benefits from way faster prototyping speed. This is a plus.</p>
<p>I think we see lots of finite-time software in transitions. Transitions from having no product to having a product, in a prototype. Transitions in the process of brainstorming a solution and trying multiple designs. Software with a finite shelf life is a good fit for no-code tools.</p>
<h2 id="2-high-churn-code">2. High-churn code</h2>
<p>There’s another category of software for which long-term maintainability matters little – code with high churn.</p>
<p>By high churn, I mean that requirements are changing almost daily, and very little of the code written today will exist in a month or a quarter’s time. If the code you write today doesn’t have to last and evolve, because something new is going to take its place tomorrow, what matters is the speed to build, not resilience to change.</p>
<p>There’s lots of high-churn code in businesses. Marketing websites and landing pages, data pipelines for analytics, e-commerce storefronts, marketing campaigns, payment portals – requirements for these kinds of solutions change quickly enough that code is constantly being rewritten, and if code needs to <em>be replaced</em> more than it needs to <em>last</em>, no-code tools are a great fit.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-same-mistakes">Avoiding the same mistakes</h2>
<p>I think “no-code” is a misnomer. It leads us to think that no-code software is the start of a trend in which general software will involve less coding, and software engineering will become easier. This is not the case. Software engineering is not about building solutions, it’s about evolving them. But change resiliency over time is not the focus of no-code tools, and I think that’s ok.</p>
<p>I think no-code tools are instead an extension of a different trend: <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/text/">reifying workflows</a>. Business processes and workflows used to be documented in Word docs strewn about the office or on a shared folder, or even just passed down by oral tradition in companies. Now, we have tools that allow us to build these workflows, talk about them, edit them, and share them more concretely. This is a huge boon for more repeatable business processes and for getting things done quickly! I think this is the true win of no-code tools: concretizing workflows.</p>
<p>If no-code wants to be a serious competitor against “traditional” software – though I don’t think it should try – no-code needs to learn from the mistakes of early software. No-code tools need to understand that products and software systems need to live on for decades against changing teams and requirements, and against products and companies and standards that die out and get replaced. This requires a cultural shift, a tooling shift, and a new class of abstractions in our toolbelt as no-code engineers. Anytime we try to introduce more tooling and abstraction to no-code, I think no-code gets just a little more “code” in it. And perhaps that’ll bring us right back to where we started, discovering that code is good.</p>
<p>After all, the world is complex. And when we build software against the complexity of the world, that <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/complexity-conservation/">complexity needs to go somewhere</a>. Software is complex, but only as much as the world it attempts to make sense of.</p>
<p>It feels like we’re getting off the edge of a discovery phase of no-code, and into a time when we’re starting to understand what problems no-code tools are great for. I think it’s important that no-code tool builders focus on those strengths, or risk falling into the trap of repeating the software industry’s mistakes from the ground up.</p>

<h2>OfferMarket launched today on Product Hunt, and we failed miserably.</h2>

<div><p>
We tried launching on Product Hunt today, if that's what you'll call it. We half-assed it. We put together our launch post and asked a few friends to upvote.&nbsp;<span>6 hours in and we have 3 referrals to our site from Product Hunt.</span></p><p>

One person we asked for an upvote replied "I just like sold my soul to give you an upvote", here's what they were referring to in the sign up with Twitter authentication flow:
</p></div>

<div>
<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.offermarket.us/uploads/1/3/1/0/131040874/published/twitter-authorize-an-application-copy.jpg?1603845762" alt="Picture"></a></p>
</div>
</div>



<p>
Then we tried to have some people find us on Product Hunt, but they couldn't because their search doesn't work...<br>
</p>

<div>
<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.offermarket.us/uploads/1/3/1/0/131040874/published/producthunt-offermarket-search-no-results.png?1603845954" alt="Picture"></a></p>
</div>
</div>



<div><p>
So that's when we realized we probably were not going to be raising much awareness on Product Hunt this time around. It also made it clear that Product Hunt either has some bugs or performance issues, or the only people whose product launches percolate to the top of the daily rankings do one or both of the following:</p><ul>
<li>know a lot of people already on Product Hunt and build a following on Product Hunt before launch</li>

<li>coerce a lot of friends, family and others for upvotes</li>
</ul><p>
Which doesn't lend much credibility to the platform as a utility for finding valuable tools.</p><p>

Moving on then. We'll try again next time. We hope you enjoyed our post-mortem and how not to launch on Product Hunt.

<h2>Part 1: Introduction</h2>



<h3>Summary</h3>



<p>Game BASIC for Sega Saturn is a homebrew development kit that allows you to program games for the Sega Saturn using the BASIC programming language.&nbsp; If you’re familiar with the PlayStation’s Net Yaroze platform, think of this as the Saturn’s answer to it – just cheaper and easier to get started with.</p>



<p>Game BASIC’s use of the BASIC language makes for a very low barrier to entry in terms of programming skill.&nbsp; Though the Saturn is notoriously difficult to program for, Game BASIC makes it easy to get started and is surprisingly powerful, allowing very easy sprite manipulation and straightforward 3D polygon implementation.&nbsp; It even includes an adapter cable that allows you to communicate with the Saturn from your PC to transfer or save programs and streamline development.  For example, here’s a Pilotwings-esque demo, but in Game BASIC:</p>

</p><figcaption>“Jump” demo, provided with Game BASIC (video courtesy <a href="https://www.satakore.com/sega-saturn-game-basic,,GBSSCD_G_JUMP_A,,GBSS-CD-Jump-Multi-Controller-Version-Bits-Laboratory.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satakore.com</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The caveat?&nbsp; Game BASIC was released only in Japan, so this means a complete setup can be difficult to obtain and all documentation is in Japanese!&nbsp; Moreover, the supporting software that allows you to use your PC for streamlined development was intended for the Windows 95 era and flat out does not install on modern systems. Oh, and the adapter cable that allows you to connect your Saturn to your PC is a 25-pin serial connection!</p>



<p>Who in the world still has both Game BASIC and a Windows 95 PC with a physical serial port? Nobody!&nbsp; (Well, unless you’re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_QU8eaMymo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Vintage Gamer</a>) But if you’re a brave experimenter who’s not afraid to tinker a bit, there are still multiple options to get everything working, even today!&nbsp; You can even do a lot just via emulation.&nbsp; So, let’s head to the Lab and get started…</p>



<h3>What You’ll Need</h3>



<p>There are several options for working with Game BASIC, ranging from quite simple but clunky to work with, to quite powerful and streamlined.&nbsp; Here are the three options:</p>



<h4>The Simple Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A copy of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games (A Japanese or modded console, a Pro Action Replay/<a href="https://ppcenter.webou.net/pskai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pseudo Saturn Kai</a> cartridge, or a Saturn emulator)</li><li>Any Saturn controller</li><li>Plenty of room in the Saturn’s internal memory (if you want to save your programs)</li></ul>



<p>For this option, you’ll run Game BASIC on the Saturn with no PC connection, using only standard Saturn accessories.&nbsp; This is a reasonable choice if you just want to write “Hello, World!”-style programs or play around with the neat games and demos that come with the kit.&nbsp; Theoretically, you can write even the most complex programs this way, but you’ll run into limitations on the size of games you can save to the Saturn’s internal memory.&nbsp; Plus, programming with a virtual keyboard is an absolute pain.&nbsp; Start here if you don’t have the necessary hardware for the other options, or if you just want to poke around a bit and see what this is all about.</p>



<h4>The Enhanced Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>All of the tools from Option 1, PLUS</li><li>Some kind of external expanded memory, such as:<ul><li>A direct-save memory cartridge (e.g., the official Saturn Backup Memory)</li></ul><ul><li>A Sega Saturn Floppy Disk Drive and some 3.5″ floppy disks</li></ul></li><li>A Sega Saturn keyboard OR the NetLink keyboard adapter with a PS/2 keyboard</li><li>Fun peripherals, like the Stunner light gun, 3D Control Pad, multi-tap, and Shuttle Mouse</li></ul>



<p>One of the great things about Game BASIC is how easy it makes it to access the Saturn’s peripherals, including the internal backup RAM, external memory cartridges, and even the Saturn Floppy Disk Drive.&nbsp; With a setup like this, you’ll have plenty of space to save your programs and you can use a real keyboard for text entry.&nbsp; You can even start experimenting with different forms of input, like analog controls and light guns!&nbsp; But without access to the tools a PC provides, it will be difficult to make nice-looking sprites, textures, and 3D models.&nbsp; So, this will still limit what you’re capable of.&nbsp; Regardless, this is a great option for the sheer fun factor of “Hey look! I’m programming with my Saturn!” or if you have no ability to connect your Saturn to a PC.</p>



<p>You can even go this route with a Saturn emulator, giving you easy access to improved keyboard, mouse, and storage options.&nbsp; I’ve confirmed that Mednafen successfully emulates Game BASIC and allows for keyboard and mouse pass-through input, meaning you can do a whole lot of Saturn development with very little barrier to entry.</p>



<h4>The Full Saturn plus PC Setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A complete Game BASIC for Sega Saturn kit, including:<ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Windows 95 Tools disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>The special Saturn-to-PC serial cable adapter</li></ul></li><li>A modern PC with a USB port, capable of running a Virtual Machine (I use VirtualBox)</li><li>A copy of Windows XP SP3 32-bit to install on a VM</li><li>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/USB-Serial-Adapter-Prolific-PL-2303/dp/B003WOWBBW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USB-to-Serial adapter</a> (Must support RS232 with a DB25 connector)</li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games on original hardware (Japanese or modded console, or a Pro Action Replay/Pseudo Saturn Kai cartridge)</li><li>A Saturn controller</li><li>Optionally, any fun Saturn accessories you may want to experiment with (I especially recommend a keyboard or keyboard adapter)</li></ul>



<p>This is the Cadillac option!&nbsp; This is the setup I use, is how Game BASIC was really intended to be used (well, except nobody expected it to be run on a VM, I suppose), and is what the rest of this guide will focus on.&nbsp; With this setup, writing a game is as simple as writing BASIC in a text editor and hitting a couple of buttons to send it to your Saturn, where it immediately shows up on your TV and responds to controller and keyboard input!&nbsp; Seriously, it’s super cool once you get it working…</p>



<p>The Simple and Enhanced Saturn-only setups are extremely straightforward.&nbsp; You just boot Game BASIC like any other Saturn game and get started, so there’s not much configuration to discuss.&nbsp; Regardless of the setup you choose, continue on to Part 2 for a few test programs.&nbsp; But if you want the Full setup, it’s quite a project to get going, so read on to Part 3 for the complete How-To!</p>

At the time I'm writing this, there are 175 different services on AWS! This surface area is bigger than most things you might try to learn as a developer. So where do you get started? How do you start chipping away at this complex elephant, but do it in a way that's practical?</p><p>I'm a few months in to my AWS journey and I wanted to share what concepts and resources I've found helpful so far. I resisted getting into AWS for a while because of its complexity. Any time I would log into AWS, my eyes would glaze over and my head would spin.</p><p>I realized, though, that ignoring AWS for much longer will be to my detriment. <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/">AWS is dominating</a> the hundred billion dollar cloud infrastructure and computing market:</p><p><span>

<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/">Source</a></p><p>Because of this, AWS certifications are in very high demand. I decided a few months ago that it's time for me to step up and at least get the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">Cloud Practitioner certification</a>, and probably others like the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/">Solutions Architect Associate</a>.</p><h2>Big AWS Concepts for Developers</h2><p>Let's lay down a couple of definitions to help you as you progress in your AWS education.</p><p>First, what are <strong>cloud computing</strong> and <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong>? In short, this means that instead of you having to physically set up servers and networks in your garage or at your company, you "rent" these from Amazon. Everything you might want to do to run a website <!-- -->—<!-- --> the hardware that runs the server, the database, the storage that holds the frontend and static files, and the domain name configuration <!-- -->—<!-- --> can be done using AWS's networking and computing resources.</p><p>Why does this matter? The main reason is <strong>scalability</strong>: the ability to grow based on demand. AWS alleviates both the cost and logistics of scaling a service or business. Imagine you're running an online store for dog toys on a single server in your garage (you probably bought it on eBay). Suddenly, <a href="https://twitter.com/dog_feelings">Thoughts of Dog</a> tweets about your store and your traffic spikes by twenty times as millions of people try to buy your bespoke artisan chew toys. What's going to happen? Most likely your server will crash due to that much demand. You're frantically searching eBay for another server and some networking equipment, but it will likely cost you a couple thousand bucks and several days to upgrade your server or add additional servers to your network. Ouch! (Incidentally, a show that demonstrates this dilemma perfectly is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a>, which is about startups in the 80s.)</p><p>Services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform came along and revolutionized the industry. Now instead of needing to buy a brand new server, you can click a button and immediately grow your infrastructure. Even better, you can automatically grow and shrink your infrastructure as demand for your site or service fluctuates. This helps keeps costs more predictable and spreads them out over time instead of all at once with big hardware purchases.</p><h2>Key AWS Services for Developers</h2><p>When approaching AWS as a developer, there are a few of the core services that you'll likely encounter right away, so here's a quick overview of those:</p><ul><li><strong>Lambda</strong>: Serverless functions are kind of a gateway for developers into AWS and cloud infrastructure. In AWS, Lambda is the service that runs these functions. Serverless functions let you perform calculations or access databases without having a physical server.</li><li><strong>S3</strong>: S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. This is where you host static files such as HTML, images, or videos.</li><li><strong>Route 53</strong>: Route 53 is where you set up DNS for domain names. "Route" is a reference to US Route 66 and "53" is a reference to TCP or UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed.</li><li><strong>EC2</strong>: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is where you run servers. If you're looking to run an API or a traditional web app using something like Node or Nest, this is what you want. EC2 costs can add up quick, so be careful experimenting with these.</li><li><strong>RDS</strong>: RDS stands for Relational Database Service so this is where you'll set up databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.</li><li><strong>DynamoDB</strong>: DynamoDB is Amazon's No SQL solution similar to MongoDB.</li><li><strong>Amplify</strong>: Amplify is a platform for building full stack apps quickly. The Amplify Framework consists of 3 components including libraries, UI components, and a CLI toolchain, while the Amplify Console is a static web hosting service.</li></ul><p>These are the core services I would focus on as a developer getting started with AWS. There are many, many more services relevant to developers, but getting a handle on the basics of these will get you quite a long way.</p><h2>AWS Pitfalls for Developers</h2><p>The two main pitfalls you might run into as you learn AWS (other than its sheer complexity) are <strong>billing</strong> and <strong>identity and access management (IAM)</strong>.</p><p>AWS is not free to use, though there is a free tier and some services are free. Usually these costs are minor for short periods of time, but beware: if you run through a tutorial and then forget to clean up after yourself, you might face a big bill at the end of the month! Be sure to know what costs you're incurring as you do tutorials and try to shut down and delete anything you don't need when you're finished. AWS also lets you create billing alerts that will email you when you've hit a threshold. Here's a great <a href="https://egghead.io/playlists/use-aws-billing-cost-management-dashboard-to-keep-your-aws-bill-to-minimum-ff0f">egghead collection on AWS cost management</a> that will help a lot.</p><p>The other really sticky area in AWS is security. Identity and Access Management (IAM) in AWS is extremely complex. There are many layers of permissions for each service, user, and group. Most tutorials will help you navigate the basic set up that you will need to get things done. Be careful that you're not leaving yourself open to big vulnerabilities as you learn. Not only does that open the door to data theft, but it could also result in huge bills if someone gets a hold of your root account. This doc is kind of scary, but you're going to want to get familiar with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html">security best practices in AWS</a> little by little. At the very least, secure your root account and enable MFA.</p><p>For the sake of both billing and IAM, you will likely want to avoid using your employer's AWS account to learn. If your job is the motivation for learning AWS, work with your company on creating a sandboxed account with a given budget.</p><h2>Overview of AWS Certifications</h2><p>While not all certifications in tech are created equal, AWS certifications are extremely valuable. They're designed to minimize false positives and fairly rigorous, so employers know they can use them as a solid benchmark of knowledge. This means they can add some zeroes to your paycheck and set you apart from the average developer.</p><p>There are many different AWS certifications, so let's break down what the options are.</p><p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">Cloud Practicioner exam</a> is considered a <strong>Foundational</strong> exam recommended for people with 6 months of fundamental AWS knowledge. It's high-level and not super technical, but gets your feet with AWS.</p><p>From there, there are three <strong>Associate</strong> level exams, recommended for people with 1 year of experience solving problems and implementing solutions using AWS. These exams have broad scope but shallow depth and break into three paths: Architect, Operations, and Developer. The three exams are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/">Solutions Architect Associate</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/">SysOps Administrator Associate</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/">Developer Associate</a></li></ul><p>From there, there are two <strong>Professional</strong> certifications, recommended for people with 2 years of comprehensive experience designing, operating, and troubleshooting solutions using AWS. These exams have broader scope and are quite deep. The Architect path remains, but Developer and Operations combine into DevOps. The two exams are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/">Solutions Architect Professional</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/">DevOps Engineer Professional</a></li></ul><p>There are also six <strong>Specialty</strong> exams, which are very narrow in scope but very deep:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty/">Advanced Networking Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/">Security Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/">Machine Learning Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-alexa-skill-builder-specialty/">Alex Skill Builder Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty/">Data Analytics Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-database-specialty/">Database Specialty</a></li></ul><p>I decided to get some of these certifications as a way to guarantee that I will actually set aside the time to learn some AWS and have something to show for it. My plan is to get the Cloud Practicioner and then the Solutions Architect Associate. Why not the Developer Associate first? Well, my understanding is that the Solutions Architect Associate is more comphrensive than the Developer Associate, and thus it's easier to get the Developer Associate after getting the Solutions Architect Associate. It also sets you up to get the Solutions Architect Professional, which is extremely difficult and highly coveted (and thus should come with a big pay raise!). The SA-P requires the SA-A, so it makes sense to go that route. I'll update this article when I've got some results.</p><h2>AWS Resources for Developers</h2><p>There are boatloads of resources for learning AWS out there. Some are geared towards infrastructure and networking folks, some are geared towards database admins, some for security teams, and others towards developers. Here are the key resources I've been using and a variety of others I've found useful.</p><h3>My Essential AWS Resources</h3><p>I've found myself relying pretty heavily on these resources in my own AWS journey:</p><ul><li><a href="https://acloud.guru/">A Cloud Guru</a>: A Cloud Guru is hands down the single best resources out there for learning AWS and just about any other cloud technology. I am honestly blown away. Just the <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certification-preparation?_ga=2.170270560.1574418745.1603210089-860129520.1602887034">AWS Certification Preparation Guide</a> is worth the cost of admission. I'm working my way through the Developer Learning Path and about halfway through the <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner?_ga=2.124181706.1574418745.1603210089-860129520.1602887034">Cloud Practitioner 2020 course</a>. I've also used A Cloud Guru a <em>ton</em> for work whenever I've needed to look up terms or concepts I don't understand.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2020-10-26</small>
        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

                  <p><img src="https://chaordic-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/productivity-1995786_960_720.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To productively build serverless &amp; distributed systems, we need to adopt new practices, some which may seem counterintuitive at first. This post will suggest five concrete practices to up your game.</p>
<p>Let’s jump in, roughly in order of importance:</p>
<h4 id="1-prefer-running-your-system-in-the-cloud-over-local-emulation">1. Prefer running your system in the cloud over local emulation</h4>
<p>Local development is sacred cow for many developers, being able to deploy, run and test an application or system on your laptop. But the reality of modern distributed systems is that some things cannot easily be emulated locally, if at all.</p>
<p>It is not for a lack of trying: systems running on Kubernetes are often emulated with Docker Compose or Minikube, with varying levels of success. For AWS Serverless, we have AWS SAM and LocalStack.</p>
<p>There are however a few issues with this type of emulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of maintaining emulation is high, since you effectively maintain two stacks - one for local development, and one for “real” deployment.</li>
<li>Emulation isn’t the real thing: you will find configuration drift, small or large differences in the behaviour of your stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, our experience of trying to maintain emulation is that the costs far outweigh the benefits. That effort should instead be put towards the ability to deploy local code quickly to the cloud environment, or where possible, connect a locally running process to a real environment in the cloud.</p>
<p>One of the great benefits of Serverless in particular, is that the cost of creating and provisioning <em>Feature Environments</em> is approaching zero. Moving local development to the cloud is a low-cost proposition.</p>
<h4 id="2-cicd-pipelines-are-not-enough-local-deployment-automation-is-crucial">2. CI/CD Pipelines are not enough, local deployment automation is crucial</h4>
<p>Given our stance on local emulation, the next instinct to suppress is that of relying on CI/CD to manage deployments to feature environments. If we rely entirely on CI pipelines for our ongoing development work, we end up wasting large amounts of time waiting for CI pipelines to build and deploy.</p>
<p>If instead, CI &amp; local development workflows can share as much as possible of deployment infrastructure, we should be able to reduce/remove this bottleneck on development, while also minimizing the duplicated effort of maintaining two types of automation.</p>
<p>In summary, any developer should trivially be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy or connect locally built resources to their own feature environment in seconds with a single command from their laptop.</li>
<li>Deploy only the unit of deployment which has changed.</li>
<li>Have a development experience that is practically indistinguishable from “local development”.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-for-aws-serverless--function-as-a-service---monolithic-functions-are-ok">3. For AWS Serverless &amp; “Function-as-a-Service” - monolithic functions are OK</h4>
<p>The first thing many teams do when they first start using AWS Lambda, is that they create separate deployable functions for every type of function invocation. For instance, a REST API gets a function for every single endpoint on the API. However, if you think in terms of <em>Domain Driven Design</em>, this might mean you end up with a number of functions that logically make up a single <em>Bounded Context</em>.</p>
<p>There are also practical considerations: as an example, AWS CloudFormation has a default limit of maximum 200 resources per stack. When you start adding up the multiplicative effect of the resources required for a Serverless application, you quickly realise that this is a limit that can be easily reached. Sticking to a service per Bounded Context, that acts as the target for multiple types of Lambda invocations is a sensible thing to do. Doing this will also reduce the automation and coordination overhead.</p>
<h4 id="4-consider-adopting-a-monorepo-with-tooling-appropriate-for-monorepos">4. Consider adopting a monorepo, with tooling appropriate for monorepos</h4>
<p>Let us start with a caveat emptor: monorepos without using appropriate tooling can be a disaster of slow CI pipelines &amp; low productivity. The upside is that some amazing and battle-tested tooling for monorepos exist these days (a personal favourite is <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>, which originated from Google).</p>
<p>Without a monorepo, building distributed systems can be painful.</p>
<p>With dozens of repositories, code navigation for larger changes spanning multiple services become painful. Another thing that quickly becomes painful is dependency management, code sharing &amp; reuse. It is not uncommon to find that different components have different, mutually incompatible dependencies, which become painful to upgrade.</p>
<p>A monorepo negates these pains, while also making things such as security audits easier to conduct and address.</p>
<p>However, to avoid the “rebuild the universe” problem with monorepos, you need tooling that solves three problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change detection &amp; dependency-graph tracking.</li>
<li>Dependency-graph based rebuilds (rebuild only what has changed and what is invalidated by the change).</li>
<li>Build caching.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-implement-all-three-pillars-of-observability">5. Implement all three pillars of observability</h4>
<p>Observability in control theory is defined as the ability to infer the internal state of a system by from knowledge about its external outputs. In practice, this is the triumvirate of event logs (log aggregation &amp; analytics), metrics (for alerting) &amp; tracing (driving visualization). Most organizations today skew heavily towards event logs only, with maybe some metrics, but very few do all three well.</p>
<p>In a distributed systems world, doing all three pillars of observability well means that the time to detect, find and address bugs and other issues can be cut down to a fraction of what it would otherwise be. Furthermore, great observability will also improve developer productivity, since we can better understand the state of our entire system.</p>
<p>This is perhaps an area where AWS Serverless stands out as a leader. While the Kubernetes eco-system is filled with many options of various complexity and quality, AWS gives us an easy way to achieve a high level of observability at low effort and cost. <em>CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics</em> and <em>AWS X-Ray</em> can provide observability to a Serverless architecture at a relatively low threshold of effort and learning.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It should be obvious by now that Serverless &amp; distributed systems require great discipline in deployment automation. It is unfortunate that many still make the distinction between deployment being an “ops” concern, separate from development.</p>
<p>Dev &amp; Ops in modern systems are intertwined, the level and quality of automation has a great impact on DevEx (Developer Experience), and thus developer productivity. It is not a concern that can be postponed or thought about after the fact: it requires effort initially, and disciplined refinement throughout. If this is done well, you will be able to develop with a speed, reliability and level of productivity that will run rings around the competition.</p>
<p>We will return to this subject in the future to show what a practical Serverless toolchain and reference architecture could look like. Feel free to sign up to our email list below to get notified when we do!</p>

The new field called <code>referer</code> — a misspelling of the word <i>referrer</i> — allowed "the client to specify, for the server's benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained". A great addition to the protocol, but ter-ible spelling 😛</p><p>75 years later, on every website request that is made, there is now a <code>referer</code> header. Barker later <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/alt.folklore.computers/7X75In21_54/JgV9Rw04f-EJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">joke</a>d that he was trying to get the Oxford English dictionary to adjust their spelling..."since my spelling is used several billion times a minute more than theirs" </p><p>SQL queries have been written, databases have been designed, bugs have been introduced...because of how Barker and Fieldings spelled this word. </p><a href="#&quot;in-this-great-future,-you-can't-forget-your-past&quot;" id="&quot;in-this-great-future,-you-can't-forget-your-past&quot;"><h2>"In this great future, you can't forget your past"</h2></a><p>Developing products is inherently path dependent. History matters. Every product decision you've made determines every product decision you're going to make in the future.</p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F147e9b25-92c3-4534-bfef-510315be9d39%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=cb6c5a83-5484-4e3d-8049-e7c40cb03e23" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>Product-Market Fit is where that initial path is set. It is Decision A. At that point, you could've head in any direction. You could turn around quickly, and head in another direction. But the further you go down a particular trail, the further you have to backtrack. The more people you convince to join you on the trail, the more you have to explain why <i>everyone</i> needs to turn around. </p><p>I've found that thinking about your product path dependency is a helpful framework for understanding why your product is the way it is, and how to shape its future. It helps clarify why parts of your product — the product you are building! — stink and are so hard to fix. It clarifies which decisions matter and which do not. </p><p>And it helps you understand how and when you can change that path.</p><a href="#exploring-some-paths" id="exploring-some-paths"><h2>Exploring Some Paths</h2></a><p>Let's explore a few examples of Product Path Dependency at play...</p><a href="#smtp-protocol" id="smtp-protocol"><h3>SMTP Protocol</h3></a><p>Most email clients don't let you retract an email once it's been sent. You also can't edit a sent email. Most email clients — from Superhuman to HEY to Gmail — are built on the assumption that a sent email is a sent email. </p><p>Products have gotten creative to work around this assumption. Superhuman adds a 10 second wait period to allow you to unsend. If both sender and recipient are using Microsoft Exchange, an email can be "recalled". </p><p>But an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">early decision in 1982</a> is largely still dictating how much of the world digitally communicates.  </p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F902fe272-6f32-4432-8a0f-718df674cc53%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=96299059-f253-4b65-8d7c-138bfc19f900" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>Slack is a great example of what can happen when new entrants aren't burdened by past decisions. Rather than using SMTP, slack uses Websockets. When you send a message, the recipients see the message almost immediately. And you can edit, delete, pin and share the messages you're sending. </p><p>Once you've used Slack, you wonder why email was so static and immutable. It revisited an assumption, and made it painfully visible. </p><a href="#instagram" id="instagram"><h3>Instagram</h3></a><p>There's been a lot of <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/5/21354975/tiktok-clone-instagram-reels-facebook-copycat" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shade</a> thrown at Instagram for attempting to clone hit features like Stories (Snapchat) and Reels (TikTok). Occasionally these clones will work, in the case of Stories, but most of the time they flop.

Now put yourself in the shoes of the PM responsible for shipping Reels. You're trying to figure out how to fit Reels in alongside Stories, IGTV, Shop, Well-Being Guides, DMs for Brands, Influencers, Advertisers, and a user base in every country around the world. </p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9c67aef4-e50a-47b7-baf6-cceddeef5173%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=85d7f892-4c3b-4a23-8c45-c33b213177cf" alt="An image from Notion"></p><a href="#what-to-do-about-product-path-dependence" id="what-to-do-about-product-path-dependence"><h2>What to do about product path dependence?</h2></a><p>Path dependency is inherent to product development. It is a badge of successfully building something that people want, and an organization that can support it. So if we can't avoid it, what can we do about it? </p><a href="#early-decisions-are-disproportionately-important" id="early-decisions-are-disproportionately-important"><h3>Early Decisions are <i>Disproportionately Important</i></h3></a><p>There is a paradox of early product decision-making. Early decisions are disproportionately important in that all future decisions will rely on it. Yet they are also the ones that need to be made the fastest and given the least consideration. "Try it out and see what sticks." Until it sticks, and then you are left with that decision for a very long time. </p><p>I think there's a way to resolve this tension by making decisions that <i>preserve future optionality</i>. It's somewhat of a hack to avoid making a decision that you will have to unwind in the future.  </p><p>Let's take a user data model as a simple example. When you have no users, designing your data model is easy. You can change on the fly. As you build more features — like your sign up flow — they are built around the assumptions you made in designing your user model. Are you going to collect birthday? Are you going to ask them to use a company email address? Can they invite friends? As you build upon these early product assumptions, they become harder and riskier to change. </p><p>Designing for optionality may take slightly more time, but thinking through some potential options you might want down the line can reduce your path dependence. </p><ul><li>Will Users be part of an Account?</li><li>Will Users need to be Linked via a social graph?</li><li>Will Users need to have multiple Plans?</li></ul><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa558f675-6d7e-45a3-ade1-174780e3bb29%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=38c88d0c-697e-4319-ab5e-a7fd6f9d6881" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>An option-preserving decision early on can save you months or years of migration work down the line. </p><a href="#competitors-are-forging-their-own-paths" id="competitors-are-forging-their-own-paths"><h3>Competitors are forging their own paths</h3></a><p>Competitors are on a path as well, but it's different from yours. By understanding your competitors path, you can understand what they might do in the future, and what they aren't able to do given their prior decisions. A company geared at large enterprises has likely built a sales team that will be reluctant  to lower prices to sell to startups. A company designed to run on-prem will have quarters/years to migrate to the cloud. </p><p>New entrants are unburdened by decisions of the the past and can move much faster in many more directions. Every so often, revisit the assumptions and "path" that you are on. If you were to start all over again, how might your product and the org look different? Migrations and re-writes can be painful, but better to do so early than to continue to building on a crumbling foundation. </p><a href="#pms-are-the-&quot;product-historians&quot;" id="pms-are-the-&quot;product-historians&quot;"><h3>PMs are the "Product Historians"</h3></a><p>PMs can play an important role in understanding the market, organizational, and technology constraints that of the past, that led to the product today. In doing so, you'll be able to revisit past assumptions, avoid making the same mistakes, and build the trust of your team and customers. It's easy to fall into the trap that those who came before made bad decisions. Rarely is that the case. They made the best decision they could with the data and assumptions they were working off of. </p><p>By putting yourself in the shoes of those that came before — and really understanding the context — you can make even better decisions going forward. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>We’re excited to announce the release of version 1.20. The 1.20 release shipped on Oct 26, 2020. This version delivers new features as well as resolving issues for users on version 1.19 and older.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>In addition to bug fixes and user interface improvements, there are a couple of new features and improvements which deserve a spotlight.</p>

<h3 id="saml-saml-saml">SAML, SAML, SAML</h3>

<p>With this release, FusionAuth implements additional parts of the SAML 2.0 standard.</p>

<p>FusionAuth now has support for SAML POST bindings when it is acting as either the SP or the IdP. This allows FusionAuth to integrate with a number of popular commercial off-the-shelf applications and websites, including <a href="https://developers.login.gov/saml/">login.gov</a> and <a href="https://docs.alfresco.com/saml/concepts/saml-overview.html">Alfresco</a>.</p>

<p>FusionAuth also supports the <code>SessionIndex</code> attribute, which is optional, but required by some software applications, notably Artifactory.</p>

<p>Finally FusionAuth now honors the <code>AssertionConsumerServiceURL</code> in a SAML request. Multiple redirect URLs can be configured in the application SAML settings as well.</p>

<h3 id="docker-changes">Docker changes</h3>

<p>In this release, we updated the base image for Docker from <code>alpine</code> to <code>ubuntu:focal</code>. This should not impact functionality, but it’s worth paying attention to if you are building Docker images based on our image.</p>

<p>We made this change because in order to run on <code>alpine</code> without including the GNU C Library (<code>glibc</code>) we had to use a custom build of OpenJDK compiled using the <code>musl</code> C library. Due to some possible performance concerns with this option, we have moved to an official build of JDK provided by AdoptOpenJDK. This build is compiled using <code>glibc</code>. Unfortunately, using the <code>ubuntu:focal</code> image increased the docker image size by approximately 30 MB over the <code>alpine</code> based image. However, until we can obtain official builds from AdoptOpenJDK based upon the <code>musl</code> C library, we are not planning to ship an official FusionAuth image on <code>alpine</code> due to the performance concerns.</p>

<h3 id="additional-admin-user-management-forms">Additional admin user management forms</h3>

<p>In version 1.18, FusionAuth added <a href="https://fusionauth.io/features/advanced-registration-forms/">custom registration forms</a> for users with a paid edition.</p>

<p>In this release, we’ve added a few new forms. These customizations are also only available to customers with a paid edition. (Learn more about <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing/">purchasing a paid edition</a>.)</p>

<p>This new feature allows you to customize the form used to add or edit a user from the FusionAuth admin UI. These forms can be configured on a per tenant basis. For instance, you can now require a mobile phone number or require one or many custom fields when a FusionAuth admin is creating a user.</p>

<p>You can also modify the registration creation and update form in the FusionAuth admin UI, including capturing custom data, removing unused fields and adding validation to the custom fields. This form is configurable on an application by application basis.</p>

<p>For instance, if your business logic needs to know a user’s favorite color (or anything else), FusionAuth has you covered:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/release-1-20/custom-edit-registration-form.png" alt="A customized registration editing form."></p>

<p>When combined with FusionAuth’s granular roles, which allow you to create users with limited privileges, you can expose these forms to customer service reps or other users whom you might not want to access the entire FusionAuth admin UI.</p>

<h2 id="bugs-squashed">Bugs squashed</h2>

<p>In addition to these features, there were over ten other bugs squashed and GitHub issues resolved as well. These fixes include changes to JWT contents in certain situations, dashboard user counts, and superfluous log messages. Please see the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/release-notes/">release notes</a> for the full breakdown of the changes between 1.19 and 1.20.</p>

<p>If you’d like to upgrade your self-hosted FusionAuth instance, see our <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/upgrade/">upgrade guide</a>. If you have a FusionAuth Cloud deployment, open a <a href="https://account.fusionauth.io/" target="_blank">support request from your account dashboard</a> or <a href="https://fusionauth.io/contact" target="_blank">use our contact form</a> and we’ll get your servers upgraded! Or, if you’d like to download and use FusionAuth, <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing/">check out your options</a>.</p>

<p>U.S. employees will now be paid the same, based on high-cost locations like NY or San Francisco, whether they work from those places or not.</p>

<p>â€œMoving forward, teams and team members will have flexibility to explore where they work: in the office, remotely, or a combination of the two,â€� the post said.</p>

<p>For those who do come into the office, the spaces will be look different: Reddit said itâ€™s â€œreimaginingâ€� its office space, without fixed desks and with â€œneighborhoodsâ€� for teams to work together. The newly flexible approach will help Reddit bring in top talent without concerns about relocations, increase workersâ€™ engagement and make their office space more efficient.</p>

<p>Several&nbsp;tech firms, including Facebook and Slack, have said during the pandemic that their workers are free to relocate and work remotely going forward, but they will be paid based on where they live. Stripe Inc. said that it would pay employees who relocate from the Bay Area or New York a one-time bonus of $20,000 â€“ but theyâ€™d also get a pay cut of as much as 10%. Brex, a fintech company based in San Francisco, has also outlined salary reductions for employees who move out of the Bay Area and New York to places like Austin, Texas or Utah.</p>

<p>â€œWe will not be afraid to continuously adapt and evolve our workforce philosophies, programs, and processes,â€� Redditâ€™s post stated.</p>

Once you have created an account, make sure to create a new project and grab the API Key ID. We will be using your API Key ID later in part 2.</p><h2 id="part-2-webflow-setup">Part 2: Webflow Setup</h2><p>For this tutorial, we have created 3 pages: Blog Homepage, Sign In Page, and Blog Content Page. We will be using Webflow CMS to do this. Please <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBtF_XuimCo&amp;t=3720s">refer to this YouTube tutorial to create a simple blog</a>.</p><h3 id="blog-homepage-setup">Blog Homepage Setup </h3><p>The Blog Homepage contains a list of your blogs and an overview of each blog. If a reader wants to read the full article, he/she will be redirected to the Sign In Page where we will show the embedded Cotter login form for your users to type in their email before getting access to the full blog post. If the reader is already signed in, then he/she will be redirected to the full article page.</p><p>After finishing the page setup, we can start with adding custom code to the Blog Homepage. Copy paste the code below to the custom code tab on the Blog Homepage Page settings.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cotter.app/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-7.47.23-PM-1.png"><figcaption>Page Settings</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.cotter.app/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-06-at-7.49.28-PM-1.png"><figcaption>Scroll down to "Custom Code" section</figcaption></figure><p>Add the code below to the body of the Blog Homepage</p><pre><code>&lt;script&gt;

// 3. Change the "Sign In" Button to "Sign Out"
let authButton = document.getElementById("auth-button")

if(!!cotterOAuthToken) authButton.innerHTML = "Sign Out"

authButton.addEventListener("click", () =&gt; {

&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre><h3 id="sign-in-page-setup-where-the-sign-in-form-will-show-up-">Sign In Page Setup (where the sign in form will show up)</h3><p>We need to include a section element to load Cotter's login form. Moreover, we need to set that section ID to "cotter-form-container". This enables Cotter's JS SDK to load the login form to the section element that we just added.</p><p>After finishing the page setup, we can start with adding custom code to the Sign In Page.

                <p>This article could have been entitled&nbsp;337,737,600 seconds, but hiding the fact that Prototypo started more than 10 years ago would have been a missed opportunity to show the dedication the team and I, as a founder, put in this project over the years.</p>
<p>Prototypo started as a student project when I studied Graphic Design at H.E.A.R Strasbourg in France. As a non-savvy Type Designer I was frustrated to not be able to complete the typeface projects I had in mind. Typefaces are made of rules and systems, right? Catcha! We can code something that follows rules, so we should succeed in coding fonts. That was the starting point of the next 10 years, and the beginning of the Roller Coaster, a.k.a creating a startup company.</p>
<p>Prototypo is a startup like many others: before having a stable and reliable business model, we put a lot of energy into developing innovative and useful technologies for our users.</p>
<p>But before being a startup, Prototypo is a company. Today we have reached the end of our resources without having found the expected Product Market Fit, and so the Break-even.</p>
<p>After several years of a strong dedication and passion for what we’ve built, we decided to shutdown the company.</p>
<p>Since the first second, I knew that it would be a hard journey with many obstacles on the path. But I regret nothing. The next 337,737,599 seconds were full of great experiences, shared with amazing people.</p>
<p>Thank you for those who supported us along the road, it was a great adventure.</p>

<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story. They’ve been ghosted by candidates. They’ve spent hours trying to convince people to talk to them. They’ve spent even more time getting candidates to the offer stage, only to lose out to the FAANG / startup-du-jour.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re an engineer (no matter how brilliant) who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A …</li></ul></div></article></main></section></div></div>

You might use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a> to resolve dependencies, <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> to run tests, <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a> and <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a> for lint checks, <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a> and <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/">isort</a> for auto-formatting, <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> for type checking, <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for interactive sessions, <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools</a>, <a href="https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pex</a> or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> for packaging, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a> for code generation, and many more. Not to mention any custom tooling you've built for your repo. </p><p>Installing, configuring and orchestrating the invocation of these tools<strong>—</strong>all while not re-executing work unnecessarily<strong>—</strong>is a hard problem, especially as your codebase grows. The lack of a robust, scalable build system for Python has been a problem for a long time, and this has become even more acute in recent years, with Python codebases increasing in size and complexity. </p><p>Fortunately, there is now a tailor-made (pun intended) solution: <strong>Pants v2</strong>!</p><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is designed from the ground-up for fast, consistent builds. Some noteworthy features include:</p><ul><li>Minimal metadata and boilerplate</li><li>Fine-grained workflow</li><li>Shared result caching</li><li>Concurrent execution</li><li>A responsive, scalable UI</li><li>Unified interface for multiple tools and languages</li><li>Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/render1603750306032.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Pants running multiple linters in parallel</figcaption></figure><p>Read on to learn more about Pants v2, and what it means for your Python codebase.</p><hr><h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2><p>We started the original open-source Pants project back in 2011. At the time, we were frustrated by slow, flaky Scala builds. The leading strategy for scaling was to hand each developer a RAM stick and a screwdriver... Surely this was a problem we could tackle with software! Thus Pants v1 was born. </p><p>Pants v1 was quite successful, and was adopted at cutting-edge tech companies such as Twitter, Foursquare, Square and others. But we still weren't satisfied: The APIs were clunkier than we would have liked, the UI was overly chatty, caching was hard to get right, and concurrent execution had to be special-cased. We knew there were plenty of performance and stability improvements to be had, if we could only unlock them. </p><p>We learned a lot from our years of work on Pants v1, and knew that we could design something new and better, leaning on our experience with v1 while addressing the drawbacks of that system. Luckily, at the same time as we began thinking about this hypothetical next system, a new motivating problem emerged: Python builds.</p><h2 id="python-builds-today">Python builds today</h2><p>As you probably know, Python has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. Not only is it used to build a wide variety of server applications, via frameworks such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, but it's also the language of choice for data scientists, thanks to powerful libraries and tools such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. </p><p>Python hits a sweet spot of simplicity and power, but there is a big problem - there is no truly great scalable build tool for Python, and this is becoming a real pain point as Python repos grow like never before. &nbsp;</p><p>Python builds today involve manually invoking a wide variety of tools. Each tool has to be installed, configured and invoked in just the right way, often while sequencing the output of one tool into input of another. Knowing how to use each tool in a given scenario is complicated and burdensome. </p><p>Sure, you can hack around the problem for a while with some combination of shell scripts, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">Makefiles</a>, <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a>, and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>. But even a small code change might require you to run a huge amount of sequential build work. Re-executing the same processes with the same inputs over and over again is a frustrating waste of time and resources. &nbsp;And these solutions start to break down as your codebase grows.</p><p>Perhaps you experimented with more complex build systems, such as <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> or <a href="https://v1.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v1</a>. &nbsp;But it's laborious to maintain all that BUILD metadata, all for a sub-par experience not optimized for Python. Not to mention the difficulty of implementing your own custom build logic. </p><p>Alternatively, maybe you've been tempted to split up your codebase into multiple interdependent repos, each with their own "smaller" builds. But that creates an even thornier problem, namely how to manage those interdependencies. Having to propagate changes across codebase boundaries can slow development down to a crawl, and leave you with the worst of both worlds - slower processes and a fragmented, unmanageable codebase.</p><p>A great build system for repos - of all sizes - that include Python code would support fine-grained invalidation and caching, so that it only executes the build work actually affected by a change. It would support concurrent local and even remote execution, to greatly speed up work by using all available CPU. It would be easy to adopt in a small repo, but would scale up as your codebase grows. It wouldn't require huge amounts of boilerplate metadata, and it would be easy to extend with custom build logic. </p><p>Well, Pants v2 is that system! </p><h2 id="introducing-pants-v2">Introducing Pants v2</h2><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is a completely new open-source build system, inspired by our work on Pants v1. &nbsp;We've been developing and testing it for the last couple of years, and it's finally ready for prime time!</p><p>A key factor in the design of Pants v2 was a set of lessons we learned from Pants v1 and other existing systems, such as Bazel. Among them: that ease of use and performance matter, boilerplate is annoying, concurrency and caching require hard design work, and most people will need custom logic at some point.</p><h3 id="lesson-1-ease-of-use-and-performance-both-matter">Lesson #1: Ease of use and performance both matter</h3><p>When designing software you often find yourself making tradeoffs between ease of use and performance. But in a build system, both are vital. The Pants v2 execution engine - which is the performance-critical heart of the system - is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, for raw speed. And the domain-specific build logic is written in familiar, easy to work with, type-annotated Python 3. This helps make Pants v2 easy to extend, without compromising performance. </p><p>Pants v2 also runs a daemon that memoizes fine-grained build state in memory, for even faster performance. This daemon watches for changes to your source files and precisely invalidates its state on the fly to ensure that the minimum amount of work happens the next time you build.</p><h3 id="lesson-2-writing-build-metadata-is-a-real-drag">Lesson #2: Writing build metadata is a real drag</h3><p>Some build tools are slow because they don't have enough information about the structure of your code to intelligently perform incremental work. Others have gone too far in the other direction, requiring a huge amount of metadata and boilerplate in BUILD files, especially relating to your code's dependencies. </p><p>Pants v2 offers the best of both worlds - intelligent, fine-grained incremental work, without the boilerplate. It does so by assuming sensible, magic-free defaults, inferring dependencies from the import statements in your code, and supporting plugins for custom inference logic. Stay tuned for an upcoming post on exactly how Pants achieves this!</p><h3 id="lesson-3-design-for-caching-concurrency-and-remoting">Lesson #3: Design for caching, concurrency and remoting </h3><p>Writing build logic that can be cached and executed concurrently and remotely is very hard. You have to be very careful about not producing or consuming side-effects, and it's extremely difficult to tack that on later. And unless you design your APIs with care, supporting these kinds of features often places severe restrictions on what your build logic may safely do. </p><p>In Pants v2, build logic is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a> Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">async coroutines</a>. So a build rule can depend not only on its inputs, but can also await on new data at runtime - all of which is precisely tracked for invalidation and caching. This gives us the best of both worlds: logic that is properly isolated from side-effects, and is therefore amenable to caching, concurrent execution and remoting, while still allowing the use of natural control flow.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/caching.gif" alt=""><figcaption>We run both tests, then add a syntax error to one test and rerun; the unmodified test uses the cache and is isolated from the syntax error.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="lesson-4-almost-everyone-needs-to-customize-their-builds">Lesson #4: Almost everyone needs to customize their builds</h3><p>Most teams have custom build steps, so extensibility is a key feature in any build system. Pants v2 is built around a <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview">plugin architecture</a>. You can write your own rules using the same API as the built-in functionality. So your custom build logic will enjoy the same fine-grained invalidation, caching, concurrency and remote execution abilities as the core Pants code.</p><h2 id="pants-2-0-0-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0 is out now!</h2><p>All this leads me to the happy announcement that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pantsbuild.pants/2.0.0/">Pants 2.0.0</a>, the first stable release of Pants v2, is out now! 2.0.0 is the culmination of years of design and development work, and many months of beta testing at several organizations. So we're really happy, proud (and relieved…) to finally have it ready for general use. </p><p>You can see what Python tools Pants currently supports <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python">here</a>. There are also commands for querying and understanding your dependency graph, and a robust help system. &nbsp;We're adding support for additional tools and features all the time, and it's straightforward to implement your own. Beta users have already written their own logic for Cython and docker, for example. </p><p>Now is a great time to adopt Pants 2.0.0! The team that developed Pants v2 is <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">ready to help you</a> onboard, answer any questions, and even pair with you to help you write any custom build logic. We're also eager to get feedback, bug reports and suggestions for what features we should focus on in the next weeks and months of development.</p><p>Pants v2 is developed by a helpful open source community, is funded by a 501(c)6 non-profit, and has excellent support available. If you have a growing Python codebase, and want to take Pants 2.0.0 for a spin, <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">let us know</a>. We'd love to fit you with some new Pants today!</p>

                    <p>We will never have enough software developers.</p><p>Developers are dropping out of the profession in large numbers despite efforts to grow the number of computer science graduates and software engineers.</p><p>Here's why.</p><h2 id="developer-dropout-is-real">Developer dropout is real</h2><p>Software development has a <em>serious</em> retention problem:</p><ul><li>At age 26, 59% of engineering and computer science grads work in occupations <em>related</em> to their field of study.

</section><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="out-with-the-old-skills-in-with-the-new-skills">Out with the old skills, in with the new skills</h2><p>Programming-related jobs have high rates of skill turnover. Over time, the types of skills required by companies hiring software developers change more rapidly than any other profession.</p><p>To demonstrate this, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/4/1965/5858010">researchers</a> analyzed job postings on more than 40,000 online job boards and company websites between 2007 and 2019, controlling for employer, location, and occupation. They defined "new" skills as those that were rare or non-existent in 2007 but prevalent in 2019 and "old" skills as those that were prevalent in 2007 but rare or extinct in 2019.</p><ul><li>While only 30% of all job vacancies required at least one new skill by 2019, <strong>47% of computer and mathematical jobs required at least one new skill</strong> (i.e. a skill that was not common back in 2007)</li><li>This compares to <em>less than 20%</em> of jobs in fields like education, law, and community and social services</li><li>In addition, <strong>16% of jobs in computer and mathematical fields in 2007 required a skill that was obsolete by 2019</strong> (i.e. a skill that was common in 2007 but relatively rare in 2019), more than double any other job category:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/azDsA9n3rx.png"></figure><p>About a third of the change in required skills in computer-related occupations is due to specific new software:</p><ul><li>The fastest-growing software skills between 2007 and 2019 include <strong>Python, R, and Apache Hadoop</strong></li><li>Software that was popular in 2007 but effectively obsolete by 2019 includes QuarkXpress, ActionScript, Solaris, IBM Websphere, and Adobe Flash (ah, finally a name I recognize)</li></ul><p>Data science, machine learning, and AI saw big increases among technology-intensive jobs as well. For example, the number of STEM-related jobs requiring skills in machine learning and AI grew more than 4x from 2007-2017, touching more than 15% of STEM jobs:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Pc3AjVflhW.png"></figure><p>To better compare rates of skill change across occupations, the researchers came up with a measure of skill change that tracks the absolute growth or decline of various skills within each profession from 2007 to 2019. Occupations whose required skills change rapidly in prevalence among job postings receive a high score, while jobs whose skills do not change much receive a lower score:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/xfeKvOWxo-.png"></figure><ul><li><strong>Computer-related occupations receive the highest score by far, 4.8</strong>. Note that the mean and standard deviation of this measure are ~3 and ~1 respectively, so computer-related jobs are <strong>nearly two standard deviations away from the typical job in America</strong></li><li>Meanwhile, jobs in education and and those involving manual labor have very low skill change scores, typically less than 2.</li></ul><p>We can get even more granular and look at specific job roles. This level of detail makes the difference even more stark (only showing the fastest changing roles):</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/OwoB5xsSdO.png"></figure><p>Web development has the highest rate of skill change <em>among all jobs in the country</em>. Next up are sales engineers, another often technical role. Database administrators, computer network architects, sysadmins, and application developers all make the top 10, and we see many other technical roles among the top 30. The mean and standard deviation are similar here, placing web development <strong>more than 3 standard deviations away from the typical job in America</strong> in terms of skill change over time.</p><p>Suffice to say, <strong>software development is a rapidly changing profession</strong>.</p><p>You might think, however, that skill change would eventually settle down as one becomes more experienced.</p><p><em>You'd be wrong.</em> The skills for software engineering jobs change rapidly throughout the entire career lifecycle:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/7ItjXMaTE-.png"></figure><ul><li>In entry-level roles in computer and engineering occupations all the way through those requiring 12+ years of experience, <strong>the proportion of job postings requiring at least one new skill in 2019 was effectively the same, 40-45%</strong></li><li>In contrast, <strong>29% of entry-level non-computing and engineering roles in 2019 required at least one new skill, but this proportion declines to 24%</strong> for jobs requiring more than four years of experience</li></ul><blockquote>This means that experienced STEM workers seeking employment in 2019 are often required to possess skills that <strong>were not required</strong> when they entered the labor market in 2007 or earlier.</blockquote><p>Software engineers <strong>never</strong> escape the skill-change vortex, even many years into their careers. Experienced engineers must learn and adopt technologies that didn't even exist when they started out. Developers must constantly retool themselves, even well after their <a href="https://whoisnnamdi.com/college-degrees-software-engineers/">formal education</a> ends.</p><h2 id="nothing-s-changed-but-my-change"><a href="https://youtu.be/m1ERvlxgCD8?t=166">Nothing's changed but my change</a></h2><p><strong>College majors associated with faster changing jobs pay more early on.</strong></p><ul><li>In professions with one standard deviation increased skill change, pay is <strong>~30%</strong> higher in the first few years of one's career</li><li>If we exclude both the fastest and slowest-changing fields (Engineering/Computer Science at the high end, Health/Education at the low end), the early earnings premium for faster-changing roles increases to <strong>~60%</strong>:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/heMo13OsG1.png"></figure><p><strong>Fast-changing fields pay better.</strong></p><p>Notice however that the pay advantage declines over time. By the time one approaches the age of 50, the pay premium for working in rapidly changing fields falls dramatically to only 20-30% vs slower changing professions.</p><p>Here's another way to see the eroding pay advantage. The below chart simulates the earnings of the average worker by category of college degree from ages 23 to 50 in 2016 dollars.</p><ul><li>Computer science and engineering grads start off with sizable advantage vs any other major</li><li>However, this premium <em>falls</em> over time as the earnings of CS and engineering graduates plateau over time while the earnings of their peers grow <em>faster</em> for <em>longer</em></li><li>In fact, <strong>life and physical science graduates' earnings surpass their computer and engineering classmates by the age of 40</strong>:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Lifecyle-Earnings-by-Degree-Category.png"></figure><p>Excluding business majors, the earnings premium of software engineering declines over time in both percentage <em>and</em> absolute dollar terms, to the point where engineers barely out-earn social science majors:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Engineering-_-Computer-Science-Earnings-Premium.png"></figure><p>But the focus on college major is somewhat misleading. This phenomenon has less to do with one's field of study and more to do with <em>choice of occupation</em>.</p><p>To show this, researchers plotted the earnings premium of various categories workers relative to those with a non-Engineering/Computer Science major working in a non-Engineering/Computer Science job.</p><ul><li>Workers who major in Engineering or Computer Science but work in unrelated fields actually see their earnings advantage <em>compound</em> over time, rather than decline</li><li>On the other hand, regardless of major, individuals who work in Engineering or Computer Science jobs see their earnings advantage erode over the years:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/OFffH9kBKA.png"></figure><blockquote><strong>Declining relative returns is a feature of STEM jobs, not majors.</strong> The earnings premium for non-STEM majors in STEM occupations starts off near 40%, but declines to 20% within a decade. In contrast, the relative earnings advantage grows over time for computer science and engineering majors working in non-STEM occupations.</blockquote><p>The <strong>profession</strong> of software development drives the declining earnings premium, <strong>not the college major</strong>.</p><p>In fact, computer science majors who work in non-CS fields experience the <em>opposite</em> dynamic of their non-developer peers — their relative earnings premium rises as they advance. A CS major who eschews the profession doesn't earn much more than otherwise similar non-CS majors early on, but eventually out-earns their peers by nearly 20%.</p><p>OK, that's enough about <em>what</em> is happening. Now let's see <em>why</em> it's happening.</p><h2 id="human-capital-depreciates-too"><em>Human</em> capital depreciates too</h2><p>Imagine a simple model where workers choose their profession in order to maximize income, which is a derivative of their own skill or human capital. Over time, workers gain new skills, while the value of their existing skills depreciates somewhat due to changing times.</p><p>Some workers, endowed with superior ability, learn faster than others, picking up skills at a quicker pace. Those workers will tend to sort into high-skilled, fast-changing professions initially, maximizing their early career earnings. Less impressive workers will sort into low-skilled, slower-changing professions.</p><p>In a world where human capital never depreciated, we could imagine that high-skilled individuals like software developers would maintain a relative human capital (and earnings) advantage over other professionals, leading to consistently increasing pay and a stable relative premium:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Human-Capital--w_o-Depreciation-.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Software-Engineering-Human-Capital-Premium--w_o-Depreciation-.png"></figure><p>But, if human capital depreciates over time and that rate of depreciation is higher in rapidly-changing fields like software development, then developers' initial advantage would erode over time, narrowing the gap vs. non-developers:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Human-Capital--w_-Depreciation-.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Software-Engineering-Human-Capital-Premium--w_-Depreciation-.png"></figure><p>This simple model helps explain what we see in the data — the software engineering earnings advantage disappears as the <em>effective</em> human capital gap narrows.</p><blockquote>Applied majors such as computer science, engineering, and business teach vintage-specific skills that become less valuable as new skills are introduced to the workplace …</blockquote></div></section></article></div></div></div>

The list of available opcodes is as follows, notice that 10-18 are composites of the preceding ones:</p><ul><li>0 <code>Value<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>1 <code>Copy<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>2 <code>Blank<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>3 <code>ReturnIntoArray<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>4 <code>ReturnIntoObject<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>5 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKey<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>6 <code>PushField<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>7 <code>PushElement<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>8 <code>PushParent<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>9 <code>Pop<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>10 <code>PushFieldCopy</code></li><li>11 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>12 <code>PushElementCopy</code></li><li>13 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>14 <code>ReturnIntoObjectPop</code></li><li>15 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKeyPop</code></li><li>16 <code>ReturnIntoArrayPop</code></li><li>17 <code>ObjectSetFieldValue</code></li><li>18 <code>ObjectCopyField</code></li><li>19 <code>ObjectDeleteField</code>â€‹ </li><li>20 <code>ArrayAppendValue</code>â€‹ </li><li>21 <code>ArrayAppendSlice<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>22 <code>StringAppendString<!-- -->â€‹</code></li></ul><p>Mendoza reads these opcodes from the patch and produces the resulting document from them. Depending on the patch, Mendoza might choose not to strictly follow the opcodes but take a simpler path. If every field and value has changed, for example, itâ€™s more efficient just to replace the whole document with the new data without going through all the operations. Or if you have a list of objects where one has moved to another position and changed a key-value, Mendoza will manage to go back to the original and represent the change in a cheap way.</p><p>Mendoza is implemented in Go and can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza">GitHub repository</a>. We have also made <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza-js">a parser for Mendoza patches in JavaScript</a>, that you can use in your own application. </p><p>Of course, you can dive into <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity/blob/a3f7158016d63728a9b435e6ab444ff2b90fd424/packages/%40sanity/desk-tool/src/panes/documentPane/documentHistory/history/timeline.ts#L421">the source code for the Sanity Studio</a> and explore how Mendoza is used there. If you want a slightly simpler use-case, you can also <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-store/blob/main/src/patch.ts">check out how weâ€™re using Mendoza to simulate a part of Sanityâ€™s real-time datastore</a> in the browser to power the <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity">real-time preview for Next.js</a>. </p><p>Naming a project is always difficult. Since this project is focused on representing changes between <em>JSON</em> documents I naturally started thinking about names like "JSON differ, JSON changes, JSON patch, â€¦". However, most of these names have already been used by existing projects. While I was muttering "JSON, JSON, JSON" it suddenly turned into "JSON, JSON, Jason, Jason Mendoza".</p><p>Jason Mendoza is a character from the show The Good Place, and while this project has little in common with the stupidest DJ from Florida, at least it's short and catchy.</p><p>Since a Mendoza patch is just describing the effect of a change it is also limited to work for the documents it was based on. It doesnâ€™t come with guarantees for consistency if the document you apply it on has changed from the original in meanwhile. This is one of the tradeoffs that we needed to do to make it really compressed. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Deadlifting 337.5 lbs in my <a href="https://billmei.net/blog/gym-build">home gym</a>.</p>

<p>I wasted years failing at improving my health and fitness by following misguided “common sense” advice. I tried everything: P90X, cross-country running, bodybuilding, HIIT, swimming, BodBot, 2 types of yoga, CrossFit, rowing, personal training, F45, and cycling. None of them worked.</p>

<p>It seemed like everyone around me was getting results, but no matter how hard I tried, I wasn’t able to carry more things, attain a muscular physique, better outrun an emergency, or climb over a fence.</p>

<p>But after hundreds of hours of frustration and disappointment, I finally figured out what was preventing me from achieving the fitness results that I wanted.</p>

<p>I made 10 major mistakes by following “common sense” advice that hindered my progress for years. They are:</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="mistake-1-not-reasoning-from-first-principles">Mistake #1: Not reasoning from first principles</h2>

<h3 id="who">Who</h3>

<p>I learned that everyone’s body is different. A nutrition and exercise program that works for me may not work for you, or vice-versa. Our genetics, physiology, and lifestyles are not the same so do not read this article as “advice” for you. It is advice only for me.</p>

<p>For example, I use more extreme language than other articles on health and fitness, because I find it necessary to go “all or nothing” in forming habits, but this writing style may be counterproductive if it does not fit your predilection; e.g. I’ll say something like “If you miss a workout, you have to <em>start over from the beginning</em>”, and this is not technically true because you can make up for the workout later, but I need to be told that the stakes are much higher than they actually are to motivate myself to stay on track. I regret that nobody was ever this forceful with me. By being too forgiving they gave me an excuse to not take things as seriously as I should have. You may find this writing style off-putting, but I will remind you that this is written for me, not for you.</p>

<p>One way I wasted a lot of time in the beginning is assuming that other peoples’ advice can apply to me, but it can’t. What worked was to figure out what first principles apply to my situation, and then build up a strategy from there to solve my individual needs, and not copy or follow someone else’s advice from the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>Why are health and fitness important? Physical health is required to operate in the physical universe. It’s the wellspring from which all other actions depend. Therefore, to improve your cognition, mood, relationships, career, morals—work out.</p>

<h3 id="how">How</h3>

<p>Ground truth comes from physics. The irreducible first step is Force = Mass × Acceleration. This is an inviolable law of the universe. Force production is therefore the only objective performance metric. All other secondary goals (weight loss, flexibility, cardiovascular health, etc.) are therefore relevant only when they are on the critical path to improving force production.<sup id="fnref:critical-path" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:critical-path">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Maintaining health is expensive, and biological organisms do not spend more resources than marginally required by their environments, because any wasteful organism will be evolutionarily outcompeted by a more resource-conserving rival. Therefore, any increase in wellness must be proportional to a preceding increase in stress. This leads us to the second step, the <a href="#mistake-4-doing-exercise-instead-of-training">Stress Recovery Adaptation cycle</a> (SRA), which I will describe later. Any strategy that does not follow this is disallowed by biology.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-2-taking-action-instead-of-planning">Mistake #2: Taking action instead of planning</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important not to overthink things—just take action! You’ll figure it out as you go.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No plan survives contact with the enemy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just Do It.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are all wrong. It turns out that planning is <em>really, really</em> important. I did not expect this, but having an appropriate plan <em>makes or breaks</em> your success.</p>

<p>Based on what I learned from entrepreneurship and the “Lean Startup Approach”, I assumed that a mediocre plan with great execution is better than a great plan with poor execution. This is not true for health and fitness.</p>

<p>A mediocre plan with great execution is not better than a great plan with poor execution. A mediocre plan with great execution achieves <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>Good planning is the difference between achieving all your goals, and achieving <em>nothing at all</em>. Action is irrelevant to outcome.</p>

<p>The problem with bad plans is that taking the <em>wrong</em> action gives you negative progress. “Just Do It” is harmful advice, because it gives you the illusion of progress while actually accomplishing nothing, or taking you in reverse.<sup id="fnref:reverse" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reverse">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It took years for me to learn this because the vast majority of exercise programs are not good. It was only by luck that after years of trying many different programs I finally found one that worked. The probability that the average personal trainer you pick after walking into a random commercial gym can design the right program is effectively nil.</p>

<p>To understand why planning is more important than action, I have to explain four other mistakes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mistake #3: Not planning all the way until the end</li>
  <li>Mistake #4: Doing exercise instead of training</li>
  <li>Mistake #5: Listening to experts</li>
  <li>Mistake #6: Following a plan not designed for me</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mistake-3-not-planning-all-the-way-until-the-end">Mistake #3: Not planning all the way until the end</h3>

<p>Strenuous exercise is not required for success in modern civilization. Thus, the vast majority of people lack any adaptation to physical stress, with the result that even a tiny amount of exercise will produce results. This gives the misleading impression that exercise is “easy” because almost anything you do in the beginning will work; but “doing anything” eventually causes you to stall out very quickly when the early progress ends, you get frustrated, and then you quit.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://billmei.net/books/practical-programming-for-strength-training/">Practical Programming for Strength Training</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Virtually anything that makes a novice work harder than bed rest will produce positive results. As a result, many people have an erroneous impression of the quality of their training system. Single sets, multiple sets, high volume, high intensity, super slow, supersets, giant sets, gnarlmonster sets – quite literally anything resembling a training program will produce better results than no program at all in novice trainees. <strong>This is known as “the novice effect,” and must be considered when training this population.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what happened to me: I tried cross-country running which worked for a bit until it didn’t, then I got discouraged and quit. Then I tried P90X which also worked for a bit until it didn’t, then I got frustrated and quit. And so on ad infinitum.</p>

<p>After I understood the novice effect, I could see that the key to a successful fitness program is not about how effective it is for beginners, but about how effective it is for people at all skill levels from beginner to olympian.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-4-doing-exercise-instead-of-training">Mistake #4: Doing exercise instead of training</h3>

<p><em>Exercise</em> is about physical activity. Almost any strenuous physical action you take can be classified as <em>exercise</em>, no matter if it is helpful or harmful in the long term.<sup id="fnref:exercise-vs-training" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:exercise-vs-training">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Training</em> is about long-term goal-directed progress. It requires that you set an objective, measurable goal you can achieve (e.g. deadlift 200lbs, run 1 mile in under 20 minutes, finish 1st in my city’s tennis tournament). If an external observer cannot unambiguously say whether you succeeded or failed at your goal<sup id="fnref:failure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:failure">4</a></sup>, then you also cannot tell whether your day-to-day actions are beneficial or harmful to your long-term goal, hence this is not <em>training</em>.<sup id="fnref:fire-your-trainer" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fire-your-trainer">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The reason for this distinction is the biological first-principle that determines whether you will succeed or fail in the long-term: the <strong>Stress Recovery Adaptation cycle</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/815fe3b43867cf07a9398a20126ed188b57f3071/be6bc/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-primary.png" alt="One iteration of the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Performing exercise creates stress on the body, which diminishes your biological capabilities for a short time. As you eat and sleep, your body repairs itself during recovery, plus some additional extra capacity (adaptation) to handle future stress."></p>

<p>x and y axes exaggerated for emphasis in all of these graphs.</p>

<p>Performing <em>exercise</em> creates <em>stress</em> on the body, which diminishes your biological capabilities for a short time. As you eat and sleep, your body repairs itself during <em>recovery</em>, plus some additional extra capacity (<em>adaptation</em>) to handle future stress.</p>

<p>The stress is an external signal to your body that your environment must be more dangerous than it previously assumed, so your body tries to adapt to enable you to have a better chance of staying alive going forward.</p>

<p>Doing a workout that isn’t any harder than what you did before does not lead to additional adaptation, because you didn’t signal to your body that your environment is more dangerous than it previously assumed:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e279ba0e443b829d621c6490a4f5d66e69e78fa1/85ff1/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-not-enough.png" alt="Undertraining in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Insufficient stress creates a small drop in performance, but when you recover there is no additional adaptation above baseline. Hence, there is no performance improvement."></p>

<p>Biological organisms do not spend more resources than marginally required by their environments, because any wasteful organism will be evolutionarily outcompeted by a more resource-conserving rival. Thus, a lack of stress is a signal to your body that your environment must be safer than it previously assumed, so your body tries to conserve resources by decreasing its athletic capability:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/336a6ad7d7c8eefa02ca3dab85b92e046704afb9/ee30a/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-atrophy.png" alt="Atrophy in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. When you skip a workout, no stress is applied, and performance slowly diminishes below baseline because your muscles atrophy. The result is a decrease in performance."></p>

<p>Conversely, too much stress that exceeds your body’s ability to recover will just result in your cells breaking down without being properly repaired:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1fd88d0c95cbd5f093e41cdd5ac7628b54b9a72a/151b4/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-too-much.png" alt="Overtraining in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Too much stress creates a sharp performance drop-off that can't be recovered from properly. This leads to performance to revert to a level smaller than your original baseline, and hence is a performance decline."></p>

<p>Thus, the key to effective <em>training</em> is to carefully tune the amount of stress per <em>exercise</em> into the “Goldilocks zone” where you receive just enough stress to trigger an adaptation response, but not too much stress that you can’t recover, and not too little stress where you don’t trigger any adaptation response.</p>

<p>If you repeat this over a long time horizon, you get this classic (but incorrect!) graph that everyone draws, which you’ll see if you google this topic:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9829068739fe825d7a72080130c41917eea6dda7/3478a/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-wrong.png" alt="The classic diagram of the Strength Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Just as you recover to a higher baseline, you perform another workout to apply additional stress, and in order to move your fitness baseline even higher"></p>

<p>There is a key mistake made by everyone else who draws this graph. The big problem with the above diagram is that once you’ve adapted to a higher baseline, a larger amount of stress is required to trigger further adaptation!</p>

<p>Trying to exert the same stress on a higher baseline does not trigger adaptation, because your body has gotten used to it and the stress …</p></article></div>

<p>Our friends over at ICmasters have delved into the package of the Apple A14 Bionic. The die size has been unmasked, and it stands in at 88mm<sup>2</sup>. Despite cramming in 11.8 billion transistors, the die size is incredibly small thanks to utilization of TSMC’s 5nm process node.</p>

<p>The march of progress is not all rosy. Apple’s chips have historically achieved 90%+ of the process node’s theoretical density in their processors. This generation stands out by missing that mark by a large amount. A14 comes in at a cool 78% effective transistor density when compared to theoretical density. Despite TSMC claiming a 1.8x shrink for N5, Apple only achieves a 1.49x shrink.</p>

<p>This is not due to a failure of TSMC or Apple. These companies are clear leaders for the manufacturing and design of semiconductors respectively. Instead, this failure to convert theoretical to effective density stems from the slow death of SRAM scaling. SRAM is extensively used throughout a processor from registers to caches. Geoffrey Yeap of TSMC claims that the typical mobile SoC which consists of 60% logic, 30% SRAM, and 10% analog/IO.</p>

<p>TSMC’s N5 node diverges from prior shrinks by showing signs of slowing SRAM scaling. Despite being a full shrink with logic, the SRAM is a 1.35x shrink. This figure is overstated as it will end up being even lower once other the other assist circuitry is accounted for. Hence TSMC’s guidance of chip area reduction at 35%-40% with N5. SemiAnalysis expects this to be a trend that will persist with new nodes. TSMC and Samsung are already demonstrating 3D stacked SRAM which will help alleviate the issue of density.</p>

<p>3D Stacking is not the silver bullet. Cost scaling has begun slowing dramatically. With TSMC N5 wafer pricing in the ~$17k range, it is clear cost per transistor has not fallen. Even if SRAM scaling kept up, the cost per transistor would still have remained flat from N7 to N5.</p>

October 27, 2020 | https://ish-ar.io/tutorial-go-git/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ish-ar.io/tutorial-go-git/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Tutorial introduction and requirements</h2>
<p>Today’s article is a tutorial on how set up and use the go-git library to clone and update a repository with an in-memory filesystem.<br>
This procedure is quite useful if you want to push against or clone a repository without touching the OS filesystem and deal with permissions or temporary files.<br>
Albeit, there’s documentation about git-go, I find it not really clear and sometimes misleading due to the different versions and names of the library.<br>
For this reason, I’ve decided to share this tutorial, and hopefully will be helpful to someone.<br>
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will do everything inside a main.go file, however you might want something more sofisticated for your use case :)</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An https Git repository (Github, Bitbucket doesn’t really matter as long as it’s accessible via https.)</li>
<li>Go installed and configured.</li>
<li>Basic Knowledge of Go.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting up the In-Memory Filesystem</h2>
<p>To set up the in-memory filesystem, we will use two packages storage and memfs.
The storer will contain the objects, references and other metadata (normally what the directory <code>.git</code> would do).<br>
The memfs filesystem will be our filesystem to read, create, remove any kind of file in our repository.<br>
First step, we need to create the two objects (the storer and the filesystem).</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>package main

import (
        "fmt"

        billy "github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5"
        memfs "github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/memfs"
        git "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5"
        http "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/plumbing/transport/http"
        memory "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/storage/memory"
)

var storer *memory.Storage
var fs billy.Filesystem

func main() {
        storer = memory.NewStorage()
        fs = memfs.New()

...</code></pre></div>
<h2>Setting up Git objects and Clone the repo</h2>
<p>Second step, in order to have our repository in the in-memory filesystem, we need to <strong>clone</strong> it and create the <strong>worktree</strong> object.<br>
The function <code>Clone()</code> will also return the Repository interface that we will then use to <code>Push()</code> to the remote.<br>
The method <code>Worktree()</code> will return the Worktree object that we will need to <code>Add()</code> &amp; <code>Commit()</code> our changes.<br>
Finally, if our repository is private, we would need to set up the basic authentication to clone it (We need the basic authentication to push anyway so better to set up it here!).</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        // Authentication
        auth := &amp;http.BasicAuth{
                Username: "your-git-user",
                Password: "your-git-pass",
        }

        repository := "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo"
        r, err := git.Clone(storer, fs, &amp;git.CloneOptions{
                URL:  repository,
                Auth: auth,
        })
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("%v", err)
                return
        }
        fmt.Println("Repository cloned")

        w, err := r.Worktree()
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("%v", err)
                return
        }</code></pre></div>
<h2>Create and commit your files</h2>
<p>Now, will we use the <code>fs</code> object to create an actual file, add &amp; commit it to the Worktree().</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, the repository is always cloned into <code>"/"</code>. </li>
<li>For some reason (unknown to me), if the filename starts with ”/” it will create a folder and not a file.<br>E.g.: /hello/world.txt (world.txt would be a directory) hello/world.txt (world.txt would be a file inside the folder hello)</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        // Create new file
        filePath := "my-new-ififif.txt"
        newFile, err := fs.Create(filePath)
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        newFile.Write([]byte("My new file"))
        newFile.Close()

        // Run git status before adding the file to the worktree
        fmt.Println(w.Status())

        // git add $filePath
        w.Add(filePath)

        // Run git status after the file has been added adding to the worktree
        fmt.Println(w.Status())

        // git commit -m $message
        w.Commit("Added my new file", &amp;git.CommitOptions{})</code></pre></div>
<h2>Push and check errors</h2>
<p>The Push() will be performed using the method of the Repository interface as shown below.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        //Push the code to the remote
        err = r.Push(&amp;git.PushOptions{
                RemoteName: "origin",
                Auth:       auth,
        })
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        fmt.Println("Remote updated.", filePath)
        return
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Our final main.go would look like this: <a href="https://github.com/ish-xyz/ish-ar.io-tutorials/blob/master/tutorial-go-git/main.go">https://github.com/ish-xyz/ish-ar.io-tutorials/blob/master/tutorial-go-git/main.go</a></p>
<h2>Install and run our module</h2>
<p>Let’s try our new go module. Run the following commands:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>go mod init

go run main.go

    Repository cloned
    ?? my-new-file.txt
    &lt;nil&gt;
    A  my-new-file.txt
    &lt;nil&gt;
    Remote updated. my-new-file.txt</code></pre></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infrastructure as code has been an important practice of DevOps for years.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone running an Apache Kafka data infrastructure and running on Kubernetes, the chances are you’ve probably nailed defining your infrastructure this way.</p><p>If you’re running on Kubernetes, you’re likely using operators as part of your CI/CD toolchain to automate your deployments.&nbsp;</p><p>Adopting GitOps is natural evolution, whereby the state of your landscape is managed in Git (or any code repo) with automation systems ensuring the state of a deployment remains consistent with the repo.</p><p>Where we’ve seen a particular lack of maturity and best practices is in managing the application landscape of flows and microservices on technologies such as Kafka and Kubernetes.</p><p>GitOps is increasingly playing a big part of DataOps. DataOps promotes the accelerated delivery of data products through decentralized data governance, automation, self-service and lowering the skills required to operate data. GitOps brings standardization, governance and automation.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a subject we’ve spoken about at a few events recently including at Kafka Summit this year and on DevOps.com:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJygfiN-RR8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>What Kafka with GitOps should look like</h2><p>
When looking to automate real-time applications following DataOps, we need to be thinking about more than automating the app deployment. We need to define the correct data governance controls as part of the software delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>This means avoiding blind releasing apps where governance is an afterthought.&nbsp;</p><p>Lack of good governance will reduce the accessibility and trust in data and reduce the confidence to use the data downstream. Governance should cover the accessibility, availability, quality, integrity and confidentiality of the data.&nbsp;</p><p>We want the creator of the App, who best understands the data to be able to define the governance controls as a single package and then have it reviewed by a standard workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Example: A data analyst builds their own data-processing application, but they also define the governance and compliance controls required to release it. This puts the app’s performance parameters in their hands - they decide what makes it production-ready and enterprise-grade.</p><p>When deploying Kafka on Kubernetes, it may look like this: The analyst defines the application logic in some form (such as SQL) and includes:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The necessary Kafka ACLs</p></li><li><p>The data policies to mask any sensitive data</p></li><li><p>The lag and expected data throughput alerting rules</p></li><li><p>Where those events should be sent to (Slack, Pagerduty, etc)</p></li><li><p>The auditing rules to 3rd parties</p></li></ul><p>And so on...&nbsp;</p><p>This can then be pushed to Git, managed through your standard Git workflows and a merge request created, triggering a build pipeline to deploy across your different environments.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/57dTrzg6Sg6OORdvRTeebS/adef2d61514ca6b0e621c6343a22c4cf/GetYourGitOps.png" alt="GetYourGitOps"></p><p>If you’re working with Kafka and doing this, there are two areas we need to consider:</p><ol><li><p>How to define the the application &amp; governance landscape as config</p></li><li><p>How to best automate deployment in an infrastructure-agnostic and secure way.</p></li></ol><h2>Defining the App and Governance as config</h2><p>
Lenses provide a full experience for data practitioners (developers, analysts, even business users) to build real-time applications deploying on a Kafka &amp; Kubernetes data platform by ensuring all data is catalogued, made accessible and explorable.&nbsp;</p><p>The<a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/tools/cli/"> Lenses CLI client</a> allows your “data landscape” to be exported as declarative

and best maintain a consistent state</h2><p>
Here’s where there are a few different methods that are commonly adopted.&nbsp;</p><h3>Push Methods</h3><p>This is the method we see most organizations adopt. Teams will push to Git which will trigger a deploy pipeline in any CI/CD (such as Jenkins) using various APIs in Kafka, Kafka Connect, Kubernetes or wherever you’re running your applications. It also makes it difficult for Jenkins to monitor the desired state and ensure consistency with Git.</p><p>Of course you also need to open up the firewall to allow Jenkins into your data platform.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/74tcs9DG4E3jGe7mk34fku/3a4d4d3bd393f1de19d92d0f659ad9ff/GetYourGitOps_Pushing.png" alt="Traditional CI/CD push for Kafka automation"></p><h4>K8 Operator for Kafka</h4><p>You can use a Kubernetes operator to push the desired state. Jenkins or your CI/CD tool still needs to penetrate the data platform environment, however, which may increase security risk. Then you can use a Kubernetes operator (such as Strimzi’s) to monitor the desired state and apply the state to Kafka via APIs. This method is often used to operate the Kafka infrastructure, scale up Brokers etc. rather than to operate at the data layer (Topics, ACLs etc.)</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/47dnPqN0cGXI46XbqGx9gg/25f72efd0b1a927661c5dd0359e9916c/GetYourGitOps_K8s.png" alt="Traditional Kubernetes operator for GitOps"></p><h3>Pull Methods</h3><p>Pull methods are still based on an operator pattern, but through watching Git rather than watching Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p><p>This allows the pattern to work independently of using Kubernetes. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/RrcOkBDI9jgcm4KXBL9ca/73f4b286f539b47886b4854803fd7917/gitops_graffic_lenses_operator.png" alt="Lenses Operator for GitOps"></p><p>The operator is a Lenses operator which can run either inside or outside your data platform.&nbsp; The operator speaks with Lenses which applies the desired state to the data platform including any real-time applications. So for example for anyone using <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/Why-new-Streaming-SQL-opens-up-data-platform/">Lenses Streaming SQL</a>, this would deploy the application over Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p><p>The desired state of course would have been created within a separate Lenses environment and exported as config with the CLI before being pushed into Git.&nbsp;</p><p>The benefit of this pull deployment approach is it provides a more secure environment by not needing your CI/CD to access your infrastructure, it also ensures your applications are secured, governed and audited in Git with the state actively monitored and the ability to rollback at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>You can practice GitOps in the free </b><a href="https://lenses.io/box/">Kafka+Lenses docker developer Box </a><b>now.&nbsp; If you’re interested in an early access to the Lenses Operator: get in touch with us now</b><a href="https://lenses.io/contact-us/"> by form</a><b> or via </b><a target="_blank" href="https://launchpass.com/lensesio">Slack.</a><b> </b></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Organizations that operate microservices/service-oriented architecture face a variety of technical and people related problems. Over the past few years, companies have been migrating massive monolithic applications into smaller microservices (think services that do one thing, like <em>archive a pdf</em>) or even service oriented architectures (e.g. service-per-domain, <em>payments, billing, auth</em>).</p><p>There are undoubtedly many issues that come from monolithic architectures: easy to tightly couple domains and data, slower deployment process, and long test runs to name a few. Breaking the monolith can seem like a panacea for these issues. An SOA can provide team level ownership of domains and their systems, data is decoupled, and features/fixes can be deployed separately. Unfortunately, a SOA comes with its own set of issues.</p><p>Monoliths have been around for a while. There's a lot that's been written about "taming the monolith". As we get to work building Cortex, we've been talking to engineers about their experiences dealing with microservice architectures. Here's some things we've learned about taming your microservices.</p><p>A monolith, for all its warts, is simple to reason about. There are no network calls. There's no overhead to calling a function elsewhere in the codebase. If you're using a typed language, you can catch API changes at compile time. All the code is in one place – if you're so inclined, you can easily peek under the hood.</p><p>An SOA brings with it a suite of technical challenges, including operational complexity and performance hits. You now have to think about:</p><ul role="list"><li>Network latency</li><li>API versioning - what if the payments team makes a breaking change to its API without notifying me?</li><li>Network issues - what happens if I don't receive confirmation that the payment went through?</li><li>Change management/releases - when an issue occurs</li></ul><p>Yet, these technical challenges are the least of your worries.</p><h2>PEBCAK - Problem exists between chair and keyboard</h2><p>While it may sound strange to think that cultural and people problems are a significant challenge stemming from architectural choices, keep in mind that most organizations move to an SOA to scale their team, not their software.</p><p><strong>Distributing ownership of domains, data, and release cadence across services and teams can increase the velocity of your engineering org.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, distributing ownership does just that - teams start diverging in their operational procedures, documentation practices, and more. As an organization scales, this can wreak havoc on productivity, and ultimately bring your velocity back to square one.</p><p>People, process, and cultural issues around service oriented architectures have far reaching consequences:</p><ul role="list"><li>Ramping up engineers becomes costly - each team maintains their own processes. An engineer moving between teams may have to learn as much as a brand new hire.</li><li>Operational triage takes longer - tribal knowledge dissipates as an organization grows, making it harder to answer questions such as: what services exist, what they do, and who owns them</li><li>Communication overhead between teams - oversharing information is noisy, undersharing (e.g. when making API changes) can, in the worst case, cause outages or functionality issues and directly impact the bottom line</li></ul><p>Looking to scale your team? It's time to start thinking these challenges and how you can counter them.</p><p>There's no silver bullet to solve these problems. No combination of tools or processes can protect you. However, prevention really is better than the cure.</p><p>Think of it like a flu shot - you know its flu season, getting the flu sucks, and even though you may still get the flu, you'll never regret setting yourself up for success.</p><h2>Spec first design</h2><p>An excellent habit to promote is thinking about APIs and data models before jumping into the implementation.</p><h3>API Design</h3><p>It's important to ensure your SOA doesn't turn into a <em>distributed monolith</em>.</p><p>Signs of a distributed monolith:</p><ul role="list"><li>No separation of concerns</li><li>Shared databases and data models</li><li>Releasing one service requires coordination of deploys across multiple other services</li><li>Consuming a service's APIs requires knowledge about its data models, side effects, etc</li></ul><p>One way to prevent this is following the Amazon model - APIs are the only way teams communicate. This means that a service owner should:</p><ul role="list"><li>Think about their API request/responses <strong>before implementation</strong></li><li><strong>Share the API for review</strong> so that use cases for dependents are well covered</li><li><strong>Communicate API changes</strong> ahead of time</li><li><strong>Version their APIs</strong> to maintain backwards compatibility</li></ul><p>This workflow provides additional benefits when used in conjunction with tooling, such as OpenAPI or gRPC. If schemas and APIs are designed ahead of time, you can use:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Code gen</strong> for clients across different languages</li><li>Catch breaking changes to your API at <strong>build time</strong></li><li>Use your code review process to loop in the right stakeholders <em>before a change is released</em></li><li><strong>Contract testing</strong> to ensure you don't go out of compliance with your predetermined schema</li></ul><figure id="w-node-9def8f3c3ff0-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f3387ce026d1c67c8e6_JqjXbRYzUWfOUOAN.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Atlassian is an example of successfully using spec-first API design to improve their development lifecycle. I found <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/technology/spec-first-api-development"><strong>https://www.atlassian.com/blog/technology/spec-first-api-development</strong></a> to be an excellent overview of using OpenAPI as the tooling to enable spec-first development.</p><h3>Data models</h3><p>The breaking point for a monolith is when multiple teams start depending on the same data models across domains. This slows down the development cadence across the org and the resulting spaghetti data models make it exponentially more difficult to reason about the code base.</p><p>It's easy to go down the same route in an SOA as well. There are some habits that help prevent this nightmare:</p><ul role="list"><li>Separate data stores for each service</li><li>Thinking carefully about data models and links before implementing APIs</li><li>Reducing dependencies at the data level between services - for example, store reference IDs to resources in a different service, and fetch data through their API</li><li>Ensuring stakeholders (business, developers, service consumers) don't build tooling directly on your data. This locks in your data model and prevents you from iterating as a service owner. Instead, expose data (with its own contract) through APIs or analytical data streams.</li></ul><h2>Standardization of platform/process</h2><p>There's one obvious solution to "each team doing things their own way" - make it easy for teams to do things in a standardized way.</p><p>Atlassian, for example, has built out an internal PaaS that is essentially a thin wrapper around AWS. By doing so, developers are provisioned their desired resources but the platform automatically augments it with standard monitoring, logging, and more.</p><p>Well designed tooling that provides a standard way of doing things speeds up developer velocity and makes sure teams are working in consistent ways.</p><p>This even extends to documentation. Spotify and Atlassian have built internal tooling that standardizes information discovery around their microservices. System-Z at Spotify and <a href="https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/why-atlassian-uses-an-internal-paas-to-regulate-aws-access/"><strong>Microscope at Atlassian</strong></a> provide a source of truth for details about each service, such as system ownership, links to documentation/runbooks, and recent deploys. What makes them even more powerful is that they are the entrypoint into further information about services – on-call rotations, links to monitoring dashboards, logging, etc.</p><figure id="w-node-a1aa57605d7f-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f37ddc5afe80353230b_vpQZUjpsspzaKCVQ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This kind of standardization of information improves engineering ramp up time and operational efficiency - all services are operated in the same way and developers have a single source to look for critical information about their services.</p><p>Many organizations end up building an internal service registry for humans after the problem has gotten out of hand – too many services, growing teams and turnover, remote developers, etc.</p><p>Cortex provides a standard, opinionated way to organize information about all of your services and enables functionality such as:</p><ul role="list"><li>A dashboard to answer questions such as "what services exist?", "who owns this service?", "where are the runbooks for this service?"</li><li>An audit report that shows you the health of your services: does every service have an owner, an oncall rotation, etc.</li></ul><figure id="w-node-66b03bd1403c-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f3276ebd32f1e32f034_YyoCvebvNYItDndV.png" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>Integrations with third party tools - for example, when Pagerduty triggers an alert, Cortex can send a slack message with information about the service such as ownership, latest commits from github, latest deploys, and more.</li></ul><p>Reach out to us on our home page to request a demo, we'd love to show you what we've built and help prevent some of the headaches that come with a service oriented architecture.

<p><code>dry-python/returns@0.15</code> is <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/releases/tag/0.15.0">released</a>! And it means that now anyone can use our Higher Kinded Types emulation in their projects.</p>

<p>In this post I will explain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What Higher Kinded Types (HKTs) are and why they are useful</li>
  <li>How they are implemented and what limitations there are</li>
  <li>How can you use them in your own projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, let’s talk about typing!</p>


      <h2 id="simple-types">
        
        <a href="#simple-types">Simple types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Typing is layered. Like a good cake. There are at least three layers that we are going to cover.</p>

<p>Simple (or flat) typing, like <code>x: int = 1</code>. This allows us to express simple types and their transformations. Like <code>int -&gt; str</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A lot of languages like <code>go</code> and <code>php</code> do not go beyond this line. And they still work pretty well! These types are also sometimes called <code>*</code>-kinded. It can be understood as “a place for just a single type argument”.</p>


    
      <h2 id="generic">
        
        <a href="#generic">Generic</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Generic level is required to express “nested” types. For example, you have a list of integers. In Python we annotate it as <code>List[int]</code> or <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/"><code>list[int]</code></a> in Python <code>3.9</code>. This allows us to have types with other types as arguments. <code>List</code> can receive <code>int</code> or <code>str</code> or even another <code>List</code> as the type argument. This way we can nest type and types start to have their own structure.</p>

<p>Generics are much more interesting than simple types. And they can have multiple type arguments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>List has one: for values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>List -&gt; T = List[T]</code></li>
  <li>Dict has two: for keys and values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>Dict -&gt; K -&gt; V = Dict[K, V]</code></li>
  <li>And so on!</li>
</ul>

<p>This would be very helpful for us in the future, I promise.</p>

<p>We can also write transformations for generic types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_list_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, that is where things begin to be quite complicated.</p>

<p>How can this function work with other iterables like <code>set</code>, <code>frozenset</code>, <code>tuple</code>?
We can express this in Python as easy as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the typing part would be quite challenging. Let’s try several things.</p>


    
      <h3 id="common-interface">
        
        <a href="#common-interface">Common interface</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>The first obvious thing to try is <code>Iterable</code> protocol. It is builtin into Python and does what we need.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try it out:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>}))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that a part of our typing information is lost. We pass <code>List</code> or <code>Set</code> or <code>Tuple</code> and always get the <code>Iterable</code> back.</p>

<p>Sometimes - this is ok. But, in some cases, this is not enough. Let’s try some other technique!</p>


    
      <h3 id="methods">
        
        <a href="#methods">Methods</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>One can say: we are all using Object-Oriented Programming! Why cannot we just create a new method for each type we need? And specify the exact return type there!</p>

<p>Well, it is a possible solution. But, there are some reasonable problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot add methods to existing types and extend them with this approach. Only create new ones, probably via subtyping, and add new methods there. In our example you would have to create your own versions of <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, and <code>Tuple</code>. Which is not desirable in most situations</li>
  <li>It really it starts to be messy if you have a lot of methods to add. A type with more than <code>X</code> (choose the number yourself) methods starts to be really complex to read, understand, and use. Instead, using separate functions is much easier, because we don’t have to put everything into a single namespace</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try something else.</p>


    
      <h3 id="overloads">
        
        <a href="#overloads">overloads</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Another solution that might solve our problem is using the <code>@overload</code> decorator with proper types for each required case.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Set</span><span>,</span> <span>overload</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s test it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Awesome! Looks like we’ve achieved our goal, haven’t we? But, there’s a new problem. We have to manually list all possible cases in a function’s signature. This works for cases when all possible arguments and outcomes are known in advance. But, not in this case. In Python <code>Iterable</code> is a protocol. We can use this function with any type with <code>__iter__</code> method defined: with both builtin and custom types. So, the number of possible arguments and outcomes is endless.</p>

<p>To illusrate the problem, let’s see what happens for <code>Tuple</code> which is not listed in the function’s overloads:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># error: No overload variant of "stringify_iterable_items" matches argument type "Tuple[int, int, int]"
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We, in <code>dry-python</code> <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/blob/0.14.0/returns/_generated/converters/flatten.pyi">used this technique</a> with <code>@overload</code> decorator for our previous versions. This allowed us to write correct definitions of functions working with generic types. But, they were limited to the pre-defined set of our own types. And we wanted to allow our users to create their custom types based on our interfaces. With the full existing code reuse.</p>


    
      <h2 id="higher-kinded-types">
        
        <a href="#higher-kinded-types">Higher Kinded Types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>That’s where the idea of Higher Kinded Types becomes useful. We need HKTs when we want to change the inner structure of generics with full type information preserving and openness to the extension. In theory, you can write something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'T'</span><span>,</span> <span>bound</span><span>=</span><span>Iterable</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this would solve our problem! What happens here is that we abstract away the <code>Iterable</code> type itself. And then ask <code>mypy</code> to figure this out for us.</p>

<p>This way we can potentially have <code>stringify_iterable_items</code> working for any <code>Iterable</code> type, but with the exact same type returned back without any information lost. And it would work for all types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>MyCustomIterable</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'my_module.MyCustomIterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/python/typing/issues/548">it is not supported</a> at the moment.</p>


    
      <h3 id="emulation">
        
        <a href="#emulation">Emulation</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Turns out we are not alone in this situation. There are multiple languages where Higher Kinded Types are not natively supported yet. But, they can be emulated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/master/docs/guides/HKT.md">TypeScript</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bow-swift.io/docs/fp-concepts/higher-kinded-types/">Swift</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://arrow-kt.io/docs/0.10/patterns/glossary/#higher-kinds">Kotlin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And now with <a href="https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/hkt.html">Python</a> too!</p>

<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf">an original whitepaper</a> for ones who are interested.</p>

<p>The core idea of HKT emulation is that we can write types the other way around: not like <code>T[int]</code>, but rather like <code>Kind[T, int]</code> (which is absolutely the same thing).</p>

<p>This way we can transform the inner structure of generics, but maintain the simple context without reinventing <code>TypeVar</code> with type arguments. And our function’s type signature will look like: <code>Kind[T, int] -&gt; Kind[T, str]</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see the implementation.</p>


    
      <h2 id="implementation">
        
        <a href="#implementation">Implementation</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/sobolevn/7f8ffd885aec70e55dd47928a1fb3e61">the final working code</a> with all the logic, all the hacks, and everything. In this article, we going to write and explain it step by step.</p>

<p>We would need a better example to test our implementation. Let’s build two types: a <code>Box</code> and a <code>Bag</code>. <code>Box</code> is defined by its size, while a <code>Bag</code> is an item of fashion: it has a brand name and a model name (I have a wife, I know this stuff!).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>dataclasses</span> <span>import</span> <span>dataclass</span>
<span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>,</span> <span>TypeVar</span>

<span>_ValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_ValueType'</span><span>)</span>
<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>brand</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can create <code>Box</code>es and <code>Bag</code>s of different types, because we can put different things inside them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>box</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>  <span># Box[int]
</span><span>bag</span> <span>=</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>  <span># Bag[int]
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we need a function with a type transformation. Let’s say we want to apply a function to the value inside boxes and bags. Let’s use fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type for now to illustrate our intent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span>

<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span> <span>_NewValueType</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_NewValueType</span><span>]:</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is going to work like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>box</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>'10'</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>bag</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We only need to change current fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type to a real HKT. We would need to define a new <code>Kind</code> type to make the emulation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>_FirstTypeArgType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_FirstTypeArgType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Kind</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceType</span><span>,</span> <span>_FirstTypeArgType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>"""Used for HKT emulation."""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One pro-tip about <code>Kind</code>: it won’t not exist during runtime. Only during type-checking.</p>

<p>Now, let’s change <code>apply_function</code> to use <code>Kind</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceKind</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceKind'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>Kind</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceKind</span><span>,</span> <span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>
    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Calla…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

October 27, 2020 | https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently finished the MVP for an idea I had last month: <a href="https://essays.findka.com/" target="_blank">Findka Essays</a>, a newsletter that adapts to your preferences with machine learning. I pivoted to this from a much more complicated recommender system app, so I was already familiar with (almost) all the parts needed to build it. I'm extremely happy with the result: the new app is simple, the codebase is clean, and I launched it in under two weeks. In the grand tradition of our people, it is now time for an architecture + toolkit walkthrough. Feel free to skip to whichever sections interest you most. If you read only one section, I suggest <a href="https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/#recommendations">Recommendations</a>.</p><p>Note: I've abstracted a lot of the code into <a href="https://findka.com/biff">Biff</a>, a web framework I released several months ago. I'll reference Biff frequently.</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/#language">Language</a></li>
<li><a href="https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/#front-end">Front end</a></li>

</ul><hr><h3 id="language">Language</h3><p>The vast majority of the app is written in Clojure (the only exception is the actual recommendation algorithm, which is written in Python). Clojure is a fabulous language that has a strong emphasis on simplicity and stability, which makes codebases easy to maintain and extend in the long run. As a Lisp, it also has an extremely tight feedback loop which is great for rapid development.</p><p>There is a trade-off: since Clojure focuses on long-term concerns over short-term concerns, it can take a while to get up to speed (though it's a lot easier if you have a mentor). For example, to do web dev in Clojure, you'll need to learn how to piece together a bunch of individual libraries—there isn't a go-to framework like Rails or Django. (<a href="https://luminusweb.com/" target="_blank">Luminus</a> is probably the best starting point, after you're familiar with the language itself).</p><p>In most cases, I'd say the trade-off is well worth it. But for small or experimental apps (like you might build in a startup), speed at the beginning is extra valuable. If you want to move fast right away but you're not already comfortable in the Clojure ecosystem, you might have a bad time. One of my goals for Biff is to help mitigate that.</p><h3 id="front-end">Front end</h3><p>OK, now for some actual code. Findka Essays, unlike its predecessor, is a humble multi-page application. No React here. So the front end is pretty simple.</p><p>(For brevity, I'll call it "Findka" from here on out).</p><p>I use <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/rum" target="_blank">Rum</a> for HTML generation. Here's a quick example:</p><pre><code>(ns hello.world
 (:require
   [rum.core :as rum]))

(defn -main []
  (spit "hello.html"
    (rum/render-static-markup
      [:html
       [:body
        [:p {:style {:color "red"}}
         "Hello world!"]]])))
</code></pre><p>After <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started" target="_blank">installing Clojure</a>, you could put that in <code>src/hello/world.clj</code> and then run the program with <code>clj -Sdeps '{:deps {rum/rum {:mvn/version "0.11.5"}}}' -M -m hello.world</code>. That's a great way to get started with Clojure, actually—you can make a whole static site with just functions, data structures, and Rum. That's how I made Findka's landing page. Here's a snippet:</p><pre><code>(defn home []
  (base-page {:scripts [[:script {:src "/js/ensure-logged-out.js"}]]}
    [:.bg-dark.text-white
     [:.container.px-3.mx-auto.max-w-screen-md
      [:.nunito-sans-bold.text-2xl.mt-4.mb-8.sm:text-center
       "Great essays delivered to your inbox. " [:br.hidden.md:inline]
       "Chosen specifically for you with machine learning."]
      [:a.btn.btn-green.btn-block.sm:max-w-sm.mx-auto
       {:href "/signup"}
       "Sign up"]
      ...
</code></pre><p>This project is the first time I've used <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> (I used Bootstrap previously). I give it two thumbs up. Tailwind gives you smaller, better building blocks than Bootstrap, and it has responsive variants for every class (hallelujah). Setup was straightforward. After an <code>npm init; npm install tailwindcss --save-dev</code>, you just need a few files:</p><p><code>tailwind.config.js</code>:</p><pre><code>module.exports = {
  purge: [
    './src/**/*.clj', // for tree-shaking
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'dark': '#343a40',
        'hn-orange': '#ff6600',
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p><code>tailwind.css</code>:</p><pre><code>@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;
@responsive {
  .btn-thin {
    @apply text-center py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
  .btn {
    @apply btn-thin font-bold;
  }
  ...
}

@tailwind utilities;
@responsive {
  .nunito-sans-bold {
    font-family: 'Nunito Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight : 900;
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre><p>Build with <code>npx tailwindcss build tailwind.css -o output.css</code>.</p><p>The last piece is fonts. I am not a designer, at all. Despite this, I have recently made a startling discovery: using different fonts, instead of just the default, can actually make your site look a lot better. It turns out you can just doom scroll through <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> until you find some you like. I did that for Findka's logo (I tried AI logo generators in the past, but they weren't good).</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>Findka supports signin via email link or Google. Biff mostly handles email link auth for you.
Just make a form with an <code>email</code> field that POSTs to <code>/api/signup</code>. Biff sends the user an email with a link, they click on it, boom. You have to provide an email template and a function that actually sends the email. I use Mailgun, so Findka's email function looks like this:</p><pre><code>(def templates
  {:biff.auth/signup
   (fn [{:keys [biff.auth/link]}]
     {:from "Findka Essays &lt;...&gt;"
      :subject "Create your Findka Essays account"
      :html (rum/render-static-markup
              [:div
               [:p "We received a request to create a Findka Essays account using this email address."]
               [:p [:a {:href link :target "_blank"} "Click here to create your account."]]
               [:p "If you did not request this link, you can ignore this email."]])})
   ...})

(defn send** [api-key opts]
  (http/post (str "https://api.mailgun.net/v3/mail.findka.com/messages")
    {:basic-auth ["api" api-key]
     :form-params opts}))

(defn send* [{:keys [mailgun/api-key template data] :as opts}]
  (if (some? template)
    (let [template-fn (get templates template)
          mailgun-opts (template-fn data)]
      (send** api-key mailgun-opts))
    (send** api-key (select-keys opts [:to :subject :text :html]))))

(defn send [{:keys [params template recaptcha/secret-key] :as sys}]
  (if (= template :biff.auth/signup)
    (let [{:keys [success score]}
          (:body
            (http/post "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify"
              {:form-params {:secret secret-key
                             :response (:g-recaptcha-response params)}
               :as :json}))]
      (when (and success (&lt;= 0.5 score))
        (send* sys)))
    (send* sys)))
</code></pre><p>As shown at the end, I use Recaptcha for bot control. It's nice because you
don't have to make the user do anything; Google's script will simply give you a
score that represents how likely the user is to be a human.</p><p>Biff doesn't have Google sign-in support built in (yet), but it's pretty simple to add.
After the front-end bit is taken care of, you just have to add an HTTP endpoint that receives
a token, verifies it using Google's library, and sets a session cookie.</p><p>That's sort of a funny way to use Google sign-in, I'll admit. You're "supposed" to send the token
with every request and verify it each time, letting Google's code handle sessions on the client.
However, Biff is already set up for authenticating requests via session cookie, and that's more convenient for multi-page applications anyway.</p><h3 id="crud">CRUD</h3><p>I use <a href="https://opencrux.com/" target="_blank">Crux</a> for the database. Crux is an immutable document database with datalog queries. Another way to explain it is that Crux works well as a general-purpose database (e.g. a replacement for postgres), but it fits better with functional programming. You also get flexible data modeling without giving up query power.</p><p>(That ignores Crux's raison d'être, bitemporal queries—a cool feature, and no doubt extremely useful if you need those. For my simple applications, I haven't.)</p><p>Crux doesn't enforce any schema, but Biff does. You can specify schema using <a href="https://clojure.org/about/spec" target="_blank">Clojure spec</a>:</p><pre><code>(require '[trident.util :as u])

(u/sdefs
  ::event-type #{:submit :email :click :like :dislike}
  ::timestamp  inst?
  ::url        string?
  ::parent     uuid?
  ::user       uuid?
  ::event      (u/only-keys
                 :req-un [::event-type
                          ::timestamp
                          ::user
                          ::url]
                 :opt-un [::parent]))

(def schema
  {:events {:spec [uuid? ::event]}})
</code></pre><p>This schema defines a "table" for events. The <code>[uuid? ::event]</code> part means that
the primary key for an event document should be a UUID, and the rest of the
document should conform to the spec given for <code>::event</code> above. In this case,
that means the document must have an event type, timestamp, user ID and URL,
and it can optionally have a "parent" key (which is set to the primary key of
another event).</p><p>Like a standard multi-page app, Findka has POST endpoints for writing to
the database and GET endpoints for reading (though I have no idea if the
endpoints adhere to REST or not). Here's one for submitting an essay:</p><pre><code>(defn submit-essay [{:keys [biff/node session/uid params] :as sys}]
  (if (nil? uid)
    {:status 302
     :headers/Location "/login/"}
    (do
      (crux/await-tx node
        (biff.crux/submit-tx sys
          {[:events] {:user uid
                      :timestamp :db/current-time
                      :event-type :submit
                      :url (:url params)}}))
      {:status 302
       :headers/Location "/settings"})))

(def routes
  [["/api/submit-essay"
   {:post submit-essay
    :name ::submit-essay
    :middleware [anti-forgery/wrap-anti-forgery]}]
   ...])
</code></pre><p>And here's a snippet from the <code>/settings</code> page. The call to <code>crux/q</code> performs
a datalog query which returns the current user's 10 most recent events, which
are displayed in the UI:</p><pre><code>(defn settings* [{:keys [biff/db session/uid]}]
  (let [events (map first
                 (crux/q db
                   {:find '[event timestamp]
                    :full-results? true
                    :args [{'user uid}]
                    :order-by '[[timestamp :desc]]
                    :limit 10
                    :where '[[event :event-type]
                             …</code></pre></div></div>

  <p>Yesterday I <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mugshot-bot">launched Mugshot Bot on Product Hunt</a> as a solo founder. It was a wild ride and I’ve never been glued to my computer like this.</p>

<p>The launch finished with with over 250 upvotes, 39 comments, and #5 Product of the Day. It generated close to 1000 visits, over 70 sign ups, and 6 paying customers.</p>

<p>I even got a cute little badge from Product Hunt!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mugshot-bot?utm_source=badge-top-post-badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_souce=badge-mugshot-bot" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/top-post-badge.svg?post_id=271792&amp;theme=light&amp;period=daily" alt="Mugshot Bot - Automated link preview images for your website. | Product Hunt" width="250" height="54"></a></p>

<p>Here’s my journey on what worked, what didn’t work, and things I wish I spent more time on. I’m not guaranteeing following these will make your launch a success. But hopefully you can pick up a tip or two.</p>

<p>Oh, and for newcomers, <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/">Mugshot Bot</a> is a tool that automates link preview images for your website without design tools.</p>

<h2 id="what-worked">What worked</h2>

<p>The single biggest contributor to the success of this Product Hunt launch was the work done, well, before the launch.</p>

<h3 id="build-in-public">Build in public</h3>

<p>First, I’ve been building Mugshot Bot in public, sharing progress as it happens. Almost every day for the past two months I’ve tweeted about a new feature, an idea, design progress, or a question.</p>

<p>Anything worth elaborating on (but not quite long enough for a blog post) I’ve been posting to <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/joemasilotti">Indie Hackers</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve also been very active in the <a href="https://www.weekendclub.co/">Weekend Club</a> community on Slack. Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/charlierward">Charlie</a> for running an amazing community.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weekend Club is a weekend co-working community and a very supportive Slack group. Mention <code>WEEKENDJOE</code> when you sign up for a free month.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of my metrics are <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/stats/">publicly available</a>, too: total visitors, registered accounts, MRR, etc.</p>

<h3 id="get-early-upvotes">Get early upvotes</h3>

<p>You only get one day on Product Hunt, and those <a href="https://blog.producthunt.com/how-to-launch-on-product-hunt-7c1843e06399">24 hours are based on the Pacific time zone</a>. Ideally, you are launching early in the morning so you can maximize your time for upvotes.</p>

<p>I’m in Eastern time and didn’t want to get up at 3am to start promoting my post. Instead, I had someone in London help me out.</p>

<p>Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/jmckinven">James</a> for getting the ball rolling. He shared the post with other indie hackers and makers in his circle which bumped the post right from the get-go.</p>

<h3 id="live-tweet">Live tweet</h3>

<p>About five seconds after I woke up I <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">tweeted a link</a> to the Product Hunt post. I followed up on every milestone, every mishap, and every little victory.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">
  <img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshotbot-tweet-thread.png" alt="Beginning of Twitter thread about Product Hunt launch">
  </a>
</p>

<p>I also pinned the tweet to my profile and set my URL to the Product Hunt page for the day.</p>

<p>In total, the tweet received 7500 impressions and a whopping 500 engagements. I replied to <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">the thread</a> 20 times.</p>

<p>This was where people showed their excitement. If you click through the thread there’s a ton of people interacting with me, letting me know they upvoted, and just being generally awesome.</p>

<p>It was a highlight of the day for me to connect directly with people about Mugshot Bot on Twitter.</p>

<p>Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/panphora">David</a> for this idea and for providing a <em>ton</em> of feedback while building Mugshot Bot.</p>

<h3 id="be-genuine">Be genuine</h3>

<p>Product Hunt has a strict policy against asking for upvotes. Instead, they recommend asking folks to “check out the page.”</p>

<p>What worked well for me was being genuine. I wanted support from my audience so that’s what I asked for. “I would love if you could show me some support” seemed to resonate.</p>

<p>I also called out in my <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">initial tweet</a> that I was nervous. This was met with a lot of positive reinforcement from folks that went a long way towards ending the day feeling great.</p>

<h2 id="what-didnt-work">What didn’t work</h2>

<p>Not every second of my launch day was productive. Here are some things that I tried but didn’t seem to help very much.</p>

<h3 id="engaging-out-of-target-audiences">Engaging out-of-target audiences</h3>

<p>A big portion of my Twitter followers are indie makers, developers, and/or bloggers. Mugshot Bot helps content creators and hackers the most, so there’s a ton of overlap.</p>

<p>That isn’t the case for my Facebook audience. Most of these folks are friends from high school and college. I’ll also be the first to admit I don’t post on Facebook much anymore.</p>

<p>The takeaway is to pick the audience that matters and focus on that instead of spreading yourself too thin.</p>

<h3 id="email-campaign-asking-for-support">Email campaign asking for support</h3>

<p>This one surprised me the most. Before the launch I had about 100 registered accounts. I sent an email letting them know about the importance of the Product Hunt launch and asking for support.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, only 9 people clicked through the Product Hunt post. Here’s the email, if you’re interested.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/product-hunt-launch-email.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of email campaign announcing Product Hunt launch"></p>

<p>Looking back, I can’t tell if these folks didn’t care enough or my messaging was off. Probably a combination of the two!</p>

<h3 id="twitter-ads">Twitter ads</h3>

<p>As soon as I got my first new customer I set up a Twitter campaign for the same amount. I focused on getting clicks to the Product Hunt post and promoted the first post in the Twitter thread.</p>

<p>I cancelled the campaign after two hours.</p>

<p>In 2 hours I received 2 clicks. For $15. This might make sense for a direct acquisition channel, but $7.50 per click was nowhere near worth it for potential upvotes.</p>

<h3 id="obsessively-refresh-metrics">Obsessively refresh metrics</h3>

<p>In the spirit of building in public all of <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/stats/">Mugshot Bot’s metrics are publicly available</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/stats">
  <img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshotbot-stats.png" alt="Mugshot Bot public metrics">
  </a>
</p>

<p>I probably refreshed this page over 100 times throughout the day. Sure, there were a few dopamine hits when a number spiked. But overall, it was a waste of time.</p>

<p>Metrics are important but being glued to them is a dangerous habit.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-wish-id-also-done">What I wish I’d also done</h2>

<p>There’s only so many hours the day. But here are a few things that I wish I carved out some extra time for.</p>

<h3 id="post-to-indie-hackers">Post to Indie Hackers</h3>

<p>Early last week I posted to Indie Hackers documenting <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/my-prep-for-a-product-hunt-launch-on-monday-66f2757c1f">everything I did for seven days leading up to the launch</a>. It was really fun to update this throughout the week.</p>

<p>But for some reason I completely forgot to post on launch day! I think this could have strummed up a bit more excitement but nothing getting too upset over.</p>

<p>You could post in the <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/product-launch">Product Launch</a>  or <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/product-hunt">Product Hunt</a> groups, they both have about 150 members.</p>

<h3 id="fine-tune-a-welcome-e-mail">Fine-tune a welcome e-mail</h3>

<p>Late in the day I added a click-to-tweet link to the welcome email to people who have signed up for Mugshot Bot. A few people used it, too!</p>

<p>The link uses Twitter intents to automatically prompt a drafted tweet with populated content. I used <a href="https://tech.cymi.org/tweet-intents">Twitter Intent Creator</a> to generate the link.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I wish I added this earlier in the day to capitalize on some more reach.</p>

<h2 id="your-product-hunt-launch">Your Product Hunt launch</h2>

<p>That’s everything that I learned during my first big Product Hunt launch. I hope you picked up a tip or two for your launch!</p>

<p>My tl;dr is to build an audience before your launch. Without this you’ll be fighting an uphill battle.</p>

<p>If you used this post to help your launch I’d love to hear about it. <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1321129876938649600">Reply to this tweet</a> or <a href="mailto:joe@masilotti.com">send me an email</a> and we can talk shop.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I started learning Python in 2009, and I had a pretty challenging task and somewhat unusual use of Python. I was working on a desktop application that used PyQT for GUI and Python as the main language.</p><p>To hide the code, I embedded Python interpreter into a standalone Windows executable. There are a lot of solutions to do so (e.g. <a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">pyinstaller</a>, <a href="https://www.py2exe.org/">pyexe</a>), and they all work similarly. They compile your Python scripts to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode">bytecode</a> files and bundle them with an interpreter into an executable. Compiling scripts down to bytecode makes it harder for people with bad intentions to get the source code and crack or hack your software. Bytecode has to be extracted from the executable and decompiled. It can also produce obfuscated code that is much harder to understand.</p><p><img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/code_isolation.svg"></p><p>At one point, I wanted to add a plugin system so that users could benefit from extra features. Executing arbitrary third-party code on your server is dangerous. But can it harm your commercial product when you execute it on user's machines, and users have trust in that they are executing? At that time, the answer was not obvious, and I decided to implement the system.</p><p>A few years later, it became apparent that you should <strong>never</strong> execute third-party code using the same Python process (interpreter) if you don't want to leak the source code. There are a lot of commercial products that use Python for desktop software or as a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/AppsWithPythonScripting">scripting language</a>. Some of them can be at risk.</p><p>There are many ways to extract Python bytecode even if you don't run any third-party code. It's a never-ending arms race between developers and reverse engineers, but it's much easier to extract the bytecode and crack your program when you can run your own code. My software was later cracked without using the plugins subsystem.</p><p>So what can you do to the "host" code when it executes your scripts?</p><p>Python is a very dynamic language, and you can do a lot of things. This article demonstrates a few approaches on how to modify or extract the source code.</p><blockquote><p>When you work with a regular Python process, you don't even need a plugins system. You can always <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/DebuggingWithGdb">attach to a running</a> process using GDB and inject your own code.</p></blockquote><h2>Monkey patching</h2><p>If a plugin can be initialized before a function that you want to modify, we can simply mock it.</p><p>Let's suppose we have a function that validates license:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>validate_license</span><span>():</span>

For example, the path to callback can be defined in the settings file.</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>get_amount</span><span>():</span>

</code></pre></div><h4>Fast locals</h4><p>In Python, local and global variables are stored in dictionaries. Every time you use a variable, Python needs to lookup it in a dictionary. Since dictionary lookups are not free and take time, Python uses various optimization techniques.</p><p>By analyzing the code of a function, it's possible to detect variable names that a function will be using when running. Our function has three local variables: <code>amount</code>, <code>user</code>, <code>logger</code>. Function arguments are local variables too.</p><p>When compiling source code to bytecode, Python maps known variable names to indexes in a special array and stores them there. Accessing a variable by an index is fast, and most of the functions use predefined names. Optimized variables are called <code>fast locals</code>. To keep variable names that are generated on the go, Python uses a dictionary as a fallback.</p><p>When dereferencing variables, Python prioritizes fast locals and ignores changes in the dictionary. That's why we use <code>ctypes</code> and call internal <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/cb9879b948a19c9434316f8ab6aba9c4601a8173/Objects/frameobject.c#L1148"><code>PyFrame_LocalsToFast</code></a> function.</p><h2>Patching bytecode</h2><p>I have an article on <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/python-bytecode-patch/">bytecode patching</a> that describes how to patch function definition. We can go even further and patch a running function.</p><p>Instead of source code, Python interpreter executes bytecode that was generated using a special compiler. When executing the code, a special virtual machine executes each instruction one by one. That allows us to replace unexecuted instructions on the go.</p><p>Let's use this function as an example:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>is_valid</span><span>():</span>

Unfortunately, we can't modify the <code>frame.f_code.co_code</code> attribute since it's a read-only attribute.</p><p>To bypass this restriction, we use <code>ctypes</code> module that allows us to modify the RAM of a Python process. Every <code>bytes</code> object contains meta-information, such as <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/python-garbage-collector/">number of references</a> and information about the type. To locate the exact address of the raw C string, we use the <code>id</code> function that returns object address in memory, and we skip all meta information (size of the empty byte string). The output from <code>dis.dis</code> shows that the <code>POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE</code> instruction is the 10th element in the byte string that we need to replace.</p><h2>Extracting the source code</h2><p>Every script that Python runs or imports creates a <code>module</code> object that stores constants, functions, class definitions, and so on. If you don't have source code, you can get it back by decompiling the bytecode.</p><p>Here is how you can iterate over all modules and find all available functions:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>for</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>module</span> <span>in</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>.</span><span>items</span><span>()):</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Fortunately (or unfortunately for some people), there is no easy way to extract the bytecode of a whole module if you don't have a <code>pyc</code> (bytecode cache) file. If you want to get the source code from a running Python process, you will need to extract the bytecode of each function, class, and module definitions as well as from some frame objects. After that, you will need to run it through one of the <a href="https://github.com/rocky/python-decompile3">decompilers</a>.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>This article is a part of <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/tags/cpython/">CPython internals</a> series. It's hard to find a practical application to these techniques, but such language details are useful for people who perform security research or participate in CTF competitions. My previous articles on bytecode have helped people to get extra points in security competitions.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>OberonScript</h2>
<p>Oberon Script is a scripting language and runtime system for building interactive Web Client applications. It consists of a compiler that translates the full Oberon language into JavaScript code, and a small runtime system that detects and compiles at load-time script sections written in Oberon Script.</p>
<p>It is a complete re-implementation from scratch of an earlier compiler that I built
while being with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a>
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. For legal reasons I was unable to take the code with me
but I cleared the code by MSR's legal department for publication via <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/default.aspx">Microsoft Research's code posting tool</a>.
However, I left MSR before completing the process, hence the complete rewrite.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>The code of the compiler is available in its current, far from final version in source code (obviously...) for personal,
non-commercial and non-governmental use. The usual disclaimers apply.</p>
<p>A very minimal documentation is also available. I may merge it some time with the prettyprinted HTML version below.</p>

			<p>Administrators can use teams policies for controlling what users can do in Microsoft Teams.</p>

<p>In this blog, I’ll show that these policies are applied only in client and thus can be easily bypassed.</p>





<p>Policies are used in Microsoft Office 365 and Azure AD for securing access to services and data. Besides the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">common identity and device access policies</a>,
Microsoft has provided a set of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/teams-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">Teams specific policies</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Teams and channel policies</li>
<li>Messaging policies</li>
<li>Meeting policies</li>
<li>App permission policies</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, administrators can configure Teams so that external users are not able to edit or delete any messages they’ve sent. Or, an owner of a Teams site can disable message editing for members of a certain channel.</p>



<h2 id="initial-discovery">Initial discovery</h2>

<p>While I was working with the previous version (v0.4.4) of <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals" target="_blank">AADInternals</a> Teams functions I noticed an interesting thing: I was able to edit and delete chat messages using AADInternals as a guest
even when it was not allowed.</p>

<p>This led to a question that <strong>what if the policies are applied only at the client end?</strong> In practice this would mean that the Teams service tells to your Teams client that “Though shall not edit messages!” but the client
could still do so.</p>

<h2 id="observing-teams-client-behaviour">Observing Teams client behaviour</h2>

<p>I started by watching what was going on between the client and cloud when the Teams client started. The first observation was that the client made about 120 http requests to the cloud.
While browsing through those requests, I spotted one that caught my interest (headers stripped):</p>

<pre><code>POST https://teams.microsoft.com/api/mt/part/emea-02/beta/users/useraggregatesettings HTTP/1.1

{
    "tenantSettingsV2": true,
    "userResourcesSettings": true,
    "messagingPolicy": true,
    "clientSettings": true,
    "targetingPolicy": true,
    "tenantSiteUrl": true,
    "userPropertiesSettings": true,
    "callingPolicy": true,
    "meetingPolicy": true,
    "educationAssignmentsAppPolicy": true
}
</code></pre>

<p>The response contained all the settings and policies the Teams client is allowed to do as the logged in user. Below can be seen the <strong>messagingPolicy</strong> section:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span></span><span>"messagingPolicy"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>"value"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>"allowUserEditMessage"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUserDeleteMessage"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUserChat"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowGiphy"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"giphyRatingType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Moderate"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowGiphyDisplay"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowPasteInternetImage"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowMemes"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowStickers"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUserTranslation"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUrlPreviews"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"readReceiptsEnabledType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"UserPreference"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowImmersiveReader"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowPriorityMessages"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"audioMessageEnabledType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"ChatsAndChannels"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"channelsInChatListEnabledType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"DisabledUserOverride"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowRemoveUser"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowSmartReply"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>What we can learn here is that the Teams client asks from the cloud what the current user is allowed to do, which was the expected behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="testing-in-action">Testing in action</h2>

<p>Next I decided to try whether I could lie to Teams client:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I saved the response from above to be used as a baseline.</p></li>

<li><div><p>I created a new Messaging policy to disable editing and deleting of sent messages.</p><p>
I applied the policy to a single demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies1.png" alt="Custom policy"></p><p>Now I had two policies, the default organisation wide and the restricted one for demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies2.png" alt="Policies"></p></div></li>

<li><p>I restarted the Teams client and noticed that the editing and deleting were correctly disabled (didn’t exists).</p></li>

<li><div><p>I compared the returned policies from the <strong>useraggregatesettings</strong> requests<br>
and as we can see, the request was missing two lines:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies3.png" alt="Policy comparison"></p></div></li>

<li><div><p>I closed the client and configured Fiddler to do an autoresponse using the saved http response from above:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies4.png" alt="Fiddler autoresponse"></p><p>
Now, when the client is requesting the settings file, it will be served the one that allows editing and deleting.</p></div></li>

<li><p>I started the Teams client and <strong>the editing and deleting were again allowed</strong> and I was able to edit and delete (my own) messages!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What we can lean here is that <strong>we can lie to Teams client</strong> and change its behaviour 😂 <br>
Moreover, we learnt that <strong>Teams policies are applied only on the client</strong> 🤦‍♂</p>

<p>Here is the video demonstrating this with <strong>AADInternals</strong> and <strong>Fiddler</strong> (sorry for the bad audio after 03:20):</p>

<div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zcqig-OyUMY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>Below is a video that shows in action that this works also with <strong>cloud file storage restrictions</strong>:<br></p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a32TkLIBwS4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<br><strong>Note:</strong> Although not seen on the video, I was able to add my Google Drive account to Teams so this is not just a UI thing.</p>



<p>As far as I know, the “uncompliant” Teams client behaviour can not be detected.</p>

<p>Same verdict with protecting. Well, one could try to use Conditional Access (CA) with device ownership and compliance restrictions, but that doesn’t cover all scenarios.</p>



<p>Our little test here proves that <strong>Teams policies are applied ONLY on the client!</strong>.</p>

<p>If the user (or guest) is utilising Teams APIs directly, using for instance AADInternals <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals/#teams-functions" target="_blank">Teams functionality</a>, he or she can bypass the restrictions set by the policies.
However, this is not a bug or vulnerability as such, but a (very very bad) design choice by Microsoft.</p>

<p>Users can do at least the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bypass messaging policies</li>
<li>Bypass cloud file storage restrictions</li>
<li>Bypass meetings policies</li>
</ul>

<p>⚠️ <strong>Teams policies are NOT a security measure and organisations should not rely on them!</strong> ⚠️</p>

Virtual bands, virtual YouTubers, and virtual streamers are all the same concept; the people creating and performing are not the focus. CGI characters are replacing humans, even outside of animation.&nbsp;</p><p>Virtual performers are not new. Alvin and the Chipmunks are the earliest example. Other notable Western examples include Dethklok and Crazy Frog.</p><p>Japan and the East, unsurprisingly, love virtual performers. Hatsune Miku is one of the most popular. She has widely attended live concerts. K/DA is a virtual K-pop group composed of characters from Riot’s League of Legends that has also seen enormous global success.</p><p id="youtube2-YSyWtESoeOc" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;YSyWtESoeOc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YSyWtESoeOc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><p>Virtual streaming was really kicked off in 2016 by Kizuna AI. Kizuna plays video games just like other streamers, but she is entirely virtual. Body movements are likely motion captured or pre animated. Her voice is a paid actress. She embodies many cutesy anime girl tropes.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, streaming was dominated by young men on Twitch in the West, which didn’t appeal to Eastern audiences. Japan was already primed because of their penchant for virtual idols. Kizuna likely uses the same freeware, MikuMikuDance, as Hatsune Miku.</p><p id="youtube2-3AK24prZk-k" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;3AK24prZk-k&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3AK24prZk-k?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><div><p>The Japanese popularity of virtual streamers has influenced a new generation of Twitch streamers. Streamers like projektmelody (NSFW) and BuffPup do well in their niches. The vast majority of virtual streamers follow the trail blazed by virtual idols and Kizuna AI. Typically they are young female anime avatars that speak Japanese.</p><p>BuffPup stands out. BuffPup is one of the earliest virtual streamers to branch out from its anime roots into furry fandom. I’ll let you look that one up if you’re unfamiliar. Virtual streaming is clearly still in its infancy. Expressiveness of many virtual streamers is lacking, which leaves a huge opportunity for the right tech to push the medium forward. Many fall into uncanny valley territory.</p></div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488692c5-d040-43fb-b228-79189c0dfe9e_1080x888.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488692c5-d040-43fb-b228-79189c0dfe9e_1080x888.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/488692c5-d040-43fb-b228-79189c0dfe9e_1080x888.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:888,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:112162,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><div><p>Since Riot is already getting their feet wet with virtual performers, I expect this trend to continue in the industry. Every major publisher will have a virtual version of their characters playing their games, streamed live. Publishers will pay actors to do motion / facial capture as well as live voice. Fans will finally be able to interact directly with their favorite video game characters. This market alone will be enormously profitable, since it can leverage existing live streaming monetization techniques.</p><p>Gaming companies will double down into motion capture and face filter-like technologies. They’ll branch into AI generated voice tech, or acquire it. Once the tech gets there, virtual streaming will be an extremely high margin business, because even the talent will be fully automated. At least in the short and medium term, this will mean more jobs for actors, so that’s a plus.</p></div><p>Stats:</p><ul><li><p>K/DA has over 384 million views on this video</p></li></ul><p id="youtube2-UOxkGD8qRB4" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;UOxkGD8qRB4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UOxkGD8qRB4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><ul><li><p>Kizuna AI has over 2.8 million subscribers on Youtube and videos with over 14 million views</p></li><li><p>projektmelody (NSFW) has 289,000 followers on Twitch, and routinely has 3,500+ concurrent viewers</p></li><li><p>64+ virtual streamers on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/team/antilewdarmy)</p></li></ul></div></div>]]>

To understand some unusual scenarios from the 538 model, like every state <a href="https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/1300480869082292225">voting for Biden but New Jersey</a>, Andrew Gelman <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/24/reverse-engineering-the-problematic-tail-behavior-of-the-fivethirtyeight-presidential-election-forecast/">examined the correlation</a> in the Trump vote share between pairs of several states. </p>
<p>I was curious what the whole universe of pairwise correlations looked like; you can click on a grid cell below to see voting patterns in two states in more detail along with the electoral maps from individual simulation scenarios. In the 538 model, 242 pairs of states are <span>negatively correlated</span>!</p>


<p>Mousing around the edges of the scatter plot pulls out more unusual scenarios, like Trump losing everywhere but <code>CA-HI-VT</code>. </p>
<p>On the correlation matrices, it appears that both models have identified similar groups of states. A scatter plot shows this directly: </p>


<p>Outside of the <code>CA-DC-VT-WA</code> and <code>LA-MS-ND-KY</code> clusters, where the 538 correlation dips below 0, the models are mostly aligned. Glancing over the outliers, it looks like the Economist might not have an equivalent to 538’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/">regional regression</a> that groups states in the same geographic region together; the Economist has <code>HI</code> at 0.2 correlation with <code>WA</code> &amp; <code>OR</code>  while 538 has it around 0.7.</p>
<p>Stepping back from the funky correlation charts, comparing the Trump vote share state by state clearly shows a bigger difference between the models: the <span>Economist model</span> considers really surprising outcomes, like Trump decisively winning <code>CA</code>, less likely than the <span>538 model</span>.</p>


<p>I haven’t followed the extensive discussion around election modeling closely enough to have a strong opinion on what all of this means, but it does look like the 538 model is allowing for the <a href="https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1320043524771991560">possibility</a> of a broad <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1300825856072454145">realignment in politics</a>–something you’d want to incorporate when modeling 2024 today, but not plausible for an election next week with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/absentee-ballot-early-voting.html">sixty million ballots</a> already cast.</p>
<div id="notes">
<p>Only 5,000 scenarios are shown on the scatter plots; the scenarios are a snapshot from 2020-10-25 and not updated (looking at the correlations over time might be interesting though!). The rendered electoral college scenarios ignore the possibility of <code>NE</code> or <code>ME</code> spliting their votes. 

</p><p>The correlations matrix orders states by clustering on 538’s correlations. Sorting using the Economist correlations <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JH9FC8I.png">splits up</a> the negative 538 correlations.

<div><h2 id="The-Virtues-of-Prototyping">The Virtues of Prototyping<a href="#The-Virtues-of-Prototyping">¶</a></h2><p>One neat thing about prototyping (with Python or whatever) is that it allows you to fully focus on your <em>approach</em>, rather than on the infrastructure. Very obviously, this is useful for <em>teaching</em> – you can use examples as the ones above in a lecture to very quickly communicate essential techniques of program analysis and test generation.</p>
<p>But prototyping has more advantages. A Jupyter Notebook (like this one) documents how you developed your approach, together with examples, experiments, and rationales – and still focusing on the essentials. If you write a tool the "classical" way, you will eventually deliver thousands of lines of code that do everything under the sun, but only once you have implemented everything will you know whether things actually work. This is a huge risk, and if you still have to change things, you will have to refactor things again and again. Furthermore, for anyone who will work on that code later, it will take days, if not weeks, to re-extract the basic idea of the approach, as it will be buried under loads and loads of infrastructure and refactorings.</p>
<p>Our consequence at this point is that we now implement new ideas <em>twice</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, we implement things as a notebook (as this one), experimenting with various approaches and parameters until we get them right.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only once we have the approach right, and if we have confidence that it works, we reimplement it in a tool that works on large scale programs. This can still take weeks to months, but at least we know we are on a good path.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Incidentally, it may well be that the original notebooks will have a longer life, as they are simpler, better documented, and capture the gist of our novel idea. And this is how several of the notebooks in this book came to be.</p>

            <p>Prior research has shown that physical activity can prevent unhealth as well as improve the prognosis of several diseases including various forms of cancer. Exactly how exercise exerts its protective effects against cancer is, however, still unknown, especially when it comes to the biological mechanisms. One plausible explanation is that physical activity activates the immune system and thereby bolsters the body’s ability to prevent and inhibit cancer growth.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet expanded on this hypothesis by examining how the immune system’s cytotoxic T cells, that is white blood cells specialized in killing cancer cells, respond to exercise.</p>

<h2>Cancer growth slowed in trained animals</h2>

<p>They divided mice with cancer into two groups and let one group exercise regularly in a spinning wheel while the other remained inactive. The result showed that cancer growth slowed and mortality decreased in the trained animals compared with the untrained.</p>

<p>Next, the researchers examined the importance of cytotoxic T cells by injecting antibodies that remove these T cells in both trained and untrained mice. The antibodies knocked out the positive effect of exercise on both cancer growth and survival, which according to the researchers demonstrates the significance of these T cells for exercise-induced suppression of cancer.</p>

<p>The researchers also transferred cytotoxic T cells from trained to untrained mice with tumors, which improved their prospects compared with those who got cells from untrained animals.</p>

<h2>Exercise altered T cell metabolism</h2>

<p>To examine how exercise influenced cancer growth, the researchers isolated T cells, blood and tissue samples after a training sessions and measured levels of common metabolites that are produced in muscle and excreted into plasma at high levels during exertion. Some of these metabolites, such as lactate, altered the metabolism of the T cells and increased their activity. The researchers also found that T cells isolated from an exercised animal showed an altered metabolism compared to T cells from resting animals.</p>

<p>In addition, the researchers examined how these metabolites change in response to exercise in humans. They took blood samples from eight healthy men after 30 minutes of intense cycling and noticed that the same training-induced metabolites were released in humans.</p>

<p>“Our research shows that exercise affects the production of several molecules and metabolites that activate cancer-fighting immune cells and thereby inhibit cancer growth,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/helame">Helene Rundqvist</a>, senior researcher at the <a href="https://ki.se/en/labmed/department-of-laboratory-medicine">Department of Laboratory Medicine</a>, Karolinska Institutet, and the study’s first author. “We hope these results may contribute to a deeper understanding of how our lifestyle impacts our immune system and inform the development of new immunotherapies against cancer.”</p>

<p>The researchers have received financing from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine, Cancer Research UK and the Wellcome Trust.</p>

        <h2>Make better decisions.</h2>
      </p>
      <p>A decision journal is a simple, yet effective tool. It helps us to avoid hindsight bias, recognize patterns of mistakes in our decision making, and provide accurate and honest feedback on the decisions we make.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with what a decision journal is, it is the simple idea of keeping track of your decisions by writing them down for the purpose of reviewing it in the future. The Nobel Prize winner and famous psychologist <a href="https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/" target="_blank">Daniel Kahneman introduced the basic concept of a decision journal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Go down to a local drugstore and buy a very cheap notebook and start keeping track of your decisions. And the specific idea is whenever you’re making a consequential decision, something going in or out of the portfolio, just take a moment to think, write down what you expect to happen, why you expect it to happen and then actually, and this is optional, but probably a great idea, is write down how you feel about the situation, both physically and even emotionally. Just, how do you feel? I feel tired. I feel good, or this stock is really draining me. Whatever you think.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, Kahneman said, helps us avoid hindisight bias. The bias where everyone tends to look back on their own past in a favorable light. It’s the tendency people have of attributing their success to their own skills and talent but their failures to bad luck.</p>

<p>By keeping a decision journal, we avoid this bias by writing down exactly how we feel in the moment of making the decision. That way our future self can’t create a false narrative. We’re forced to be honest with ourselves.</p>

<p>Many decision makers in all walks of life use decision journals to help them improve their decision making capabilities. The problem is they can be challenging to maintain and keep track of. They require you to always remember to write down the decisions you want to keep track of and to go back and review them periodically. This causes many people to stop using them or to use them sub-optimally.</p>

<p>What if there was a more convenient way to use a decision journal?</p>

<p>Now there is, introducing Decision Journal, now available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/decision-journal/id1534768141" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterthinkingsoftware.decisionjournal" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p>

<p>With Decision Journal, we tried to take all of the awesome benefits decision journals offer and augment them with modern technology and software. Let’s go over some of the app’s key features.</p>

<h4 id="always-with-you">Always with you</h4>

<p>One of the challenges in keeping a good decision journal is making sure that you remember to write down the important decisions you want to keep track of. Not only that but the whole point of a decision journal is so that you can later recall exactly what you were thinking and feeling at the time of the decision. The challenge is that we don’t remember everything and the longer you go without writing down your thoughts, the more likely what you write down will be inaccurate.</p>

<p>That’s one of the great benefits of using the Decision Journal app as your decision journal. It’s always with you. Whenever you make a decision or begin thinking about making a particular decision, you can pull your phone out of your pocket and jot it down. Plus, given that it is on your phone, we’ll sync it to the cloud every time you save it so that you can keep track of your decisions on your own time, whenever is most convenient for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://decisionjournalapp.com/assets/img/screens/welcome-image.light.ios.png" height="350">
</p>

<h4 id="scheduled-reviews">Scheduled reviews</h4>

<p>Another important part of keeping a decision journal is so that you can accurately and honestly evaluate your decisions. However, one of the challenges is in remembering to do so in a timely manner.</p>

<p>We’re probably all too familiar with setting out our New Year’s resolutions at the beginning of each year, only to never follow up and review them. Why? Because life happens and we lose track of things. We’re human.</p>

<p>But that’s where technology can come in and assist us. With the Decision Journal app, we’ve made it super simple to mark a particular decision for a review at some point in the future. And you don’t have to remember to follow up, the app will do all of that for you. When it’s time to review a particular decision, the app will send you a notification letting you know that a particular decision is up for review.</p>

<p>And we didn’t just stop there. Sometimes you make decisions where the outcome of that decision can take place over long periods of time. That’s why we made it easy for you to schedule multiple reviews for any decision.</p>

<p><img src="https://decisionjournalapp.com/assets/img/screens/schedule-review.light.ios.png" height="350">
</p>

<h4 id="analyze-the-results">Analyze the results</h4>

<p>The whole point in keeping a decision journal in the first place is to try and improve on our decision making ability. That means picking up on patterns of errors and mistakes that we may be making.</p>

<p>With a paper and pen journal, this can be quite challenging. We may be able to remember the most frequent patterns of errors that we make but we might also miss a lot due to information overload.</p>

<p>This is another area where modern technology and software can help us. With the Decision Journal app, you can tag every decision you make to easily find trends and patterns in any particular category of decisions. In addition to tags, we’ve also added a powerful search capability that allows you to find decisions in a flash, so that you can be sure you’re not missing anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://decisionjournalapp.com/assets/img/screens/analyze-results.light.ios.png" height="350">
</p>

<h4 id="make-better-decisions-today">Make better decisions today</h4>

<p>Decision journals are such a powerful and effective tool for helping you make better decisions. Everyone should be using them. The problem is, they can also be a challenge and a burden to keep. That’s why we created the Decision Journal app for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/decision-journal/id1534768141" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterthinkingsoftware.decisionjournal" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p>

<p>It takes the powerful concept of a decision journal and expands on it with new capabilities made possible through modern technology and software. We think it is an essential tool for any decision maker out there, but don’t just take our word for it, give it a try today:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During the last 10 years, Node.js has become a big player in the backend framework market, powering several large scale applications across the globe. Meanwhile, JavaScript has also evolved greatly, not only because of the efforts of its development team, but also based on community feedback. However, integrating some of these new language features into a 10-year-old framework is not really straightforward, and has a high level of complexity.</p>
<p>Therefore we could say that Node.js’ architecture hasn’t evolved as fast as the language. As a basic example, Node.js is still based on callbacks, while there are far better ways to deal with asynchronicity in modern JavaScript. This is something that its creator, Ryan Dahl, has acknowledged in the past few years, and it has moved him to work on a new framework that addresses some of these issues. It is called Deno, and in the following article, we would like to explore some of its concepts to determine if it will render Node.js obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-deno">What is Deno?</h2>
<p>First of all, you should know that Deno is not a fork of Node.js. It’s a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, implemented from scratch by Ryan Dahl in 2018. It was built on <a href="https://v8.dev/">V8</a> just like Node.js, but Deno was written with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a>. The runtime was designed with TypeScript in mind, and for that reason Deno supports TypeScript without extra configurations or tooling.</p>
<p>Deno was built to improve security and help increase productivity in developers using the latest JavaScript features. At the time this article was written, Deno’s version is 1.4.0. It’s a stable release, so it’s a good time to go over its main features and learn how you can use them for your application.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<h3 id="typescript-out-of-the-box">TypeScript out of the box:</h3>
<p>TypeScript is powerful. This superset of JavaScript allows us to use types, interfaces, classes, inheritance, modules, generics, and other awesome things. However, it can be a bit tricky when using it with Node.js, because we need to install a module for TypeScript support and some tools to transpile the code. It also requires some additional configurations through tsconfig.json. However, after all of this setup, the JavaScript files that get compiled from TypeScript work pretty well with Node.js.</p>
<p>Deno offers native support for TypeScript at its 3.9 version. For it to run nothing else needs to be installed, and no compilation step is needed since Deno transpiles the code behind the scenes. It is also possible to run the code with a custom <code>tsconfig.json</code> file to customize how Deno compiles your code.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span># Using a custom tsconfig.json file</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span>deno</span> run -c tsconfig.json my-application.ts</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="url-imports">URL imports:</h3>
<p>Node.js projects have a <code>package.json</code> file that contains relevant information for your project. It also holds the dependency list that you’ll be using. Deno handles this part in a completely different way. The <code>package.json</code> file is not used anymore in favor of <code>ES Modules</code>. In order to use modules in a Deno project, you will need to reference each module with its URL or file path.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a># Import <span>module</span> <span>server</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>import</span> <span>{</span>serve<span>}</span> <span>from</span> “https<span>:</span><span>//deno.land/std/http/server.ts”</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When the application is executed for the first time, Deno downloads and caches all modules in a global cache. It is possible to store them in a custom directory using the <code>$DENO_DIR</code> environment variable. With this approach, Deno decentralizes the modules and your project will not have a large <code>node_modules</code> folder.</p>
<p>To keep module versions locked, it is possible to create a lock file with the <code>--lock</code> and <code>--lock-write</code> flags.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span># Create/update the lock file "lock.json"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span>deno</span> cache --lock=lock.json --lock-write src/my-application.ts</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="secure-by-default">Secure by Default:</h3>
<p>Deno has some security measures in place to disallow potentially dangerous operations. By default, the code is executed in a secure sandbox, so it is not possible to access the network, file system, or environment unless you explicitly allow it. You can do this by adding flags when running the application. These are enabled by default in Node.js, which makes it insecure in some cases.</p>
<p>As a quick overview of what can be enabled we have the following flags:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span># Enable environment access with Deno.env.get</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-env my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>#Enable high resolution time measurement (used for profiling)</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-hrtime my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a><span>#Enable network access</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a><span># This is used in cases where we want to fetch from external servers</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span># or when we want to expose a port from our server</span></span>
<span id="cb4-10"><a href="#cb4-10"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-net=https://example.com my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-11"><a href="#cb4-11"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-12"><a href="#cb4-12"></a><span># Enable plugin usage</span></span>
<span id="cb4-13"><a href="#cb4-13"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-plugin my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-14"><a href="#cb4-14"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-15"><a href="#cb4-15"></a><span># Enable filesystem access</span></span>
<span id="cb4-16"><a href="#cb4-16"></a><span># To read a file or directory with Deno.open, or write to a file</span></span>
<span id="cb4-17"><a href="#cb4-17"></a><span># or  directory with Deno.writeFile</span></span>
<span id="cb4-18"><a href="#cb4-18"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-read=awesome.txt my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-19"><a href="#cb4-19"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-write=awesome.txt my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-20"><a href="#cb4-20"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-21"><a href="#cb4-21"></a><span># Enable subprocess execution with Deno.run</span></span>
<span id="cb4-22"><a href="#cb4-22"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-run my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-23"><a href="#cb4-23"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-24"><a href="#cb4-24"></a><span># Disable all security checks</span></span>
<span id="cb4-25"><a href="#cb4-25"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-all my-application.ts</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="built-in-utilities">Built-in utilities:</h3>
<p>In Deno, we have some nice tools available out of the box. This means that we don’t need to install any additional libraries for some common development tasks. At a glance, these utilities are:</p>
<p><strong>Debugger:</strong> Like Node, Deno supports the V8 Inspector Protocol, which means that it’s possible to debug the program in any client that supports it. This consists mainly of two commands:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span># Debugging flags</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>#   --inspect      : Allows debugger attachment at any point</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a><span>#   --inspect-brk  : Pause execution on first line</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span># Usage:</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a><span>deno</span> run --inspect-brk</span></code></pre></div>
<p>From this point, all you have to do is open your client and the program will stop on the first line, allowing you to set up breakpoints where you need to. For VSCode you can add the entry point and arguments to your <code>launch.json</code> to enable it.</p>
<p><strong>Formatter:</strong> In Node.js applications, it’s common to add a linter tool (typically ESLint) with a formatter like Prettier so the code is standardized. Deno has this feature built into it. You can access it by simply running <code>deno fmt</code></p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>deno</span> fmt          <span>#Formats everything in the current tree</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>deno</span> fmt file1.ts <span>#Formats a single file</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a><span>deno</span> fmt --check  <span># Checks if files are formatted correctly</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bundler:</strong> Bundling is a task that is currently done with webpack, gulp or Grunt in Node.js applications. We can use Deno’s bundler when we want to pack a module together with its dependencies and this will generate a single module we can reference from other files. These bundles can also be loaded in the web browser.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>deno</span> bundle https://foo.bar/test.ts test.bundle.js</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After that, we can import it from another JavaScript file or using a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in our HTML with the <code>type=”module”</code> property.</p>
<p><strong>Dependency inspector:</strong> We can display a tree structure of our dependencies using the <code>deno info</code> command, followed by the URL we want to inspect. This is similar to <code>npm ls</code> in Node</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>deno</span> info https://deno.land/std/uuid/test.ts</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a><span>local</span>: /Users/foo/Library/Caches/deno/deps/https/deno.land/997789467b3621b5d93c6b18bf8b275f35057b24f934c2508e3d1ef52cd51644</span>

<span id="cb8-16"><a href="#cb8-16"></a>  <span>.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="asynchronous-handling">Asynchronous handling:</h3>
<p>JavaScript asynchronous operations have evolved over time. The standard way of making an asynchronous call was through the use of callbacks. Recently we’ve gotten better ways to handle these operations, by using Promises, async/await syntax or generators. For that reason, Deno has taken advantage of these modern features.</p>
<p>All async actions in Deno return a promise. This is interesting because the <code>await</code> keyword is supported on the top level and there is no need to define the function with the <code>async</code> keyword. This approach allows us to write more readable code when working with asynchronism.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>// Await some asynchronous operation</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span>let</span> file <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>open</span>(<span>'./my-file.txt'</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a><span>// Awaiting when starting the server</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a><span>import</span> <span>{</span> serve <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a><span>const</span> server <span>=</span> <span>serve</span>(<span>{</span> port<span>:</span> <span>3000</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><a href="#cb9-9"></a><span>for</span> <span>await</span> (<span>const</span> req <span>of</span> server)<span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-10"><a href="#cb9-10"></a>  <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>respond</span>(<span>{</span> body<span>:</span> <span>'Running server!!'</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-11"><a href="#cb9-11"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Deno supports promises out of the box. In the first example, the <code>await</code> keyword waits until <code>Deno.open</code> is resolved and its result is stored in the <code>file</code> variable. In the second example, <code>server</code> is an async iterator and the <code>for await</code> keywords are used to iterate them, each item will be a new incoming request.</p>

<p>Deno has incredible features, but there are two points that I think can be improved: - The permission flags could be handled in a different way like using a file that allows us to set the flags. If your code needs almost all the permissions you will have to use a long command. However, this is not a big issue on itself. - About the dependencies, NodeJS has a better project organization and the <code>lock</code> file is generated automatically. With Deno your dependencies will be placed in one directory, and to lock the dependencies you need to run an additional command. This might not be a good developer experience, but the community is working on some alternatives to change this.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to mention is regarding the examples and tutorials. On the NodeJS side, you can find a lot of examples/tutorials of any library or functionality you may need, while with Deno there are few examples/tutorials. But it will increase in the future for sure.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://github.com/stackbuilders/deno-example">link</a> you will find a small example using Deno and Typescript that shows how to create routes with the <code>oak</code> module, submit data from a form and generate a CSV file with the provided data.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Deno is a good alternative for increasing security that allows us to use TypeScript without extra configurations or …</p></div></div>

<p>DENVER, CO — Oct 27, 2020 — Application security startup StackHawk announced today that it has raised a $10 million in Series A funding. The pre-emptive, oversubscribed round was led by <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire Ventures</a> and included return seed backers Foundry Group, Costanoa Ventures, Flybridge Capital, and Matchstick Ventures. Launched just over a year ago, StackHawk has seen significant demand as a platform that helps developers implement security testing before applications are pushed into production — a trend in the industry known as “shifting security left.”</p>



<p>With widespread adoption of DevOps over the past decade, companies are shipping software to production more frequently than before, with many companies pushing to production multiple times per day. The traditional models of application security testing such as quarterly penetration tests or scheduled scans of the production application have struggled to keep up with this shift, resulting in inefficiencies and increased risk exposure. Modern companies, however, are integrating application security into their DevOps practices, checking for vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle. This approach vastly shortens the time to find and fix vulnerabilities, leading to efficient development and secure applications.</p>



<p>StackHawk is an application security testing platform that allows DevOps teams to instrument automated dynamic application security testing (DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline. With this approach, engineering teams can instrument automated testing with every pull request, ensuring that vulnerabilities are caught long before they hit production. And with a strong focus on features for software developers, application security can scale across the engineering organization, creating significant efficiencies in fixing security bugs.</p>



<p>Adrián Moreno Peña, Tech Lead at VanMoof, describes the company’s use of StackHawk, “At VanMoof we work fast and lean, in a DevOps-way of working with empowered teams using smart tools to handle their work. It was about time to find InfoSec tools that fit with our vision — high productivity tools, flexible, adaptable and created with developers in mind. Using StackHawk we can make our security improvement process transparent, actionable and easy to understand for each developer in the team, applying best practices and preventing security issues from going to production.”</p>



<p>The modern approach to application security also resonates with Katie Teitler, industry analyst at TAG Cyber. “Coming early into the development lifecycle is an attractive proposition, both for development lifecycles and for security teams,” said Teitler. “Since the platform is lightweight and quick to deploy through Docker, devs should feel instantly comfortable with it.”</p>



<p>The StackHawk founding team has leveraged their backgrounds in DevOps and security to build the product that puts application security in developer’s hands. Joni Klippert, StackHawk founder &amp; CEO, has spent the past decade building DevOps products, most recently as the VP, Product at VictorOps (acquired by Splunk).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital Transformation has allowed for automation of many tasks associated with building, delivering and operating software in production. DevOps automation enables companies to deliver business value to their customers faster than ever before,” said Klippert. “However, security practices are not keeping up with the speed of modern software delivery. StackHawk empowers software engineers to deliver secure software to their customers at the speed of DevOps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The focus on integrating into the modern engineering workflow and building features for developers was a leading factor for Sapphire to lead the round. “With the rise of DevOps, companies have shifted to the frequent release of software and reliance on automation. How companies approach application security should be no different,” says David Hartwig, Managing Director at Sapphire Ventures. “We believe that StackHawk has the product and the team in place, led by Founder and CEO Joni Klippert, to deliver on developer-first automated application security testing in the DevOps pipeline, and we are excited to partner with them along their journey.”</p>



<p>With the additional capital, StackHawk will continue product development, invest in go-to-market teams, and continue to support ZAP, the open source project that the company’s platform is built upon.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>About StackHawk</strong><br>StackHawk, an application security SaaS startup in Denver, CO, empowers engineers to easily find and fix application security bugs at any stage of software development.

<p>This is a brief blog post describing my experience with automating Photoshop using Python.
I am an experienced software developer, but had never really used Photoshop before. As you can tell from my wonderful programmer art in this post ;)</p>

<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop-cc-vbs-ref.pdf">Adobe documentation</a> my work was based on.</p>

<p>Here’s a link to <a href="https://github.com/loonghao/photoshop-python-api">another project</a> that could also be of interest. <strong>I have not used their code,</strong> but it looks very promising.</p>

<p>The sample code and repo source code have been <strong>tested on Python 2.7</strong>, but should work fine on Python 3.
<a href="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation">Source code</a></p>

<h2 id="generating-images">Generating images</h2>
<p>Some time ago we needed a solution to be able to quickly generate some product images using Photoshop.</p>

<p>The graphic designer wanted to combine 2 images into a final product image to be used for display their products online.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An environment image (PSD file).</li>
  <li>An object image (jpg).</li>
  <li>Combine the above images into a product image (jpg).</li>
</ul>

<p>This was done manually in Photoshop and as expected was very time consuming and error prone.</p>

<p>The scenario described for generating an image might seem very simple, <strong>why use Photoshop at all, right?</strong> PIL, Skimage, OpenCV would work fine! Well in this case, there were some very fine transformations and image processing being done in Photoshop and the graphic designer needed all these features required in order to generate high-quality images using filter, shears and other exotic (for me at least) visual effects.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation/blob/gh-pages/Combine_2_images.png?raw=true" alt="Combination of 2 images"></p>

<h2 id="smart-objects">Smart objects?</h2>
<p>Prior to my involvement, the graphic designer had been looking for a way to simplify and automate this image generation process.
An important feature that would be key to this work is the concept of <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/photoshop/using/create-smart-objects.html">Smart Objects</a></p>

<p><strong>Smart objects</strong> in Photoshop allow you to ‘link’ 2 or more PSD files. Any changes made to the linked PSD are automatically made to any PSD linking to it!
Basically you create a PSD file, and have one of the layers be a Smart Object. Then you link that Smart Object layer to another PSD.
Afterwards when you open the background image and the product image in Photoshop, <strong>any changes you make to the product image, also are made in the background image</strong>.</p>

<p>Another cool thing about Smart Objects: <strong>all the transformations within the Smart Object layer are preserved</strong>, regardless of the changes you make to the source PSD.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation/blob/gh-pages/smart_objects_update.png?raw=true" alt="Smart Objects workflow"></p>

<p><strong>This requires:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each background image (PSD) must contain a layer with a Smart Object.</li>
  <li>The Smart Object layer has  to be linked to a default image (PSD).</li>
  <li>Works best if both PSD files reside in same directory.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The manual steps for generating a final product image becomes:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the background image in Photoshop (mountains).</li>
  <li>Open the default product image in Photoshop (ball).</li>
  <li>Open the desired product image in Photoshop (star).</li>
  <li>Copy the desired product image into the default product image. This updates the Smart Object.</li>
  <li>Save the background image as JPEG. This is our final image we want to generate with mountains and the star.</li>
  <li>Repeat this for every background/product combination image we want to generate.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="python-and-com">Python and COM</h2>
<p>As mentionned at the beginning, we will be using the Photoshop COM programming interface.
The <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop-cc-vbs-ref.pdf">Photoshop reference PDF</a> will be our guide in writing our automation scripts. Of course we could be doing this directly in VB script, but it is much more fun (and productive!) to use Python.</p>

<p>Here’s a basic sample that opens an image in Photoshop.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>win32com.client</span>

<span># This actually fires up Photoshop if not already running.
</span><span>ps</span> <span>=</span> <span>win32com</span><span>.</span><span>client</span><span>.</span><span>Dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>"Photoshop.Application"</span><span>)</span>

<span># Open an image file (PSD in our case)
</span><span>doc</span> <span>=</span> <span>ps</span><span>.</span><span>Open</span><span>(</span><span>r"X:\Path\To\My.psd"</span><span>)</span>
<span># ... do something ...
</span><span>doc</span><span>.</span><span>Close</span><span>()</span>

<span>ps</span><span>.</span><span>Quit</span><span>()</span> <span># Stops the Photoshop application
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>This works on Windows, but some other scripting language might be more appropriate for Mac OS.
We will not be covering other platforms.</p>

<p><strong>There is no headless mode when running Python/COM automation scripts.</strong></p>

<p>Each script command actually translates to an action you see happen on the screen.
I will get into this and other annoyances later.</p>

<h2 id="basic-recipe">Basic Recipe</h2>

<p>Here is some basic sample code that illustrates the automated steps to generate our final product image, which is a star on a background of mountains.</p>

<p>Notice also that we duplicate the PSD documents once we open them. We do this in order not to accidentally change and save the original PSD files.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> working with Photoshop’s object containers is different than native Python lists and tuples. The indices are <strong>1-based</strong>, so the first element of container has index=1 (as opposed to index=0 as per usual).</p>

<h2 id="watch-out">Watch out!</h2>
<p>As mentionned earlier, even though there are quite a few advantages to automating with Photoshop, there are also quite a few points to consider.</p>

<p>Photoshop scripts require running an actual instance of Photoshop and it’s <strong>main window will be visible on the desktop</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Photoshop window should not be minimized while running a script.</strong> This might actually block Photoshop, and prevent your automated task from running properly.</p>

<p>If you make use of <strong>Copy/Paste commands in your script, this will hijack your clipboard</strong>, and prevent any other user/application from using it properly.</p>

<p><strong>Photoshop tends to hang/freeze/crash periodically.</strong> The crashes are frequent on big batches of images and don’t seem to be related to RAM/CPU usage. Just restart your script and it will eventually run to completion just fine. Regardless of crashes, <strong>you can still make huge productivity gains from automating some tasks.</strong></p>

<p>For all these reasons, we <strong>highly recommend that any automated tasks you create should run on a dedicated Windows PC.</strong> You don’t need a high end PC for most tasks and this will definitely make everyone more productive.</p>

<h2 id="hope-this-was-useful">Hope this was useful</h2>
<p>Of course, most of the code and samples discussed here are related to the specific use case described.
Almost all Photoshop commands can be scripted this way. The sample code should help you get started, and more details can be found in Photoshop scripting reference.

    <p>
      Proposition 24 is a 52-page law that overhauls privacy laws in California. It's so complex that it has split the privacy community, and experts disagree about what it would mean for Californians. Most voices agree Prop 24 has some changes to love, and some to reject. The typical voter is probably very uncertain about whether to vote "Yes" or "No".
    </p>
    <p>
      We are <strong>San Diego Privacy</strong>, a small group of privacy advocates in San Diego, and we'd like to help by offering a neutral analysis. Below you'll find 10 of the biggest issues with Prop 24, along with the main points supporters (the "Yes" side) and opponents (the "No" side) make about that issue.
    </p>
    <p>We suggest you first pick the issues in purple that jump out to you the most. Then, keep count of whether you find the Yes side or the No side more compelling, for the issues you've picked. Last, total up your counts.</p>
    <p>Then, as always, go vote your values.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Update</i></strong>: When you pick the issues below that matter to you, consider <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSWtcqBEbe-SOUUWZ9d7j_M3Ft1ap5CR?usp=sharing" target="_blank">downloading a shareable image</a> of that issue as well, and posting it on social media to generate discussion.</p>

            <p>I feel strongly about <strong>Pay For Privacy</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Pay for Privacy</strong> means that if you demand privacy, companies can charge you more for goods and services.

              <ul>
                <li>Companies that rely on targeted advertising, like newspapers or free streaming music services, currently rely on targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Some privacy options allow you to block the ability to show you targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Pay-for-privacy is already allowed in existing California law.</li>

        Authors' Note: It's important to emphasize here that pay-for-privacy is already allowed in current law. Opponents see Prop 24's choice to further expand pay-for-privacy, rather than ban it, as one reason to oppose it.

            <p>I feel strongly about <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong> allows you to set up your privacy options in one place, and have them apply universally. Prop 24 allows companies to ignore those global settings, in some cases.

              </p>

                <li>In the future, you'll be able to set your privacy preferences in one place, rather than at each site or service.</li>
                <li>Prop 24 includes provisions for allowing companies to ignore your global privacy preferences for certain reasons, like if they want you to pay.</li>

        Authors' Note: This is a good place to note that many privacy advocates believe all efforts to collect your data should require affirmative consent from you, rather than using the "opt-out" model where companies collect your data first, and then require you to ask it be deleted or not collected.

        Authors' Note: Privacy advocates feel very strongly that Californians should have the "private right of action," or the right to sue companies to enforce privacy law. It seems to us unlikely that privacy organizations will support overhauls to California's privacy laws without that private right of action being included.

            <div>
              <p>
                Prop 24 is a 52-page law with so much complexity that even experts disagree on its meaning. It was written privately and then submitted directly to voters.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Alastair Mactaggart wrote Prop 24. It has not been reviewed by the legislature.</li>
                <li>Mactaggart invited some industries to provide changes to Prop 24 as it was drafted.</li>
                <li>Mactaggart helped get California's existing CCPA privacy law passed through the legislature.</li>

        Authors' Note: Due to the way this law is being proposed directly to voters, rather than going through the long process of the legislature, there are a lot of experts disagreeing with each other regarding Prop 24's implications.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>For the past 15 years I’ve been a very opinionated PC gamer, along with the rest of my family. However it’s always been a pain in some shape or form to <em>be</em> a PC gamer, be it with the constant software updates, the lack of first-party support, or just the general cost. I’m one of these people that has stuck to good old Windows 7 because a mobile UI on my gaming PC is what I imagine hell to be. I’ve had no problems thus far, but there are more and more 10-only games coming out by the day, and some of them are enticing an upgrade.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there has been a LOT of activity around Wine and Vulkan to get Windows games running on Linux, to the point where I scheduled some time this Christmas break to give it a shot. My goal was to run the few games I actually wanted to play (Elite Dangerous, Minecraft, Subnautica, Garry’s Mod) on Linux on a spare computer before the 25th, whilst also proving to my family of gamers that it was time to “break the glass” and get away from the proprietary OS.</p>
<h2 id="by-the-way-i-tried-to-use-arch">By the way I tried to use Arch</h2>

<p><a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/2018-12-24-003401_1440x900_scrot.jpg"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/2018-12-24-003401_1440x900_scrot_hue660b04f3b99512430f28cfa69e907e7_222930_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian.jpg" title="Desktop"></a></p><p>I don’t think it’s possible to ever finish installing Arch, you just get more things configured (and broken) over time. I started this week trying to set up a system with Steam installed and Linux compatible games running. It took a full day’s work to get through the numerous issues I encountered, but I eventually had Garry’s Mod launching, albeit with some weird error about <code>en_US.UTF8</code> not being available.</p>
<p>At that point, I wasn’t at all happy with the setup. I had a very minimal i3, a very broken version of Steam with all sorts of rendering issues, and one native Linux game limping along. I installed LXDE so that I had a window manager that cooperated with the concept of full screen graphics applications, but even with my high tolerance for outdated looking UIs I still couldn’t help but dislike the default theme. I spent a good few hours fixing that but it was still uncomfortable to use.</p>
<p>I tried setting up <a href="https://lutris.net/">Lutris</a> too. They recommend installing wine-staging which is no problem on Arch because you just grab the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wine-staging-git/">wine-staging AUR package</a> and job done. However I still couldn’t get it to launch any games due to all sorts of missing dependencies in Wine (and maybe due to my Donegal internet too).</p>
<p>When I realized I needed to install most 32 bit versions for everything I accepted defeat. It was going to be too much hassle to configure + maintain an Arch gaming install, and I’d never want to reload that machine. I took a night to think about it, then I broke up with Arch in the morning.</p>
<h2 id="solus-is-new-bae">Solus is new bae</h2>
<p>Whilst I was browsing around on Lutris, Reddit, and some other sites I kept seeing mentions of this new Debian based distro with some real fancy window manager. With my lack of motivation to do configuration myself my requirements were now very different as to when I picked Arch. However, with the need for a very new version of Steam + Wine in order to play games I needed something that had either frequent updates or a way to easily update manually.</p>
<p>The Solus website looked very appealing. “Designed for Home Computing”. Last time I read that I set up Mint on my granny’s laptop, and I don’t think she used it since. However something about the material design of its site and UI made me think it was at least worth a shot.</p>
<p>I downloaded the ISO, booted up a computer, and in about 10 minutes I had a running machine. This PC does have an SSD in it, but even so it took just 4 seconds to boot to the login screen! My mentality of it needing to be Arch to boot fast went right out the window.</p>
<p>I logged in and a lot of things were just working, which was great, but then again my expectations were very low coming from Arch. There was a remarkable lack of shit installed by default. LibreOffice is there but not GIMP, and there’s only 1 video player instead of 4. As a result I didn’t spend any time undoing defaults, which I had fully expected from a “home computing” distribution.</p>
<h2 id="who-needs-terminals">Who Needs Terminals?</h2>
<p>I got Steam and Proton installed again, this time with no hassle because I used the Solus Software Centre and it just worked. Whilst that was downloading I copied Garry’s Mod over from another Windows computer on the network through the file manager because apparently it just supports CIFS out of the box. I launched that game no problem, so then I started looking at Lutris again.</p>
<p>I was under the impression that I was going to need Lutris to play basically anything that wasn’t a Steam native Linux game. It turns out that is not entirely true. My next game goal was Elite Dangerous, so I copied it over the network too and Steam picked it up fine. Testing my luck I just hit “play” with the Steam Proton version set to the latest beta, but it did absolutely nothing. Then I tried launching it through Lutris. I got a bit suspicious when I saw the Steam install downloader pop up, and then I realized it was creating its own “prefix” for Steam Windows under Wine, ignoring the system version I had installed entirely.</p>
<p>So I wasn’t going to use Lutris for Elite then, and I got a bit worried. If it didn’t launch through Steam would it work at all? I searched around and saw lots of people trying to get it to work, and then I found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/150">this Github issue</a> which lead to <a href="https://github.com/redmcg/wine/releases/tag/ED_Proton_3.16-6_Beta">this forked repo release</a>. With that, I had the game running flawlessly in like 20 minutes, and I even <a href="https://twitter.com/m1cr0m4n/status/1076614809414782976">tweeted about it</a>.</p>
<p>Other than installing the ED Proton fork, I had no need for a terminal during this process. I call that a testament to this OS. Generally, I only need a terminal when something breaks or something is more easily/quickly done at the prompt. My point being that if you were a Windows gamer trying to justify the conversion, you can rest assured that there is no need for any prior knowledge of Linux, or maybe even computers, to pull this off.</p>
<h2 id="real-work-on-solus">Real Work on Solus</h2>

<p><a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/Screenshot%20from%202018-12-24%2001-20-04.jpg"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/Screenshot%20from%202018-12-24%2001-20-04_huc4494bcc592d409b6b1867b12478b696_518421_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian.jpg" title="Solus"></a></p><p>It’s been so long since I used a “real” distro I can’t really separate what is unique to Solus from the common features you get nowadays. Setting up my networking and audio was painless. It’s Network Manager based networking with that regular GNOME GUI you see everywhere. You can control your audio volumes per-application from the pop out side bar in the UI. I noticed whilst I was installing all sorts of random stuff that the Solus not-a-start-menu was populating shortcuts and categories for everything. Also once I got the Nvidia driver installed everything like moving windows around was silky smooth. Honestly, I don’t think I want to use i3 any more.</p>
<p>With this level of confidence, I even went and setup my browser, IRC client, and a bunch of other stuff I would only do if I was committed to an install. What I wanted to try next was remote desktop gaming using TurboVNC, and I immediately encountered a problem. TurboVNC wasn’t in Solus' repositories so I was going to have to build it myself. I’m so glad I did.</p>
<p>Solus has a really nice YAML based system for developing packages. It does 90% of the work for you which is awesome. It will setup a build environment in a chroot, install dependencies, run commands, and generate a package all based on this one package.yaml. Their documentation on this setup is quite easy to follow, but I did pop into their IRC for a few questions.</p>
<p>I ended up building 3 packages for TVNC + its dependencies, and it didn’t take too long. From talking to a few developers and package maintainers, I’m quite tempted to submit + maintain these packages for Solus too. This blog post isn’t going to be about remote desktop gaming though so I’ll leave that for another day.</p>
<h2 id="convincing-the-family">Convincing the Family</h2>
<p>Over this weekend I played around 8 hours of Elite, whilst on Discord, on this really weirdly spec’d computer with an i3 2100 and a GTX 970. I had zero issues, both in setup and performance, and I spent way more time actually playing the games than I expected to.</p>
<p>When I mention the idea of using Linux to my brother, I always get an immediate no. “It’s for geeks”, “I can’t code”, “X won’t run on it”. I was able to prove him wrong on at least 2 of his points, but really it would be so much better if we all ran Linux. One of the biggest problems we have at the moment is that every time we make a significant hardware change to one of our computers, we have to reload the OS. We wouldn’t have to do that if we were running Solus on all the PCs. Also, Windows 7 isn’t exactly secure anymore. It hasn’t got real updates in like 2 years now, and we have turned them off before that to avoid breaking some games relying on old DRM (read: Securom) technology.</p>
<p>I don’t think it is going to take me much longer to convert every one given how much faster, simpler and prettier running a modern Linux distribution is. So long as I can prove that new and old games will work fine and continue to work when I’m not around I might be in for a chance of having a standardized boot image on all of our computers. This is appealing because living in Donegal you can’t be doing any sort of updates whilst playing games online otherwise your ping will go through the roof. You still have to do updates at some point, the question is how many times do you have to do them.</p>
<p>I’ll continue to test more games and work out a way I can easily deploy an entire Linux gaming setup to more computers. It is already exceptionally simple, but I need a turnkey solution to running Windows games on Steam that I can hand to people that have no idea what <code>ls</code> does.</p>

    <div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This tutorial will help you to get up and running with Speechly by guiding you through the process of building a simple voice filtering web app with Speechly and React.</p>
<p>You can find the source code for this tutorial <a href="https://github.com/speechly/react-example-repo-filtering">on GitHub</a> and you can also try out the final result <a href="http://speechly.github.io/react-example-repo-filtering/">hosted on GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Since we’ll be using <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started">create-react-app</a> for this tutorial, we’ll need the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js 8.10+</li>
<li>npm 5.2+</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this tutorial also uses TypeScript, so feel free to check out <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs">TypeScript documentation</a> if you’re not familiar with it.</p>
<h3 id="1-creating-an-app">1. Creating an app</h3>
<p>Let’s get started by creating an app and installing its dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">npx create-react-app speechly-voice-filter --typescript
<span>cd</span> speechly-voice-filter
npm i
</code></pre></div><p>Now that you’ve created the app, you can check it out by running <code>npm start</code> - it should open a browser tab with your app running in it.</p>
<h3 id="2-adding-data-and-layout">2. Adding data and layout</h3>
<p>Since we are building a filtering app, let’s add some data to filter and layout to display it.</p>
<p>To make it simple, our data source will be just a static array with some popular repositories on GitHub. Let’s add the following code and save it as <code>src/data.ts</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> type Repository <span>=</span> {

</code></pre></div><p>In order to show the table, we’ll need to render it. We could render our table right in our top-level <code>App</code> component, but let’s instead use a top-level component for our app under <code>src/SpeechApp.tsx</code> - it will come in handy later on:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;

<span>import</span> { repositories } from <span>"./data"</span>;

<span>import</span> { RepoList } from <span>"./RepoList"</span>;

  );
};
</code></pre></div><p>Now let’s add it to our top-level component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> { SpeechProvider } from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> App;
</code></pre></div><h3 id="3-adding-speechly-client-and-a-microphone-button">3. Adding Speechly client and a microphone button</h3>
<p>Before we proceed with the app, let’s take a quick detour and train a very simple and not very useful Speechly app, so that we can use it to test our integration later on.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://speechly.com/dashboard">https://speechly.com/dashboard</a> and login (or sign up if you haven’t yet) and create a new app (you can <a href="https://www.speechly.com/docs/quick-start/">check our Speechly Dashboard quickstart guide</a> if you feel lost). Feel free to use any configuration you want, even an almost empty configuration with just “Hello world” will suffice, but make sure your app is deployed!</p>

            <em>A simple Speechly configuration example</em>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once you have your Speechly app deployed, let’s integrate it. Start by installing Speechly React client:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">npm i --save @speechly/react-client
</code></pre></div><p>The client exposes a context provider and a hook that allows you to consume that context. Let’s add the context provider to <code>src/App.tsx</code>. Make sure you provide the <code>App ID</code> of your Speechly app as a property for <code>SpeechProvider</code>!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> { SpeechProvider } from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

<span>import</span> <span>"./App.css"</span>;

<span>function</span> App()<span>:</span> JSX.Element {
  <span>return</span> (
    <span>&lt;</span>div className<span>=</span><span>"App"</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>SpeechProvider appId<span>=</span><span>"your-app-id-here"</span> language<span>=</span><span>"en-US"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>SpeechApp <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/SpeechProvider&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
  );
}

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> App;
</code></pre></div><p>Next, let’s add some code to act as the microphone button. Also, it would be nice to see what we are saying, so let’s also render the transcript next to the button for some feedback. Let’s make that a separate component and save it as <code>src/Microphone.tsx</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> {
  Word <span>as</span> SpeechWord,
  SpeechSegment,
  SpeechState,
} from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

type Props <span>=</span> {
  segment?: <span>SpeechSegment</span>;
  state: <span>SpeechState</span>;
  onRecord<span>:</span> () <span>=&gt;</span> Promise<span>&lt;</span><span>void</span><span>&gt;</span>;
};

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> Microphone <span>=</span> React.memo(
  ({ state, segment, onRecord }<span>:</span> Props)<span>:</span> JSX.Element <span>=&gt;</span> {
    <span>let</span> enabled <span>=</span> <span>false</span>;
    <span>let</span> text <span>=</span> <span>"Error"</span>;

    <span>switch</span> (state) {
      <span>case</span> SpeechState.Idle:
      <span>case</span> SpeechState.Ready:
        <span>enabled</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>;
        text <span>=</span> <span>"Start"</span>;
        <span>break</span>;
      <span>case</span> SpeechState.Recording:
        <span>enabled</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>;
        text <span>=</span> <span>"Stop"</span>;
        <span>break</span>;
      <span>case</span> SpeechState.Connecting:
      <span>case</span> SpeechState.Loading:
        <span>enabled</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>;
        text <span>=</span> <span>"Loading..."</span>;
        <span>break</span>;
    }

    <span>return</span> (
      <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button onClick<span>=</span>{onRecord} disabled<span>=</span>{<span>!</span>enabled}<span>&gt;</span>
          {text}
        <span>&lt;</span><span>/button&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>Transcript segment<span>=</span>{segment} <span>/&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
    );
  }
);

<span>const</span> Transcript <span>=</span> React.memo(
  ({ segment }<span>:</span> { segment?: <span>SpeechSegment</span> })<span>:</span> JSX.Element <span>=&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (segment <span>===</span> <span>undefined</span>) {
      <span>return</span> (
        <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
          <span>&lt;</span>em<span>&gt;</span>Waiting <span>for</span> speech input...<span>&lt;</span><span>/em&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
      );
    }

    <span>return</span> (
      <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
        {segment.words.map((w) <span>=&gt;</span> (
          <span>&lt;</span>Word word<span>=</span>{w} key<span>=</span>{w.index} <span>/&gt;</span>
        ))}
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
    );
  }
);

<span>const</span> Word <span>=</span> React.memo(
  ({ word }<span>:</span> { word: <span>SpeechWord</span> })<span>:</span> JSX.Element <span>=&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (word.isFinal) {
      <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span>strong<span>&gt;</span>{<span>`</span><span>${</span>word.value<span>}</span><span> `</span>}<span>&lt;</span><span>/strong&gt;;</span>
    }

    <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span>span<span>&gt;</span>{<span>`</span><span>${</span>word.value<span>}</span><span> `</span>}<span>&lt;</span><span>/span&gt;;</span>
  }
);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this component renders a button that calls the <code>onRecord</code> callback passed in the properties and uses the state of Speechly client to determine when to enable the button and which text to use as its label. In addition to that, the component also renders the transcript of the phrase by assembling individual transcripted words from a segment (check out <a href="https://www.speechly.com/docs/speechly-api/#understanding-server-responses">this article in our documentation</a> for more information about how SLU API works). Since a word can be either tentative (i.e., its value can change as the API receives more audio data) or final, we use bold text to highlight final words.</p>
<p>One more step - we’d need to render our component and hook it up to the API. Let’s add it to our <code>SpeechApp</code> component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> { useSpeechContext } from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

<span>import</span> { repositories } from <span>"./data"</span>;

<span>import</span> { RepoList } from <span>"./RepoList"</span>;
<span>import</span> { Microphone } from <span>"./Microphone"</span>;

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> SpeechApp: <span>React.FC</span> <span>=</span> ()<span>:</span> JSX.Element <span>=&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> { toggleRecording, speechState, segment } <span>=</span> useSpeechContext();

  <span>return</span> (
    <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>

Peterson</a></strong>&nbsp;is a Canadian clinical psychologist and psychology professor at the University of Toronto who became a controversial figure in late-2016 for his critiques of political correctness. Peterson’s most recent book, 12 Rules for Life, has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. Most recently, Peterson has suffered from health issues that necessitated a year-long reprieve from the public eye.</p><h4><strong>Success compounds, meaning those that win tend to continue to win</strong></h4><p>Lobsters are interesting animals, but most people don’t think about them too often. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/">While they may not be immortal as many like to think</a>, they never stop growing and can regenerate lost limbs. Unfortunately for them, they taste good with butter - but let’s circle back to lobsters here in a minute.</p><p>In the early 1900s, an Italian engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, and philosopher (but he was probably no fun at parties, so you got him there) named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto#Economic_concepts">Vilfredo Pareto</a> became fascinated by the ideas of wealth and power - namely, how is wealth distributed across society? (Interestingly, he did not start this work until his forties, <a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/takeaway-friday-a-stoic-philosopher">so it is never too late to make a difference</a>.)</p><p>Ever diligent, he pulled data from the 1400s through his modern times and found the same pattern everywhere. Whereas people had previously assumed that wealth would be distributed in a flat, upward-sloping line from poor to rich, what Pareto found was in fact a hockey stick - a small percentage of the population holds a majority of the wealth.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:700,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:110387,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>This kind of distribution - the most successful / most productive / largest “winners” continuously having a greater chunk of the pie - can be seen across many different fields.</p><blockquote><p>That same brutal principle of unequal distribution applies outside the financial domain—indeed, anywhere that creative production is required. The majority of scientific papers are published by a very small group of scientists. A tiny proportion of musicians produces almost all the recorded commercial music. Just a handful of authors sell all the books. A million and a half separately titled books (!) sell each year in the US. However, only five hundred of these sell more than a hundred thousand copies. Similarly, just four classical composers (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky) wrote almost all the music played by modern orchestras. Bach, for his part, composed so prolifically that it would take decades of work merely to hand-copy his scores, yet only a small fraction of this prodigious output is commonly performed...</p><p>It also applies to the population of cities (a very small number have almost all the people), the mass of heavenly bodies (a very small number hoard all the matter), and the frequency of words in a language (90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words), among many other things. Sometimes it is known as the Matthew Principle (Matthew 25:29), derived from what might be the harshest statement ever attributed to Christ: “to those who have everything, more will be given; from those who have nothing, everything will be taken.”</p></blockquote><p>This idea was further expanded in the mid-1900s when British physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price">Derek Price</a> noticed that certain of his colleague were prolific publishers and others - well, not so much. In fact, Price could fit most domains of publication to a “law” stating that half of all papers are written by the square root of the number of all writers - if you had 100 papers written by 25 people, 50 papers would have been written by only 5 individuals. If it was 1,000 papers and 250 people, 500 papers were written by only 16 people. Thus, there was always an active minority generating the majority of the work.</p><p>These results can be understood as it relates to the compounding effects of resources - those that have previously “won” generally have access to the greatest resources and can more easily utilize those resources to achieve additional success. Those without resources cannot. </p><p>Thus, resources beget additional resources while losing resources restricts your ability to gain resources in the future - <em>winners are more likely to win again, and losers more likely to lose</em>.</p><p>However, there is also something going on in the brain that makes those that win more likely to pursue meaningful, productive activities again in the future.</p><h4>Your brain is aware of where you are within the winner-loser continuum and makes plans based on where it thinks you sit</h4><p>Back to the lobsters. Lobsters live in a cold, brutal world where things such as ideal lobster nests (think “safe hiding places”) and access to food are both paramount and scarce. This scarcity can result in conflict. So how do you determine which lobsters lay claim to the best nests?</p><p>As you might have guessed, they fight for them - and Peterson goes into detail on lobster confrontation rituals in his book. Important to this conversation is what happens in the brains of lobsters that win and lobsters that lose.</p><blockquote><p>A lobster loser’s brain chemistry differs importantly from that of a lobster winner. This is reflected in their relative postures. Whether a lobster is confident or cringing depends on the ratio of two chemicals that modulate communication between lobster neurons: serotonin and octopamine. Winning increases the ratio of the former to the latter.</p><p>A lobster with high levels of serotonin and low levels of octopamine is a cocky, strutting sort of shellfish, much less likely to back down when challenged. This is because serotonin helps regulate postural flexion. A flexed lobster extends its appendages so that it can look tall and dangerous, like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti Western…</p><p>High serotonin/low octopamine characterizes the victor. The opposite neurochemical configuration, a high ratio of octopamine to serotonin, produces a defeated-looking, scrunched-up, inhibited, drooping, skulking sort of lobster, very likely to hang around street corners, and to vanish at the first hint of trouble.</p></blockquote><p>The lobster’s brain knows whether it just lost or won a fight. The victor confidently holds himself up high and the loser shirks from potential conflict. And this makes sense - it is advantageous to your survival to avoid conflict if you tend to lose because 1) you tend to lose and 2) having lost, you now have access to less advantageous resources (food and shelter). The winner is confident in his access to resources and knows, based on experience, that he can win future fights.</p><p>These changes in how the lobster orients itself to the world start deep within its brain, with levels of serotonin driving physical changes in the external lobster. This brain infrastructure is very similar to what sits inside humans, who also take into account where they are in the “tend to win and have resources / tend to lose and don’t have resources” continuum.</p><blockquote><p>The part of our brain that keeps track of our position in the dominance hierarchy is therefore <a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/takeaway-tuesday-knowing-history">exceptionally ancient and fundamental</a>.&nbsp;It is a master control system, modulating our perceptions, values,&nbsp;emotions, thoughts and actions…</p><p>The ancient part of your brain specialized for assessing dominance watches how you are treated by other people. On that evidence, it renders a determination of your value and assigns you a status. If you are judged by your peers as of little worth, the counter restricts serotonin availability. That makes you much more physically and psychologically reactive to any circumstance or event that might produce emotion, particularly if it is negative. You need that reactivity. Emergencies are common at the bottom, and you must be ready to survive.</p></blockquote><p>If you are lower on the totem pole, being constantly prepared for emergencies eventually takes its toll on you given your orientation towards short-term survival at the expense of long-term success. It impacts everything, from the way your body allocates resources to its immune system (long-term investment) to your fight-or-flight response sensitivity (expensive short-term preparedness). </p><p>But this all makes sense for the competitive world our ancestors grew up in. </p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, that physical hyper-response, that constant alertness, burns up a lot of precious energy and physical resources. This response is really what everyone calls stress, and it is by no means only or even primarily psychological. It’s a reflection of the genuine constraints of unfortunate circumstances. When operating at the bottom, the ancient brain counter assumes that even the smallest unexpected&nbsp;impediment might produce an uncontrollable chain of negative events, which will have to be handled alone, as useful friends are rare indeed, on society’s fringes. You will therefore continually sacrifice what you could otherwise physically store for the future, using it up on heightened readiness and the possibility of immediate panicked action in the present… The physical demands of emergency preparedness will wear you down in every way.</p><p>If you have a high status, on the other hand, the counter’s cold, pre-reptilian mechanics assume that your niche is secure, productive and safe, and that you are well buttressed with social support. It thinks the chance that something will damage you is low and can be safely discounted. Change might be opportunity, instead of disaster. The serotonin flows plentifully. This renders you confident and calm, standing tall and straight, and much less on constant alert. Because your position is secure, the future is likely to be good for you. It’s worthwhile to think in the long term and plan for a better tomorrow.</p></blockquote><h4>Feedback loops can both hurt you and help you</h4><p>This whole process is an example of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis#:~:text=A%20single%20chemical%20reaction%20is,is%20called%20an%20autocatalytic%20reaction.">autocatalytic reaction</a> - a chemical reaction where one of the reaction products (in this case “losing”) …</p></div></div>

In fact, Tem published the first Notion website back in March 2020 (oh, how the world has changed). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Thanks in large to awesome projects like Super and Fruition, building websites on Notion became easier and faster. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Given the surge in popularity, I deciced to pen this comprehensive guide and create some duplicable blocks, so you can create your own Notion website in no time — enjoy 🙌</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="cc149452e88b42e8b29622443a589d9c"></span><span><span>🔑 An overview of the guide</span></span></h2><div id="c496b9ce8126498e85222feb210e850b"><div id="4e7f6e020650473a8d103736b9068090"><p><span><span>Making a landing page with Notion is easy to the point of enjoyable — you don't need any coding skills at all. It's also flexible — you can mix, match, and style various blocks to get the look and feel needed to present your idea (or product) just the right way.</span></span></p><p><span><span>This guide will walk you through every step of setting up your landing with Notion, publishing it to the web, adding analytics and custom styling. As a cherry on top, we've also curated 10 ready-made components that you can use to get your Notion landing page out in no time.</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="4b158c7e538e49518051b4d9b3d1f780"></span><span><span>🎯 Setting your landing page goals</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Landing pages are the best way to "sell" something, to tell people about a specific product, service or a resource, and make them do a specific action. </span></span></p><p><span><span>When user does an action, this is called "conversion", and usually landing pages are fine-tuned to get as much conversions as possible. Conversions could be anything: from subscribing to a newsletter or joining a community, to buying a product or a service. Landing pages can be purely informational, too. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Think what's the purpose of your page, and what the user needs to do to contribute.</span></span></p><h2><span id="cbfc301b7d274e27a06afc720d7eb511"></span><span><span>🤔 Deciding on what to show on the landing page</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Defining your goal was the hard part — after you know what action you want the user to make, it's easy to define what to show on your landing. </span></span></p><p><span><span>If they're subscribing to a newsletter, tell what it's about. If the goal is to grow a community, tell about the people already there and show what's the purpose of this community. If you're selling a product, focus on the value it offers and on core functionality. Don't forget call-to-actions to let the user actually realize their interest when they're convinced.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Take a look at </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demandcurve.com/#1opac8uusrjldfqjb39wpp">Demand Curve</a></span><span>'s landing page, for example. </span></span></p><div id="54fa9f431f9a45fc970d6e7fc90bf338"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>They're advertising their start-up program, focusing on what the program is about, how it's structured and why people learn valuable things during that program. It's all there — right on the first screen you can see the bullet points describing what the program is about (Growth Strategy, Ads, etc.).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Demand Curve's team also put a special emphasis on social proof — there's a ton of different testimonials and stories from people on the page.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Sometimes short landing pages that span 1-2 screens have higher conversion that longer ones, that span 3 and more screens. When you need your user to perform a simple action, like sharing their email, a short page works better. Short landings also make more sense for "warm" clients who already know what you are offering.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Longer landings with lots of information work better for "cold" clients, because they need more context. After you have an idea on what size is appropriate in your case, you can start experimenting with content.</span></span></p><h2><span id="3812d49b74904f9d961961ff3c8b07b9"></span><span><span>🖋️ Adding some content</span></span></h2><p><span><span>On a typical landing page, the information is arranged into standard "blocks" with valuable information:  there's an eye-catching Hero image, simple text blocks describing your value proposition, a call-to-action that lets you collect interest, and a footer with terms. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Like on </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.refactoringgrowth.com/">Refactoring Growth</a></span><span>'s landing page, you have an elaborate introduction, several sections with a value proposition (simple text) block and a picture or a graphic, a pricing block and a Call-to-Action.</span></span></p><div id="c32142c387d44b52b7995b22ae6c17c9"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>Optionally, you can add more useful stuff. It's a good idea to include social proof (which is very important for conversions and creates a sense of community around your value prop), juicy product shots or screenshots and a blog section linking to your posts somewhere else. </span></span></p><div id="d3e8989030c247cba938e6e513c95e1d"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/a9051f9d-917c-4013-bde2-6b219dbfaa5d.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><h2><span id="f07e89f0db6c4c5188083b57316e7685"></span><span><span>🎁 Ready-made landing page blocks</span></span></h2><p><span><span>We've assembled some common sections in Notion so you can borrow them for your website.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Just open the component you like below, click on the bookmark, then click "Duplicate" and drag your component's page into any page you like. Select "Turn into", then "text". You've got your landing page! Add some space between the blocks, change the content and delete the toggle. Then customize it as you like.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Here's a 53-second demo: </span></span></p><p><span><span>Mix and match the blocks and add your own section to make your own converting landing page in 10 minutes.</span></span></p><h2><span id="dbfa3c0dca5f4aada94f5376166f8281"></span><span><span>🌐 Publish your page to the web </span></span></h2><p><span><span>It's easy to publish your page and make it accessible from a custom domain. 
We like two services: </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fruitionsite.com/">Fruition</a></span><span> is free and open-source, while </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://super.so/">Super</a></span><span> offers more functionality and better performance. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Fruition has a </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fruitionsite.com/">very elaborate guide</a></span><span> right on their home page, and a </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw0x54PzCaI">video tutorial</a></span><span>, and Super gives a good onboarding when you sign up, leading you through all the necessary steps. 

</span><span><span>Here's a step-by-step to get you going on Super:</span></span></span></p><ol><li id="30fa5f0ef68b4ad79354c951f1b9aba1"><span><span>Sign up, select a plan (essentially boils down to how many sites you need, keep in mind that one site can have many subpages, like any website on the Web)
</span></span></li><li id="787193987a0b4c7c95437a027e1bd716"><span><span>Select whether you want to make a static website out of your page, or go with a default Notion-based method. 

First option offers great performance, but doesn't allow for filtered views and calendars on your page. 

Default Notion page is relatively poor in terms of performance and SEO, but all Notion functionality will work and it's still enough for simple personal websites or pages where you don't need fast loading.
</span></span></li><ol></ol><li id="e44a993f1fce466193429d780f87fd90"><span><span>Select your site name used in Super, a custom domain from a domain provider, and the URL to your original Notion page with the page set to public via the "Share" menu at the top ("Share" → "Share to the Web")
</span></span></li><li id="2aa6fd185ae9449084ed3674d150ac83"><span><span>Add one or more pretty URLs if you need them. By default, all the sub-pages you add inside your home page will have ugly Notion URLs. You can change that by providing links to sub-pages you want to add slugs to and specifying the slug (e.g. </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://optemization.com/preconceived">optemization.com/preconceived</a></span><span>)
</span></span></li><li id="ff4df464b80145149fe1675f38702e2b"><span><span>Add A and CNAME records to point Super to your domain name (Super provides these and you need to enter them in your domain provider's control panel). You can also provide an API Key if it's GoDaddy.</span></span></li><ol></ol><li id="52d2dce988b94c798bc7fafc30303552"><span><span>Enter your site's description, attach an image and an icon for social sharing. You can also select a custom font for your page's contents at this point.
</span></span></li></ol><p><span><span>Voila! The site should now be public. You're awesome.</span></span></p><h2><span id="728b3a07a7f3429b818b7992351d8dfa"></span><span><span>🔢 Add analytics</span></span></h2><p><span><span>With both Super and Fruition, you can inject your own Javascript into your page. This means you can use most of analytics solutions available.</span></span></p><p><span><span>For example, you can get your Fathom Analytics script to inject by going to Settings → Site → Site ID. Here's their own Fathom's </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://usefathom.com/support/tracking">instruction</a></span><span>. Google Analytics also has a global site tag you can inject. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Both look like this (from Super's landing):</span></span></p><pre id="c777ed719650472ea7f2d1bb17322dd3"><code><span><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>script src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://cdn.analytics.com"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></span></code></pre><p><span><span>After you copy and paste the script into the right field in Super or with Fruition, it should should auto-magically start collecting your stats and you'll be able to see them in your analytics dashboard. These are statistics we measure for </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://optemization.com/">optemization.com</a></span><span>:</span></span></p><h2><span id="4b1780ab79904f75abb4ecda48f54fd6"></span><span><span>✨Add styling </span></span></h2><p><span><span>In theory, with Super or Fruition you can style practically any part of your page. One of the simple things to do is to change default Notion colors. To change any color on your page just add a script (the same way you add an analytics script) that replaces Notion's CSS values.</span></span></p><p><span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demo.super.so/guides/colors">Super</a></span><span> has a great mini-guide on doing that, below is the script with every default Notion color. Just replace the color you want to change with a HEX value (#000 for black, #fff for white) and delete the rest to change colors for a site hosted with Super (Fruition works the same way).</span></span></p><details id="cd15c584098c4a26b2e6aeadc95bd312"><summary><span><span>Notion's core colors (check the full list here: </span><span><span><a id="/fed8e0f6059d469fadaeeac47812b6e7" href="https://optemization.com/fed8e0f6059d469fadaeeac47812b6e7"><div><p><img src="https://super.so/icon/dark/hexagon.svg" alt="Notion Colors"></p><p><span><span>Notion Colors</span></span></p></div></a></span></span><span>)</span></span></summary><div><pre id="675898bed12c4045ac7bdd3c20ed3ae3"><code><span><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span><span>

                                                  <div>
                                                                                        <p><span><span>A research team at the University of Calgary’s <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/">Cumming School of Medicine</a> (CSM) led by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen, PhD, has made an exciting breakthrough with the potential to prevent and reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The team discovered that limiting the open time of a channel called the ryanodine receptor, which acts like a gateway to cells located in the heart and brain, reverses and prevents progression of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models. They also identified a drug that interrupts the disease process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The effect of giving the drug to animal models was remarkable: After one month of treatment, the memory loss and cognitive impairments in these models disappeared. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The significance of identifying a clinically used drug that acts on a defined target to provide anti-Alzheimer’s disease benefits can’t be overstated,” says Chen, a member of the <a href="https://libin.ucalgary.ca/">Libin Cardiovascular Institute</a> and the <a href="https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/">Hotchkiss Brain Institute</a> at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>Dr. Jinjing Yao, PhD, a student of Chen, is the first author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The results of this groundbreaking study were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31158-X"><em>Cell Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This work is potentially highly impactful as more than half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, suffering memory loss and other cognitive impairments with a negative impact on quality of life. </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><span>The science behind the findings</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Previous research has shown that the progression of Alzheimer’s disease is driven by a vicious cycle of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) inducing hyperactivity at the neuron level. However, the mechanism behind this wasn’t fully understood nor were there effective treatments to stop the cycle. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen’s team used a portion of an existing drug used for heart patients, carvedilol, to treat mice models with Alzheimer’s symptoms. After a month of treatment, researchers tested animal models with very promising results. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“We treated them for a month and the effect was quite amazing,” says Chen, explaining the drug was successful in reversing major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “We couldn’t tell the drug-treated disease models and the healthy models apart.” </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen, a Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher, is optimistic about the future of this research, noting the next step will be clinical trials in people.</span></span></p>

<p><em><span><span>Wayne Chen is a professor in the Department&nbsp;of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biochemistry and </span></span><span><span>Molecular Biology at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span></em><span><span><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>Led by the&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.hbi.ucalgary.ca/"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Hotchkiss Brain Institute</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>,&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/research/brain-and-mental-health"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Brain and Mental Health</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>&nbsp;is one of six research strategies guiding the University of Calgary toward its&nbsp;Eyes High&nbsp;goals.

<p>For starters, this post is not a theoretical demonstration regarding whether you should use or not use ORMs (Object Relational Mapping) in your projects. It’s a description of why, in my own context, I decided to stop using ORMs. The ambition is to give a particular point of view that may be of use for people working in tech, to make up their mind.</p>



<p><strong><span>The Context</span></strong></p>



<p>First, the context. I’ve been working for 6 years as a tech startup CTO, at times as a cofounder, at times as a freelance. I’ve worked in or with a dozen of tech teams, using various kinds of technologies. Some teams were venture-backed, some were not.<br>If I had to sum up the context for the subject at hand, I would say that my point of view on ORMs is relevant for startup tech teams with &lt; 30 persons.</p>



<p>When I started coding, like most people, I started with a specific language, and that was not SQL. So, as soon as I started to need using a database, I naturally used ORMs to handle the database stuff. If we’re being honest here, most people don’t do a thorough research regarding the ORM topic, and just end up using one because they feel like they can get things done quicker, in a language they’re familiar with. I myself began coding in Python, and I quickly ended up using Django.</p>



<p>As time passed, I began appreciating several things about it, especially the migrations management part. Having all data schema modifications done in code (= versioned in Git) felt safer, especially when working with other people on that data schema. As the complexity of my projects grew, the backend code became more and more complex, but I didn’t give it second thoughts, since I had always used ORMs.<br>One thing that bothered me is that each time a requirement a little bit complex came up on a project, I had to dig very deep in the ORM documentation, like if I was cursed and that when a customer asked me something it would invariably be a specific corner case where the ORM fell short.</p>



<p>One day, I started taking data science projects, and I started learning SQL, since I had to perform a lot of queries on structured data.<br>I did my research and for various reasons I ended up selecting Postgres for my database of choice, due to its open source nature, its awesome views features (named reusable SQL queries), and its GIS extension Postgis.<br>One thing leading to the other, I worked on multiple data science projects in a row, and began to be quite good with SQL. It started to dawn on me how quick I was to make complex queries, with very few lines of SQL code.<br>I then worked again on web projects, and with my experience in SQL, decided that this time I would still write the backend in Python, but without ORM, and use a database driver instead (Psycopg2) to interact with the DB (database).</p>



<p>It has been a few years now that I work without ORMs, and I think my productivity more than doubled. I’m currently a freelance CTO, and I’m responsible (among other things) for the production infrastructure, including database schemas, of 4 startups.<br>I tried to analyze retrospectively what happened and here are a few thoughts.</p>



<p><strong><span>There is no Free Lunch</span></strong></p>



<p>ORM make one promise: that they will abstract the DB away. Solving problems in a generic way that works for everybody can mean 2 things: either it’s a technological breakthrough, either someone made some kind of middle-ground trade-off with existing tech. ORMs clearly fall in the latter.<br>ORMs make so many abstractions that starting off may be easier, but very quickly as you encounter more evolved real-world use cases, you end up spending your time reading documentation to understand the ORM abstractions, and how to configure it the way you need.</p>



<p>When a piece of software abstracts away a problem for you, if the scope of the problem is well defined, you can end up always using sensible defaults config parameters and a few of their variants. In this case, abstraction is a winning proposition.<br>The problem with ORMs is that the scope of what they usually try to achieve is too big, and in a real-world situation, when complexity arises, you often end up reading dark corners of your ORM documentation to find out whether your situation can fit in their abstractions. A great <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/" target="_blank">blog post</a> sums this up:  </p>



<p>“Although it may seem trite to say it, Object/Relational Mapping is the Vietnam of Computer Science. It represents a quagmire which starts well, gets more complicated as time passes, and before long entraps its users in a commitment that has no clear demarcation point, no clear win conditions, and no clear exit strategy.”</p>



<p>ORMs often seemed at first to be a winning proposition, but as time passes, I spent more time reading complex documentation for seemingly simple real-world situations, and I realized that the scope of what ORMs try to accomplish is just too large. When life keeps throwing at you different use cases with many little variants (and rest assured, this never stops), any endeavour to abstract it all quickly turns into a quagmire.</p>



<p><strong><span>Requirements You don’t have</span></strong></p>



<p>A huge problem of ORMs is that they abstract away the database, which means that if you have a favorite database, you can’t use its specific features.<br>If we’re being honest, in the context I’m talking about (startup with tech team &lt; 30 persons), who really needs DB portability?<br>The DB field is competitive and different DBs do differentiate themselves with great features (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo…). Abstracting the DB away means you have to settle for a common denominator, which is usually frankly quite mediocre.</p>



<p>For example, if in Django you need to perform a classic array aggregation, you end up using django.contrib.postgres.aggregates module, and lose DB portability right away. Array aggregations are very useful in many use cases, but not all DB propose it, so you end up using DB-specific modules anyway.</p>



<p><strong><span>The Performance Problem</span></strong></p>



<p>ORMs usually come with a SQL generator, that you’re never supposed to see. Problem is, in real-life, your DB schema will eventually get complex enough, and you will start having performance issues.<br>Business requirements change over time, retrocompatibility requirements pile up, and there is no way you can keep your DB schema theoretically optimal for your company’s needs at time t.<br>This fact translates into increased complexity for your DB queries, and a need to be smart about your queries.<br>When this complexity increases a bit, there is simply no way the ORM SQL generator can output optimized queries. Things will get slow, and I’ve yet to see an efficient way of querying a complex DB other than by writing the SQL yourself.</p>



<p><strong><span>DB Schema Consistency</span></strong></p>



<p>Initially I loved ORM for the fact that data structures were defined in code, which means versioned in Git, which means people could collaborate on them. Over the years I’ve changed my mind completely about this. Having multiple people make changes on DB schema invariably leads to huge inconsistencies, suboptimal choices and huge legacy.<br>This is why I enjoy working in small teams. I know it’s not possible for big corporations to have only 1 or 2 guys be the data masterminds, and I think that’s the reason why software quality drops so rapidly with the size of an organization. We just don’t know how to work efficiently in tech when the problem becomes too big for one brain (and by the way I think this is one of the biggest challenges to the advancement of humankind but that’s a story for another time).<br>I think that in the context of a startup with a tech team &lt; 30 persons, you should not have multiple persons making decisions about the DB schema. There should be 1 owner for this (which does not mean there can’t be collaborative discussions of course).<br>Currently I usually am the owner of DB schemas, and I manage SQL migrations by hand, via SQL scripts that are versioned in git, separately from backend code repos. I’m still regularly surprised by how many bad product/code decisions become obvious when considering DB schema issues, with context and history in mind.</p>



<p><strong><span>Be pragmati</span><span>c</span></strong></p>



<p>I had the opportunity to discuss the ORM topic with friends, and many had experienced more or less the same things, however some of them had an interesting take on the matter: they kept using ORMs, but only for particular things such as migrations management, handling connection pools with DB (for concurrent querying), input validations… To come back to the Vietnam analogy, I think it’s perfectly OK to use ORMs, if you know exactly what for, with a clear goal in mind and a well defined perimeter.</p>



<p><strong><span>The stack I use now</span></strong></p>



<p>Now when I start a web project, on the backend side I set up a REST API with a lightweight HTTP framework (Flask in Python, ExpressJS in Javascript), I interact with the DB with a driver (Psycopg2 in Python, pg-native in NodeJs), and I use Postgres, with a heavy use of Postgres Views to put as many data-related code in SQL, and as few as possible in backend Python/Js code.</p>



<p>The resulting backends, if you know SQL, are insanely quick to write, easy to read, and thus to maintain.</p>

<p>We like to apply labels to users: they’re irrational, lazy, unpredictable, rushed, and so on.</p>

<p>To some extent that may be true<span>—</span>we aren’t machines.</p>

<p>But research shows that users actually make decisions based on a set of predictable subconscious patterns.</p>

<p>To create satisfying digital experiences, UX designers should be aware of<span>—</span>and support<span>—</span>these cognitive habits.</p>

<h2 id="heuristics">Heuristics</h2>

<p>Human beings use psychological tactics and biases to get to decisions quickly. These mental shortcuts are called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555" target="_blank">heuristics</a>. We use heuristics in everyday life, but we especially like using them with software.</p>

<p>We don’t follow these patterns out of laziness or because we’re scatter-brained. It’s quite rational to take advantage of heuristics as a user because…</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the digital world, there’s <strong>very little penalty for being wrong</strong>. The cost of most errors is close to zero. Guessing wrong on a link and hitting the back button is still more efficient than reading the whole page to find an exact match.</li>
  <li>Carelessly clicking around is <strong>more fun</strong> because we get a small dopamine rush from each click.</li>
  <li>Web pages can be complicated. We’d rather <strong>make a decision and get on with our lives</strong>. It’s a matter of trade-offs<span>—</span>a balancing act.</li>
  <li>The web enables us to <strong>move quickly from one decision to the next</strong>, at a much faster pace than the physical world. So that’s what we do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most common heuristics that users employ.</p>

<h3 id="satisficing">Satisficing</h3>

<p>A combination of the words “satisfy” and “suffice.” It means to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/satisficing/" target="_blank">settle for the first reasonable option you find</a>, without considering the whole set of possibilities. We don’t look for the right answer<span>—</span>we look for whatever is good enough.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/satisficing.png" alt="Users make quick and dirty scans. When they come across something that refers even a little to what they've come for, they instinctively click it.">
</figure>

<h3 id="loss-aversion">Loss Aversion</h3>

<p><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.320.8769" target="_blank">Losses loom larger than gains</a> in our minds. It is thought that the pain of losing is about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. We put in more work and take more risks to avoid losses than we do to make gains. Part of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prospect-theory/">Prospect Theory</a>.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/availability-heuristic/" target="_blank">People draw conclusions based on what comes to mind immediately</a>. We give a lot of importance to things that we recall quickly and things we can already see right in front of us.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="decision-fatigue">Decision Fatigue</h3>

<p>Making a lot of decisions <a href="https://archive.org/details/psychologyofecon0000unse/mode/2up" target="_blank">lowers a person’s ability to make rational ones</a>. It’s also exhausting.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/decision-fatigue.png" alt="If a user is forced to make decision after decision after decision, they'll eventually start making sub-optimal choices... or give up entirely.">
</figure>

<h3 id="reference-dependence">Reference Dependence</h3>

<p>Human beings do not have an innate way to determine absolute value. So <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/01/the-power-of-comparison-how-it-affects-decision-making.php" target="_blank">we assign value by comparing one thing to another</a>. We make judgments in relative rather than absolute terms.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/reference-dependence.png" alt="In a set of choices in an interface, how the options relate to each other will determine what the user will do.">
</figure>

<h3 id="status-quo-bias">Status Quo Bias</h3>

<p>Unless there’s a compelling incentive, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-power-of-defaults/" target="_blank">people are more likely to stick to the default</a>. In other words, we tend not to change the established situation.</p>

    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/status-quo-bias.png" alt="This explains, for example, why users rarely utilize fancy customization features or change default settings.">

<h3 id="hicks-law">Hick’s Law</h3>

<p>The number of stimuli present <a href="https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law" target="_blank">influences the time and effort required to make a decision</a>.</p>

    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/hicks-law.png" alt="When users come across a situation with too many options, sometimes they'll try to bypass the unpleasantness of Hick's Law by hastily making any decision, which they later regret.">
</figure>

<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>

<p>As designers, what do we do about all this?</p>

<p>Here are a few ways we can tailor our digital experiences to these heuristics.</p>

<h3 id="decrease-your-dpp">Decrease your DPP</h3>

<p>One helpful exercise is to look at what we can call our DPP: <em>Decisions Per Page</em>.</p>

<p>Take an important page from your interface and count the number of possible decisions a user could make on that page. This includes actions (which always require a decision) or information that leads to a decision.</p>

<p>I’m willing to bet the number is higher than you would have guessed.</p>

<p><strong>If the DPP is too high, what do you do?</strong></p>

    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/decisions-per-page.png" alt="Decisions per page">
</figure>

<h3 id="reduce-visual-signals">Reduce visual signals</h3>

<p>Start by reducing the number of colors and fonts. Using more than four meaningful colors causes the “<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-impressions-human-automaticity/" target="_blank">rainbow effect</a>” which disorients the brain and creates an impression of ugliness.</p>

<p>Movement is distracting. Use animation sparingly and only for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>Build a design system. It ensures consistency between elements, and prevents users from having to re-learn the interface on every new page.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="optimize-the-default-experience">Optimize the default experience</h3>

<p>Be aware that many people will never use fancy customization options. Make sure the general default experience provides for all the important <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/the-how-and-why-of-user-flows" target="_blank">task flows</a>.</p>

<p>Forms provide lots of opportunities to be helpful. For example, we could pre-populate fields with the most common value or a realistic example. This representative value helps the user understand how to complete the field and what the expected response is. Not to mention it will save most users time and decision-making energy.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="prioritize-for-the-user">Prioritize for the user</h3>

<p>Since many users aren’t going to accurately prioritize things on their own, we should do some of that work for them. The ultimate goal is that they can glance at any page and know instinctively which items are most important.</p>

<p>Knowing what to prioritize requires that you learn about your users, their goals, and their main <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/the-how-and-why-of-user-flows" target="_blank">workflows</a>. Think about what is <em>essential</em> (vs. what is optional) and what moves the user <em>forward</em>.</p>

<p>We can give the user visual clues to create a clear hierarchy. Our brain assigns importance to things based on size, color, imagery, contrast, white space, and alignment.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="evaluate-your-content">Evaluate your content</h3>

<p>Remember almost all users scan<span>—</span>they don’t read. Classic principles of good writing, including descriptive headings and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/" target="_blank">inverted-pyramid</a> structures, help users get meaning from content.</p>

<p>Some common red flags include a lack of headings and big, long blocks of text. Call attention to important information using bulleted lists and bold or italic fonts. Take the time to craft your <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/7-practical-tips-for-better-microcopy" target="_blank">microcopy</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/content.png" alt="Evaluate content">
</figure>

<h3 id="consider-the-post-click-experience">Consider the post-click experience</h3>

<p>What happens when a user clicks on something? What’s the next thing they see and how does it connect to where they just were? How does it fit into their whole journey through your interface?</p>

<p>It could be easy to think of each page in isolation. <strong>But remember pages aren’t individual silos<span>—</span>they’re pieces of flows.</strong> It’s all a series of connected actions.</p>

<p>Give good <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/7-practical-tips-for-better-microcopy" target="_blank">information scent</a> with link labels so users know where they’re going. Allow them to gracefully recover from clicking on the wrong thing to eliminate the “cost” of clicking. Make sure they’re always moving forward.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="tying-it-off">Tying it off</h2>

<p>Remember: we never truly know what an individual user is thinking until we research. When in doubt, <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/usability-testing-in-4-simplified-steps" target="_blank">test it out</a>.</p>

<p>What are you going to do differently with your products to better support these heuristics?</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the field of computer science, the Paxos algorithm is notorious for how difficult it is to understand. I had to learn the Paxos algorithm in my distributed systems class. I even have "implemented" it by translating Leslie Lamport's TLA+ to Python. But I didn't understand it until much much later.</p>

<p>Now I have a better understanding of Paxos than I used to, I want to explain it to other people. Not because I'd like to help people, rather, I find that explaining things is a very good way to find blind spots in my own understanding.</p>

<p>So, where do we start? Personally, I dislike explanations that start with a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm, followed by a proof of why those steps do what they claim to do. Instead, I much prefer to start with the problem the algorithm tries to solve, then iteratively come up with a solution together with the reader. So that's what I am going to do. And now you understand the title.</p>

<p><em>Small disclaimer:</em> The glossaries used in this article is different from what is commonly used for Paxos. I just picked the ones that made the most sense for my narrative.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>The distributed consensus problem is widely useful, so the reader probably doesn't need to be motivated. Here I will just simply state the problem.</p>

<p>There is a group of agents (let's call them $\sc{CLIENT}s$), who want to choose a number among their selections. Any number is fine, as long as everyone agrees on the same number.</p>

<p>Here, there are a few assumptions we will make to make this problem meaningful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All the agents - including but not limited to the $\sc{CLIENT}s$, as we will add more types of agents later - are well-behaved. Meaning they all execute the prescribed algorithms faithfully, and don't maliciously try to trick other agents. (If you like jargons: Byzantine failures don't occur.)</li>
  <li>Agents can talk to each other by sending each other messages, but the messages they send to each other could take arbitrarily long before reaching their destination, and might get lost (but never altered).</li>
</ul>

<p>The agents could also "fail". However, failing is equivalent to all messages sent to/from that agent being lost forever. So whether we have this assumption or not won't change the algorithm we come up with.</p>

<p>Also, to not complicate things, we are only solving the "single-round" consensus problem in this article, meaning as the output of this algorithm, all of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ will get a single number which they agree on.</p>

<h2 id="solution-searching-adventure">Solution searching adventure</h2>

<h3 id="iteration-0">Iteration 0</h3>

<p>When trying to solve a complex problem such as this one, it's usually a good idea to start by simplifying the problem.
As a start, let's just ignore the need to be reliable entirely.</p>

<p>If we throw reliability out the window, it should be easy to come up with a very simple solution: we add an agent (let's call it $\sc{COORDINATOR}$).
The $\sc{CLIENTS}$ send whatever number they pick to the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ in a $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ message, where $x$ is the number
proposed by the $i$-th $\sc{CLIENT}$. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ picks an arbitrary proposal (say, $x'$),
and informs the other $\sc{CLIENT}s$ about this decision.
Specifically, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ will just reply with a $\sc{CHOSEN}(x')$ message to all the $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\ldots)$ messages it has
received and will receive.</p>

<p>If we assume no messages ever get lost, it is quite easy to see that every $\sc{CLIENT}$ will get a number. And because only one number is ever chosen, they will all get the same number.</p>

<p>It is also easy to see why this solution is impractical: it has a single point of failure. Once the singular $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ fails, no further progress can be made.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h3>

<p>To improve this almost looks easy at first glance: just add more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$!</p>

<p>Sure, more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would remove the single point of failure. However, if there are more than one $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, they might individually make different decisions, which results in the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ having disagreement.</p>

<p>What if we let the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ reach an agreement among themselves before responding? But wait, doesn't that sound familiar? Having a group of agents reaching an agreement, that's exactly what we added the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to solve. We just made the problem cyclic.</p>

<p>Let's take a step back. Is there a way for the clients to reach an agreement without having the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ communicate with each other?</p>

<p>In other words, among the decisions of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, is there an deterministic algorithm to pick out a specific one that is robust against message losses?</p>

<p>This might sound hard, but it's actually quite simple: pick the decision that is backed by more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>There can't be two decisions both with more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing them; and if a decision doesn't have that many $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing it, it won't appear to have more backing $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ through message losses.</p>

<p>Since this approach resembles a majority vote, let's call $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ decisions $\sc{VOTE}(coord_i, x)$ from now on, where $x$ is the number picked by the $i$-th $\sc{COORDINATOR}$. Each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has a single vote, because each of them only makes a single decision.</p>

<p>Obviously, our solution cannot be infinitely reliable. If more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ went down, there will never be a majority reached. But this is already vastly better than our first solution, and the reliability scales with the number of $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$. So we will call it good enough.</p>

<p>Sadly, this solution doesn't actually work: there might not be a majority at all! For example, it's possible that three of the proposals each get a third of the votes. We would have a stalemate in that case.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-2">Iteration 2</h3>

<p>Again, a solution seems straightforward: just try again in case of a stalemate.</p>

<p>But then again, things aren't that simple.</p>

<p>First of all, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ need to be made aware of a retry. Otherwise, because each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ only has one vote, they won't be able to vote again even if the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ retry.</p>

<p>To do that, we attach an attempt id to all the messages sent. i.e. $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ becomes $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\#attempt, client_i, x)$, and so forth. Each time a $\sc{CLIENT}$ retries, it bumps $\#attempt$ to the maximum $\#attempt$ it knows of plus 1. And the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ should only responds to messages with the most recent $\#attempt$.</p>

<p>Hopefully the intent of the $\#attempt$ number is clear. (<a href="https://github.com/yshui/explain-algorithms/issues/new">Let me know</a> if not.)</p>

<p>Are we good now? Unfortunately, no. Consider this scenario:</p>

<p>There were 2 clients. They proposed their numbers, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ voted on them and all agreed on a single number, $x_1$, all is good. But, all of the $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots)$ messages got lost on the way to $client_2$, while $client_1$ received all of the messages just fine. At this point, $client_1$ thought $x_1$ is the number, but $client_2$ went on to retry. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ voted again, and got $x_2$. This time, all the messages sent to $client_1$ got lost.</p>

<p>And behold, we got the two clients to disagree.</p>

<p>There is an important insight to be had here. Whenever a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$, say $coord_i$, sends out a $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots, coord_i, x)$, there is a chance that some $\sc{CLIENT}$ would adopt $x$. If $coord_i$ ever sends out two votes with different $x$, there is a chance that some of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ would disagree.</p>

<p>In other words, once a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has revealed its vote, it has to stick to it.</p>

<p>This seems to run contrary to our attempt: if the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ cannot change their votes, what's the point of retrying? A stalemate will be a stalemate forever.</p>

<p>Looks like we reached a dead end with this type of voting. It appears the problem stems from the fact that the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to commit to their votes.</p>

<p>So, what if we introduce a form of non-commitment voting?</p>

<h3 id="iteration-3">Iteration 3</h3>

<p>Let's explore this idea. Say, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ could now send a $\sc{TENTATIVE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, coord_i, x)$ message, to tentatively vote for $x$.</p>

<p>Obviously, the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ couldn't adopt $x$ right away. So what's this vote good for?</p>

<p>Ah, right, it could get us to a majority.</p>

<p>It is correct that tentative votes don't lead directly to an agreement among $\sc{CLIENT}s$, but it can show us when a majority has formed among the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>Once a $\sc{CLIENT}$ sees a majority tentative vote, it can then message the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to ask for an actual vote. (Let's call this message $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, client_i)$). Intuitively, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to make the same vote in the actual vote as their tentative votes.</p>

<p>If all goes well, we would get a majority and an agreement. If there is no majority, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ won't even start a vote, so they are free to change their mind. So the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ could start another attempt which might have a different outcome.</p>

<p>What if things don't go well? What if the $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}$ messages weren't received by some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$?
In that case, some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would have voted, and their decisions cannot be changed. That is to say, in all subsequent attempts, these $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ will always vote for what they have voted for, whether it's a tentative vote, or the actual vote. But that doesn't create a problem for us. There was a majority in the tentative votes, and now we solidified part of the tentative votes. There is at least one way we can still reach a majority in the next round: everyone votes the same as they did in this round. And we can prove this inductively for all future rounds.</p>

<p>From this, we can have a rough image of how the algorithm functions: as attempts are being made, more and more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ start to make up their mind which number they will commit to, while making sure a majority could still be reached. Eventually, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

  <section><p>Throughout my career, I’ve always gravitated toward incidents. Maybe it’s the
drama, or I like to see how things go wrong. Perhaps… maybe I even cause them?</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, this experience has helped me develop a sense of how I like
handling incidents, something I’ve tried passing onto my team. So when a
colleague asked what our methods were, I was more than happy to respond with
some unstructured ramblings.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/incident-response-email.png" alt="email asking for incident response advice">
</figure>

<p>Since then, Matthieu has regularly nudged me to share these thoughts more
widely. This article is what happened when I took those words, dressed them up
all fancy, and sent them into the world.</p>

<p>I hope you find it useful!</p>

<hr>

<p>If you’ve ever Googled incident response, you’ll have found a load of results
about <strong>incident roles</strong>. Atlassian has some <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management">incredible docs</a> that
explain the concepts well.</p>

<p>In brief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incident roles help scale incidents as your response team grows. Roles help
separate responsibilities, ensuring someone is properly focused on each aspect
of an incident. Defining these roles can help make everyone clear about what
they’re expected to do, and what to expect of one another.</li>
  <li>Two <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/incident-response/roles-responsibilities">roles</a> you must be aware of:
    <ul>
      <li>Incident commander, the single point of contact for actions taken related
to this incident. They don’t need to be the person taking the action, but
before you reboot that server, you check with them. This avoids the
classic ‘shit, I didn’t realise you were restoring the database onto
<em>that</em> node’ when you clash with a well-intentioned colleague</li>
      <li>Communications. Essential, and typically the first thing forgotten when
lacking a structured incident response process. Don’t be that team-
nominate someone to manage comms as early as possible, and make sure all
responders actively offload communication to them. Don’t ever split
people’s focus by requiring them to debug and communicate, or you’ll
half-ass both!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are many other roles defined in the literature, but roles only help when
your team has a strong understanding of what each role entails. Commander and
communications are, in my opinion, essential- adding more granularity without
sufficient training can confuse incidents and impair your response</li>
</ul>

<p>If you become comfortable with the roles you want to use, and your team are well
practiced in all of them, you’ll have taken the first step towards an effective
response. But now you have the roles, how does your team go about fixing the
issue?</p>

<p>Firstly, identify <strong>what is bleeding</strong>. If you can establish the scope of an
incident early, it means your next steps will be much more likely to address the
problem.</p>

<p>Try to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify which systems are failing, then work through the dependencies to
understand whether the issue is due to an upstream or downstream component</li>
  <li>Be extremely wary of assumptions. For everything you receive from a
third-party, trust but verify. Record whatever you did to verify, such as the
commands you ran and the time you ran them. An incorrect assumption can derail
your response, so do your best to avoid them!</li>
  <li>Once you’ve found the technical source, consider running some impact analysis.
Don’t delay your response with this work, but if someone is spare, get them to
estimate the scope of the impact- who and how many are affected. An inaccurate
understanding of impact can lead to poor decisions, and clarity on who is
affected can help other parts of your organisation (Customer Success, Support,
etc) respond appropriately</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the team understands the nature of the incident, you can begin to <strong>stop
the bleeding</strong>. Put differently, your goal should be to stop the immediate pain
and defer clean-up to a less pressured time.</p>

<p>For this, we need to prioritise actions to achieve the best chance of a positive
outcome. Note the phrase <strong>“best chance”</strong>: routine remediations that are quick
to apply should be taken first, even if you suspect it may only partially fix
the problem.</p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rollback to a known good revision, even if you think you can write a fix
really quickly- you can always do that after you’ve rolled back, when there is
less urgency</li>
  <li>Take action to preserve critical systems, even at the expense of other less
critical flows. If a single endpoint is causing the whole system to fail,
don’t hesitate to no-op that endpoint if it restores service to the parts that
matter</li>
  <li>Make full use of your team and proactively apply whatever fixes you think are
low-risk, even if you suspect it might not fix the whole problem: scale down
non-essential queues, put a freeze on deploys, restart that server. Effective
delegation means it costs little to try, provided other responders continue to
work on root cause analysis assuming the easy fixes will fail</li>
</ul>

<p>This should give you an idea of what your team should work on. The question is
now how should they work together to execute them?</p>

<p>Given incident response is so much about communication, you’ll be wanting an
effective tool for <strong>instant messaging</strong>, and to record a log of your actions.</p>

<p>Turn to Slack (or whatever your equivalent is):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first action in any incident should be creating a message channel. Several
tools (<a href="https://github.com/monzo/response">monzo/response</a>, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072">Netflix’s
Dispatch</a>) can automatically create that (and more) for you,
but even if you have to painstakingly click those buttons yourself, do it.
It’s way worth the additional minute of downtime to get that space
ready-to-go.</li>
  <li>I strongly advocate against private incident response channels. Company
culture providing, a public channel can level-up your response by increasing
ease of access to information. This can prevent coordination issues that you’d
head-desk to encounter (I’ve seen two separate incident teams tackling the
same incident, with no knowledge of each others existence…)</li>
  <li>Whenever you’re about to do something destructive, such as run a command or
restart some resource, message the channel. Not only can this improve
awareness across the team, but it provides an invaluable resource when
building an incident log for your post-mortem</li>
</ul>

<p>Instant messaging is great for information that is timestamped and should not be
changed. For content you expect to modify as the incident progresses, create an
<strong>incident document</strong> in your favourite collaborative editor (Google Docs,
Dropbox Paper, Notion, etc):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your organisation can draft incident doc templates that contain the structure
you need: perhaps you have reporting responsibilities, or have a specific
communications flow? Put it all in here, and make it easy to create documents
from these templates with a single click</li>
  <li>Especially for large-scale incidents where people rotate through the incident
team, this doc can act as the entry-point for onboarding people into the
incident. Have whoever runs comms manage this document, maintaining a timeline
of important events, and even draft an executive summary if the incident is
particularly complex</li>
  <li>Have your technical team post code snippets or relevant logs lines into the
document appendix, so everyone can lean on a central view of the incident</li>
</ul>

<p>Paired together, chat log and incident doc can be powerful tools to help
coordinate the response team, while providing transparency to any invested
onlookers. Even better, this content can be easily reshaped into a post-mortem
once the dust has settled.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, the <strong>human element</strong>. People make bad decisions
when stressed, and the excitement of an incident can make you forget entirely
about caring for yourself. Lead by example and be forceful when encouraging your
responders to care for themselves.</p>

<p>Some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One highly effective method to reduce stress is to take breaks, going away
from your screen, and breathing. Actively encourage your team to take these
pauses with you, reducing the chance you’ll screw things up by rushing</li>
  <li>As a general rule, take pauses whenever:
    <ul>
      <li>You get paged. It doesn’t have to be long; just 10s of breathing can
remind your body that you’re in control, and lower your adrenaline.</li>
      <li>Whenever the production impact has ceased. As soon as the alarms go quiet
and things seem stable, call a break for the entire team. It’s rare that
incidents don’t have extended follow-up work: rest yourself for at least
15m before you start that process</li>
      <li>During follow-up, before commencing any sort of procedure, such as
‘recovery of X cluster’. Get everyone to grab some air before running the
checklist, allowing each individual to recharge in case the process goes
wrong, or takes much longer than expected</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure your incident commanders are trained to detach responders before they
burn themselves. One important job is to order (and expense!) food before
people get hungry. You’ll be surprised at how an incident response team will
eat, after noisily protesting that they don’t need any food!</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all folks! A whistle-stop tour through my essential shopping list of
incident response practices. This list is far from complete, but can be used as
a great starter pack, or a prompt for the more experienced to consider what they
care about in their incident response process.</p>

<p>Just remember: take a deep breath, look out for your colleagues, blame systems
not people, and don’t rush. Good luck!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I love text layout, and have been working with it in one form or other for over 35 years. Yet, knowledge about it is quite arcane. I don’t believe there is a single place where it’s all properly written down. I have some explanation for that: while basic text layout is very important for UI, games, and other contexts, a lot of the “professional” needs around text layout are embedded in <em>much</em> more complicated systems such as Microsoft Word or a modern Web browser.</p>

<p>A complete account of text layout would be at least a small book. Since there’s no way I can write that now, this blog post is a small step towards that – in particular, an attempt to describe the “big picture,” using the conceptual framework of a “loose hierarchy.” Essentially, a text layout engine breaks the input into finer and finer grains, then reassembles the results into a text layout object suitable for drawing, measurement, and hit testing.</p>

<p>The main hierarchy is concerned with laying out the entire paragraph as a single line of text. Line breaking is also important, but has a separate, parallel hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-text-layout-hierarchy">The main text layout hierarchy</h2>

<p>The hierarchy is: paragraph segmentation as the coarsest granularity, followed by rich text style and BiDi analysis, then itemization (coverage by font), then Unicode script, and shaping clusters as the finest.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/layout_pyramid.svg" alt="diagram of layout hierarchy"></p>

<h3 id="paragraph-segmentation">Paragraph segmentation</h3>

<p>The coarsest, and also simplest, segmentation task is paragraph segmentation. Most of the time, paragraphs are simply separated by newline (U+000A) characters, though Unicode in its infinite wisdom specifies a number of code point sequences that function as paragraph separators in plain text:</p>

<ul>
  <li>U+000A LINE FEED</li>
  <li>U+000B VERTICAL TAB</li>
  <li>U+000C FORM FEED</li>
  <li>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN</li>
  <li>U+000D U+000A (CR + LF)</li>
  <li>U+0085 NEXT LINE</li>
  <li>U+2008 LINE SEPARATOR</li>
  <li>U+2009 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</li>
</ul>

<p>In rich text, paragraphs are usually indicated through markup rather than special characters, for example <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> in HTML. But in this post, as in most text layout APIs, we’ll treat rich text as plain text + attribute spans.</p>

<h3 id="rich-text-style">Rich text style</h3>

<p>A paragraph of rich text may contain <em>spans</em> that can affect formatting. In particular, choice of font, font weight, italic or no, and a number of other attributes can affect text layout. Thus, each paragraph is typically broken into a some number of <em>style runs,</em> so that within a run the style is consistent.</p>

<p>Note that some style changes don’t <em>necessarily</em> affect text layout. A classic example is color. Firefox, rather famously, does <em>not</em> define segmentation boundaries here for color changes. If a color boundary cuts a ligature, it uses fancy graphics techiques to render parts of the ligature in different color. But this is a subtle refinement and I think not required for basic text rendering. For more details, see <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/">Text Rendering Hates You</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bidirectional-analysis">Bidirectional analysis</h3>

<p>Completely separate from the style spans, a paragraph may in general contain both left-to-right and right-to-left text. The need for bidirectional (BiDi) text is certainly one of the things that makes text layout more complicated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this part of the stack is defined by a standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UAX #9</a>), and there are a number of good implementations. The interested reader is referred to <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>. The key takeaway here is that BiDi analysis is done on the plain text of the entire paragraph, and the result is a sequence of <em>level runs,</em> where the level of each run defines whether it is LTR or RTL.</p>

<p>The level runs and the style runs are then merged, so that in subsequent stages each run is of a consistent style and directionality. As such, for the purpose of defining the hierarchy, the result of BiDi analysis could alternatively be considered an implicit or derived rich text span.</p>

<p>In addition to BiDi, which I consider a basic requirement, a more sophisticated text layout engine will also be able to handle vertical <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode">writing modes</a>, including mixed cases where short strings are horizontal within the vertical primary direction. Extremely sophisticated layout engines will also be able to handle ruby text and other ways of annotating the main text flow with intercalated strings. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a> for many examples of sophisticated layout requirements; the scope of this blog post really is basic text layout of the kind needed in user interfaces.</p>

<h3 id="itemization-font-coverage">Itemization (font coverage)</h3>

<p>Itemization is the trickiest and least well specified part of the hierarchy. There is no standard for it, and no common implementation. Rather, each text layout engine deals with it in its own special way.</p>

<p>Essentially, the result of itemization is to choose a single concrete font for a run, from a <em>font collection.</em> Generally a font collection consists of a main font (selected by font name from system fonts, or loaded as a custom asset), backed by a <em>fallback stack,</em> which are usually system fonts, but thanks to <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto</a> it is possible to bundle a fallback font stack with an application, if you don’t mind spending a few hundred megabytes for the assets.</p>

<p>Why is it so tricky? A few reasons, which I’ll touch on.</p>

<p>First, it’s not so easy to determine whether a font can render a particular string of text. One reason is <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalization</a>. For example, the string “é” can be encoded as U+00E9 (in NFC encoding) or as U+0065 U+0301 (in NFD encoding). Due to the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">Unicode equivalence</a>, these should be rendered identically, but a font may have coverage for only one or the other in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cmap">Character to Glyph Index Mapping</a> (cmap) table. The shaping engine has all the Unicode logic to handle these cases.</p>

<p>Of course, realistic fonts with Latin coverage will have both of these particular sequences covered in the cmap table, but edge cases certainly do happen, both in extended Latin ranges, and other scripts such as Hangul, which has complex normalization rules (thanks in part to a Korean standard for normalization which is somewhat at odds with Unicode). It’s worth noting that <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201009-00/?p=104351">DirectWrite gets Hangul normalization quite wrong</a>.</p>

<p>I believe a similar situation exists with the Arabic presentation forms; see <a href="https://www.arabeyes.org/Developing_Arabic_fonts">Developing Arabic fonts</a> for more detail on that.</p>

<p>Because of these tricky normalization and presentation issues, the most robust way to determine whether a font can render a string is to try it. This is how LibreOffice has worked for a while, and in 2015 <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2015-October/005168.html">Chromium followed</a>. See also <a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/layout-team/eliminating-simple-text">Eliminating Simple Text</a> for more background on the Chromium text layout changes.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> whole class of complexity is emoji. A lot of emoji can be rendered with either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Emoji_versus_text_presentation">text or emoji presentation</a>, and there are no hard and fast rules to pick one or the other. Generally the text presentation is in a symbol font, and the emoji presentation is in a separate color font. A particularly tough example is the smiling emoji, which began its encoding life as 0x01 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">Code page 437</a>, the standard 8-bit character encoding of the original IBM PC, and is now U+263A in Unicode. However, the suggested default presentation is text, which won’t do in a world which expects color. Apple on iOS unilaterally chose an emoji presentation, so many text stacks follow Apple’s lead. (Incidentally, the most robust way to encode such emoji is to append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)">variation selector</a> to pin down the presentation.)</p>

<p>Another source of complexity when trying to write a cross-platform text layout engine is querying the system fonts. See <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/skribo/text/2019/04/04/font-fallback.html">Font fallback deep dive</a> for more information about that.</p>

<p>I should note one thing, which might help people doing archaeology of legacy text stacks: it used to be pretty common for text layout to resolve “compatibility” forms such as NFKC and NFKD, and this can lead to various problems. But today it is more common to solve that particular problem by providing a font stack with <em>massive</em> Unicode coverage, including all the code points in the relevant compatibility ranges.</p>

<h3 id="script">Script</h3>

<p>The <em>shaping</em> of text, or the transformation of a sequence of code points into a sequence of positioned glyphs, depends on the script. Some scripts, such as Arabic and Devanagari, have extremely elaborate shaping rules, while others, such as Chinese, are a fairly straightforward mapping from code point into glyph. Latin is somewhere in the middle, starting with a straightforward mapping, but ligatures and kerning are also required for high quality text layout.</p>

<p>Determining script runs is reasonably straightforward - many characters have a Unicode script property which uniquely identifies which script they belong to. However, some characters, such as space, are “common,” so the assigned script just continues the previous run.</p>

<p>A simple example is “hello мир”. This string is broken into two script runs: “hello “ is <code>Latn</code>, and “мир” is <code>Cyrl</code>.</p>

<h3 id="shaping-cluster">Shaping (cluster)</h3>

<p>At this point, we have a run of constant style, font, direction, and script. It is ready for <em>shaping.</em> Shaping is a complicated process that converts a string (sequence of Unicode code points) into positioned glyphs. For the purpose of this blog post, we can generally treat it as a black box. Fortunately, a very high quality open source implementation exists, in the form of HarfBuzz.</p>

<p>We’re not <em>quite</em> done with segmentation, though, as shaping assigns substrings in the input to <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/clusters.html">clusters</a> of glyphs. The correspondence depends a lot on the font. In Latin, the string “fi” is often shaped to a single glyph (a ligature). For complex scripts such as Devanagari, a cluster is most often a syllable in the source text, and complex reordering can happen within the cluster.</p>

<p>Clusters are important for <em>hit testing,</em> or determining the correspondence between a physical cursor position in the text layout and the offset within the text. Generally, they can be ignored if the text will only be rendered, not edited (or selected).</p>

<p>Note that these shaping clusters are distinct from grapheme clusters. The “fi” example has two grapheme clusters but a single shaping cluster, so a grapheme cluster boundary can cut a shaping cluster. Since …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<hr>

    <p>For a while now I’ve had a series of blog posts floating around in my head on how to build an HTTP stack in Swift. The idea started last spring with Rob Napier’s <a href="https://robnapier.net/start-with-a-protocol">blog posts on protocols</a>, and matured last summer and fall while I was working at WeWork on an internal Swift framework.</p>

<p>So, with my <a href="https://davedelong.com/blog/2020/06/14/anything-worth-doing/">newfound blogging powers</a>, I think it’s time to tackle this problem. Over the course of several posts, I’ll walk through a number of topics related to HTTP and how we can fit them together into a great Swift framework. We’ll end up with a framework that supports things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automatically retrying requests</li>
  <li>throttling to a customizable maximum number of concurrent requests</li>
  <li>specifying custom server environments for an entire connection stack, or for a single request</li>
  <li>automatically cancelling in-flight requests when the stack is reset</li>
  <li>basic mesh networking</li>
  <li>implementing OAuth (or any sort of authenticated request)</li>
  <li>multi-part form uploads</li>
  <li>easy mocking of responses</li>
  <li>… and a whole lot more I’m glossing over</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll be building all of this on top of <code>URLSession</code>. And along the way, we’ll be addressing a lot of the feedback I <a href="https://davedelong.com/blog/2018/03/02/apple-networking-feedback/">provided to Apple Engineers</a> about the state of the built-in networking stack. (Awesomely, in the past 2 years a couple of those items have already been addressed)</p>

<p>I will preempt any questions by saying: I will <em>not</em> be publishing the actual code for this framework online. The purpose of these posts is to describe the problems and solutions, but implementing them will be left up to you. I will have small embedded snippets to illustrate concepts, but largely the entire thing will be left as an “exercise for the reader”. There’s just no substitute for sitting down and writing the code yourself.</p>

<p>But… before we get started in Swift, we need to answer a really fundamental question.</p>

<h2 id="what-on-earth-is-http">What on earth is HTTP?</h2>

<p>HTTP, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">“Hypertext Transfer Protocol”</a>, is a specification for describing how two different systems can communicate with each other. As its name implies, it’s a <em>text</em>-based specification. This is great for humans, because text is nicely readable, and it’s good for machines, because text is pretty nicely compressible (which is a major part of the 2.0 specification).</p>

<p>HTTP defines a very specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response">“request/response”</a> model. You send out a request for information, and you get a response back. One request, one response.</p>

<p>A request has the following format:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A request line</li>
  <li>Zero-or-more header value lines</li>
  <li>A blank line</li>
  <li>An optional body</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="request-lines">Request Lines</h3>

<p>A request line looks something like:</p>



<p>The first part of the line is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods">request method</a>. We’re most familiar with <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>, but other common HTTP methods include things like <code>HEAD</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, and so on. In reality, the HTTP spec itself does not place a limit on the value of the request method, which allows for specs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> (which powers CalDAV and CardDAV) to add their own methods like <code>COPY</code>, <code>LOCK</code>, <code>PROPFIND</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>This leads us to the simplest of problems with a lot of Swift networking frameworks. It’s really common to see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>enum</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>get</span> <span>=</span> <span>"GET"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>"POST"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>put</span> <span>=</span> <span>"PUT"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>delete</span> <span>=</span> <span>"DELETE"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the HTTP spec allows for <em>any</em> single-word method, defining this value in Swift as an <em>enum</em> is incorrect, because an enum only allows for a finite number of values, but there are an infinite number of possible “single word” values. A <em>better</em> implementation of this is to use a <code>struct</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>struct</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>:</span> <span>Hashable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>get</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"POST"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>put</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"PUT"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>delete</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"DELETE"</span><span>)</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>let</span> <span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After the method comes the path, which should be readily recognizable as the <code>.path</code> of a <code>URL</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s a bit about which HTTP spec version you’re using. HTTP 2.0 is commonly used these days, but since it mainly deals with <em>compressed</em> HTTP requests, I’ll use the 1.1 version, which describes <em>uncompressed</em> requests.</p>



<p>Headers are a series of key-value pairs, in a familiar key-value-looking format:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Host: swapi.dev
Connection: close
User-Agent: Paw/3.1.10 (Macintosh; OS X/10.15.5) GCDHTTPRequest
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">header fields commonly used with HTTP</a>, some of them defined by the specs, and some agreed upon by convention. Like with request methods, there’s no limit to the possible names of a header, nor much of a limit on the possible values.</p>

<h3 id="the-body">The Body</h3>

<p>Any HTTP request may include a body. Yes, even a <code>GET</code> request is allowed to include a body. However, most servers will only interpret the body of a request based on which request method is used, so it’s likely that even if you did include a body with a <code>GET</code> requests, the server would ignore it.</p>

<p>The body itself is just raw binary data. How it’s interpreted by the server depends entirely on conventions agreed upon between the server engineers and the client engineers.</p>

<h2 id="putting-a-request-together">Putting a request together</h2>

<p>If we want to execute a basic HTTP request to the <a href="https://swapi.dev/">Star Wars API</a>, we would construct an HTTP request that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GET /api/ HTTP/1.1
Host: swapi.dev
Connection: close
User-Agent: Paw/3.1.10 (Macintosh; OS X/10.15.5) GCDHTTPRequest

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see the request line, 3 header lines, and an empty line at the end. It’s important to note that every line in an HTTP request is separated by <em>two</em> characters: <code>\r\n</code> (carriage return + line feed). This becomes more apparent when we look at the hex representation of this request (newlines inserted for readability):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>474554202F6170692F20485454502F312E310D0A 
486F73743A2073776170692E6465760D0A
436F6E6E656374696F6E3A20636C6F73650D0A 
557365722D4167656E743A205061772F332E312E313020284D6163696E746F73683B204F5320582F31302E31352E35292047434448545450526571756573740D0A
0D0A
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>0D</code> and <code>0A</code> are the hexadecimal representation of <code>\r</code> and <code>\n</code>, respectively. The empty line is how an HTTP server knows where the headers stop and the body begins.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an aside, if you find yourself working with network APIs a lot, I <em>highly</em> recommend using Lucky Marmot’s fantastic app <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a>. It is an indispensable tool for analyzing and tweaking network calls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another thing worth pointing out here is that <code>Host:</code> header. While it’s required by the spec, it doesn’t necessarily specify where the request is going. That’s because the host part of the URL is used before the request is ever sent by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS resolution process</a> as part of the whole “what server am I actually connecting to” flow. The <code>Host</code> header is included for clarity while debugging, and it may be used by the server for further internal routing. For example, you could imagine a server for all of Github Pages using the <code>Host</code> header to know which set of pages you actually want.</p>

<p>So, that’s the request.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-response">What about the response?</h2>

<p>The response we get back is almost identical in structure to the request. It has:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The response line</li>
  <li>Zero or more header value lines</li>
  <li>An empty line</li>
  <li>An optional body</li>
</ol>

<p>So, that request to the Star Wars API will have a response that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.16.1
Date: Sat, 27 Jun 2020 19:13:53 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: close
Vary: Accept, Cookie
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
ETag: "57e8c3fe1ac5cb74e15b96dc98767ce6"
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000

{"people":"http://swapi.dev/api/people/","planets":"http://swapi.dev/api/planets/","films":"http://swapi.dev/api/films/","species":"http://swapi.dev/api/species/","vehicles":"http://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/","starships":"http://swapi.dev/api/starships/"}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Like with the request, all lines are separated by <code>\r\n</code>, and the empty line is how we know where the headers stop and the body begins. The only other difference is that the first line now has an integer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">status code</a> and a textual description of the code’s meaning.</p>

<p>Like with request methods, there’s no real limit on the status code values and message. The HTTP spec defines many that we’re familiar with, such as <code>200</code> (OK) and <code>404</code> (Not Found), as well as the allowed range of numbers (100 … 599). But… you <em>could</em> return a <code>666 Diabolical</code> code, or <code>42 Mostly Harmless</code> code. You could even return a <code>200 👍</code> response. But please don’t. 😅</p>

<p>The body, again, is raw binary data and it’s up to the recipient to correctly interpret it. The Star Wars API body is JSON-encoded text, but a body can just as easily be the raw bytes of a <code>.jpg</code> file, or the XML bytes of an RSS feed, or the text that describes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U">HTTP live streaming playlist</a>.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h2>

<p>That’s an overview of HTTP requests and responses. This simple model describes the fundamental communications used by most of the internet. It doesn’t cover things like web sockets or push notifications, but this is used by every website and most network APIs. Knowing the details of how this works continues to be one of the most valuable and consistently useful things I know and use as a software engineer.</p>

<p>In the next post, we’ll take a look at how we move from this specification to the basic structures we’ll need for our framework.</p>

                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Last year we had a three part blog series about Qt's new approach to working with 3D graphics APIs and shading languages: <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-2">part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-3">part 3</a>. For <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-index.html">Qt Quick</a>, an early, opt-in preview of the new rendering architecture was shipped in Qt 5.14, with some improvements in Qt 5.15. With the release of Qt 6.0 upcoming, let's see what has happened since Qt 5.15. It will not be possible to cover every detail of the graphics stack improvements for Qt Quick here, let alone dive into the vast amount of Qt Quick 3D features, many of which are new or improved in Qt 6.0. Rather, the aim is just to give an overview of what can be expected from the graphics stack perspective when Qt 6.0 ships later this year.</p>
<p>Note that the documentation links refer to the Qt 6 snapshot documentation. This allows seeing the latest C++ and QML API pages, including all changed and new functions, but the content is also not final. These links may also break later on.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>QRhi improvements</h2>
<p>QRhi, the Qt Rendering Hardware Interface, is Qt's internal graphics abstraction when 3D APIs, such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D, are involved. Compared to 5.15, the main improvements in 6.0 are a lot of polishing fixes here and there, and, most importantly, a large set of performance optimizations. While benefitting Qt Quick as well, these become especially important with Qt Quick 3D when complex scenes with many renderable objects are involved.</p>
<p>With some simplifications, the main layers of the Qt 6.0 graphics stack can be visualized like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png" alt="rhiarch-3" width="800" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 400w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 800w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1200&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1600&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2000&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2000w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>Shader management</h2>
<p>The Qt Shader Tools module is now a selectable module in the installer. For applications this can be relevant because this is the module that provides the <em>qsb</em> command-line tool (not to be confused with <em>qbs</em>) and its associated CMake build system integration. In addition, the module is a mandatory dependency for Qt Quick 3D at the moment.</p>
<p>Qt 6 no longer uses OpenGL-compatible GLSL source snippets directly. Rather, shaders are all written in Vulkan-style GLSL, then reflected and translated to other shading languages, and finally packaged up into a serializable QShader object that can be consumed by QRhi. The shader preparation pipeline in Qt 6 is the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png" alt="shaderconditioning" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=640&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1920&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=2560&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3200&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3840&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>In QML applications using Qt Quick, whenever working with ShaderEffect, or subclassing QSGMaterialShader, the application will need to provide a baked shader pack in form of a .qsb file. These are generated by the <em>qsb</em> tool. This does not however mean that developers have to start dealing with a new tool directly: with the CMake integration one can easily list the vertex, fragment, and compute shaders in CMakeLists.txt via the qt6_add_shaders() CMake function. Invoking qsb and packing the resulting .qsb files into the Qt resource system is then taken care of by the build system.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtshadertools-index.html">the shadertools documentation</a> for an overview of how graphics and compute shaders are handled in Qt 6 and the details of the qsb tool and its CMake integration.</p>
<h2>Direct OpenGL is no more for Qt Quick</h2>
<p>In Qt 5.14 and 5.15, Qt Quick shipped with an optional QRhi-based rendering path that could be enabled by setting the environment variable <em>QSG_RHI</em>. This allowed painless experimenting with the new stack, while keeping the traditional, battle tested direct OpenGL code path the default.</p>
<p>In Qt 6.0 all such switches are gone. There is no way get rendering go directly to OpenGL with Qt Quick scenes. Rather, the new default is the QRhi-based rendering path of the Qt Quick scene graph. Other than the defaults changing, the ways to configure what QRhi backend, and so which graphics API to use are mostly unchanged compared to Qt 5.15. See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#rendering-via-the-qt-rendering-hardware-interface">the documentation</a> for details. One difference is better API naming: in C++ code to request, and so effectively tie the application to, a given QRhi backend (and by extension graphics API) is now done through the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#setGraphicsApi">QQuickWindow::setGraphicsApi()</a> function, whereas in 5.15 this task used to be pushed onto an overload of setSceneGraphBackend(), leading to fairly inaccurate naming.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications, although many applications will not notice any of these. If an application uses neither shader code (ShaderEffect, QSGMaterial) nor does it perform its own rendering with OpenGL directly, there is a very high chance that it will need no migration steps at all. (at least not because of graphics)</p>
<h4>Applications using OpenGL directly</h4>
<p>What about applications that use OpenGL directly in one way or another, and are not interested in functioning with other graphics APIs? For example, applications that use <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickframebufferobject.html">QQuickFramebufferObject</a>, or connect to signals like <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRendering">QQuickWindow::beforeRendering()</a> to inject their own OpenGL rendering under or above the Qt Quick scene. This is when the setGraphicsApi() function mentioned above comes into play for real: if an application wishes, it can always state that it wants OpenGL (or Vulkan, or Metal, or D3D) only, and nothing else. That way it is guaranteed that Qt Quick is going to use the corresponding QRhi backend (or else it will fail to initialize), so the application can safely assume that going directly to OpenGL is safe, because Qt Quick will also end up rendering through OpenGL. Note that this does not exempt the application from having to do other type of porting steps: for example, if it in addition uses ShaderEffect or creates its own custom materials, it will still need to migrate to the new ways of handling shaders and materials.</p>
<h4>QSG* and QQuick* API changes</h4>
<p>The API changes mainly fall into 3 categories. This is not going to be an exhaustive list, but rather just a peek at some of the important changes. Detailed change lists and porting guides are expected to be available with the final Qt 6.0 release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Different approach to shaders and materials: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgmaterialshader.html">QSGMaterialShader</a> received a full revamp (matching more or less what the now-removed QSGMaterialRhiShader used to be in 5.14 and 5.15). <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html">ShaderEffect</a> no longer allows inline shader strings. Rather, the vertexShader and fragmentShader properties are URLs, similarly to <span>Image.source</span> and others. They can refer to a local .qsb file, or a .qsb file embedded via the Qt resource system (qrc).</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing OpenGL-specifics from QQuickWindow, QSGTexture, and elsewhere. It should come as no surprise that functions like <em>GLuint textureId()</em>, <em>createTextureFromId(GLuint textureId, ...)</em>, or <em>setRenderTarget(GLuint fboId)</em> are now gone. Adopting (wrapping) an existing OpenGL texture, Vulkan image, Metal texture, or D3D11 texture, or accessing the underlying native texture for a QSGTexture is still perfectly possible, but now is done via a different set of APIs, such as <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-qsgvulkantexture.html">QSGVulkanTexture</a> and the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-sub-qtquick.html">other similar classes</a>, instances of which are <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgtexture.html?__hstc=233546881.8510e053e4fb66e1a58543a6e9886427.1603454017210.1603454017210.1603454017210.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1603454017210&amp;__hsfp=1285229618#nativeInterface" rel="noopener">queryable from QSGTexure</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Integrating the application's own custom rendering with the graphics API that Qt Quick renders with is fully supported, not just for OpenGL, but also Vulkan, Metal, and D3D11. Due to their nature however, some of these APIs will need more than connecting to one single signal like beforeRendering() or afterRendering(). For example, we now also have <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRenderPassRecording">beforeRenderPassRecording()</a>. See the relevant section in the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#mixing-scene-graph-and-the-native-graphics-api">scenegraph overview docs</a> for more details and links to examples. Finally, the number of native graphics resources queryable via <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgrendererinterface.html">QSGRendererInterface</a> has been extended, now covering Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D too.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending support for redirecting the Qt Quick scene into an offscreen render target. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/%3Ehttps://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendercontrol.html">QQuickRenderControl</a> and the related infrastructure has been heavily enhanced. This was done not just to enable working with graphics APIs other than OpenGL the same way as in Qt 5 (for example, to render a Qt Quick scene into a Vulkan VkImage without an on-screen window), but also to enable integration with AR/VR frameworks and APIs such as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/openxr/">OpenXR</a> (in combination with any of Vulkan, D3D11, or OpenGL). Besides the slightly changed QQuickRenderControl interface, we now have a number of helper classes that improve the configurability of a QQuickWindow: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendertarget.html">QQuickRenderTarget</a>, <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsdevice.html">QQuickGraphicsDevice</a>, and <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsconfiguration.html">QQuickGraphicsConfiguration</a>. These are essential in scenarios where a more fine grained control is needed: integrating with APIs like OpenXR is not always straightforward when an existing rendering engine is involved, with a number of potential chicken-egg problems when it comes to the creation, initialization, and ownership of instance, device, and other graphics objects: Which Vulkan instance should Qt Quick use, or should it create a new one upon initializing the scenegraph for the first time? Which Vulkan physical device or DXGI adapter should Qt Quick pick, or just stay with the default? Which VkDevice extensions should be enabled in addition to what Qt itself needs? What 2D image/texture should rendering target, who creates that and when? The expectation is that Qt 6.0 will be well-prepared and providing the foundations for further exploring the world of AR/VR during the rest of the Qt 6.x series.</p>

<h4>New approach to handling shader code in ShaderEffect</h4>
<p>A comprehensive example of the new approach to shader code in ShaderEffect is the Qt 6 port of the classic Qt 5 Cinematic Experience demo. <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience" rel="noopener">(GitHub repo)</a> This version is ported to CMake and is fully functional with all graphics APIs, including all shader and particle effects.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png" alt="cinematic" width="702" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=351&amp;name=cinematic.png 351w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png 702w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1053&amp;name=cinematic.png 1053w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1404&amp;name=cinematic.png 1404w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1755&amp;name=cinematic.png 1755w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=2106&amp;name=cinematic.png 2106w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></p>
<p>Looking at the QML source code, for example the code for the <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/blob/master/content/CurtainEffect.qml" rel="noopener">curtain effect </a>shows that indeed it has all inline GLSL strings removed.</p>

	<section>
		<p>I am a notorious note-taker. Over the years, I've learned not to rely solely on my (or anyone else's) memory but to create well structured, concise, and adequately labeled notes for future use. It's not only required to preserve the knowledge, but it helps you develop some valuable abilities &amp; skills, e.g.:</p><ul><li>synthesis of information</li><li>clarity of thought</li><li>proper application of mental models</li><li>crafting a visual structure that carries the supplementary information</li><li>sketching :)</li></ul><p>I've tried various techniques of note-taking. Friction-less apps like Bear, personal knowledge management tools like Notion, audio recorders like Otter, outlining tools like Workflowy, Zettelkasten-inspired research tools like Roam or Obsidian. All of them have their pros, I still use some of them daily for specific purposes (Notion, Roam), but none of them has beaten the <strong>fundamental advantages</strong> of a thin sheet of paper:</p><ul><li>minimum latency (&amp; inertia)</li><li>maximum flexibility (when it comes to notation &amp; form - nothing is enforced)</li></ul><p>Obviously, <strong>paper has its flaws</strong> as well:</p><ul><li>it's immutable</li><li>digitizing it is a manual, cumbersome process</li><li>full freedom of what you draw/write/scribble is fantastic, but sometimes it would save a lot of time to have a library of stencils/templates</li><li>inventorizing the notes properly (so they're searchable/navigable in scale) is not easy</li><li>making cross-content references is also a pain</li></ul><p>Is it possible to have a solution <strong>with the advantages of paper but devoid of its flaws</strong>? In my quest to answer this question, I've decided to reach for an e-ink tablet named <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">reMarkable 2</a>.</p><hr><p>It's the 2nd iteration of that concept. I was considering a purchase of the previous generation one, but in the end, I've passed because of the high price and moderately enthusiastic reviews on the Internet. According to its creators' declaration, the new edition is supposed to fix its predecessor's flaws. And the price tag is much more wallet-friendly.</p><p>So in the end I've decided to give it a go. The production and delivery cycle has been delayed due to COVID-19 (by two months), but I've finally received my device, used it for few weeks, and can now provide you my initial review.</p><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Before I dive into the actual details - what precisely did I order? Apart from the tablet itself (there's just one model, no options/variants), I've picked the marker (more expensive version - with the eraser) and a folio case (opens like a book, covers full tablet).</p><p>I'll spare you all the specification details - screen density, dimensions, weight, etc. - you can find all of those at the manufacturer's site. I'd like to focus on impressions &amp; conclusions only.</p><p>IMHO the hardware quality is on par with <strong>Amazon Kindle Oasis 2</strong> - the e-book reader I use daily for a long time. Solid, sturdy, durable, thin &amp; aesthetic. No cheap plastic elements. The only visible differences between Oasis and reMarkable 2 (except for the size) are the lack of screen backlight and turn-page buttons. </p><p>Additional observations:</p><ol><li>the screen is not automatically turned on/off when closing the folio case - TBH I don't find it a significant flaw</li><li>the marker is attached magnetically to the side of the tablet - it snaps precisely, exactly when expected, and it doesn't drop off randomly - zero complaints here</li></ol><hr><p>Marker is not required to use reMarkable 2, but TBH using the tablet w/o it kind of misses the whole point. It's supposed to be <strong>a note-taking device, not an e-book reader</strong>. You've been probably waiting for that, so I'm not stalling anymore: the marker works surprisingly well - both accuracy and latency are more than acceptable:</p><ul><li>I don't remember getting frustrated that the effect of my scribbling doesn't match my intent (<u>precision</u>)</li><li>the <u>feedback</u> is nearly instantaneous - I didn't have a feeling I'm intentionally slowing down (writing or scribbling) to compensate for any device's speed deficiencies</li><li>the speed (of a move, while marker touches the surface) doesn't affect the <u>accuracy</u> (fluidity) - lines remain continuous, without gaps or other inaccuracies</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Btw. the marker has a removable rod at its tip - that's the only surface that touches the screen when scribbling. I can't tell how quickly it wears out, but you get a few spare ones as replacements. So far, I didn't notice any scratches on the e-ink screen - let's hope it stays that way.</p><p>My marker (the more expensive version) theoretically works like a pencil with an eraser at the opposite end. That's the theory - in practice, it turns out that you can't rub (to erase), but you need to poke. It's not only unintuitive but also quite slow. However - it works.</p><p>Overall, reMarkable 2 hardware doesn't disappoint - it provides <u><strong>a solid base to meet expectations</strong></u>, but TBH there was no <em>"wow effect"</em> - I didn't have a feeling of handling a breakthrough <em>"next-gen"</em> device.</p><p>There are three pieces of software to evaluate pretty much independently:</p><ol><li>Tablet firmware</li><li>PC companion app</li><li>Chrome extension</li></ol><h3 id="tablet-firmware">Tablet firmware</h3><p>Needless to say, good hardware is crap w/o decent software (on the device). Surprisingly reMarkable 2 <strong>doesn't shine here</strong>. Tablet's software is very minimalistic (which is not an issue <em>per se</em>) - you can read e-books and make notes, but the software doesn't do much to improve/expand the experience:</p><ul><li>no dictionaries/Wiki support</li><li>no bookmarking/indexing</li><li>three colors (black, one shade of grey, white) for note-taking :(</li><li>the surface for scribbling is fixed (forget about infinite whiteboard ...) and in fact rather small (but you can easily add more sheets, of course)</li><li>OCR functionality is limited - whole page or nothing</li><li>there's zero integration with popular note-taking tools/platforms (like Evernote or OneNote) - all you can do is to export to image formats like PNG</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_4.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_4.jpg 600w"></figure><p>Unfortunately, I've encountered <strong>few bugs/inconsistencies</strong> as well:</p><ol><li>there were misleading synchronization messages (<em>"failed but succeeded"</em> style of communication ;P)</li><li>once I've tried to change font settings for an article sent via Chrome extension (it was a part of Apache Arrow specification), the device started rebooting repeatedly (about five times) - I was able to replicate the issue</li></ol><hr><p>But to be honest, there are <strong>some pros worth mentioning</strong> as well:</p><ol><li>You can scribble over your e-books (!) - underline, highlight, add comments on margins. It works like a charm, is very convenient, but TBH I didn't check how foolproof it is (e.g., what happens with the notes if I adjust margin settings, so page numeration changes ...).</li><li>There's a nice variety of "pens" available - ones that imitate pencils, brushes, highlighters, or markers - I find the selection wide enough for my needs.</li><li>It's possible to add transparent layers, so you can scribble on one without affecting others.</li><li>One can also use one of many available templates (stencils) for the full pages (only): tables, grids, checklists, organizers, even perspective "helpers" or guitar chord sheets.</li><li>Selecting content is super-convenient - you just draw a shape around an item ("magic lasso" style), and then you can scale, rotate or cut the selection.</li><li>You need to get used to erasing stuff - it's impossible to "select" elements by "clicking"; you need either to use the selection tool or the opposite tip of your marker (if you have the expensive version).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="pc-companion-app">PC companion app</h3><p>What about the PC companion app? I've tried the Windows version, and it ... just works. Its primary purpose is to upload e-books, and it does it in quite a convenient way - you don't need to plug the device to your PC (with USB cable), because it sends the e-book over the Internet.</p><p>When it comes to e-books, two formats are supported: PDF and epub. I have literally zero complaints regarding PDFs - due to the larger screen, the user experience (of reading PDF) was much more pleasant than with <strong>Amazon Kindle Oasis 2</strong>. But my epubs were rendered poorly, like if someone has stripped all the formatting and converted the rich text to raw text. Frankly, I can't tell whether it's the issue with epub format or reMarkable 2, because I've never used epub before (only mobi), but the effect was disappointing anyway.</p><h3 id="the-browser-extension">The browser extension</h3><p>The browser extension is available only for Chrome (sadly). All it does is send whatever page you're reading to your reMarkable 2 as either raw text or PDF (it uses PDF print functionality built into Chrome). I've already mentioned issues with changing font settings for raw text articles. Hopefully, this gets fixed soon.</p><p>I guess it's time to round things up.</p><p><strong>reMarkable 2</strong> is a great piece of hardware that needs some improvement of the software powering it. I dreamed of using it as a minimum-friction note-taking <em>"front-end"</em> for powerful knowledge management platforms I use, but it's very cumbersome at this point. It's a standalone device, <strong>reMarkable 2</strong> isn't even trying to either attach to any existing app ecosystem or creating its own (challenger) one.</p><p>That's a big disappointment. But I believe that CAN be fixed; the potential is still there. The device's essential features - <u>high responsiveness</u>, <u>remarkable accuracy</u>, and <u>low latency times</u> - are there: confirmed and unquestionable.</p><p>What kind of improvements would I gladly see? Here are some ideas:</p><ol><li>OCR for selection - replaces scribbling (in-place) with recognized text</li><li>Import/export from popular knowledge management tools</li><li>Remove the fixed boundaries of quick notes scribbling space (make it "virtually infinite")</li><li>Casting/transmitting the content of the device e.g. to computer screen in real-time (e.g. to present for the larger audience or just collaborate remotely)</li><li>Stencil library for shapes (e.g. sticky notes, basic icons, elements of the most popular visual notations)</li><li>Better UX for syncing stuff (on the tablet) - e.g. force sync button</li></ol><p>What I think is beyond the capabilities of reMarkable 2 (even with regular software updates)?</p><ol><li>More colors (I don't believe they've reduced it to 3 for kicks and giggles ...)</li><li>"Objectualizing" parts of the note and adding dynamic connectors between them (e.g. flows, arrows, lines) that adjust when objects are moved</li></ol><hr><p><strong>So, was it worth it (the price tag)?</strong></p><p>I honestly can't tell at this point. In time I will know …</p></section></article></div>

<p>… or failures are your friends :&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;INTRO&gt;</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>&lt;/INTRO&gt;</p>
<p>The story behind this whole post is a bit lengthy but I’ll try to be brief 🙂</p>
<p>In August of 2019, I’ve received an email from MrTrinsic. Back then, I didn’t yet know what is coming lol.</p>
<p>It turned out that MrTrinsic is a great Amiga enthusiast and he’d asked me to work on his Amiga 1000 … but no on a standard A1000 but with an Amiga 1000 Phoenix motherboard!</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix Enhanced mobo is an extremely rare motherboard replacement for Amiga 1000. Some people think there were no more than 200 units manufactured, others say it was no more than 2000. I’ve no idea either but still, it is very rare so a magic smoke is not an option lol.</p>
<p>This motherboard is an awesome hack in itself and that is why MrTrinsic refers to it as DIVA 😀</p>
<p>Let me quote an excerpt from one of emails.</p>
<p><em>You should mention or point out more clearly that the Phoenix Board is a … DIVA!<br>It is a hack. Just look at the manual what kind of things you can modify and what kind of headers there are to change stuff.<br>The price is that it has an extremely bad signal quality. Plus, it lacks the Buster-Chip that the Amiga 2000 has.<br>The Phoenix is a bad version of the original A2000 from Braunschweig, which in itself was a hacked and beefed-up version of the A1000.<br>Plus, the Phoenix only has two layers. It’s a nightmare as we have seen.</em></p>
<p>It simply always has some problems like stability and compatibility issues which I’ve tried to sort out.</p>
<p>Phoenix mobo was developed in 1989/1990 by our fellow friends from Australia and was one of the very first crowd-funding campaigns! You can read/watch more on one of my fav websites -&gt; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?t=476" target="_blank">www.amigalove.com</a></p>
<p>Hardware specs are available here -&gt;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amiga.resource.cx/exp/phoenix" target="_blank"> amiga.resource.cx</a></p>
<h4>The plan</h4>
<p>Initially, MrTrinsic asked me to work on some external floppy replacements by Dell which I will cover in another post. Once I’ve figured out that floppy drive issue he’d decided we should start working on The Phoenix project.</p>
<p>At first, he’d send me a large box with gear that he wanted to have in this Amiga. I was like OMG! Not only Phoenix but the whole large project was about to begin!</p>
<p>The plan was to run lots of modern hardware add-ons with Amiga 1000 Phoenix and later try to squeeze it into a nice looking case, plus make it alive and stable.</p>
<p>The first package arrived and I was really excited by what I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix in an A1000 case with lots of mods and hacks already installed, plus, tons of other hardware mods still in boxes … and that was only for starters …</p>

<p>Obviously, the original plan was to MAKE Amiga 1000 Phoenix GREAT AGAIN!</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the main goal was to run a graphics card along with <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA500plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA500plus</a> + <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by iComp</p>
<p>On top of tons of other minor hardware mods, He’d also sent me two graphic cards – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shop.mntmn.com/products/zz9000-for-amiga-preorder" target="_blank">ZZ9000 by MNT</a> and GBAPII++ by KryoFlux.</p>

<h4>Running it</h4>
<p>First things first. Phoenix motherboard is so rare that I first had to learn how it works and how it is all connected etc.</p>
<p>As it gave me a black screen at the very first run, I had to start learning about jumper settings and the board in general</p>
<p>Below, you can see a block diagram of particular parts location to give you an idea of what is where.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of course, I would not move on quickly without MrTrinsics support. He’d pointed me to several sites and sent over some more info about the board itself. One of the most important documents I’ve received was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/phoenix_jumpers_english.pdf" target="_blank">the jumper settings file</a> along with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Phoenix.pdf" target="_blank">original manual</a>.</p>
<p>The above documents gave me the general idea of how things should work. The very first thing that I did was the removal of all added mods. I’ve then tried to run the A1K but still no luck – black screen. MrTrinsic then pointed me to jumper L35 which could cause such behavior if set incorrectly and bingo! It worked! </p>
<p>Since Phoenix has slots for more than one ROM chip, it is possible to install three KickStarts – 1.3. and 3.1 and third as a custom option. That was already done, along with a switch hack.</p>

<p>The problem was that Amiga wasn’t starting every single time. Instead, it booted every couple of times. My next move was to take it out and try running it outside of the case. This is where I’ve started noticing all the awesome texts on the PCB itself. I took PCB out started shooting pics of those texts and greetz for various hackers of that era.</p>

<p>Next, I’ve checked for any obvious problems and when I was happy with this inspection, I’ve put it back to a case to simply avoid any accidental short circuits caused by beer-drinking ;P</p>
<p>I’ve decided that I will try to run it with only Indivision ECS2, and KryoFlux GBAPII++ inserted.</p>
<p>I’ve then located the switch setting for the first ROM and put an awesome<a href="http://www.diagrom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DiagROM by John “<em>Chucky</em>” Hertell</a> in a socket. Yeah, I know, it is a quite a large resistor ;P</p>

<p>To my surprise, it worked flawlessly and I was greeted by a known diag info and a menu a bit later.</p>

<p>Once it worked, I’ve figured that it might be as simple as a flaky ROM socket problem. I’ve put a 2.0 ROM in the place of DiagROM and Viola! It works!</p>

<p>When I’ve figured that part out, I could move on and start working on the alternative power supply which was …</p>
<h4>HDPLEX + Uber nice Amiga adapter</h4>
<p>MrTrinsic sent me this HQ HDPLEX Pico PSU but he’d also sent me a very cool DIY KIT – ATX2.0d-Amiga adapter which has super cool features like over-voltage/current protection outputs all needed voltages, and has additional floppy power outputs. Moreover, it generates a TICK signal which is good to have for testing.</p>
<p>However, it was a DIY KIT so I had to solder it all up first.</p>

<p>Combined together, it created an awesome and stable power source for this Amiga project.</p>

<p>All I needed to do next was to prepare all the wiring. That was a trivial job after taking some measurements. I’ve used wires from my Nissan Patrol spare wiring kit as these are thick (copper) and nice, hence the color mismatch ;P</p>

<p>It worked like a charm so now I had two working power supplies – original and superior to it HDPLEX with a kickass adapter.</p>
<h4>030 cards</h4>
<p>The next step was about adding 68030 CPU to the system. I had two options as MrTrinsic sent me two different solutions.</p>
<p>The First solution was an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://icomp.de/shop-icomp/en/produkt-details/product/ACA500plus.html" target="_blank">ACA500plus</a> card along with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank">an ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by Individual Computers. ACA500plus also had an Ethernet add-on – X-Surf 500</p>
<p>These two make a great solution but for AMIGA 500. There are not many folks out there who played it with it in an A1000 and especially with a Phoenix mobo!</p>

<p>Then I’ve added ACA1233n on an EXTREMELY WANTED DURING PANDEMIC stand 😀 😀 😀</p>

<p>To my surprise, it worked!</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/GtUMP6a.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/GtUMP6a.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/imgur.com/GbOnzwF.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/imgur.com/GbOnzwF.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Below, a demo running on this setup</p>
<figure><p><span><iframe width="900" height="507" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJYyBRBnhu8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>
<p>The second setup was a bit different. It is made of four devices.</p>
<ul><li>Open 68000 relocator card</li><li>68030 accelerator card </li><li>SDRam + IDE interface</li><li>IDE2CF interface</li></ul>
<p>This setup also appeared to be working nicely after some tests, however as MrTrinsic pointed out, it has some stability issues and will not allow running some software so it was a backup card in case ACA failed. I don’t have a video of it running though.</p>

<h4>Other mods and add-ons</h4>
<p>Once accel-cards were tested, I’ve started installing OS and testing other mods. To name the few:</p>
<ul><li>X-surf 500 Ethernet card</li><li>RapidRoad USB</li><li>Indivision ECS v2</li><li>SCSI2SD </li><li>KryoFlux GBAPII++</li></ul>

<p>Indivision ECS v2 and SCSI2SD worked flawlessly so I started playing with other gear.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/p2dSIad.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/p2dSIad.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>After installing all the needed software I’ve finally managed to get an IP addr from my local DHCP server</p>

<p>Obviously, I wouldn’t be myself if I didn’t destroy something. I’ve accidentally connected the RapidRoad USB module to a clock port the other way around. The magic smoke appeared and…</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/LHLR7WY.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/LHLR7WY.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of course, I had to fix it. After a while, it turned out that only 3R3 resistor was fried.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/GdJIXWt.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/GdJIXWt.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>I’ve quickly replaced it and started testing USB functionality.</p>

<h4>GFX cards</h4>
<p>Once all other major mods were working more or less correctly, I could start testing GFX cards high-res modes.</p>
<p>This is where it all started to go wrong …</p>
<p>I had two cards to test with this setup – GBAPII++ by Kryoflux and ZZ9000 by MNT. </p>
<p>GBAPII++ worked nicely only with green 030 cards, but in such config, there would be no Ethernet card.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/GMNmuZ5.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/GMNmuZ5.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/x5aY8Sy.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/x5aY8Sy.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>Then I’ve tried running ZZ9000 along with green 030 and ACA cards but I’ve encountered autoconfig problems.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/olqS18u.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/olqS18u.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>Finally, I’ve focused on ACA500plus with ACA1233n and I just couldn’t make it work. </p>
<p>When ACA was inserted then GBAPII++ was completely invisible to the system.</p>
<p>After updating tons of libraries, firmware and reinstalling OS a few times without any luck, we’ve figured out that it might be a power issue. MrTrinsic ordered an adapter for A500 which would allow pumping in more power.</p>
<p>I’ve first tested it with a stock A500.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/AFRHzjv.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/AFRHzjv.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>Same story, GBAPII++ was invisible but I’ve checked it with A1K and power injector adapter just to be sure … unfortunately no luck again.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1hkTi44.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1hkTi44.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<h4>Unfinished 🙁</h4>
<p>I’ve invested weeks of time into this GFX problem research but finally, I had to give up on this project for now. It is still in an unfinished state until we will find a solution to all problems. The project is partially done but it requires more work and I hope to cover it someday in one of the future posts making Amiga 1000 Phoenix great again!</p>
<p>But worry not, this gave birth to a new project which is even more awesome.</p>
<p>Currently, it is a work-in-progress but that is a story for another blog post 🙂</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2Ftelemelt-FINAL.png?v=1601250432872" alt="Telemelt Logo"></p>
<p><a href="https://telemelt.com/">Telemelt</a> is a web-based multi-emulator (<a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>/<a href="https://www.libretro.com/">libretro</a>) designed to recreate the experience of playing console games with a single controller in a room full of friends.</p>
<p>Gathering around a TV and collectively attempting to beat a game has been a consistent joy throughout my life, and is one of the rituals I miss the most with the ones we're separated from right now. I wanted to create a way to play single player/hotseat games with friends remotely that was free and required minimal setup. Netplay has always been unsatisfying for this, since only the host had low enough latency for games that require tight timing. I started this project in March, and have been pouring my heart into it every day possible since then.<br>
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2F6dfcbe63-2f80-4bb3-a780-a48a51dc0a19.image.png?v=1602011998888" alt="collage"></p>
<p>The system skips traditional netplay to allow a single player to assume host responsibility and experience <strong>zero network latency</strong> for games with demanding response times, with the viewers processing frames as broadcasted by the player. The virtual controller/host can be instantly passed to any user in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Designed to be lowest hassle way to play emulated games with a friend or loved one, even if they are not tech savvy!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No port forwarding, no IP addresses thanks to auto-generated URL</li>
<li>No installation or downloads, everything works in browser</li>
<li>Mappings for common/inexpensive controllers (PS3/4, XB360/1, Switch JC/Pro etc..) on both USB/BT thanks to RetroArch bindings</li>
<li>Always free! No tracking, no logins, no paid advertisements - personal budget allocated for Azure costs to serve thousands of users for months</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2Fgiphy.gif?v=1602018705346" alt="Become Player"></p>
<p><strong>Focus on the experience of passing <em>a single controller</em> between people</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This allows for a unique and efficient architecture that provides a consistent experience with minimal bandwidth</li>
<li>No AV is transmitted! Only controller and serialized state data, made even smaller by <a href="https://github.com/phretaddin/schemapack">schemapack</a></li>
<li>User state error checked per frame and reconciled via <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> server if needed</li>
<li>Takes advantage of deterministic nature of certain libretro cores - like a broadcasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun">TAS</a></li>
<li>Rethink the kinds of content you would play (painting, music collaboration, RPGs, game shows)</li>
<li>Everyone working towards the same goal keeps people engaged</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/productivity-cover.png" alt="Productivity cover"></p><h2 id="what-is-productivity">What Is Productivity?</h2><p>Let’s define productivity first:</p><blockquote><p>Productivity represents the efficiency of a person to perform a specific task.</p></blockquote><p>We often think it is a state of constant efficiency that allows us to do everything faster and better, but this is wrong. <em>Productivity is a measurement per individual task.</em> With some assignments, you are very productive, while with others, your efficiency is terrible.</p><p>It’s because, for some tasks, you unconsciously are doing the right things, while for the others, you need to rethink your approach. And this also means that you can focus on those more important tasks and become more efficient at them.</p><p>At the end of this guide, you will have all the necessary knowledge to analyze your approach toward different assignments and make the corresponding adjustments to be more productive. It helped me <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/faang-preparation/">land an offer at facebook</a> and become a part of <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/iulian-gulea">Toptal</a> — one of the best freelance communities on the planet, and I hope that it will help you, too.</p><h2 id="the-four-levels-of-mastery">The Four Levels Of Mastery</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-of-mastery-1.png" alt="The Pyramid Of Mastery"></p><p>Before diving into different productivity techniques, let’s first dive into more details about the <em>essence</em> of productivity. And to do that, I will use the <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">Pyramid of Mastery</a> — a model that allows you to understand better a domain of interest, its constituent parts, and how to become an expert in it.</p><p>It does so by defining a domain through four types of entities:</p><ul><li><strong>Elements.</strong> These are the building blocks of the field of interest, that include concepts, ideas, and entities;</li><li><strong>Rules.</strong> These are the laws that govern a domain. This layer comprises both rules that define the interaction between various Elements as well as organizational and governing rules at the domain level;</li><li><strong>Tools.</strong> These are the instruments you use to perform the activities within a field;</li><li><strong>Frameworks.</strong> These are combinations of the above levels that allow for faster achievement of preset goals for which the Framework was created;</li></ul><p>For an in-depth explanation of the Pyramid of Mastery, you can read the original <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">article</a> on it.</p><p>Now, once you have an understanding of the model, let’s see how we can define productivity through the prism of it.</p><h2 id="productivity-elements">Productivity Elements</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-elements.png" alt="Pyramid of Mastery - Elements"></p><p>What are the Elements of productivity, the building blocks that you need to know about in order to excel at it?</p><p>I find this to be the most underestimated and overlooked layer. Very few people are thinking about what makes a productive person or about what productivity consists of. Instead, they try to squeeze in more time using tools, calendars, and other tools.</p><p>But knowing the fundamentals is vital if you want to become an expert in something. Therefore, here are some of the Elements that can help you be more productive if you understand them.</p><h3 id="human-senses">Human Senses</h3><p>Our senses are the only mechanisms that allow us to get information about the world around us. Humans have five main senses through which they receive information:</p><ul><li>Vision</li><li>Hearing</li><li>Touch</li><li>Smell</li><li>Taste</li></ul><p>Each sense has its own throughput:</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/conscious_attention_bit_sec.png#c" alt="Image with conscious attention throughput"></p><p>Therefore, we receive the most information visually, then through hearing, touch, smell, and taste.</p><p>If you are interested in the topic of human senses, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/human-senses/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="attention">Attention</h3><p>We receive a flood of information through our senses at every moment, but only a tiny bit of it reaches our awareness. This filter that orients our focus toward different stimuli is <strong>attention.</strong></p><p>Attention is the process that selects which sensory information is preferentially processed and ultimately reaches our awareness.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>There are two types of attention: <em>Goal-Directed</em> attention (GDA) and <em>Stimulus-Driven</em> attention (SDA). The GDA is the voluntary effort to focus on something, be it reading this article, cutting vegetables, watching a movie, or writing code.</p><p>On the other hand, SDA is the involuntary reaction toward stimuli that are salient enough to grab our attention:</p><ul><li>contrasting things (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.);</li><li>intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.);</li><li>certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.);</li></ul><p>If you are interested in the topic of attention, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/attention/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="working-memory">Working Memory</h3><p>For tasks that require cognitive effort, once we focused our attention on a specific subset of stimuli we got from our senses, it is only here that we can finally perform some mental work.</p><p>Working Memory is the place in our memory where we can consciously process and manipulate data. It has a fundamental limitation, though: its processing capacity is limited to ~4 chunks of information.</p><p>A <em>chunk</em> is a relative unit of measurement that depends on different factors, such as:</p><ul><li>familiarity with the topic;</li><li>complexity of the concept;</li><li>one’s mental agility;</li></ul><p>For instance, in the simple task of solving this simple math equation <code>21 * 2</code>, you have to store number <code>21</code> as a chunk, store number <code>2</code> as another chunk, then, having these 2 in your working memory, do the multiplication, and store the result <code>42</code> as a third chunk.</p><p>However, in a debate on “homeschooling vs. formal education,” both concepts each represent a chunk. As it is a complex concept, you can then zoom in or out on either of those as information is stored in a complex network of associations in our brain.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about working memory, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="long-term-memory">Long-Term Memory</h3><p>Our Long-Term Memory (LTM) holds all the information, knowledge, skills, plans, and memories. What you commit to the LTM can stay there for your whole life. Although there is a tendency to forget things, you can strengthen your memories using repetition.</p><h3 id="task-process">Task Process</h3><p>A task usually represents a specific result you want to achieve (e.g., write an article, build a website, create a marketing campaign, etc.). But behind any such assignment, there is a sequence of steps necessary to complete before you can say that you have done the task. It is called a <strong>process.</strong></p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/task-process.png" alt="Image of a task process"></p><p>Each step in the process is a smaller task that will advance you closer to your desired result.</p><p>Learn and understand the necessary steps needed to achieve the end goal — it will show you what you are doing well and where you are wasting your time. Besides this, it is always easier to follow a list of specific action steps rather than figure out what to do on the fly.</p><h3 id="domain-specific-elements">Domain Specific Elements</h3><p>Finally, since productivity is measured per task, it means that besides the Elements mentioned above, there are some domain-specific ones that you must also understand to be more effective.</p><p>And this is valid for all layers of the pyramid — you must know your domain of activity. Otherwise, you cannot be productive in it since you will have to learn a lot, and learning is a slow and effortful process in itself.</p><p>Now, once we have enumerated the primary elements, let’s discuss the Rules that govern the domain of productivity.</p><h2 id="productivity-rules">Productivity Rules</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-rules.png" alt="Pyramid of Mastery - Rules"></p><p>How the Elements we have enumerated interact? Here are some essential Rules that govern how we function and perform cognitive work.</p><h3 id="stimulus-driven-attention-overrides-goal-directed-attention">Stimulus-Driven Attention Overrides Goal-Directed Attention</h3><p>Imagine that while you are reading this article, you hear the sound of a breaking plate in the kitchen, which distracts you from reading. Or you are working on a report, and suddenly, the light starts to flash, thus distracting you from the job.</p><p>Stimulus-Driven attention can override your voluntary, Goal-Directed attention. This is bad news for productivity since, most of the time, working on a task means we have to engage this Goal-Directed attention to focus on some things consciously. And because those things might be boring, monotonous, or uninteresting, we can get distracted much easier by any unrelated stimulus.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/bright-shiny-objects.jpg#c" alt="Cartoon where dogs in a meeting are being distracted by a squirrel"></p><p>The following stimuli are all capable of distracting your Goal-Directed Attention:</p><ul><li>high-contrast changes in our environment (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.);</li><li>intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.);</li><li>some certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.);</li><li>“important” (e.g., one’s own name).</li></ul><h3 id="working-memory-is-physiologically-incapable-to-multitask">Working Memory Is Physiologically Incapable To Multitask</h3><p>Imagine you are in a warehouse with an immense storage capacity (that’s your Long-Term Memory), a single small table with four zones where any kind of work can be performed (that’s your Working Memory), and a storekeeper who does all the work and knows where everything is stored. One constraint is that the storekeeper can work <em>only</em> at the table, so you must first put it there before doing anything.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/working-memory-analogy.png#c" alt="Image of a table with four zones and a storekeeper"></p><p>Each chunk takes one slot on the table. And you can get it either from your senses (imagine a conveyor system that brings things directly to your table) or search in the warehouse (which takes time).</p><p>Suppose you are working on a report. The storekeeper searches for relevant information in your Long-Term memory, puts it on the table, takes some from the conveyor, and puts it on the table as well, where they can manipulate, combine, dissect, and mix those concepts.</p><p>But suddenly, you are being called by your spouse regarding the plans for the weekend. Ideally, the storekeeper should take the time to carefully take the chunks off the table and put them in a dedicated place where they can find them later. In reality, however, the storekeeper sweeps off in a hurry everything from the table and rushes to put on it chunks related to plans for the weekend: movies, cuisine, activities, etc.</p><p>Then, when you are done talking with your spouse, you stare blankly at the computer screen, trying to recall what you were doing before the call. The storekeeper runs hysterically around the table in these moments, trying to find out something, but they don’t know what exactly to look for. Finally, you see the opened MS Excel window and remember you were working on the report.</p><p>But then another problem arises. You cannot recall the latest thoughts you had just before the call. The storekeeper cannot find the chunks they swept off the table. They looked everywhere, but the chunks just vanished. And …</p></div></div>

<p>PHP 8 is already in it's release candidate stage, with RC 3 being released on October 29th, and the general availability release targeted for November 26th. So it is time to take a look at all the new and upcoming features of PHP 8. You can take a look at PHP 8's <a href="https://wiki.php.net/todo/php80">release schedule here</a>.</p>
<p>Every feature that you see in this blogpost comes with an interactive embedded editor, where you can modify the PHP code and evaluate the results yourself.</p>
<p>The official upgrade guide can be found on <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.0/UPGRADING">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>A union type accepts values of multiple different types, rather than a single one.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
 
class Number {
    private int|float $number;
 
    public function setNumber(int|float $number): void {
        $this-&gt;number = $number;
    }
 
    public function getNumber(): int|float {
        return $this-&gt;number;
    }

<h2 id="added-weakmap-a-hrefhttpswikiphpnetrfcweak-mapsrfca">Added WeakMap (<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/weak_maps">RFC</a>) <a href="#added-weakmap-a-hrefhttpswikiphpnetrfcweak-mapsrfca">#</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Weak maps allow creating a map from objects to arbitrary values (similar to SplObjectStorage) without preventing the objects that are used as keys from being garbage collected. If an object key is garbage collected, it will simply be removed from the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very useful new feature, as it allows users to worry even less about leaving memory leaks in their code. While this might not be an issue for most PHP developers, it is certainly something to watch out for when writing long-running processes, for example using ReactPHP. With WeakMaps, references to an object automatically get garbage collected, once the object is no longer available.</p>
<p>If you would do the same thing with an array, you would still have a reference to the object, thus leaking memory.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
 

class FooBar {
    public WeakMap $cache;
    
    public function __construct() {
    	$this-&gt;cache = new WeakMap();
    }
 
    public function getSomethingWithCaching(object $obj) {
        return $this-&gt;cache[$obj] ??= $this-&gt;computeSomethingExpensive($obj);
    }
    
    public function computeSomethingExpensive(object $obj) {
		dump("I got called");
		return rand(1, 100);
    }
}

$cacheObject = new stdClass;

$obj = new FooBar;
// "I got called" only will be printed once
$obj-&gt;getSomethingWithCaching($cacheObject);
$obj-&gt;getSomethingWithCaching($cacheObject);

dump(count($obj-&gt;cache));

// When unsetting our object, the WeakMap frees up memory
unset($cacheObject);

dump(count($obj-&gt;cache));

exit;
</pre>
</pre>
<h2 id="new-codevalueerrorcode-exception">New <code>ValueError</code> Exception <a href="#new-codevalueerrorcode-exception">#</a></h2>
<p>PHP 8 introduces a new built-in exception class called <code>ValueError</code>. It extends <code>\Exception</code> and PHP throws this exception, every time you pass a value to a function, which has a valid type - but can not be used for the operation. Prior to PHP 8, this would result in a warning.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
 
/**
 * We pass an array to array_rand,
 * which is of the correct type. But
 * array_rand expects non-empty arrays.
 *
 * This throws a ValueError exception.
 */
array_rand([], 0);

/**
 * The depth argument for json_decode is a
 * valid integer, but it must be greater than 0
 */
json_decode('{}', true, -1);

<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);

class A {
    public function method(int $many, string $parameters, $here) {

    }
}
class B extends A {

<p>The <code>static</code> return type may now be used in PHP 8 to identify that a method returns the class, that this method was actually called on - even if it was inherited (late static binding).</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php

<p>It is now possible to fetch the class name of an object using <code>$object::class</code>. The result is the same as <code>get_class($object)</code>.</p>

<p>PHP 8 introduces a new <code>Stringable</code> interfaces, which gets automatically added, once a class implements the <code>__toString</code> method. You do not need to explicitly implement this interface.</p>

<h2 id="added-support-for-attributes">Added support for Attributes <a href="#added-support-for-attributes">#</a></h2>
<p>PHP 8's attributes actually consist of a number of RFCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2</a>
</li>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments</a>

</li>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax_change">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax_change</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Attributes are definitely one of the biggest changes in PHP 8, and they can be a bit tricky to understand at first. In short, attributes allow you to add meta-data to PHP functions, parameters, classes, etc.
This meta-data can then be retrieved programatically - whereas in PHP 7 and lower, you would need to parse doclocks, attributes allow you to access this information deeply integrated into PHP itself.</p>
<p>To make this a bit clearer, lets say that you want to allow users to add a middleware to a controller class/method by using an attribute.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
// First, we need to define the attribute. An Attribute itself is just a plain PHP class, that is annotated as an Attribute itself.

#[Attribute]
class ApplyMiddleware
{
    public array $middlware = [];

    public function __construct(...$middleware) {
        $this-&gt;middleware = $middleware;
    }
}

// This adds the attribute to the MyController class, with the "auth" middleware as an argument.

#[ApplyMiddleware('auth')]
class MyController
{
    public function index() {}
}

// We can then retrieve all ApplyMiddleware attributes on our class using reflection
// And read the given middleware arguments.

$reflectionClass = new ReflectionClass(MyController::class);

$attributes = $reflectionClass-&gt;getAttributes(ApplyMiddleware::class);

foreach ($attributes as $attribute) {
    $middlewareAttribute = $attribute-&gt;newInstance();
    dump($middlewareAttribute-&gt;middleware);
}

exit;
</pre>
</pre>

<p>This RFC proposes to introduce a short hand syntax, which allows combining the definition of properties and the constructor:</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);

class User {
    public function __construct(
        public int $id,
        public string $name,
    ) {}
}

$user = new User(1, 'Marcel');

dump($user-&gt;id);

<p>Every day people walk past Wennington Green, on the corner of Grove Road and Roman Road, without realising this was the spot on which stood Rachel Whiteread’s controversial inside-out concrete cast of an East End terraced house. Why was this Bow landmark demolished?</p>

<h2>Wennington Green, Bow, London</h2>



<p>At the intersection of Roman Road and Grove Road lies Wennington Green – a patch of land in <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/mile-end-park-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mile End Park </a>principally sculpted by flying bombs. In fact, an English Heritage plaque on the railway bridge a little further down Grove Road commemorates the first one to strike London.</p>



<p>The blitz largely levelled the hundred or so turn-of-the-century terraces, common stock of the working class East End, on what is now the Green but up until the early ‘90s a row of dilapidated dwellings persisted. These residences were mostly derelict, abandoned and occasionally squatted, but for one, ex-docker Mr Sidney Gale of No. 193, a condemned house remained a home.</p>



<p>Indeed, in 1993, the final row was fated to be demolished as part of Tower Hamlet’s council’s plan to create a Green Corridor, unifying the broken line of parkland between the Isle of Dogs and the established lung of <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/">Victoria Park</a>. It was a means to cleanse the area of the legacy of prefabs that had homed the dislocated population post-war and a redemptive space for those in the high-rise accommodation which had replaced the traditional terraces. ‘What people who live in tower blocks want is parkland,’ declared Councillor Eric Flounders.</p>



<p>Yet psychogeographer Iain Sinclair was sceptical of the council’s motives, calling it ‘an Arcadia for the underclass… the whole scheme was a disinterested attempt at municipal aesthetics’. Pointedly, the area was in direct sight of Mrs Thatcher’s commerce baby, Canary Wharf, and the call for a Green was not a far cry from the original motivations to create Victoria Park, opened in 1845. Vicky Park is the oldest purpose built recreation ground in London, conceived to curb disease contracted in damp and cramped conditions and as a means harness working-class wildness. Indeed, Bow is an area rich with connotations of a strong working-class community, but also radicalism and revolt.</p>



<p>Mr Gale forcefully resisted eviction from No. 193 by the council for a number of years, even festooning the property with banners to affirm his unrelenting presence, but, realising his campaign was ultimately futile, he eventually yielded and was re-homed nearby. Gale’s loss was artist Rachel Whiteread’s gain. The practitioner had been seeking a condemned property in London for over two years to realise a project which was essentially a development upon her Turner Prize nominated sculpture, Ghost (1990); a room-sized cast of a bedsit contained in a Victorian property in Archway.</p>



<p>Whiteread, supported by art commissioners Artangel, approached the London Borough of Tower Hamlets&nbsp;council about utilising the property and the authorities duly consented. In the beginning, the council were of the opinion that, ‘It won’t cost the neighbourhood a penny and will provide an unusual landmark for the area,’ however, by the time the bricks were removed and the sculpture was exposed, Councillor Flounders, Chair of Bow Parks Board, denounced it as ‘excrescent.’</p>



<h2>Building Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="692" src="https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-1024x692.jpg" alt="Rachel Whiteread's House on Grove Road in Bow, photo by David Hoffman" srcset="https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-300x203.jpg 300w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-768x519.jpg 768w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Rachel Whiteread’s house view of Grove Road © David Hoffman</figcaption></figure>



<p>To make House, Whiteread used the physical house as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mould, making a cast from the interior by spraying a skin of liquid concrete around a metal armature constructed to support the weight of the work. Coating the whole house took over a month and an additional ten days were needed for the concrete to cure and set. Once solid, scaffolding was erected and Whiteread and her assistants began to remove the exterior brick structure.</p>



<p>What was revealed was an uncanny sight – the concrete impressed with the idiosyncrasies of over a century of domestic habitation. Depressions translated into protrusions; the industrial material betraying past human intimacies: soot marking the fire; yellow paint from a top-floor bedroom. The floors in-between stories could not be cast so, as local Markham Hall recalls, it resembled a ‘wedding cake.’ But the marriage at hand, between the art world and the East End, was to be short-lived and volatile.</p>



<h2>Reactions to Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>It was essentially a neutral process, with no specific moral agenda, but Whiteread conceded ‘I knew of course, while I was making House, it had a political dimension. You can’t make a cast of a house in a poor area of London and not be political.’ Yet it became ‘far more political than I could have predicted.’ Seemingly, the council had also underestimated its resonance, as it quickly became front-page news, attracting scores of art-pilgrims and causing traffic chaos. Its status was even brought to debate in the House of Commons. The council couldn’t wait to get rid of the work fast enough, coming to regard it as a politically embarrassing monument to an impoverished history and standing in the way of the construction of a less threatening green space.</p>

Why Not? © David Hoffman</figcaption></figure>



<p>People reacted to House so strongly as it transcended the individual and became an archetype; an emblem for the area’s time-honoured mode of living. Indeed, it raised pressing questions regarding degrading housing stock and what should be done with it, the creeping gentrification of a historically tight working class community and scepticism towards the authority of those instigating change for the supposed ‘greater good’. In whose name was this change really for? And poignantly, it confronted these questions on its own material terms – concrete being the material used to fix the original Victorian House’s bricks; the embossed surface betraying the umbilical cords of pipes and power-lines which linked the individual house with the local, national and global public.</p>



<p>At base, Whiteread made an empty space, the negative void of the vacated property, into a positive object but insists ‘the work is to do with absence not presence.’ Implicitly, House was defined by the object it was not. When one refers to a ‘house’ we generally mean the façade as publicly viewed from the street, the interior is intimate – that is the home. Whiteread’s sculpture was resolutely an interior; an unsettling mass of inside, out.</p>



<p>The form elicited unease as when we have an intimate relationship with a space, we start to ignore its intricacies, instead handling navigating through the general form unconsciously. Thus, the sculpture was uncanny as it solidified the overlooked, demanding a long-looking, deep contemplation, as one attempted to decipher the inverted forms. Whiteread neglected to furnish her House with meaning but it was predominantly envisioned as what the populace of Bow would soon lose sight of. The interior, a family home, was left out in the cold and significantly, Whiteread chose not to cast the attic space, as if riffing on the idiom ‘left with no roof over their heads.’</p>



<p>It’s understandable then, that there was some resentment from locals towards House as they perceived it to be adding insult to injury over the demolition of such homes in the area, and a crassness in exposing working-class abode for the ‘arty’ leisure classes. Yet, this wasn’t just a case of Art World vs. East Enders, the opinions were split within both camps: in the Art World, Andrew Graham-Dixon proclaimed it ‘a strange and fantastical object which also amounts to one of the most extraordinary and imaginative public sculptures created by an English artist this century.’ To Brian&nbsp;Sewell, it was a ‘meritless gigantism.’ Sewell’s scorn found resonance in one local’s assertion that ‘an engineer could have done it; I don’t see it as creative.’ Whereas, another neighbour to the site regarded it as ‘brilliant,’ reckoning it to be ‘a new way of looking at traditional things.’</p>



<p>House’s evicted resident, Mr Gale, protested, ‘They’re taking the wee-wee.’ He questioned, ‘How can they get grants for arts projects when we can’t get grants for homes? I could have bought a new home for my family with this money.’ His sentiment was echoed in graffiti scrawled on the sculpture: ‘WOT FOR?’ Another renegade scribe rebuffing ‘Why not!’</p>



<p>House’s economics became even more contentious when Whiteread won the £20,000 Turner Prize for the work (the first woman to receive the honour), and then £40,000 from the rebel K Foundation (composed of members of the defunct pop group KLF) for the ‘worst artist of the year.’ Whiteread split the latter money between Shelter, a charity for the London’s homeless, and a fund to supplement young artists. On the same day, the&nbsp;Council made the decision to refuse House a stay of execution. By this time, many people (philanthropists, dealers, galleries) had offered to purchase House, but money offered to the Council to retain its presence was blasted by the authorities as ‘bribes.’ In any case, Whiteread was adamant that the sculpture was ‘absolutely specific to the site’ thus preferred its destruction to relocation.</p>



<p>The bulldozers came on January 11th 1994. The <em>East London Advertiser</em> reports that ‘art lovers’ chained themselves to the railings in attempt to save the work, quoting one as protesting, ‘We’re doing this because House represents the destruction of not only homes but whole communities in East London.’ Another suggested its removal was a sacrilegious act, perceiving House as ‘a headstone to the houses that were here.’ But the sculpture’s fate was sealed. As Whiteread succinctly mused ‘it took three and a half years to develop, four months to make, and thirty minutes to demolish.’</p>



<h2>The legacy of Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>The Houseless Park has now had over 20 years to bed in to the community’s psyche and flourish naturally. In all of the articles and art history books I have trawled to substantiate …</p></div></div>

    <p>Ever since teaching <a href="https://github.com/chiphuyen/stanford-tensorflow-tutorials">TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research</a>, I’ve known that I love teaching and want to do it again.</p>

<p>In early 2019, I started talking with Stanford’s CS department about the possibility of coming back to teach. After almost two years in development, the course has finally taken shape. I’m excited to let you know that I’ll be teaching <strong>CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford</strong> in January 2021.</p>

<p>The course wouldn’t have been possible with the help of many people including <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/">Christopher Ré</a>, Jerry Cain, Mehran Sahami, <a href="https://pirroh.fyi/">Michele Catasta</a>, Mykel J. Kochenderfer.</p>

<p>Here’s a short description of the course. You can find the (tentative) syllabus below.</p>

<p><em>This project-based course covers the iterative process for designing, developing, and deploying machine learning systems. It focuses on systems that require massive datasets and compute resources, such as large neural networks. Students will learn about the different layers of the data pipeline, approaches to model selection, training, scaling, as well as how to deploy, monitor, and maintain ML systems. In the process, students will learn about important issues including privacy, fairness, and security.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong>: <em>At least one of the following; CS229, CS230, CS231N, CS224N, or equivalent. Students should have a good understanding of machine learning algorithms and should be familiar with at least one framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX.</em></p>

<p>For Stanford students interested in taking the course, <a href="https://bit.ly/appy-mlsys-2021">you can fill in the application here</a>. The course will be evaluated based on one final project (at least 50%), three short assignments, and class participation.</p>

<p>For those outside Stanford, I’ll try to make as much of the course materials available as possible. I’ll post updates about the course on <a href="https://twitter.com/chipro">Twitter</a> or you can check back here from time to time.</p>

<p>Since these are all new materials, I’m hoping to get early feedback. If you’re interested in becoming a reviewer for the course materials, please shoot me an email. Thank you!</p>

<p>2020-10-23</p>
<p>For my current job I knew I wanted a Linux laptop again, after enough exposure to Apples ecosystem. Naturally a Thinkpad came to mind as an option, but I wanted to give used hardware a chance, given that Thinkpads are known to be reliable and well built.</p>
<p>I went with used/refurbished hardware from a vendor I know and trust for a while now, <a href="https://www.lapstore.de/">lapstore.de</a>, and I could not be happier with my choice. I went with a Lenovo Thinkpad T460s, as a compromise between decent performance, weight, screen size and good Linux support out of the box. This model is 5 years old, but CPUs are not evolving that fast anymore, so it still feels very snappy with everything I'm doing. The internal screen could have used a slightly higher resolution for my taste, but I am rarely using it these days.</p>
<p>One big advantage of the older models is access to the old version of the docking stations, which are totally worth it. At home the laptop sits there, gets charged and drives my 4K display easily, while being hooked up to my mouse, keyboard and network cable. Speaking of ports: the T460s still has proper Rj-45, USB 2.0/3.0 and HDMI ports. No adapters needed!</p>
<p>Summing up, here is why I think used hardware is worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is cheaper. Sure, your employer might be paying for it, but maybe you have a fixed budget and get more out of it this way.</li>
<li>it is good for the environment.</li>
<li>it will likely last for the next few years. Most of us don't need the latest hardware to do our job. I would argue that quite a bit of software could run better if developers weren't handed the latest and greatest hardware as a given</li>
<li>you are not giving up support. Sure, it might break. But so does a new one. There are quite a few respectable dealers out there who offer 3 years of warranty for little extra cost. Actually the first (used) docking station I got was not working ok, so I got an immediate, brand new replacement 2 days later.</li>
<li>Linux runs great on older hardware. With Kubuntu 20.04 everything works out of the box, including webcam, multimedia keys, docking/undocking or switching between different screen configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not give used hardware a try?</p>
<p>EDIT [2020-10-27] fixed typo "wantec"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 <div>
  
  <p><label>Posted on <strong>26 October 2020</strong></label></p><p>An <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=three+weeks&amp;oq=three+weeks">eternity</a> ago, I published a <a href="https://www.peterstefek.me/focused-render.html">blog post</a> about a shader I wrote. In that post, I casually repeated a piece of gpu folklore I picked up as a wee opengl enthusiast almost a decade ago,   </p>
<p>
"Using if statements inside a shader will cause performance degradation."  
</p>

<p>People on the internet seemed a little skeptical about this statement, and I realized my advice might be outdated. So this post is a quick follow up about the cost of branching on more modern gpus.  </p>
<p>Before we talk about branching, what is a gpu? A GPU or graphics processing unit, is a special piece of hardware initially developed to crunch numbers for graphics calculations. It accomplishes this goal quickly through a large amount of parallelization.   </p>
<p>GPUs can run many threads at the same time in parallel. These threads are generally executed in groups called warps (CUDA), invocations (Vulkan) and waves (I will use the term warp, but they are all interchangeable). On recent Nvidia hardware (Ampere/ Volta / Pascal) these warps contain 32 threads. Pascal for example can theoretically run up to four independent instructions per warp over 56 warps of 32 threads which comes out to a mind blowing 7168 instructions per cycle. </p>
<p>Each warp can only execute one instruction at a time. However that instruction can be executed for each of the threads in the warp. This means the GPU can execute 32 copies of the same instruction in parallel for each thread in the warp at once.   </p>
<p>However, taking both sides of a branch will cause the threads inside a warp to "diverge". This means some threads will need to execute one side of the branch and some will need to execute the other. Unfortunately, both instructions can not be executed simultaneously for threads in the same warp. So these divergent instructions must be executed sequentially.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.  </p>
<p>Consider the <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WdyyWV">following fragment shader</a>:<br>
<code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{  <br>
  </code></p><p><code>
  // TUNE THIS AMOUNT TO YOUR GPU STRENGTH<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (mod(fragCoord.x, 2.) &lt; 1. &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>In fragment shaders like the one above, each warp is composed of a set of spatially close pixels. Each warp in this shader should diverge because each horizontally adjacent pixel takes a different side of the branch. Let's say the cost of each inner loop is n cycles. Since each side of the branch is executed in series, each warp must take at least 2n cycles, even though each thread uses only one side of the branch. These effects scale with the number of threads in the distinct divergent paths taken (up to 32x in Nvidia hardware). Here's another shader which should have roughly four branches per warp. <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wsVyzG">This shader</a> will take at least 4n cycles.  </p>
<p>However, let's look a <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsVyzG">second shader</a>:   </p>
<p><code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
  </code></p><p><code>
  // USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (fragCoord.x &lt; iResolution.x / 2.0 &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
    </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
          </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>This shader should run roughly twice as fast as the other shader even though roughly the same number of pixels take each branch. This is because most of the warps do not diverge (with the exception of a few around half way across the screen).   </p>
<p><strong>Nvidia Specifics</strong><br>
As far as I can tell, there are roughly two different ways of nvidia graphics cards handle divergence with in a warp.</p>
<p><strong>Thread Masking (Pre Volta)</strong><br>
On pre volta Nvidia card, divergence was handled by something called thread masking.   </p>
<p>Basically when a conditional is hit, a thread mask is generated.  We can think of this mask as a 32 entry array. Each entry specifies whether the corresponding thread takes the first side of the branch or not. The first side is then executed for each of those threads. After the first side of the branch is then executed, the mask is reversed and the other side of the branch is executed.   </p>
<p>This thread mask strategy exists in part because there is only one program counter per warp on pre volta gpus. So essential every thread in the warp must be at the same place in the program. The only way we know which threads to execute, is by using the mask.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that only the threads which need to execute the branch actually are assigned to computational cores. So if no threads execute one side of the branch, no work is done.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Thread Scheduling (Volta and Beyond)</strong><br>
One big change in the Volta architecture and beyond is the introduction of "Independent Thread Scheduling".   </p>
<p>In Independent thread scheduling, each thread has its own program counter. This allows each warp to track the execution of every thread at a fine grain level. However, we can still only execute only one instruction at a time. So the actual runtime of a branch does not change.  </p>
<p>So if Independent Thread Scheduling does not speed up branching, what does it do? Independent Thread Scheduling enables both sides of a branch to execute concurrently but not in parallel.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/volta-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>The reason for this shift is because before Volta, branches were places where deceptive deadlocks could occur. <br>
<code>
leader_id = 0<br>
If (threadIdx.x == leader_id) {<br>
  </code></p><p><code>
    // Do some inital work
  </code></p><p><code>
} else {
  <p>
    // Wait for leader to finish it's work<br>
    // then do my work
  </p>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>In the above compute shader pseudo code, we have 31 "follower" threads waiting for the "leader thread" to finish (using in-warp shared local memory) before executing their own instructions. </p>
<p>On a Pascal GPU or below, if the else side of the branch is executed first, a deadlock will occur. The leader will never get a chance to start it's work because its followers will be waiting for it. </p>
<p>Independent Thread Scheduling gets around these locking problems by interlacing the two diverging paths. </p>
<p><strong>Article TLDR</strong><br>
Branch divergence in warp makes all parts of the branch execute in sequence which slows down the shader. Branching divergence between warps does not affect runtime.  </p>
<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br>
Branch execution on gpus is surprisingly deep, and there are many edge cases I didn't address and I also didn't touch gpu vendors other than Nvidia. Here are some good sources if you want to learn more:  </p>

<p>[Edit April 25 2019: Please note <strong>this is not an iPhone or Android app</strong>, and I have no plans to release it as such. You can use your phone or any other camera to take pictures of your ground coffee, but then you need to install the application on either OS X or through Python (on any operating system) to analyze the data. <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/archive/master.zip">Download the application package here</a>.]</p>



<p>Today I would like to present an OS X application I have been developing for a few months. It turns out writing Python software for coffee is a great way to relax after a day of writing Python software for astrophysics.</p>



<p>When I started being interested in brewing specialty coffee a few years ago, one of the first things that irritated me was our inability to recommend grind sizes for different coffee brewing methods, or to compare the quality of different grinders in an objective way. Sure, some laboratories have laser diffraction equipment that can measure the size of all particles coming out of a grinder, but rare are the coffee geeks that have access to these multi-hundred thousands of dollars kinds of equipment.</p>



<p>At first, I decided to take pictures of my coffee grounds spread on a white sheet, and to use an old piece of software called <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>, developed by the National Institutes of Health mainly to analyze microscope images, to obtain a distribution of the sizes of my coffee grounds. This worked decently well, and allowed me to start comparing different grinders. Then <a href="https://www.scottrao.com/">Scott Rao</a> made me realize that a stand-alone application that doesn’t need a complicated installation and that is dedicated to coffee would be of interest to many people in the coffee industry. Probably just the 10% geekiest of them, but that’s cool.</p>



<p>I’m hoping that this application will help us understand the effects of particle size distributions on the taste of coffee. I don’t think the industry really kept us in the loop with all the laser diffraction experiments, so hopefully we can help ourselves as a community.</p>



<p>If you are interested in measuring the particle size distribution of your grinder, then this app is for you ‒ and it’s free. I placed it as “open source” on <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a>, so if you are a developer, you are welcome to send me suggestions in the form of <em>push requests</em> (the developers will know what that means).</p>



<p>If you would like to get started, I suggest you read this quick <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_installation.pdf">installation guide</a>, which will explain how to download the app and run it even though I am not a registered Apple Developer. Then, you can choose to either read this <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_summarized_manual.pdf">quick summary</a> that will get you running with the basics, or this <strong><em>very</em></strong> detailed and wordy <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_manual.pdf">user manual</a> that will guide you through all the detailed options the application offers you.</p>



<p>I would like to show you an example of what can be done with the software. Below, I am comparing the particle size distribution of the Baratza Forté grinder, which uses 54 mm flat steel burrs, with that of the Lido 3 hand grinder, which uses 48 mm conical steel burrs. I set both grinders in a way that produces a similar peak of average-sized particles with diameters around 1 mm, but as you can see, the particle size distributions are very different ! The Forté generates way less fines (with diameters below 0.5 mm) and slightly less boulders (with diameters of approximately 2 mm), which is indicative of a better quality grinder.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="976" data-permalink="https://coffeeadastra.com/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam/" data-orig-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" data-orig-size="1000,780" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=750" src="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" alt=""><figcaption>An example of figure that can be generated with the coffee grind size software. Each red bar corresponds to one kind of particle diameter generated by the Lido 3 grinder (smallest particles correspond to the leftmost bar, largest ones correspond to the rightmost bar), and their heights correspond to the total contribution of these kinds of particles, by mass. As you can see, the particles that contribute to the largest amount of mass have sizes just above 1 mm. The red circle shows the average particle diameter for the Lido 3, and the horizontal bars show the “characteristic width” of the distribution – this corresponds to the width that covers approximately 68% of all the distribution. Similarly, the blue line and the blue circle describe the distribution of the Forté grinder.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For now, the app is only intended to be used on OS X computers. But if you are running any other kind of system and know your way around Python, you can always download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a> and run it with your own installation of Python 3.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/66ug5i9bkhrghef/screencap_coffeegrindsize.mov?raw=1"></video><figcaption>This is an example of how to use the coffee grind size application.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I would like to thank Scott Rao for his excitement when I shared this project idea with him, and for beta testing the software. I would also like to thank Alex Levitt, Mitch Hale, Caleb Fischer, Francisco Quijano and Victor Malherbe for beta testing the software.</p>

<p>Online discourse has recently been borrowing vocabulary from Lewis Carroll. From articles about the dangers 
of 
rabbit holes on social media, Youtube and Reddit, to QAnon's "follow the white rabbit" mantra, concepts from 
Alice's Wonderland seem to fit naturally with the internet.</p>
<p>In Lewis Carroll's book, Alice and the white rabbit are the only two characters that transition from reality 
to 
Wonderland. The white rabbit is driven by anxiety. Alice by curiosity. We are motivated to access 
the internet for these same reasons. Our curiosity is never satiated with endless content and powerful 
recommender systems. Our anxiety is consistently triggered by the fear of missing out and the need to escape 
reality.</p>
<p>Like Wonderland, the internet has become an alternate reality thanks to the breath of the content available 
and its multimedia nature. Wonderland resembled reality enough that Alice accepted it as real. The internet's 
information is realistic enough that people struggle to know what is real and what is fake.</p>
<p>As distorted realities, both the internet and Wonderland are strange and entertaining. But they are a 
dangerous type of fantasy that discourages us from returning to reality, and attemps to transform us into one of its 
cartoon characters.</p>
<p>Alice navigated Wonderland safely, staying true to herself. Her principles can help us remain active 
internet users, instead of being used by the internet. Keep an open mind, but remain logical. Think 
critically, through questions. Stay curious, with purpose.</p>
