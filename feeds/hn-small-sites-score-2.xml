<p><strong><span>A Tale of Two Charts</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows the monthly average <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin">price of bitcoin</a> since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1238" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-26/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png" data-orig-size="782,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-26" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png 782w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px"></figure>



<p>This second chart shows the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=bitcoin">Google Trends Score</a> by month for the search term “bitcoin”, also since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1239" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-27/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-27" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>When I first saw the second chart, I thought it looked remarkably similar to the first. Sure enough, it does. Below are the two charts together. The darker line shows the price according to the left-side axis and the lighter line shows the Google Trends Score according to the right-side axis.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1240" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-28/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png" data-orig-size="783,306" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-28" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>It turns out that bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score are quite correlated.</p>



<p>Specifically, they have had a 72% positive correlation since October 2013. This compares favorably to bitcoin’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-correlation-with-gold-is-weakening-says-new-kraken-report">26% correlation with the stock market and 24% correlation with gold</a> over the last year.</p>



<p>I should note that the correlation between bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score was much stronger up until both price and score peaked in December 2017 (98%) than it has been since (59%).</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the purpose of this analysis is not to argue about the level of correlation nor to assert causation one way or another (though it seems logical that the price and popularity feed off of each other). Rather, the purpose of this analysis is to make a speculative projection regarding what bitcoin’s price could be if and when its popularity (as measured by its Google Trends Score) returns to and surpasses its previous all-time high.</p>



<p>In order to make this projection, we first must consider the historical ratio between bitcoin’s average price and its Google Trends Score on a monthly basis. Let us refer to this as the <em><strong>price:score ratio</strong></em><strong> </strong>for short.</p>



<p><strong><span>Bitcoin’s Price:Score Ratio</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows how bitcoin’s price:score ratio has increased over the last several years.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1241" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-29/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-29" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>For a ratio that has been relatively volatile historically, it has remained unusually consistent for the last two months (June &amp; July) at 729, just 4% short of its all-time high of 758 in November 2019.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s price:score ratio has been above 645 for 9 of the last 12 months after having only reached such a level once before, and barely (646 in October 2018).</p>



<p>The 3 months in the last year during which the ratio was lower than 645 can be fairly easily explained. They took place this past March, April, and May as hype grew in anticipation of bitcoin’s once every four years halving event on May 11, 2020. Additionally, people perhaps were searching more than usual for information about alternative assets (including bitcoin) when the stock market crashed ~30% in the early days of the lockdown resulting from the pandemic. Those two factors together seem sufficient to explain the uptick in bitcoin’s Google Trends Score over that period. On the other side of the price:score ratio, bitcoin’s price fell along with the market, and so with the price going down and the score going up, the decreased price:score ratio over those few months makes sense.</p>



<p>Since the stock market substantially recovered and the halving event came and went without materially moving bitcoin’s price, the Google Trends Score has returned to the pre-pandemic, pre-halving-hype range. For the last two months (June &amp; July), bitcoin’s monthly Google Trends Score has stayed steady at 13, which is equal to its average from April 2018 (after the peak) through February 2020 (before the halving hype and market crash).</p>



<p>For some additional context, it should be noted that bitcoin’s Google Trends Score has only been equal to or greater than 21 in 7 months since bitcoin’s inception and they all took place consecutively surrounding bitcoin’s last major surge from September 2017 through March 2018 (with scores chronologically of 21, 22, 44, 100, 55, 39, and 23).</p>



<p><strong><span>Flying Under The Radar</span></strong></p>



<p>Sufficed to say, bitcoin’s average score of 13 since the last surge, excluding the three aforementioned months from earlier this year (14 if we include them), shows objectively that bitcoin is flying under the radar (in terms of its popularity as a search term at least). Of course, it may not seem this way to people who follow crypto closely and daily but the algorithmic and mass-data collecting Google Trends Score should be trusted over any single person’s speculative and subjective observation about the current level of hype and attention.</p>



<p>If you, like me, believe that bitcoin is and has been flying under the radar for more than two years now, the natural question to ask is this. What do we expect to happen when that is no longer the case? In other words, what happens to bitcoin’s price if and when it reaches the pinnacle of its next hype cycle? How high might bitcoin fly the next time we see a situation similar to that of December 2017?</p>



<p><strong><span>Projecting Bitcoin’s Price</span></strong></p>



<p>I believe a reasonable response to this question can be made by applying bitcoin’s average price:score ratio over the last twelve months (643) to a Google Trends Score of 100 to estimate what bitcoin’s price would be if the price:score ratio stays about constant and bitcoin’s popularity in terms of search returns to its all-time high. The price implied by this projection is about $65,000 as is demonstrated by the maximum value in the top right corner of the chart below. Basically, if one believes that bitcoin will at least at some point return to the level of popularity it attained in December 2017, this methodology would lead that person to expect bitcoin to attain a price of at least $60,000 at that time.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1242" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-30/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png" data-orig-size="783,308" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-30" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>This estimate can be made less conservative in two ways. The first is to assume that the price:score ratio will continue to increase as it has all along (6% month-over-month), rather than calculating the price using the LTM average of the ratio. The second is to assume that bitcoin’s popularity as a search term will well surpass its previous all-time high set in December 2017 just as that all-time was more than twice as great as any high before it and more than 8 times greater than the all-time high before May 2017 (which was set in December 2013, perhaps not coincidentally exactly 4 years or one halving period prior to the latest all-time high). I hesitate to call either of these two less conservative assumptions aggressive because they are not only reasonable but actually probable if one is to simply assume that the historical trends will continue in terms of the score and the ratio.</p>



<p>As such, I will close by presenting a chart which one can use to approximate the price implied by their own inputs for the Google Trends Score and the price:score ratio. In this chart, I show the ratio for the last 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and so on, and use the average year-over-year growth rate between those figures (16%) to project the next twelve months (“NTM”), next two years (“N2Y”), and next three years (“N3Y”) ratios.</p>



<p>The highest price projected on the chart is right around $300,000 based on a Google Trends Score of 3 times the previous all-time high (300) and a projected N3Y price:score ratio of 996 (the LTM average of 643 increased 16% 3 times for 3 years). Of course, this maximum price projection is limited only arbitrarily by the maximums I have decided to present on this chart for both the score and the ratio.</p>

<p><strong><span>To Be Continued…</span></strong></p>



<p>Many people have employed many methodologies in attempting to accurately project bitcoin’s price. For example, <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD">PlanB</a>‘s stock to flow ratio looks at scarcity to make one of the more convincing price projections I’ve seen. My price:score ratio looks at popularity in endeavoring to do the same. This analysis was not intended to be totally comprehensive. My intention was merely to introduce this methodology for others to critique. As such, my hope is that this becomes widely enough read so that I may receive ample critical feedback for further consideration and refinement of the methodology.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>We can take advantage of the way humans think about value.</em></strong></p><p>We know that the computer you are using is <strong>worth more</strong> than the water bottle that is on the table. That is just something we inherently know. <strong>Why?</strong> Because we probably purchased water in the past, we recognize the price of a computer. We understand that we get more value out of the computer than the bottle of water. Every human has a built-in value meter in which we value products (or services!) comparatively.</p><p>Now, assume I put you in the middle of the desert and don't give you water for two days. Suddenly the value of the water bottle climbs to the top of your value meter.</p><hr><p>When you ask a person directly what they are willing to pay for a bottle of water, they refer to their value meter. They give you an answer based on expectation and comparison rather than on how much they may potentially value it. This happening makes it hard for a person to admit the real value of your product.</p><p>This phenomenon occurs when your product is an innovation, without valid comparisons, or if the value your product provides is much higher than any substitutes available on the market. The customer suddenly does not have an accurate thermometer to measure your product against, and will often give you a much lower price point when asked directly.</p><p>Economists and psychologists have studied this phenomenon for a long time. There are many techniques to gather information on the world-famous question for any startup: <strong>How much should I price my product?</strong></p><p>We can take advantage of this phenomenon by asking the customer indirect questions on a range.</p><hr><p>One of my favorite techniques, which I believe works very well, is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Westendorp%27s_Price_Sensitivity_Meter">Van Westerndorp method</a></strong>, also known as the Price Sensitivity Meter technique. Its a series of 4 simple questions you can ask your customers to determine a price range at which your product pricing matches your offering's real value. </p><p>What better way then to put those questions on a survey and ask enough people. If you survey, say, 150 potential customers, you will discover a pretty accurate price range determined by consumer value. Simple enough? Let's get started.</p><p>The first step is to <strong>make sure that customers understand your product</strong>. Consider giving customers a demo, sharing a video, or showing them detailed pictures of your product. You could include this at the top of your survey. For our purposes, let us take a picture of this yummy Gyro. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I think it would do quite well to price this Gyro.</p><figure><img src="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/gyro.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/gyro.jpg 600w, https://theunconventional.blog/content/images/2020/07/gyro.jpg 700w"><figcaption>Let's price this Gyro.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

<p>The GIMP team recently informed me that the next upcoming version of GIMP will be GIMP 2.10.22 (no GIMP 3.0 just yet – womp). Though there has been no official announcements of specific features to come in this next version, there has been one feature announcement in particular that has caught my eye – the “<strong>linked layers</strong>” feature.</p>



<h2>Linked Layers – GIMP’s Answer to Photoshop’s Smart Objects?</h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zemarmot/status/1286952087558004738?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GIMP quietly announced (via a retweet)</a> that the <a href="https://patreon.com/zemarmot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeMarmot team</a> was working on a new feature they are calling the “Linked Layers” feature (note: this has nothing to do with the “transform link” feature already found in GIMP).</p>



<p>In fact, work for this feature actually began in July 2019 (about a year ago) but, due to limited developers working on GIMP, this feature was shelved until recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jehan from ZeMarmot, who recently revisited development on this feature, described the application of Linked Layers in this way: “What if you wanted to use the same background in several images? Instead of duplicating it, you could just link it from all images using it. And if you edit a bit your common background, it would automatically update the render of all images.”</p>



<p>Sound familiar?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To me, this sounds like GIMP’s version of “Smart Objects” – the popular Photoshop feature that allows you to “link” a different file to your composition, then have that file live update in your current composition any time you make changes to it. This has many applications – especially in the world of creating universal templates that can be updated with your own design (by simply replacing the “linked image” with your own design, then re-saving that image). <strong>This is huge.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It would work like this in GIMP: you would create a new layer, and under “Fill With” you choose “Image Link” (red arrow in the image above). Choosing this option would bring up an option to select an image to link the layer to on your computer (blue arrow). You then select your image, and click “OK” to create your new layer. The layer is now linked to the image on your computer. If you were to then open that image in GIMP and make edits to it, the edits would automatically update in the linked layer inside your other composition.</p>



<h2>Why GIMP’s Linked Layers Will Be Just As Good As Photoshop’s Smart Objects</h2>

<p>Some of you are wondering how this feature would keep pace with Photoshop’s well-established “Smart Objects” feature. In Photoshop, not only can you link a layer from one composition to a layer or image from another composition, but you can also link vector objects from Adobe Illustrator as a layer in Photoshop, and edit that vector object essentially in real-time in either program and have the quality of the vector object remain intact.</p>



<p>Well, GIMP’s “linked layers” will do the exact same thing – using Open Source alternatives, of course. This feature will be integrated with Inkscape so that, for example, you can link a vector composition to a GIMP layer, and have the GIMP layer scale up without quality loss the way any vector object would in Inskcape. <strong>This is mind-blowing.</strong> You could also make updates to the vector file in Inkscape, and those changes would then refresh inside of the linked layer in GIMP. It would essentially create a dynamic link between the two programs.</p>



<p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/N5oyqbD7zyQ">video ZeMarmot released showing this new “linked layers” feature in action.</a> This isn’t just a pipe-dream or concept yet to be implemented – it’s a feature they’ve demonstrated to work in a test-version of GIMP. </p>



<p>If GIMP can successfully get linked layers to work in a stable release version of GIMP, the internet, myself included, will lose its mind. And, once again, GIMP will have successfully taken a bite out of Adobe’s photo editing software lead (still without charging its users a dime).</p>



<p>In my opinion, some form of “smart object” functionality is one of the top 3 features missing in GIMP (and one of the top 3 things I get comments about on my videos – especially when doing PS vs. GIMP comparisons). Stay tuned – I will provide more information on this feature as it comes out (hopefully via a video tutorial if they get the feature implemented in one of the new release-versions of GIMP).</p>



<p>If you want to help speed up the development of this and other cool new features in GIMP, I recommend supporting the <a href="https://patreon.com/zemarmot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare">ZeMarmot team on Patreon</a> so they can spend more time on GIMP development and less time on other jobs to pay their bills.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this article, I’ll share my motivation for doing 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. More importantly, I’ll share 13 lessons I learned from my failures and my successes.</p>
<p>I’ve grouped the lessons into three categories to match the phases of a typical recruitment process.</p>
<p>While most of the lessons apply directly to software engineers and technical professionals, the principles behind these lessons can be applied to all careers. I hope you find something useful that you can apply to your professional lives.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-i-get-started-">How did I get started?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p> “If you’re going to fail, do it fast.” — Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like any other software engineer, I’ve had different types of technical interviews - from the dreaded whiteboard coding interview to the unreal 45-minute coding challenge on platforms like HackerRank. While some of my experiences in these interviews were great, others were bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>But I wanted to get really good at interviewing. I wanted to learn to overcome the interviewing phobia and exude confidence at interviews. Like a skilled surfer, I wanted to learn to ride the high pressure waves that came with interviews. I was also looking to change jobs at the time.</p>
<p>So from January through early March 2020, I applied to and was contacted by companies based in the US and Europe. From early-stage startups like Coda to later stage startups like Crunchbase, from mid-size companies like Affirm, to bigger companies like Amazon and even remote companies like Webflow.</p>
<p>109+ applications later, I landed myself more than 60 interviews. These comprised more than 60 introductory phone interviews, 50+ technical phone screen interviews, 18 take-home coding projects, 11 coding challenges and 8 on-site interviews including 3 virtual ones.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-learn-">What did I learn?</h2>
<p>For better appreciation, I have grouped the lessons into three categories to match the different phases of a typical recruitment process.</p>
<h3 id="pre-interview-phase">Pre-Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything from the initial contact with a company to the point where the first interview happens.</p>
<h4 id="1-what-i-learned-about-applications">1. What I learned about applications</h4>
<p>When I started applying to companies, I imagined that the more applications I submitted, the higher my chances of getting an interview would be. Seems logical, huh? So I set a target of 5 applications a day, aiming for 1 interview for every 5 applications.</p>
<p>But my strategy didn’t work as I hoped it would. The number of interview requests I got often fell short of my target. It was almost a 1:12 ratio - 1 interview for every 12 applications.</p>
<p>I was faced with the question: do I need to increase my daily target to, say, 10 companies? Or was there something else I needed to change?</p>
<p>With every unsuccessful application, I saw that something needed to change.</p>
<p>That change came when I took a break from meeting my daily numbers and began to think of my applications differently. I began to see each application as a sales pitch to the hiring manager or whoever was going to be reading my application, but here the product being sold was me.</p>
<p>If a company needed to fill a talent gap and I say I had the skills, I needed to find a way to convince them that I did.</p>
<p>My new task then became to find a way to effectively pitch my unique skills, experience and personality in a way that convinced the hiring manager that I was the right fit for the job.</p>
<p>Here is an example of one of such <em>pitches</em> I came up with:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596030331456/A8nDIn-ih.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="body image.png"></p>
<p>Backed with my resume, this cover letter had a 95% success rate. The one time this didn’t work, the hiring manager still replied to let me know that the position was no longer available but he would like to connect in the future.</p>
<p>The lesson here is, be very intentional about the application you put forward – quality over quantity. Better still do both. Know your unique competencies and experience and present them in a way that matches the company’s needs without sacrificing your personality.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand the peculiarity of the company you are applying to and its specific needs. A startup or a smaller-sized company may have different needs from a bigger company, thus requiring a different skill-set.</p>
<p>Sell yourself and be sure to back your sales pitch during the interview.</p>
<h4 id="2-what-i-learned-about-recruiter-in-mails">2. What I learned about recruiter in-mails</h4>
<p>During this period, I received a number of in-mails from recruiters (mostly unsolicited) for open roles, the majority of which were roles I wasn’t interested in.</p>
<p>Granted, it was sometimes a lot given my busy schedule but I learned to be empathetic, understanding that these recruiters were only trying to do their jobs.</p>
<p>I stopped seeing these in-mails as noise in my inbox and started making the effort to reply to all recruiter in-mails, even for positions I was not interested in. By doing this, I succeeded in building a network of recruiters that have become a rich resource if I have to switch roles in the future.</p>
<p>Now I don’t expect you may want to start replying to every in-mail you receive. But it might interest you to know that some of the interview requests I got were from recruiters I had replied to before for roles I wasn’t interested in. It never hurts to reply.</p>
<h3 id="the-interview-phase">The Interview Phase</h3>
<p>This covers everything about the interview itself, cutting across the different interview types.</p>
<h4 id="3-how-to-handle-introductory-phone-calls">3. How to handle introductory phone calls</h4>
<p>Yes I get it, you’re busy and many things are competing for your time. But hey, you are also an excellent professional, and that means you never get on a phone call without knowing at least these two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first name of your interviewer, and</li>
<li>at least one tangible thing about the company — what they do, where they are located, any recent news, something, anything!</li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed that for interviews where I put in the effort to make these findings, I always came across as being genuinely interested in the company. That’s something recruiters typically look for in these kinds of interviews.</p>
<h4 id="4-how-to-handle-technical-phone-screens">4. How to handle technical phone screens</h4>
<p>The one thing that can almost single-handedly decide how well you do in a technical phone screen interview is your ability to communicate your thoughts clearly.</p>
<p>You may have heard stuff like this before:
“<em>The interviewers care about your thought process. Yes they can see your code but importantly, they want to know why you are doing what you’re doing</em>.”</p>
<p>The interviewer isn’t there with you and so does not have the luxury of seeing other non-verbal cues like your hand gestures or nuances. All the interviewer has is your voice as a means of understanding your thought process.</p>
<p>Now you know how you should lead this conversation, the next question is how do you become good at this? Because the truth is, while expressing your thoughts may come naturally to some people, it doesn’t to others – including me.</p>
<p>So – Practice! Practice!! Practice!!!</p>
<p>Practice doing a lot of mock interviews. Doing these mock interviews with friends made me better and more confident in explaining my thought process. But more interestingly, it helped me develop a new mindset about interviews.</p>
<p>I began to see interviews as a conversation with a friend or a team member. I visualized the interviewer on the other end as one of my friends (I sometimes gave the interviewer a name in my head). So what would have been a high-pressure interview I now saw as a friendly ‘chat’ about a technical problem.</p>
<p>This new mindset, aided by the many practice interviews, helped me grow in confidence so much so that I started enjoying interviews, sorry, technical chats.
How to get started on a problem</p>
<p>Never start solving a problem without fully understanding the problem statement. You are almost never wrong if you start by asking clarifying questions. It’s also a good sign to your interviewer when you ask those questions rather than run with your assumptions.</p>
<h4 id="5-how-to-solve-the-problem">5. How to solve the problem</h4>
<p>Good candidates know how to solve a problem (e.g. a sorting problem), but the best candidates know multiple solutions to a problem and understand the trade-offs of one solution versus the other.</p>
<p>The interviews where I performed the best (Cruise comes to mind) are the ones where I didn’t just solve the algorithmic challenge – I was also able to provide alternative solutions and discuss the trade-offs.</p>
<p>Aim to provide multiple solutions to a problem, be willing to discuss the trade-offs, and be able to implement at least one of them.</p>
<p>For technical interviews, write clean code. Most interviewers care about your code quality as well as the correctness of your solution. Aim for modular code, separate reusable logic into utility functions, name variables and methods properly, and just be a boss!</p>
<h4 id="6-what-to-do-when-you-re-stuck-on-a-problem">6. What to do when you’re stuck on a problem</h4>
<p>There will be times when you’re stuck. And this could be caused by a number of reasons: you don’t have the requisite knowledge, incorrect assumptions, missing details, and so on.</p>
<p>I used to think that at such times I was being judged by how fast I could come up with a solution. So I would be quiet, thinking, not communicating with the interviewer, just thinking.</p>
<p>And this is where a lot of us get it wrong. I get it, you need some alone time to think. But sorry to burst your bubble, that alone time is not when you’re being interviewed by a person.</p>
<p>Yes, your interviewer wants to see that you can come up with a solution, but one thing you must not forget is that they also want to see that <strong>you can collaborate with other team-mates to come up with a solution</strong>. While companies want rock-stars, they also want team-players.</p>
<p>Since your interviewer is a friend, a buddy, a team member who’s on your side and means well for you (Refer to 4), talk to them while you're figuring it out.</p>
<p>Share your thought process up till the point you got stuck and do it confidently, not like some cry for help. By doing so you just may uncover the solution, as was the case during my interview with Coda.</p>
<h4 id="7-how-to-handle-coding-challenges">7. How to handle coding challenges</h4>
<p>The lessons here apply to interviews that take the form of coding challenges on platforms like Hackerrank, Codility, and so on. Typically these are timed challenges, say 45 minutes or …</p></div></div>

<p>Anyone else tired of these annoying popups?</p>

<p><img src="https://lovettchris.github.io/posts/apple_upsell/icloud_installer.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I’m getting pretty tired of all this… I actually tried to find customer support for the PC
installer popup, but no luck. Anyone know who owns this ugly little Windows app? I find it
particularly devious that Apple uses language here that sounds like something is broken until I
“Install” their fix. This is not a fix, this is an upsell to get iCloud on my PC.</p>

<p>The iPhone backup message is also annoying. I tried to tell my iPhone to stop backing up my photos,
and yet I still get this backup failed warning every day. Perhaps Apple should find a more creative
way to upsell my on iCloud because this is driving me nuts, and making it much less likely I’ll
ever checkout the benefits of paying Apple for cloud storage on stuff I’ve backed up my self lots
of other ways.</p>

<p>Apple is world class on user experiences of everything else, so why are they so bad at this
experience? I’m guessing the part of the company that expertly squeezes every dime out of consumers
is not so connected to the user experience gods at Apple… Here’s hoping I can wake up some of
those gods to go slap the accountants on the wrist for this naughty behavior.</p>

				<p><a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> "is a microblogging server software that can federate (= exchange messages with) other servers that support the same federation standards (OStatus and ActivityPub). What that means is that you can host a server for yourself or your friends and stay in control of your online identity, but still exchange messages with people on larger servers. Pleroma will federate with all servers that implement either OStatus or ActivityPub, like GNU Social, Friendica, Hubzilla and Mastodon." <a href="https://blog.soykaf.com/post/what-is-pleroma/">(stolen from Lain's blog post)</a>.</p>

<p>Recently I modified my Pleroma instance to support bot services: parse a posted message, take an action, post the result. To get there I had to learn <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>, the language in which Pleroma is written, as well as <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html">Phoenix</a>, the web framework Elixir uses, and a little bit about ActivityPub, the protocol for exchanging messages. What I want to explain here in particular is the architecture of Pleroma, so that you can hack it more easily, for fun or if you want to participate in the development.</p>

<h2>Elixir</h2>

<p>As Pleroma is written in <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> you'll need to learn that language to some extent. If you are familiar with Ruby (or Perl, for that matter) and with the idea of functional programming (everything is a function), then it is quite easy to learn and understand. The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/">documentation</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">guides</a> are very good. </p>

<p>If you've never hear of functional programming, the main difference with e.g. Ruby or Java is that Elixir does not use an object-oriented programming model. Instead, there are functions that manipulate data structures and other functions. A particular consequence of the functional model is that there are no for- or while-loops. Instead, there are what is called higher-order functions which e.g. apply another function to a list. Elixir programs also make a lot more use of recursion. </p>

<p>Another point about Elixir as a web programming language is that it is built on a system where processes communicate by passing messages to one another, and it is  built in such a way that if a process dies it will normally be restarted automatically. This approach makes it very easy to offload work to separate worker processes etc. </p>

<p>All this comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, the language on which Elixir is built, with its powerfull OTP framework for building applications and its BEAM virtual machine, which manages the processes. </p>

<h2>Phoenix</h2>

<p>A lot of the groundwork of Pleroma is done by <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html">Phoenix</a>, a very easy-to-use web server framework. Essentially, what happens is that the end user accesses the application using a specific url, typically via a web browser, and based on this url the application performs a number of actions, which in the end result in a change in the state of the application and usually in what is shown in the browser window.</p>

<p>In Phoenix, there are five stages or components  between the connection and the resulting action by the application:</p>

<h3>Endpoint</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Endpoint.html">endpoint</a> is the boundary where all requests to your web application start. It is also the interface your application provides to the underlying web servers.</p>

<p>Pleroma's endpoint is <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/endpoint.ex"><code>web/endpoint.ex</code></a>. If you look at the source you see several occurrences of <code>plug(Plug...)</code>. <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/plug.html">Plug</a> is a specification for composable modules in between web applications, and it is very heavily used in Pleroma.  For example, to serve only specific static files/folders from <code>priv/static</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>plug</span><span>(</span>
  <span>Plug.Static</span><span>,</span>
  <span>at</span><span>:</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>:pleroma</span><span>,</span>
  <span>only</span><span>:</span> <span>~w(index.html static finmoji emoji packs sounds images instance sw.js)</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Another very nice feature of Phoenis is that you can edit your code while your server is running. It gets automatically recompiled and the affected processes are automatically restarted, courtesy of the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.CodeReloader.html">Phoenix.CodeReloader</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span>  <span># Code reloading can be explicitly enabled under the</span>
  <span># :code_reloader configuration of your endpoint.</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>code_reloading?</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>Phoenix.CodeReloader</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Router</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Router.html">Routers</a> are the main hubs of Phoenix applications. They match HTTP requests to controller actions, wire up real-time channel handlers, and define a series of pipeline transformations for scoping middleware to sets of routes.</p>

<p>Pleroma's router is <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/router.ex"><code>web/router.ex</code></a>. The key function in the router is the <code>pipeline</code> which lets you create pipelines of plugs. Other functions are <code>scope</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>post</code>, <code>pipe_through</code>, all of these let you match on the url and whether you are dealing with a get or post request, and define appropriate pipelines of actions. For example, federated ActivityPub requests handled as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>scope</span> <span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>Pleroma.Web.ActivityPub</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>pipe_through</span><span>(</span><span>:activitypub</span><span>)</span>
  <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>"/users/:nickname/inbox"</span><span>,</span> <span>ActivityPubController</span><span>,</span> <span>:inbox</span><span>)</span>
  <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>"/inbox"</span><span>,</span> <span>ActivityPubController</span><span>,</span> <span>:inbox</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>where the <code>pipe_through(:activitypub)</code> call is used to insert a custom pipeline:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>pipeline</span> <span>:activitypub</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>:accepts</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>"activity+json"</span><span>])</span>
  <span>plug</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Plugs.HTTPSignaturePlug</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Controllers</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Controller.htm">Controllers</a> are used to group common functionality in the same (pluggable) module.  </p>

<p>Pleroma makes heavy use of controllers: almost every request is handled by a specific controller for any given protocol, e.g. <code>MastodonAPIController</code> or <code>ActivityPubController</code>. This makes it easy to identify the files to work on if you need to make a change to the code for a given protocol. For example, the ActivityPub post requests in the Router are handled by <code>inbox</code> function in the <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex">ActivityPubController</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>inbox</span><span>(%{</span><span>assigns</span><span>:</span> <span>%{</span><span>valid_signature</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}}</span> <span>=</span> <span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Federator</span><span>.</span><span>enqueue</span><span>(</span><span>:incoming_ap_doc</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span>
  <span>json</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>"ok"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Views</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.View.html">Views</a> are used to control the rendering of templates. You create a view module, a template and a set of assigns, which are basically key-value pairs.</p>

<p>Pleroma uses views for "rendering" JSON objects. For example in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex"><code>web/activity_pub/activity_pub_controller.ex</code></a> there are lines like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>UserView</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>"user.json"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>user</span><span>}))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, <code>UserView.render</code> is defined in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/activity_pub/views/user_view.ex"><code>web/activity_pub/views/user_view.ex</code></a> for a number of different "*.json" strings. These are not really templates, they are simply used to pattern match on the function definitions.</p>

<p>The more conventional usage to create HTML is also used, e.g. the template <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/templates/mastodon_api/mastodon/index.html.eex"><code>web/templates/mastodon_api/mastodon/index.html.eex</code></a>
is used in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/mastodon_api/mastodon_api_controller.ex"><code>web/mastodon_api/mastodon_api_controller.ex</code></a> via the view
<a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/mastodon_api/views/mastodon_view.ex"><code>web/mastodon_api/views/mastodon_view.ex</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>MastodonView</span><span>,</span> <span>"index.html"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>initial_state</span><span>:</span> <span>initial_state</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Templates</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Template.html">Templates</a> are text files (typically html pages) with Elixir code to generate the specific values based on the assigns, included in <code>&lt;%= ... %&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in Pleroma, the Mastodon front-end uses a template for the <code>index.html</code> file which has the code</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>%</span><span>=</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>get_env</span><span>(</span><span>:pleroma</span><span>,</span> <span>:instance</span><span>)[</span><span>:name</span><span>]</span> <span>%</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>to show the name of the instance.</p>

<h2>Ecto</h2>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html">Ecto</a> is not a part of Phoenix, but it is an integral part of most web applications: Ecto is Elixir's main library for working with databases. It provides the tools to interact with databases under a common API.</p>

<p>Ecto is split into 4 main components:</p>

<p>Ecto.Repo - repositories are wrappers around the data store. Via the repository, we can create, update, destroy and query existing entries. A repository needs an adapter and credentials to communicate to the database</p>

<p>Pleroma uses the PostgresQL database.</p>

<p>Ecto.Schema - schemas are used mainly to map tables into Elixir data (there are other use cases too).</p>

<p>Ecto.Changeset - changesets provide a way for developers to filter and cast external parameters, as well as a mechanism to track and validate changes before they are applied to your data</p>

<p>Ecto.Query - written in Elixir syntax, queries are used to retrieve information from the database.</p>

<h2>GenServer</h2>

<p>Because Elixir, like Erlang, uses a processes-with-message-passing paradigm, client-server relationships are so common that they have been abstracted as a <em>behaviour</em>, which in Elixir is a specification for composable modules which have to implement specified public functions (a bit like an interface in Java or typeclass in Haskell).</p>

<p>If we look at the <code>Federator.enqueue</code> function, its implementation actually reduces to a single line:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>cast</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>:enqueue</span><span>,</span> <span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>payload</span><span>,</span> <span>priority</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html">GenServer</a> is an Elixir behaviour module for implementing the server of a client-server relation. The <code>cast</code> call sends an asynchronous request to the server (synchronous requests use <code>call</code>). The server behaviour is implemented using the <code>handle_cast</code> callback, which handles <code>cast</code> calls. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/federator/federator.ex"><code>Pleroma.Federator</code></a>, these are implemented in the same module as the <code>enqueue</code> function, hence the use of <code>__MODULE__</code> rather than the hardcoded module name.</p>

<h2>Applications, Workers and Supervisors</h2>

<p>Elixir borrows the concept of a "supervision tree" from Erlang/OTP. AN application consists of a tree of processes than can either be <em>supervisors</em> or <em>workers</em>. The task of a supervisors is to ensure that the worker processes do their work, including distributing the work and restarting the worker processes when they die. Supervisors can supervise either worker or other supervisors, so you can build a <em>supervision tree</em>.</p>

<p>Elixir provides an <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Application.html">Application</a> behaviour module and a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html">Supervisor</a> module to make this easy. The Application module requires a <code>start()</code> function as entry point. Typical code to create a supervision tree is</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>Supervisor</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>children</span><span>,</span> <span>opts</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>where <code>start_link()</code> spawns the top process of the tree, and it spawns all the child processes in the list <code>children</code>. </p>

<p>Pleroma uses a convenient but deprecated module called <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.Spec.html">Supervisor.Spec</a> which provides <code>worker()</code> and <code>supervisor()</code> functions, for example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>children</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>supervisor</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Repo</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span>supervisor</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Endpoint</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span># ...</span>
  <span>worker</span><span>(</span><span>Pleroma.Web.Federator</span><span>,</span> <span>[]),</span>
  <span># ...</span>
<span>]</span>  
</code></pre></div>
<p>Every worker has this own <code>start_link</code> function,  e.g.  in <a href="https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/lib/pleroma/web/federator/federator.ex"><code>web/federator/federator.ex</code></a> we find: </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span></span><span>def</span> <span>start_link</span> <span>do</span>
  <span># ...</span>
  <span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This means that the Federator module borrows the <code>start_link</code> from the GenServer module. This is a very common way to create a worker.</p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty" target="_blank">Alacritty</a>
      is a terminal emulator with a strong focus on simplicity and performance.
      With such a strong focus on performance, included features are carefully
      considered and you can always expect Alacritty to be blazingly fast. By
      making sane choices for defaults, Alacritty requires no additional setup.
      However, it does allow configuration of many aspects of the terminal.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>By coincidence, right when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cherno</a> announced his game engine series I was just starting to get going on my own engine. I couldn’t wait to finally have a professional opinion on how to make one. With self-taught programming it’s hard to not doubt yourself constantly, wondering if you are doing things right or just think you are.</p>



<p>Recently, he has been posting videos about huge aspects of his engine like physics and entity systems, which were what I really wanted to learn about by making myself, but he ended up using libraries instead of going through the internals! I am not against using libraries, but to use them for the fun stuff? I felt like it defeated the point of making a <em>custom</em> engine series.</p>



<p>There is an argument to be made about saving time, but this was the first C++ project that I was making and the goal from the start was to go through all the major pillars of an engine: input, graphics, physics, entities, and audio. I wanted to learn how those things worked along with C++ and code design in general.</p>



<p>I bet that some other people are interested in the details of how these systems work, and I want to learn how to explain code better, so I am going to try and make some videos going over the internals of these systems. They end up being much simpler than at first glance.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s start with the physics engine…</strong></p>



<p>Physics engines are responsible for figuring out where each object in a scene is over time. Objects can collide with one another, then choose to respond in several ways. It’s a generic problem that the user can configure at several different levels. Do they want a collider? Do they want to respond to collisions? Do they want to simulate dynamics? They could want dynamics, but not gravity. It’s a problem that calls for good planning and robust design.</p>



<p>I looked at how <a href="https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">box2d</a> went about sorting their engines and concluded that the way bullet went about it was solid. I boiled it down to just what was needed, and based my design around that. There are already some <a href="https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-i-an-introduction-to-rigid-body-dynamics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great articles</a> going over the hard math involved, so I am going to focus on the design aspect instead because I haven’t seen anyone do that, and it’s also a real headache.</p>



<p>At the current moment, this physics engine is not fully featured, but in future articles I plan to build it out further. This article will not cover rotation, multiple contact point collisions, or constrained simulation. I think it will work out for the best as it’s easy to get overwhelmed, and I want to ease into those topics. With that out of the way, let’s dive into the different parts of a physics engine.</p>



<p>The problem can be split into 2 or 3 pieces, dynamics, collision detection, and collision response. I’ll start with dynamics because it is by far the simplest.</p>



<p><strong>Dynamics</strong></p>



<p>Dynamics is all about calculating where the new positions of objects are based on their velocity and acceleration. In high school you learn about the four kinematic equations along with Newton's three laws which describe the motion of objects. We’ll only be using the first and third kinematic equations, the others are more useful for analysis of situations, not simulation. That leaves us with:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+at</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">\Delta x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2</span></p><p>We can give ourselves more control by using Newtons 2<sup>nd</sup> law, subbing out acceleration giving us:</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">v = v_0+\frac{F}{m}t</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">x = x_0+vt</span></p><p>Each object needs to store these three properties: velocity, mass, and net force. Here we find the first decision we can make towards the design, net force could either be a list or a single vector. In school you make force diagrams and sum up the forces, implying that we should store a list. This would make it so you could set a force, but you would need to remove it later which could get annoying for the user. If we think about it further, net force is really the total force applied in a <em>single</em> frame, so we can use a vector and clear it at the end of each update. This allows the user to apply a force by adding it, but removing it is automatic. This shortens our code and gives a performance bump because there is no summation of forces, it’s a running total.</p>



<p>We’ll use this struct to store the object info for now.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Object</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Position</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;struct&nbsp;with&nbsp;3&nbsp;floats&nbsp;for&nbsp;x,&nbsp;y,&nbsp;z&nbsp;or&nbsp;i&nbsp;+&nbsp;j&nbsp;+&nbsp;k</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Velocity</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Force</span><span>;</span>
	<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>Mass</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>We need a way to keep track of the objects we want to update. A classic approach is to have a <em>physics world</em> that has list of objects and a <em>step</em> function that loops over each one. Let’s see how that might look; I’ll omit header/cpp files for brevity.</p>



<pre><span>class</span>&nbsp;<span>PhysicsWorld</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
<span>private</span><span>:</span>
	<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Object</span><span>*&gt;</span>&nbsp;<span>m_objects</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>m_gravity</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>vector3</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>-</span><span>9.81f</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>);</span>
 
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>AddObject</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>object</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>/*&nbsp;...&nbsp;*/</span>&nbsp;<span>}</span>
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>RemoveObject</span><span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>object</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>/*&nbsp;...&nbsp;*/</span>&nbsp;<span>}</span>
 
	<span>void</span>&nbsp;<span>Step</span><span>(</span>
		<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>)</span>
	<span>{</span>
		<span>for</span>&nbsp;<span>(</span><span>Object</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span>&nbsp;<span>:</span>&nbsp;<span>m_objects</span><span>)</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Mass</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>m_gravity</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;apply&nbsp;a&nbsp;force</span>
 
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Velocity</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>/</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Mass</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>;</span>
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Position</span>&nbsp;<span>+=</span>&nbsp;<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Velocity</span>&nbsp;<span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>dt</span><span>;</span>
 
			<span>obj</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>Force</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>vector3</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>,</span>&nbsp;<span>0</span><span>);</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;reset&nbsp;net&nbsp;force&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;end</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Note the use of pointers, this forces other systems to take care of the actual storing of objects, leaving the physics engine to worry about physics, not memory allocation.</p>



<p>With this you can simulate all sorts of stuff from objects flying through the sky to solar systems.</p>

<p>You can do a lot with this, but it’s the easy part to be honest, and that’s not what you came for…</p>



<p><strong>Collision detection</strong></p>



<p>Collision detection is more involved, but we can lighten the load by using some clever tricks. Let’s think about what needs to be found first. If we look at some examples of objects colliding, we notice that in most cases there is a point on each shape that is furthest inside the other.</p>

<p>This turns out to be all we need to respond to a collision. From those two points we can find the normal, and how deep the objects are inside one another. This is huge because it means that we can abstract the idea of different shapes away, and only worry about the points in the response.</p>



<p>Let’s jump into the code, we’ll need some helper structs that I’ll note first.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>A</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;A&nbsp;into&nbsp;B</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>B</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Furthest&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;into&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Normal</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A&nbsp;normalized</span>
	<span>float</span>&nbsp;<span>Depth</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Length&nbsp;of&nbsp;B&nbsp;–&nbsp;A</span>
	<span>bool</span>&nbsp;<span>HasCollision</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
 
<span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>&nbsp;<span>//&nbsp;Describes&nbsp;an&nbsp;objects&nbsp;location</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Position</span><span>;</span>
	<span>vector3</span>&nbsp;<span>Scale</span><span>;</span>
	<span>quaternion</span>&nbsp;<span>Rotation</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Each shape will have a different type of collider to hold its properties and a base to allow them to be stored. Any type of collider should be able to test for a collision with any other type, so we’ll add functions in the base for each one. These functions will take <em>Transforms</em>, so the colliders can use relative coordinates. I’ll only demonstrate spheres and planes, but the code is repeatable for any number of colliders.</p>



<pre><span>struct</span>&nbsp;<span>Collider</span>&nbsp;<span>{</span>
	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>
		<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>Transform</span><span>*</span>&nbsp;<span>transform</span><span>,</span>

	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>

	<span>virtual</span>&nbsp;<span>CollisionPoints</span>&nbsp;<span>TestCollision</span><span>(</span>

<span>};</span>
</pre>



<p>Let’s make both types of colliders at the same time too see how they interact. A sphere is defined as a point and a radius, and a plane is defined as a vector and a distance. We’ll override the functions from <em>Collider</em>, but won’t worry about the work for now.</p>



<p>We can choose per collider which other colliders it will detect by filling, or not filling, in these functions. In this case, we don’t want Plane v Plane collisions, so we return an empty <em>CollisionPoints</em>.</p>

<p>We can add a function for testing the base and use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double dispatch</a>. This takes advantage of the type system to determine both types of colliders for us by swapping the arguments, determining the first, then the second type through two calls of TestCollision. This saves us needing to know what type of colliders we are checking, which means we’ve fully abstracted away the notion of different shapes outside the collision detection.</p>

    <p>2020 has flipped the investment scene upside down: retail investors are now in charge. It first struck me when i picked the <a href="https://shyal.com/blog/tesla-stock-bottom-date">tesla stock bottom date</a> while professional financial advisors, professional investors, and economics professors missed the entire 800% move.</p>
<h2 id="millenials-hold-the-reins">Millenials hold the reins</h2>
<p>Don't want to take my word for it? Then in the words of billionaire investor Chamath Paliphpitiya:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Retail investors now have access to so much information that it's almost on parity with people that work in traditional investment organisations" -- Chamath Palihapitiya</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 48.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2048.png"></p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-retail-flows">The importance of retail flows</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.biancoresearch.com/about-us/">Jim Bianco</a>, a macro strategist who recently featured on <a href="https://realvision.com/">RealVision</a> also agrees: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well, that seems to be what's going on with a lot of this money, even though a traditional AAII account might have half a million dollars in it, and a Robinhood account might have 10,000 just to use a number, that 10,000 will turn over every day or two, that half a million might do three trades a year. That Robinhood account will have a bigger influence on the flow of money in and out of the markets than those other accounts. Citadel says that about 25% of all trading in the markets, they said this to Bloomberg a few weeks ago, is retail investors on peak days, 20% on normal days. Now the third group" -- Jim Bianco @ RealVision</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>on peak days, people trading on their apps are actually driving the price action.</li>
<li>the rest of the time (non peak days) they still dictate about a third of the price action.</li>
</ul>
<p>The average Robinhood investor is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/robinhood-profiles-morgan-stanley-etrade">30 years old</a>. </p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 51.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2051.png"></p>
<h2 id="listen-to-the-millennials-who-have-savings">Listen to the Millennials (who have savings)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGberGnxiJk">Thomas Lee</a> also agrees, and has been warning us that Millennials are now entering into their peak income years. It turns out Millennials love <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthstock.asp">"growth stocks"</a> (companies which re-invest in themselves and focus on exponential growth).</p>
<p>If TSLA teaches us anything, it is that big disruptive growth stock companies have become too complex for traditional finance to analyze under their existing lense. They'll often blend AI, SAAS, economies of scale, etc. and require a more technologically versed group of analysts to properly price.</p>
<p>Maybe this is something Millenials can do, natively, especially when not pressured by their boomer CEOs while working in the traditional fin jobs? After all, Millenials grew up programming their parents' VCRs.</p>
<p>Another thesis is that <strong>it doesn't matter whether millennials are right or wrong</strong>. They are now calling the shots. If they say it's right, then it's right.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 50.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2050.png"></p>
<h2 id="ditch-your-hedge-fund">Ditch your hedge fund</h2>
<p>We now know that hedge funds are basically a money-making myth:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hedge funds lost 3.8% of assets globally in 2019, the most since 2009" --<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/clients-withdrew-nearly-1-of-all-hedge-fund-assets-in-december-2020-02-18">market watch</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also ditch your financial advisor if they missed all the important trends of 2020. They'll tell you that you cannot live without them; they'll enter self-preservation mode, but remember they make money from you; and the data is showing they should start paying you for advice, not vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="to-sum-up">To sum up</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do your own research, you have access to as much information as investment firms.</li>
<li>Listen to 30 year olds. What companies do they like? <strong>30 year olds dictate the trends</strong>.</li>
<li>Research <strong>good</strong> investment apps: apps that let you directly buy:<ul>
<li>Stocks</li>
<li>Commodities</li>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start <strong>small</strong>, while you learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are now in charge.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
      <p>When used well, TODOs can help you write more robust code and minimise
unhandled edge cases. When used badly, they disappear into your codebase and
are forgotten, marking problems which will never be fixed.</p>
<p>Here’s what I think of as a best-practice system for using TODOs. It treats
them like sticky notes and is made up of two rules and four actions. I call it
“TODO Zero”.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-rules">The two rules</h2>
<p>There are only two rules, and everything flows from them.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Capture every useful thought in a TODO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave no TODOs in shipped code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-four-actions">The four actions</h2>
<p>Something must be done with a TODO which was created because of Rule 1 before
it is deleted because of Rule 2, so the rules give rise to the four actions.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Disregard it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an issue (or ticket) from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert it to a note.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-system">The system</h2>
<p>These rules and actions combine to create a simple system which works like
this.</p>
<p>When you’re writing code and you have a useful idea or thought which isn’t
directly relevant to the code you’re writing at that instant, record it as a
TODO. Then as soon as you’ve done that forget about it and go back to the
code you were writing.</p>
<p>Treat a TODO as a temporary reminder, like a sticky note. It serves two
purposes. The first is to make sure that ideas and insights which you can’t act
on straight away aren’t forgotten. The second is to clear your mind of thoughts
that aren’t relevant to what you’re doing right at that instant.</p>
<p>Over your work session, review the TODOs you’ve written. Your aim for each one
is to use one of the four actions to deal with it, and then delete it. Just
like sticky notes, TODOs are thrown out as soon as they’ve served their purpose
as a reminder, and just like sticky notes, they don’t make it into the final
product.</p>
<p>Before your code reaches the branch from which you ship (i.e. release or
deploy), all the TODOs you’ve created should be deleted. No TODOs should
survive in your finished code, which is where the name <em>TODO Zero</em> comes from.</p>
<h2 id="lets-dive-in">Let’s dive in</h2>
<p>That was the high-level summary, now stay with me as I explain how it works,
why it works and how to best make it work for you.</p>
<p>First, let’s start with a look at the most common problem <em>TODO Zero</em> saves you
from – The Forgotten TODO.</p>
<h2 id="the-forgotten-todo">The Forgotten TODO</h2>
<p>A TODO usually marks something that the person who left it didn’t have the
time, energy or knowledge to take care of.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re coding productively and you don’t want to slow down to handle
an unlikely edge case, so you quickly throw in a comment like this and move on:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># TODO: Handle an empty list.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or you’re racing the clock on a deadline. The function you’ve just finished is
unpleasantly complicated <em>but it works</em>, and so you add a note like this above
it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># TODO: Clean this function up.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or maybe an aspect of what you’re doing is a bit beyond your current
capabilities, so you leave a comment like this behind hoping that someone with
the right skills will see it one day and sort it out:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># TODO: Optimise for large querysets.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s easy to write a TODO and tell ourselves someone will get to it sometime.
But is that what really happens once we finish working with that code? Does
someone get to it, ever? In my experience, the answer is usually “no”.</p>
<p>How often have you stumbled across a TODO in some rarely visited code, only to
ignore it and move on because it’s not relevant to the task at hand? How many
people before you have ignored that same comment, just as you did? And so there
it stays through the ages, forgotten.</p>
<p><em>TODO Zero</em> stops TODOs being forgotten because it requires us to do something
with them rather than letting them sneak into shipped code.</p>
<p>Let’s see how to put it into practice!</p>
<h2 id="rule-1-capture-every-useful-thought-in-a-todo">Rule 1: Capture every useful thought in a TODO</h2>
<p>If you’re anything like me, you’ll have thoughts and realisations about the
code you’re working on faster than you can implement them.</p>
<p>Many of these will be useful, and easily forgotten. If you try to remember
them, you’ll find that they get in the way of you focusing properly on the code
you’re writing, <em>and you’ll still forget some</em>. The less you try to remember,
the lower your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load" target="_blank">cognitive load</a> and the more clearly you can think.</p>
<p>It’s much better to capture them in TODOs as they come to you, as if you were
jotting them down quickly on sticky notes. Do this and you can come back and
take care of each one when you have time and can give it your full attention.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’ve just finishing writing the signature of the <code>display_errors</code>
function when two edge cases it will need to handle come to mind. You can
capture them like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>display_errors</span>(error_list):
    <span># TODO: Handle a really long list. Truncate and add count of hidden items?</span>
    <span># TODO: Handle error messages with &gt;100 characters.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s better to get the main path through the function fleshed out before
shifting focus to handle those edge cases, so you make them into TODOs and
forget about them for now.</p>
<p>Then let’s say you’re only two lines into <code>display_errors</code> when you have a
realisation about the thread-safety of the <code>build_pdf</code> function you wrote an
hour ago. Again, capture it in a TODO. It doesn’t matter where. You can put it
right where you’re working for the time being and move it later:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>display_errors</span>(error_list):
    <span>for</span> error <span>in</span> error_list:
        <span>print</span>(error)
    <span># TODO: Ensure that build_pdf function is thread-safe.</span>
    <span># TODO: Handle a really long list. Truncate and add hidden item count?</span>
    <span># TODO: Handle error messages with &gt;100 characters.</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When you use TODOs in this way, you ensure that every realisation and edge case
which occurs to you is recorded and will be dealt with. Once recorded they
can’t fall through the cracks, so your code will be more robust.</p>
<p>Because a TODO is now just a note to yourself, don’t take time making it
detailed or perfect. You’re the only one who will read it. As long as you can
understand it, that’s all that matters. Just like a sticky note.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_%28author%29" target="_blank">David Allen's</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" target="_blank">Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology</a> will recognise what I’ve just
described as what he calls “ubiquitous capture”. Which is really just another
way of saying that if you have a good idea, record it somewhere so you don’t
forget it.</p>
<h2 id="rule-2-leave-no-todos-in-shipped-code">Rule 2: Leave no TODOs in shipped code</h2>
<p>The TODOs you create represent tasks you need to do, problems you need to solve
or ideas you need to consider as part of the work you’re doing.</p>
<p>Every single one should be addressed and then removed before the code reaches
the branch you ship from.</p>
<p>By addressing them all, you gain the confidence of knowing that every potential
problem or issue which occurred to you has been dealt with, so your code is as
thorough as you can make it.</p>
<p>Addressing a TODO requires you to <em>do something with it</em> so that it is no
longer needed. That means applying one of the four actions – disregard it, do
it, create an issue from it or convert it to a note. I’ll explain each of them
in more detail shortly.</p>
<p>As you progress through the work you’re doing, take some time now and then to
look over the TODOs you’ve made. When the time is right for each one, do
something with it and then delete it.</p>
<p>I use this <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction" target="_blank">Makefile</a> target which lists all TODOs to help with that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span>todos</span>:
    @grep -r -v <span>"| grep TODO"</span> . | grep TODO
</code></pre></div>
<p>You should find that as you get closer to finishing there are fewer and fewer
remaining. When you finish, ensure that there are none left at all. Your code
is not complete until they have all been addressed and removed.</p>
<p>Again, think of a TODO like a sticky note. It’s a scrappy short-term reminder
that doesn’t belong in a finished product and is disposed of when it has served
its purpose.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at each of the four actions.</p>
<h2 id="action-1-disregard-it">Action 1: Disregard it</h2>
<p><em>Sometimes you’re wrong.</em></p>
<p>When you record all the thoughts and ideas that cross your mind, once you come
back later to give them your full attention, it’s inevitable that some will
turn out to be junk, or mistakes, or just not worth doing.</p>
<p>Maybe you thought you saw an edge case where there wasn’t one. Maybe what
seemed like a good idea turns out to be a bad idea. Maybe you saw an
opportunity for an optimisation which would actually be too time-consuming to
be worth doing.</p>
<p>Not to worry. When you come across a TODO like this, disregard it, delete it,
and move on.</p>
<h2 id="action-2-do-it">Action 2: Do it</h2>
<p><em>Sometimes you’re right.</em></p>
<p>Often a TODO contains a good idea that’s worth doing, and worth doing now.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s an easy optimisation. Maybe it’s dealing with an edge case.</p>
<p>If it’s necessary to complete your work, or if it’s not but you think it’s
worth doing now anyway, do it. Then once you’ve done it, delete that TODO.</p>
<h2 id="action-3-create-an-issue-or-ticket-from-it">Action 3: Create an issue (or ticket) from it.</h2>
<p><em>Sometimes it can wait for later.</em></p>
<p>There will be some TODOs which describe something which will need to be done
eventually, but which can wait until after your code is shipped.</p>
<p>For each of these, create an issue from it in the project’s issue tracker, then
delete the TODO.</p>
<p>Although some people argue that in cases like this leaving TODOs in shipped
code is an effective way to track tasks that need to be done, I disagree. I’m a
believer in the benefits of having a single source of truth for work to be
done. When an issue tracker isn’t tracking <em>all</em> the work for a project, you
undermine its effectiveness, and I say that because my experience is that
what’s not in the issue tracker doesn’t get done.</p>
<h2 id="action-4-convert-it-to-a-note">Action 4: Convert it to a note.</h2>
<p><em>Sometimes it’s just not going to happen.</em></p>
<p>Some TODOs fall into the category of “in a perfect world we’d address that, but
it’s never likely to be important enough to worry about”.</p>
<p>In my experience, these are often the ones which flag edge cases which are
either very unlikely to arise, or won’t have worrying consequences when they
do, or both.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Life as an introvert</strong> is rarely easy. Ever since I graduated, Iâ€™ve been compelled to work in open-plan offices. Itâ€™s exhausting. Imagine being engaged in a task that requires high concentration, such as looking for a lost earing in the middle of a tennis court. Now imagine that an automatic ball launcher keeps shooting balls directly at you. Wouldnâ€™t you get tired quickly, and be much less efficient in your search? This is how I feel during my work, when sudden and repeating distractions are â€˜shotâ€™ at or near my desk.</p><p>The struggle of an introvert doesnâ€™t end in the office. Networking at conferences, some with thousands of attendees, is a central part of an academic career. Picture yourself entering a huge hall, with bright neon lights, hundreds of people in each aisle, and a background din that forces you to yell to be heard. In a typical two-hour poster session, youâ€™re expected to acquire the information you need while also efficiently introducing your own work to colleagues. As an introvert, the experience is equal to riding a terrifying rollercoaster while having to maintain a big smile on your face.</p><p>I wish I could say these types of challenge are limited to the work environment, but thatâ€™s not the case. For my most recent birthday, a friend bought me a dinner at EatWith â€“ a meal-sharing platform. Youâ€™re invited to dine in the house of strangers who cook for you and other participating guests. I would enjoy the food and cultural experience if I didnâ€™t have to go through the excruciating labour of small talk with random people. â€˜Sounds like fun,â€™ I said politely to my friend, but privately my immediate sense was that this was yet another ill-designed platform for introverts.</p><p>Today, as a psychologist, I know that introversion is a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2015/12/11/personality-and-interest-in-science-health-topics/" target="_blank">common</a> trait. Unlike shyness, which is more about a fear of being judged negatively, introversion is defined as a preference for quiet, less stimulating environments. The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung was the first to propose differentiating individuals along an introvert-extravert axis. Writing in the 1920s, he <a href="http://www.cyjack.com/cognition/(ebook%20pdf)%20jung,%20carl%20-%20the%20psychological%20types.pdf" target="_blank">described</a> introverts as preferring to direct their attention inward, to their own feelings and thoughts, and how they lose energy during social interactions. Extraverts, by contrast, direct their attention outward, gain energy from social interactions, and lose energy during periods of solitude.</p><p>Beginning in the 1950s, the German-born psychologist Hans Eysenck proposed a physiological explanation for the difference between introverts and extraverts. Extraverts, he <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1964.tb00912.x" target="_blank">said</a>, have a lower baseline level of cortical arousal relative to introverts, leading them to search for external stimulation to increase their motivation, attention and alertness. Introvertsâ€™ higher baseline arousal levels, in contrast, lead them to withdraw. Contemporary psychology still considers the introversion-extraversion distinction a core aspect of personality (it is one of the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-09869-001" target="_blank">so-called</a> â€˜Big Fiveâ€™ traits), although it is seen as a continuous spectrum along which we are all positioned, rather than a dichotomous state.</p><p>Although thereâ€™s no definitive way of identifying the proportion of introverts in the population, Susan Cain, an influential thinker in the field, has made a reasonable <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/296/296443/quiet-power/9780241977910.html" target="_blank">estimate</a> that at least a third of people are at one end of this spectrum. The third on the other end are extraverts, and the final third fall somewhere in between â€“ some <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327752jpa4305_14" target="_blank">call</a> these people â€˜ambivertsâ€™. Knowing that introverts comprise an approximately equal share of the population as extraverts, I keep wondering about the missing 33 per cent â€“ where are all the introverts in the ocean of extraverts that surround me in my daily life?</p><p>Many of the decisions relating to the daily life of introverts are in the hands of extraverts</p><p><strong>While I have introverted</strong> friends, they seem to be vastly outnumbered by my extraverted friends and acquaintances. I have to remind myself that this apparent absence from my daily landscape is not surprising: we introverts are much harder to notice. Introverts probably wonâ€™t be the ones sharing a joke with the entire office, waiting by the coffee machine for a chance to chat, or appearing on television screens as rising reality-show stars. On the contrary, theyâ€™re more likely to enjoy some quiet time by themselves or with a few selected friends, to process their thoughts silently before saying them out loud, and to retreat to their quiet-place to recharge after social interactions.</p><p>While the higher visibility of extraverts is self-explanatory, it is far from trivial. Not only does it mean introversion is perceived as less common than it really is, but also introverts are less likely to be evenly represented in influential social groups, including in politics. We risk missing the immense contribution of a large percentage of our employees, students, trainees and friends.</p><p>For <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0894439312462802" target="_blank">example</a>, extraverts are more likely to take part in political engagements, such as disseminating political messages and signing petitions, both on the internet and offline. Negative political messages, which seem so common nowadays, <a href="https://jspp.psychopen.eu/article/view/280" target="_blank">deter</a> introverts from participating in politics, while having the opposite influence on extraverts, including increasing their likelihood of voting, rallying or volunteering for a political campaign. Extraverts are more <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001472" target="_blank">active</a> on social media. They also have easier access to higher corporate ranks, due to the high attention they draw to themselves and to social <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fire.12173" target="_blank">stereotypes</a> that associate extravert characteristics with leadership. This state of affairs leaves many of the decisions relating to the daily life of introverts in the hands of the extraverts.</p><p>Unfortunately, the greater representation of extraverts in social and political life is self-perpetuating. Working conditions chosen by extraverts to suit extraverts increase the burden on introverts. For instance, group meetings, in which each participant contributes thoughts in a disorganised, dominance-based manner, can put introverts at a disadvantage. The overabundance of extraverts in managing and recruitment roles also decreases the likelihood of introverts winning promotion due to whatâ€™s <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-02267-014" target="_blank">called</a> the â€˜similarity biasâ€™ â€“ our tendency to prefer people who are similar to ourselves. This is not only unfair to introverts, itâ€™s to the detriment of organisations.</p><p>Leadership is commonly associated with extraversion, but history teaches us that introverts can serve as powerful leaders. Rosa Parks, a leading activist in the American civil rights movement, was quiet and reserved. Her brave actions, more than her words, led to a crucial turning-point in the struggle. Similarly, while serving as US president, Barack Obama eagerly protected his solitude in the evenings, spending the time reading and concentrating on work decisions. His preference for small group outings rather than big social events didnâ€™t deprive him of extraordinary communication skills and the ability to make bold decisions. In <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10904018.2016.1202770" target="_blank">contrast</a> to the mistaken perception of introverts as snobbish, misanthropic or depressed, we can be highly empathic, with strong communicative skills.</p><p>But itâ€™s not a case of establishing whether introverts or extraverts make better leaders, rather each brings something different, and diversity is often key to effective leadership. For <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11365-014-0334-3" target="_blank">instance</a>, entrepreneurial teams perform better when leadership is shared between individuals, but only if they have diverse personality traits. Moreover, teams dominated by extraverted members <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-15936-006" target="_blank">actually</a> perform better under introverted leaders, possibly due to their greater responsiveness to their employeesâ€™ ideas.</p><p>Introversion is not something to be fixed â€“ but a blessed source of human diversity</p><p>The main cultural problem is that introverts are widely seen as not adapted to the environment, instead of it being acknowledged that the environment is designed to profit extraverts. Societyâ€™s praise and acceptance of extraversion as the norm has led many introverts, along with many ambiverts, to suppress different aspects of their personality, or to see them as flaws. This state of affairs is bad not only for introverts, but for society as a whole.</p><p><strong>The bias begins already</strong> in the first grade of school. Learning in a big classroom environment might be cost-efficient, but is by no means the best model for everyone. Some kids, especially the introverts, will struggle in the continuous company of a large number of others and the constant requirement to engage in group work. The same misconception â€“ placing the onus on introverts to change â€“ is also reflected in the recent <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-18181-001" target="_blank">proposal</a> that introverts would be happier if only they â€˜acted more extravertedâ€™, even if acting this way counteracts their natural tendencies.</p><p>Simple changes across society could be made to mitigate the inequities faced by introverts. In the educational system, for example, designated private spaces in schools could enable periodic shelter for those introverted kids and others who need a place to recharge. Introverts could also profit from greater access to online learning and sharing platforms, with asynchronous communication <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-0625-8_15" target="_blank">enabling</a> them to think and research an area without the pressure to respond immediately. Creating equal opportunities for participation in class, such as giving students time to think, the autonomy to decide to work alone or to write their ideas instead of presenting them verbally, could also help rebalance the traditional inequity.</p><p>In business and academic settings, workers should have more autonomy in choosing their working conditions. In meetings, stating the topics to be discussed in advance could allow more time for introverts to prepare and process the information. Allocating time for each attendee to speak could also give introverts the chance to express their thoughts. There should be more questioning of whether group meetings are necessarily the best platform for disseminating knowledge, brainstorming …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>A core motivation for building DoltHub was to empower organizations to collaboratively create and maintain high quality data assets that they could collectively depend on. This is very much analogous to GitHub. Analogies are powerful ways to articulate an idea when an appropriate one is already widely understood. In our case a large community of developers, and technology adjacent businesses more broadly, understand GitHub, and how it enabled a revolution in open source software. It's therefore straightforward for us to explain our product in terms of an analogy.</p>
<p>The balance of this article is about the, relatively nascent, open data ecosystem, and the similarities and differences with the the open source software ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Open Source Software</h2>
<p>Collaborative public development of software is not necessary for it to be considered "open source", this is a characteristic of the distribution licensing, but when one uses the term "open source" that is normally what is implicitly understood. Indeed at various points in my career assessing whether to adopt a tool often involved gauging how "vibrant" the "community" around that tool was. What does this mean in specifically?</p>
<ul>
<li>gauging the level of mailing list activity, JIRA board back and forth, or GitHub issues to see a healthy interest in the tool, that is a user base</li>
<li>checking Git commit logs to see if there is a healthy base of contributors</li>
</ul>
<p>The fundamental thing this kind of analysis seeks to establish is a qualitative sense of whether a <em>healthy</em> dynamic exists around the project. At a fundamental level marginal users must see value in the project, and some fraction of them must be willing to convert to contributors in order to sustain the project. If significant investment is attracted, then the user base can grow as the project in creases in scope and quality, thus becoming a solution to more and more problems. This is the "flywheel" that sustains open source projects that allow companies to drop in pieces of software infrastructure that they might otherwise have to buy or maintain. The existence of the open source alternative allows these companies to compare the cost of buying or building to having a stake in a free to use tool, usually outside their core competency.</p>
<p>This is not a scientific, or exhaustive, theory of open source software project dynamics, but it seems a reasonable first approximation of the dynamic that drives companies to seek to employ open source contributors to projects that constitute a critical part of their infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Open Data</h2>
<p>To start to gauge the relevance of this analogy at the level of "project dynamics", I performed a quick Google search:
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/images/open-data-project-google-search.png">Open Data Projects Google Search</a></p>
<p>The first, non-paid, article is a blog by a SaaS business focused on "spatial data science", and so while data sources may be interesting, they are picked because they compliment Carto's business thesis of the value of geo spatial data. Furthermore, most of the identified "projects" are the work of an individual or organization publishing, rather than the kind of distributed collaboration we identified as the core of the open source software development model.</p>
<p>The next two links are initiatives by the government to make data publicly available. While government data can be great, the existence of single publisher is the essence of its value. We then have Kaggle, a well known platform for machine learning competitions. Since a necessary prerequisite for a machine learning competition is a dataset, Kaggle hosts a lot of free datasets. However, they tend to be tailored toward the competition, and most are not updated, nor is there any concept of collaboration on a single dataset. We then reach some summary articles, probably what we were really looking for, that identify interesting and compelling "open data." However, again these data sources are mostly organizations and governments, or quasi government, entities <em>publishing</em>.</p>
<p>It seems pretty clear that the term "open data" often just means "available data", a one directional relationship where individuals and organizations can consume a data source passively. But how are organizations that have a shared interest in a dataset that is necessary but not a core competitive advantage supposed to collaborate?</p>
<p>Let's dig into an example.</p>
<h2>Open Elections</h2>
<p>One interesting open data project that looks bit like open source software is Open Elections. We have <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-01-open-elections/">blogged about</a> the project in the past. Recapping, the goal of the project is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is to create the first free, comprehensive, standardized, linked set of election data for the United States, including federal and statewide offices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interest in voting data is broad, and is driven by both professional and personal motivations. Furthermore, many organizations have an interest in voting data, but lack the financial resources to buy it. Many commercial grade solutions, such as the associated press, are tailored to large media organizations with big budgets and low latency tolerance. This is not a good trade off for researchers or campaigns. Open Elections seeks to democratize access to this data by making high quality precinct level results available.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of wide interest in the data there is a sizable base of contributors. It's not hard to imagine that a researcher or enthusiast sees the Open Elections <a href="http://openelections.net/">homepage</a>, and realizes that with a small outlay of effort they can extend the dataset to meet their needs. They <em>convert from a user to a contributor</em>. This looks much more like open source software than random quasi-governmental agencies pushing out collections of CSVs whenever they see fit. To be clear, this is not to be scoffed at, but it's an entirely different model of data distribution.</p>
<p>Open Elections is managed via GitHub, which makes sense as that's the most notable platform around for administering a project with this dynamic. It's also free to use, widely understood, and the product is mature and well executed. However, one shortcoming of using data in a format such as CSV is that the format itself is "loose", it is after all a file format. Databases are a file format in a sense, but differ hugely in they require a program to edit the format. In essence that program, the query engine, "gates" interactions with the format, which in turn enables much stronger "guarantees" to be presented. These guarantees are described by a schema, and enable the use of a query language. Dolt uses SQL. Datasets store in a database are much more work to build than collections of data files separated by commas, but when data arrives in a database the time to value is radically compressed. We published a subset of the Open Elections data as a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/open-elections/voting-data">Dolt repository</a>, which does a nice job of illustrating the power of the distribution model.</p>
<p>This is the core value proposition of Dolt to the open data community, it offers mechanism for building high quality production grade resources, and delivering a uniquely seamless consumption experience to users of the data.</p>
<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>Putting data in relational databases is hard. The analogy to open source software would be unit tests. While the existence of such a "forcing function" to quality makes the life of the contributor harder by raising the barrier to creating a successful contribution, it also greatly elevates the experience of the marginal user.</p>
<p>That forcing function, using a database with Git-like features for managing open data project, is essential to our vision for Dolt and DoltHub in the open data world. We see Dolt the database, and the collaboration features built on top of it for DoltHub, as having the potential to elevate the quality of the data assets that come out of open data projects such that businesses are more willing to rely on them, and therefore invest in the projects themselves.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To recap, we have used the analogy of open source code, and Git and GitHub, to articulate the goals of Dolt and DoltHub in many places, including this blog. While the analogy is a powerful communication tool, it does tend to gloss over the key differences between the dynamics at play in collaborative process design, open source software, and collaborative fact assembly, open data.</p>
<p>One reason that we believe open data projects have not taken off is lack of tools that make it easy for contributors to publish high quality data assets that clear the threshold of quality such that commercial enterprises see them as viable alternatives to proprietary and paid solutions. Dolt and DoltHub represent our attempt to facilitate collaboration that creates high quality data assets that can become reliable dependencies.</p></div></div>]]>

Rebuilding the app from scratch may have not been the best choice, but during that process I have massively simplified the app's data structure, despaghettified some messy UI code, and spent two full days trying to solve a problem that didn't exist. This is the story of that last bit.</p> <h2 id="-structural-changes">## Structural Changes</h2> <p>The new app, so far, was mostly the same as the old version but without the <code>AppDelegate.swift</code> or <code>SceneDelegate.swift</code> files (using the new XCode 12 multiplatform app template). I also combined the Core Data <code>FloatingTask</code> and <code>DailyTask</code> entities into one <code>Task</code> entity. By this point, everything was running well enough so I started to migrate more code into the new codebase starting with the fetch request:</p> <pre><code>@FetchRequest(
    entity: Task.entity(),
    sortDescriptors: [
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Task.completed, ascending: true),
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Task.priority, ascending: false),
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Task.name, ascending: true)
    ]
) var tasks: FetchedResults&lt;Task&gt;</code></pre> <h2 id="-breaking-taskview">## Breaking TaskView</h2> <p>Tasks are displayed as <code>TaskView</code>s in a <code>ForEach</code> loop on the homescreen, which is simple enough. The <code>TaskView</code> struct, however, is relatively complicated. The purpose of <code>TaskView</code> is to represent and manipulate a single <code>Task</code>. In the previous version of the app (I'm going to call the original version 2.0 and the rewrite 3.0 from now on), this involved passing a number of attributes individually to be manipulated as the view's <code>@State</code>. When migrating the view, I reduced this to a single <code>@ObservedObject</code>. I also removed some of the text styling, which I planned to port over after I got the UI functional.</p> <p>I ran the app on my device, and this happened:</p> <p><video controls="" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/ascending-checkmarks-error.webm"><a href="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/ascending-checkmarks-error.webm">As you check off any task in the vertical stack, instead of checking off the task that you selected, tasks are checked off starting from the bottom and moving upwards in an ascending order.</a></video></p> <p>Well that was unexpected. Instead of checking off the tasks I selected, tasks were checked off starting from the bottom and ascending – obviously not the intended behavior! My first thought was that it was caused by the use of <code>@ObservedObject</code> to declare the view's task property –&nbsp;I haven't seen it used to manipulate a Core Data entity before, but it's worked fine so far in txtodo – so I rewrote the variables to match version 2.0.</p> <p><img alt="The variables declared before the UI of version 3.0 and version 2.0. Version 3.0 has two variables, task and config, but version 2.0 has nine: task, completed, name, priority, deleted, editingText, editingPriority, viewingNotes, and confirmingDelete." src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/variable-comparison.webp"></p> <p>Still no change. It was getting pretty late at this point, but I decided to stick it out for just a bit longer. I rewrote the <code>TaskView</code> struct from scratch <em>two more times</em> to no avail. Something was wrong, but I had no idea where it was and there was no way I was going to figure it out at two in the morning by coding it again the exact same way.</p> <h2 id="-fantastic-bugs-and-where-to-find-them">## Fantastic Bugs and Where to Find Them</h2> <p>The next morning, I took a look at the code again. If the problem wasn't in <code>TaskView</code>, where was it? The only other thing in the UI was the button to make a new task, which looked something like this:</p> <pre><code>Button(action: {
    let newTask = Task(context: self.managedObjectContext)
    newTask.name = "test"
    newTask.priority = 3
    newTask.notes = [String]() as NSObject
    newTask.id = UUID()
    newTask.date = Date.init()
    newTask.daily = true
    do {
        try self.managedObjectContext.save()
    } catch {
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}) {
    Text("Add")
}</code></pre> <p>Some of you may have figured it out by this point. At the time, I was still confused – this was the exact method I was using in my previous app, but with preset values – how could it be broken? I modified the generation slightly so I could tell the difference between tasks, and hopefully get to the bottom of the issue:</p> <pre><code>let newTask = Task(context: self.managedObjectContext)
newTask.name = String(UUID().uuidString.prefix(Int.random(in: 5..&lt;9)))
newTask.priority = Int16.random(in: 1..&lt;4)
newTask.notes = [String]() as NSObject
newTask.id = UUID()
newTask.date = Date.init()
newTask.daily = Bool.random()</code></pre> <p>I ran the app again and saw this:</p> <p><video controls="" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/randomized-test-values.webm"><a href="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/randomized-test-values.webm">The tasks were not being marked off in ascending order – rather, they were being moved to the bottom when completed, which I couldn't tell before because they were all identical.</a></video></p> <h2 id="-intentional-behavior">## Intentional Behavior</h2> <p>The tasks weren't being marked off in ascending order. They were being moved to the bottom automatically when marked as complete, which I couldn't see because a) all the tasks were identical and b) there were no animations to indicate that was happening. They were sorted by the <code>FetchRequest</code> with a <code>NSSortDescriptor</code>, to make sure that the unfinished tasks are the first thing the user sees. The "glitch" I had spent two days chasing down was entirely by design, and I had just forgotten.</p> <p>There were two main things I learned from this experience. First, it's incredibly important to be able to take breaks. The difference between spending two days trying to fix a non-existent glitch and realizing it's a feature you implemented could be as simple as a nap – it was for me. Secondly, your test and placeholder data is more significant than you might think: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in%2C_garbage_out" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">garbage in, garbage out</a> definitely applies here. If all your test data is the same, your tests are not good tests.</p> <h2 id="-wrap-up">## Wrap-up</h2> <p>To make the sorting more clear, I randomized the tasks' priority, name, and category (as seen above) and added an animation with <code>.animation(.easeIn(duration: 0.25))</code>. The current prototype looks something like this:</p> <p><video controls="" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/update-preview.webm"><a href="https://figbert.com/content/posts/pebkac-txtodo-rewrite/update-preview.webm">Animated, randomized tasks being checked off, deleted, and delayed.</a></video></p> <p>This has been a really fun blog post to write! A got a big laugh out of this bug chase, and I hope you've enjoyed reading it.</p> <p>Till next time, FIGBERT</p> </section></article></div>]]>

		<p>Audio brings games and projects to life! Web developers have it easy, they can publish their apps on the web and play audio using the browser API no problem. However, what about those of us that are command-line and graphics apps in other languages? Repl.it is a special place on the web where you can publish any app in any language, but so far it’s been missing audio capabilities because code executes in a container on the backend. This summer, for my internship I set out to solve this problem and make it possible to play audio in any repl in any language. In this post I’ll show you how to play audio in your repl and then I will chronicle the journey that got us here. </p>
<p><img src="https://repl.art/music-01.png" alt="music art"></p>
<h2 id="how-you-play-audio">How you play audio</h2>
<p>Before we get to the technical parts, let's talk about how you can use audio in your app or game.</p>
<p>As of this writing we support two libraries: Python and JavaScript. The Python library is built right in so you shouldn't need to install it. However, the JavaScript library you'll have to install and you can do that by simple importing (<code>@replit/audio</code>).</p>
<p>You can learn more on our <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/audio">docs for audio</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a quick demo before I tell how it all works:</p>


<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>It started out with an idea, I wanted to add audio to Repl.it because I wanted to use it and many users were asking for it, so it seemed like a good project to take on.  To be honest, I thought it was going to be a lot easier than it turned out to be. I thought I’d just throw in a Pulseaudio stream over TCP, play it in the browser, and be done with it. I was wrong. But who would’ve thought that real-time audio streaming from an isolated Docker container using fake audio devices without the use of an always-on daemon would be difficult? I sure didn’t.</p>
<p>At first, my goal was to get something simple that worked. My first attempt was to use a combination of portaudio and loopback devices native to the host machine but isolated to each container but that didn’t end up working because the infrastructure was far too complicated to be maintainable and we’d have to install C libraries for each language so they could play audio. Moving on.</p>
<p>My second attempt was to prototype something so I could see how I could build the client. I wanted to make sure that I had at least one part of the setup correct.  For this attempt, I just searched for files named “PlayMeAudio.wav (or .aiff)” which would be decoded and sent to the client in a buffer when the client opened the repl. Although this worked, it was only a prototype and we didn’t ship it.</p>
<p>For my third attempt, I figured I’d decode the audio and relay that to the client via a pipe file. Although this worked, it was using a ridiculous amount of CPU in Python and just simply not fast enough. I had concerns it might be an issue in other languages as well.</p>
<p>For my final and fourth attempt, I made a request based system. Instead of decoding the audio files in userland and putting a strain on resources, I’d have the user language tell me which files to play, and we’d do the heavy lifting in Go, which is the language that we write the container service in, which we call PID1.  Although the code was a mess, it worked and ended up being the first version of audio we released to explorers, despite its many shortcomings.</p>
<p>Although it worked, this attempt had three issues: 
All files had to be at a sample rate of <code>44,000</code> hertz
All files had to have a bit depth of <code>32</code>
Only <code>.aiff</code> and <code>.wav</code> files were supported.</p>
<p>The reason for the first issue was that I couldn't find a good polyphase filter (for sample rate conversion) and I needed a C library to cross compile. This proved to be challenging, as we needed to static link it and it had libm as a dependency, which means we’d have to static link all of libc -- more on that later.  I ended up having to dynamically build it. Including its source wasn't an option because it had very large generated files, so I had to build it before we built PID1, more on this later on.</p>
<p>For the second issue, I really didn’t have an excuse other than not really understanding bit depth, but once I did I was able to quickly fix it.</p>
<p>For the third one, it wasn't so much that those files were the only ones supported - it was more so that we didn’t support <code>.mp3</code> files- for this, I ended up needing to use C again. I used minimp3 library and its Go bindings.</p>
<p>I also had plans to include <code>.opus</code> file support, so I was going to need another C library… Well to clarify, I needed both opus and opusfile. Opusfile requires opus, which requires OpenSSL, so I had to build OpenSSL the build opus and opusfile, without root. Well needless to say, this was starting to get a bit ridiculous to do more than once. I made a <a href="https://github.com/repl-it-discord/audio/">github repo</a> which would serve as a repo to house all the C libraries we needed along with the Go bindings, and I included a file I found from a source that would let me static link libm without all of libc. </p>
<p>After all of this, we have the dependencies resolved, and everything sounds good - except for one thing: Changes in audio take <code>~.74</code> -  <code>~1.48</code> seconds to take effect. Why? Well we were sending audio in chunks, instead of streaming. Every <code>~.74</code> seconds, we prepare audio and send exactly <code>32,768</code> samples (<code>2^15</code>, no particular reason for this magic number other than the buffer rarely runs out and the latency isn't unbearable) but this wasn't enough.  </p>
<p>The client was designed to append audio samples at the end of what it had scheduled, so what I did was send audio initially and then immediately send it again, so we’d give the client  <code>65,536</code> samples at the start, and send an additional <code>32,768</code> samples every <code>~.74</code> seconds. Where did I get <code>.74</code> seconds from? As we are playing the audio at <code>44,100</code> hertz, we play <code>44,100</code> samples per second - so <code>32,768/44,100</code>. </p>
<p>This setup was great for smooth audio, but I felt that the latency makes your repl experience feel rather shoddy. I mean, imagine you’re playing a game, you open the chest and go through a door. Once you go through the door, the sound from the chests plays because you as a user have that <code>.74</code> - <code>1.48</code> second buffer, which just makes using audio for games useless for anything other than background music.</p>
<p>So we had to rewrite this and unfortunately to solve the timing issue we had to complicate the solution. We made the server send overlapping buffers of samples and the client used a timing system along with a sample index the server sent to calculate and compensate for latency and try to make it “real-time” streaming.</p>
<p>Now I know this is hard to understand, in fact I was told it was also hard to code review, so I’ll do my best to illustrate it. </p>
<p>Normally, this is how our makeshift stream would look:</p>
<pre><code>Message 1: 1 2 3 4 5
Message 2:         5 6 7 8 9 
Message 3:                 9 10 11 12 13
...</code></pre><p>This keeps us from audio cutting out due to (network) latency (to an extent), allowing us for smaller buffer sizes without as much (audio) latency</p>
<p>That alone isn't very special, what's really the star of the show is for the server to be able to send:</p>
<pre><code>Message 1: 1 2 3 4 5  
Message 2:   2 3 4 5 6
Message 3:           6 7 8 9 10</code></pre><p>The client is where the difficult processing for this takes place, when we receive new samples we immediately stop playing and start playing those samples… well… mostly. </p>
<p>You see, there's still the one thing that we can’t control. Networking.  Maybe there's a <code>.1</code> second delay for one of the messages, well now look - we’re playing audio we already played!</p>
<p>So now the client has to calculate LATENCY too, which is even MORE difficult. At this point, we’re on multiple devices, and we need less than a <code>1/44,100</code> second difference in time in order to figure this out! That seemed too hard. Instead, what I did was give each message in the protocol the sample index of the first sample, i.e. the first message would have sample index <code>0</code>.  The client then determines how many samples the player has played in total and if that's greater than the sample index it will compensate for that by skipping samples. </p>
<p>Now too get back to the request system I mentioned earlier -- how does one use that? As I mentioned, there’s two libraries above for Python and JavaScript, however this should work for any language, and you’re free to implement your own libraries.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-libraries-work">How do libraries work?</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, users can determine what is played via requests to a named pipe which PID1 reads.  I opted for a simple approach for encoding - json. While making libraries is fun and all, I can’t update libraries for many languages every time I change the requests, so I figured I’d make the request system pretty simple.</p>
<p>The user’s script must only write json data to <code>/tmp/audio</code> (a named pipe) and the go script will then parse the data and fulfill the request.  However, this might error - for example the file isn't found or has invalid encoding. Since we’re sending requests through a named pipe, we can't get errors very easily.
This means that the library the client uses must determine when there’s an issue with a source being created - the setup I made for the libraries which I used would wait up to a set amount of time then if the source wasn’t created in time it times out - while this isn’t always perfect, it's better than nothing.</p>
<p>A typical request to play a tone might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"Paused"</span>: <span>false</span>,
  <span>"Name"</span>: <span>"My tone"</span>,
  <span>"Type"</span>: <span>"tone"</span>,
  <span>"Volume"</span>: <span>1</span>,
  <span>"DoesLoop"</span>: <span>false</span>,
  <span>"LoopCount"</span>: <span>0</span>,
  <span>"Args"</span>: {
    <span>"Pitch"</span>: <span>400</span>,
    <span>"Seconds"</span>: <span>5</span>,
    <span>"Type"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"Path"</span>: <span>""</span>
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>A quick explanation of the above fields: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>Paused</code> - Whether the source is paused or not - this can only be set when updating the source.</li>
<li><code>Name</code> - the name of the source - this can be used to identify the source when it's being created - if it's not set the name will be set by pid1.</li>
<li><code>Type</code> - the type of the source, supported types when I wrote this are:<ul>
<li><code>wav</code> - A <code>.wav</code> file</li>
<li><code>aiff</code> - A <code>.aiff</code> file </li>
<li><code>mp3</code> - A <code>.mp3</code> file</li>
<li><code>tone</code> - A generated tone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Volume</code> - The volume of the source as a floating point number - <code>1</code> would be <code>100</code>%</li>
<li><code>DoesLoop</code> - Whether the source should loop or not …</li></ul></div></div>

Planning orchestrates the work of different project departments (software development, marketing, sales, etc.). Having a plan enables business decision-makers to stay focused on where they go and see the vector of product development clearly. Planning cannot work without estimating the time of execution for each of your tasks. Developing a habit of splitting your tasks into subtasks while defining the estimated time of execution for all of them is not easy. This sin can be common not only with Junior developers but more experienced professionals can also avoid estimates.</p><p id="2cc2">In this article, I’ll explain how we encourage our developers to estimate tasks using simple &amp; smart Jira configuration.</p><h2 id="5b9a"><strong>Where the problem originates from?</strong></h2><p id="e435">To quickly start a new project in JIRA, our PMs often use the default settings for workflow, fields, screens, etc. These settings are a good fit for a broad variety of projects, which is excellent! However, if you have a more specific task to complete, you’ll need to go deeper into configurations, like in our example. You will have to learn something new, too.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="The Default Workflow and the Advanced Workflow Configured in Jira for One of Mad Devs Projects." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3000/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png" width="1500" height="844" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*xZ3XrvuYRQ0muY--dmqAxw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The default workflow and the advanced workflow configured for one of our projects.</figcaption></figure><p id="0015">At the sprint planning stage, our PMs ask developers to fracture and estimate their tasks. This enables us not to overload the sprint and stay committed to what we can deliver on time. However, at times a developer may drill into an unestimated task which may let the entire team down. This person may be unaware of the full scope of work that he or she needs to do. This is the reason behind such actions.</p><blockquote><p id="ada6">The developer’s estimate is their personal commitment to complete the task on time.</p></blockquote><p id="38d3">The manager can surely control estimates manually by checking out every ticket, but this is not what we really want. We need to save time. A project manager can automate their routine tasks by picking the existing tool or even creating one from scratch. This principle is driving the entire IT industry forward.</p><p id="2a30">Now let’s have a look at the simple and elegant solution to the problem with the tasks estimating.</p><h2 id="728e"><strong>JIRA can do more than you think</strong></h2><p id="b59e">To solve the problem, I needed to make developers fill the <strong>Original Estimate</strong> field before they start working on a task (this is important). I’ve been working with JIRA for over a year now. Thanks to the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/university" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlassian University</a> courses I took, I came up with a solution fast.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>‍<strong>Here’s the one(ish)-sentence summary: </strong>we took a goofy idea with some crummy designs made in Google Slides and ended up contract manufacturing custom bobblehead trophies. We send these trophies to every team that subscribes to Water Cooler Trivia. <br></p><h2><strong>How it all began</strong><br></h2><p>In January 2019, our team met to talk goals for the upcoming year. We had laid the foundations for a product that brings work teams closer together and builds office culture, and we wanted to keep improving the product and bringing it to more teams.<br></p><p>One of our goals: <strong>Delight users through new customer-centric innovations. </strong>We’re a platform for customizable weekly trivia quizzes. The quizzes and results are sent via email or Slack. Naturally, most of our “customer-centric innovations” are software based, like redesigning our <a href="https://app.watercoolertrivia.com/demo/results">quiz results</a> or building a<a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/features-slack-app"> Slack app</a>.<br></p><p>However, with only a single-person engineering department, we couldn’t bite off much more than one big feature each quarter.&nbsp;So we started thinking about a customer-centric feature that didn’t require a single line of code: <strong>a Water Cooler Trivia bobblehead trophy.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f23668c73efdd4882767e82_IMG_0918.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Yes, those are the trophies posed in my kitchen.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From idea to design</strong></h2><p>Back in 2019, there was a little old institution known as the office. This is where coworkers would spend much of their waking week, working in non-socially-distant proximity.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This is also where teams would discuss the weekly Water Cooler Trivia results. The winner is celebrated in the results email each week, but that fleeting sense of accomplishment, well, fleets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We wanted to create a new way to celebrate the winner. Stealing the idea of a roaming championship totem like the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stanley+cup+filled+with+skittles&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS879US879&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01N4_N6R1iLOS5J_sNWKjo3ynVPPA:1596144974172&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTy8ex9_XqAhXKQc0KHdcjBx0Q_AUoAXoECA4QAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=749">Stanley Cup</a> or a WWE belt, we wanted to send a trophy to each team. <strong>The winner would proudly display the trophy on their desk for the duration of their reign</strong> -- typically one week but longer if they had back-to-back victories.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Rather than imitation-chrome over a faceless figurine like the soccer participation trophies of our past, we wanted <strong>a trophy that reflected the quirky, fun tone of Water Cooler Trivia</strong>. After all, the goal here is team-building fun, so the trophy might as well be fun.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f23602980e22bd77a756d05_Group%2050%20(2).png" alt=""></p><figcaption>There's enough of these faux-metallic-finished trophies in the world.</figcaption></figure><p>What’s more fun than a trophy? A bobblehead. What’s more fun than a faceless gold figurine? Our “blue brain” mascot.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f23609fc91bd60af1a7d087_collage%201.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>We love the brains.</figcaption></figure><p>I had a clear vision in my head of what these trophies would look like, but no design skills or manufacturing experience. <strong>My design toolkit? Google Slides.</strong> It’s free, super easy to share, and it has a crop button.<br></p><p>I searched for a few inspiration images: <strong>blue brains</strong>, <strong>water cooler renderings</strong>, and <strong>brain trophies</strong>. The results were pretty much exactly what you would expect.&nbsp;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f3f49ec631774ca9422_hl75CU-kzTBo4_7r8jgUb2N8qc0Qw5isQu2pzmqlcHxo3zsOE7ge9pZJZ8GPuOOSho4quQe03VPjzZU8NMiNZxjrByIc5GMmJqLP99lFup3xD7WJ1pyreymPrxgyUYH4isDsRLbO.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Design building blocks via Google Images.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, I played with a few iterations of what this trophy might look like by overlaying text blocks and smashing two images together. <strong>These looked bad.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f3fa79a46074dcddffa_Gu4Z_2uchCr5yiSgMknGu-nYorXoS3MiytTGaoHUpEoE1cnIwZhNa7fKO_beOtjIa6kVTBx4Fllbdp_SVW9YNRVpkx7HY9ve5UmbZzDd7qqbae7FjngA2yYyXaMGakAalD5ALlLA.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>First attempts at a trophy design.</figcaption></figure><p>So I iterated a few more times. I noodled with the concept of putting the brain in a water cooler (basically a 3D version of our boringly 2D logo).&nbsp;I toggled the transparency and saturation, hoping that I would magically stumble upon a not-totally-horrible-looking combination. <br></p><p><strong>It turned out fine.</strong><br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f245e1f6d93f82c6667f72d_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%2012.08.20%20PM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>My final Google Slides design of the trophy.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From design to manufacturing partner</strong></h2><p>Quick aside: a friend of a friend owns a business that sells Bitcoin socks. You read that right: socks, not stocks. Black foot-and-lower-leg coverings dotted with yellow BTC logos. I was amazed that the design, manufacturing, and shipping were all through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba">Alibaba</a>, the Chinese conglomerate often compared to Amazon. </p><p>Critically, he clued me in to the fact that Alibaba has a super-accessible RFP (request for proposal) feature.</p><p><strong>You enter a description, an image, a quantity, and a price point. Within hours you are flooded with offers from manufacturers. </strong>This was extremely convenient. <br></p><p><strong>Five vendors reached out within 48 hours</strong> in various mixes of Chinese and English. I wasn’t quite sure how to decide, so I went with the vendor that was most responsive to my questions and had the most robust English.</p><p>Our contract manufacturer? <a href="https://xfdbobble.en.alibaba.com/">Xiamen Xinfade Trade Co</a> with Jonas from their team as our touchpoint throughout the process.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f245fb1dd15c16aa68b3ffc_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%2012.15.02%20PM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Dog Custom bobblehead was the closest category.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From manufacturing partner to bobblehead trophies</strong></h2><p>The email back-and-forth with Jonas began in earnest when I sent my “designs” (Google Slides screenshots) in March 2019.<br></p><p>We discussed project timing, and in less than two weeks he sent pictures of the mold.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f4041f47b7113ec4f25_HT8B54ZCk_wm8pWpAzzq5DaBl9ViC-JS4Y2cCE9xGvXP1pPbvsDqLgjaZe4QREMBi2A_OxtqCVx9F4uLdG-HUe0MoA_CQapNoGtoTHAWrzMKJCatr-u1Y2SUpAM7BDLOa9Dp_XGr.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>The mold of the trophy from different angles.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, we'd agreed to 300 trophies for $3.50 each, but we hadn't signed a contract or paid a single cent. So when Jonas sent through the mold images I was floored: <strong>this was actually happening.</strong><br></p><p>The molds looked good enough that we locked in the deal with a signed and paid invoice.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By April 11, Jonas sent me painted versions of the molds so we could get a sense of the colors. He asked about box details, colors, stickers, size, and more fine tuning.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f3f680645a36ea7f2ec_P7_uon-XtgJW6KHv4xzCgkMbcCvyQNsq4XhoDOVf-xOd5E-LQ3V_B1-wLxrfB-mGO8lNkupe5fl1CFZr57yhkRLx82KDDNDWlJdD6jW0vkF5Fieny-8CSTC9sP665J_gUOYBfAdP.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Painted versions of the mold. Still just a sticker version of the logo.</figcaption></figure><p>We asked for a lighter resin to make the cooler more transparent. Jonas made it happen. By mid-May, Jonas sent the picture of hundreds of bobbleheads coming off the assembly line. <strong>We were ecstatic.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f41e63c203678cfd7f0_lhd5l-_H4iikMusOv844lY3tWLENxFn5CyPE6mh8nrARa2XutbHet_-H356eKmkpMx9dd-lOQ9dz75iKCIalsrH4LX0QZkHak0WPmJqF9_BoYL95F6R_rHNFuFw8TJ9Kiqi5i9SQ.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Fresh off the assembly line.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From China to Brooklyn</strong></h2><p>Turns out shipping across an ocean with a small quantity of low-cost items is… expensive.<br></p><p>Jonas asked who our freight-forwarder was.

I didn't know how long the boxes had been there (I’d been out of town for over a week), but I was sure it'd confused my neighbors.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f40a79a463e49cddffb_jYbXUPrTvTKK3a8IJHNei2HidUvHJYD_Z60f33c0gfdzwNaSWQ7sg8yyO1Y0pXsjpVbSzZDzJHZh4nir8Kx2NtFKH8wGiS8e9bo70otXHOihTjPcrxdxQyQPk1rpzglmSXwLCQFj.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Much of the atrium was taken up with trivia trophy boxes.</figcaption></figure><p>With the help of two roommates, we carried the boxes up to our apartment. <strong>We unboxed the trophies, excited to see the outcome of the quixotic quest.</strong> They looked great! The brain was on a spring-loaded cylinder so it did indeed bobble, the transparency on the cooler allowed for easy observation of the richly-colored blue brain. It worked out better than I could have expected.&nbsp;</p><p>Except... </p><p>When I bobbled the bobblehead for a second time, the cooler separated from its circular base, sliding right off, and thusly <strong>decapitating the trophy.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The glue that attached the open cooler cylinder to the circular cardboard base was shoddy. As bobbleheads, we fully expected them to receive regular rattling.</p><p>I hoped I’d pulled a bad apple out of the barrel, but <strong>quality control checks on the next five trophies confirmed the problem was widespread.</strong> It was simply a weak point in the construction.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f3f0544bd5651c0cbd0_C25G_MkoXsmSSgJagtb83H09Y1nECSOFa20tDsF49FGMSo4PgeGyRKj9TCt3A5W5jtooAoiRwpUK2369TgnCLTH_qo9fQpX2GxbZhoVjxC5eTFo0upGfua3XHAYPNUWsoc-29wAI.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Actually there were two weak points.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The glue did not hold the resin and the cardboard together nearly enough for a trophy meant to bobble.</strong> After confirming the worst, we acknowledged that it was going to take serious elbow grease and human power to get the trophies in customer-ready shape.<br></p><p>Before undertaking the crafty project, we fixed a handful and took them on a quick photoshoot around New York City.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f423227a4684e5a1aa4_mAPl9kF4d7Y-7A8c00uxYUVjSlReiPVk0u-bPp1KLFY7XHcnUlD0EWfq-KYey7NfXRQYFkaJQQAbCXWTMkaFCy34NBTVmuNTe-nHiYnB5ijfyPIcN3kV3XBC7OfITeuT7RPMsEIH.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>We call it the "poor man's photoshoot."</figcaption></figure><p>The process of precisely breaking 300 bobbleheads and re-gluing them in two different places with Gorilla Glue is not a quick one. Especially when you add in the time of unboxing and re-boxing each individual trophy. My partner, my roommate, even my sister visiting New York all generously chipped in their time. <strong>In total, we spent about 30 hours fixing up the trophies.</strong><br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f40be075e716de512c6_szmo0tDw4evHQO38Am7oYvL3LxscMU9jQJYxsR3iH0PSxUxdYFfxnqOB5OSRUfaUmG6jU3W2vjAYdFoV8VW6J6mHZd99b9nwEVcT0vduh7slhZWiSMcCImIFMWlr41Hn5WJ6SDab.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f413227a489155a1aa3_4UNLDXSbdfeSvaO1Mn39bH51Stoov0wdxX-Ct3cyE2klQfOo_4ZsGFy6fwrEE_Fwa-F1JtRSdFT_igsbtnI5DJMQDiaALP418hApTCDbAO0Lz5Lt0MCsZyyQCgEax98ASz-o0AXJ.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f40e762e79eb6d96dfe_iv7bHadxbLn_BnrWBepDqLbbEorOsEjSgBH4FPX2c1hmxpq4WtjK5GfKQ1gbcbnr4Eion6apmH4heWraFTJBqSFd9-O2xmT4jTC_tSE-jphn_I0KBG1_amel7hP9hoUUnuf_aMP8.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>The real MVP.</figcaption></figure><p>Not exactly scintillating work, but we didn’t want to make it to the finish line only to send our customers a knowingly-busted object.</p><h2><strong>Lessons learned?</strong></h2><p><strong>Customers seem to genuinely like and appreciate the trophies.</strong> It gives our whimsical, fun-loving brand a more physical presence for hundreds of teams around the world.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f41d45976e1588c8c02_P37-ZeibsPwed0EDZpx_tgN41PuVZmSTffCrehHhU1u_eDKlYKaYjpH5xaXYasWMCypFZO5lJ4D7EnD8q5VbzEXFOeMMMAgHbr0r_MamQY3_Hoc3oFTYfsb44qYMw9BJuT_jn_cp.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Happy customers after a weekly trivia win.</figcaption></figure><p>We’re a pragmatic team here at Water Cooler Trivia HQ.

<p>It is one of the most commonly used supplements frequently taken to address joint pain, but there might be more to this dietary supplement than first meets the eye.</p>
<p>Glucosamine was originally discovered during the 1960s in Italy by pharmacologist Professor Luigi Rovati. Glucosamine is one of the most commonly used dietary supplements and is typically taken to help with the joint pain and inflammation associated with aging.</p>
<p>Glucosamine is a polysaccharide that is found naturally in cartilaginous joint tissues, bones, skin, ligaments, and nails, and it is involved in protein and lipid synthesis. In the context of joints, synovial fluid contains glucosamine and occupies the space between joints, helping to reduce the friction of joint surfaces.</p>
<p>Despite it being frequently taken for arthritis, the evidence for its effectiveness is limited, although, there is data for it being anti-inflammatory, as suggested by the results of a randomized clinical trial in 2015 [1].</p>
<p>However, glucosamine supplementation seems to correlate with lower all-cause mortality and other mortality risks, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, respiratory and digestive diseases. A recent <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/6/829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analysis</a> published in the journal BMJ showed that glucosamine supplementation conveys around a 15% reduction of all-cause mortality [2]. This is a considerable amount when compared to other lifestyle interventions as well as other supplements. The data gathered is from a large number of people, and the trend of reduced mortality is unmistakable.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>This population-based prospective cohort study included 495 077 women and men (mean (SD) age, 56.6 (8.1) years) from the UK Biobank study. Participants were recruited from 2006 to 2010 and were followed up through 2018. We evaluated all-cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, respiratory and digestive disease. HRs and 95% CIs for all-cause and cause-specific mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for potential confounding variables.</p>
<p>Regular glucosamine supplementation was associated with lower mortality due to all causes, cancer, CVD, respiratory and digestive diseases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The exact reasons for this correlation with the reduction of various mortality risks is as yet unknown, but given the large patient group in this and in other analyses along with the popularity of this supplement, it is impossible to deny that there is a definite trend here.</p>
<p>We are not suggesting that you take this supplement, but given that it is cheap and freely available with an excellent safety profile, it may be worth your consideration and further research to evaluate if you wish to take it or not.</p>

Those of you who live and work in Slack know how big this is - I personally went from opening Slack practically <em>every day</em> from 2015 - 2020, to zero meaningful usage whatsoever.</p> <p>In its place, I am now active in a ton of Developer Discord channels. I feel like this is a <em>meaningful</em> shift this year, and based on responses, <a href="https://twitter.com/jkup/status/1260936175172419590?s=20">I'm</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/1Marc/status/1261960701666623488?s=20">not</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/stolinski/status/1260943494635352066?s=20">alone</a>.</p> <section> <h2 id="but-they-didnt-want-developers">But They Didn't Want Developers?</h2> <p>The obvious proximate cause of course, is that I am professionally and personally highly attuned to developer communities, and Slack has actively pushed away developer communities. <a href="https://twitter.com/harry_hedger/status/1261967137989513216?s=20">Quote Harry Hedger</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Slack lost <a href="https://www.reactiflux.com/">Reactiflux</a> bc they wanted $70k/month to support them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sure, I get that this was a deliberate decision. Storage costs money. But <em>how much</em> are we talking? Further, every company understands the logic of running "loss leaders" in order to seed stickiness and future growth. <strong>While literally every other company on Earth is throwing all sorts of free benefits to attract developers</strong>, Slack found developer communities growing like a weed on it, and flicked them away like so much dandruff. Stewart Butterfield is like the anti-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM-2OVNt-eQ">Ballmer</a>.</p> <p>I'm not here to argue that Slack lost developers because it didn't want developers. That's a tautology. I'm here to argue that <strong>this is a strategic fumble</strong> that opened up the field to whatever will eventually replace Slack for startups (Microsoft Teams' success is difficult to assess so I will ignore it here).</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="slack-losing-its-way">Slack Losing Its Way</h2> <p><strong>Developers are your canary in the coalmine</strong> for user experience - because they create the damn things!</p> <p>Slack's original appeal was that it had a much better user experience than prior work chat/email/collaboration tools including the now-dead HipChat and Campfire. Reams of VC pitch decks were made about the "Consumerization of the Workplace" thanks to Slack's approachable design (as <a href="https://medium.com/@awilkinson/slack-s-2-8-billion-dollar-secret-sauce-5c5ec7117908">MetaLab never fails to remind you</a>) and early touches like emoji reactions and bots. The theory was that we demand the UX polish that we see in our personal lives, in our professional lives as well.</p> <p>Fast forward to today: "I’ve been using Discord a ton lately. Slack for work and Discord for hobbies." That's from <a href="https://twitter.com/1Marc/status/1261960701666623488">Marc Grabanski</a>, who knows a thing or two about developer trends.</p> <p>I'll raise you another point: In 2016, Slack was originally backronym'ed into the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-did-slack-get-its-name-2016-9">Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge</a>.</p> <p>Fast forward to today and advice from the curiously high amount of "how to work from home" content you've undoubtedly been receiving is overwhelmingly <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/#2-communicate-asynchronously">Communicate Asynchronously</a> and <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1331-process-and-tools-how-to-collaborate-effectively-when-your-team-is-remote#but-are-there-tools-you-just-cant-live-without">Use Anything But Slack for Long Lived Knowledge</a>.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="the-game-is-changing">The Game is Changing</h2> <p>Meanwhile the UX bar has risen in the past 5 years:</p> <ul> <li>Slack makes you create a email and password anew every time you join a new Slack. Clicking a Discord invite immediately lands you in the channel as long as you're logged in.</li> <li>Slack walks you through the full onboarding experience every time you join a new Slack. I've joined probably 80 Slacks, I'm tired of the "👋 Hi, Slackbot here!" welcome messages on how to use Slack, or the downright <em>buggy</em> step through guide that prompts me to put in my profile picture even though Slack clearly figured out that I use the same damn picture every time and is already displaying it. Discord does exactly none of this.</li> <li>You need to repeat the whole email and signup song and dance when you move to your phone. Discord is cross-platform-first - sign in on desktop and you're also signed in on mobile.</li> <li>(Developer specific) The new WYSIWYG editor rolled out last year <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7nbn/slacks-new-rich-text-editor-shows-why-markdown-still-scares-people">made it annoying</a> for developers accustomed to What We Type Is What We Get Thank You Very Much. Not only does Discord not get in the way of your typing, it offers <strong>SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING</strong> if you add <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting">language identifiers</a> to your code fenced blocks!</li> </ul> <p>The past year or so in Office Productivity has been a free-for-all as other companies moved into Slack's open flanks. Notion has torn it up as the Searchable Knowledge Base to beat today. Zoom has overwhelmingly captured video chat, despite Slack also offering it natively. Even a bootstrapped startup like <a href="http://tuple.app/">Tuple</a> has become successful despite Slack buying the literal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/slack-buys-screenhero-to-add-screen-sharing-and-voice-chat-to-its-work-messaging-platform/">category maker</a> in the space. And of course Discord and even Telegram have made inroads in real time chat.</p> <p>My intuition is that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/">the Great Unbundling</a> has come for Slack. Whether or not it survives will probably depend on this: Is text chat really <a href="https://jtbd.info/feature-vs-product-42bf2dad2764">a feature or a product</a>? Either way, having to answer that question is an undesirable strategic position for Slack to be in. There is no victory in this fight.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: if you feel lost right about here, I released the <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/dev-guide-to-tech-strategy/">Developer's Guide to Tech Strategy</a> chapter of <a href="https://twitter.com/coding_career">my upcoming book</a> recently, feel free to pause and check it out.</p> </blockquote> </section> <section> <h2 id="not-over-yet">Not Over Yet</h2> <p>Slack has fumbled a ball, but it still has a strong lead. Two features still make Slack a strong fit for realtime workplace communication: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14305528/slack-threads-threaded-messages">threaded messages</a>, which Discord refuses to build, and <a href="https://slackhq.com/shared-channels-growth-innovation">Shared Channels</a>, which <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1096347638696267778?s=20">I've gone on record</a> as saying will add years' worth and billions of dollars of revenue. Both were introduced in 2017, probably the peak year of innovation for Slack before creating <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=slack+fund&amp;oq=slack+fund&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57l2j69i59l2j69i65l2j69i61j69i60.843j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">the Slack fund</a> in 2018 and then its 2019 IPO.</p> <p>From my limited anecdata, the no-code <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/24/slack-launches-workflow-builder-for-businesses-to-make-apps-without-code/">Workflow Builder</a> hasn't yet had significant adoption, but I would be happy to see this change over time. All great platforms eventually add low/no-code automation.</p> <p>Slack has also made heavy investments for Enterprise Adoption, with things like <a href="https://slackhq.com/introducing-slack-enterprise-grid">Enterprise Grid</a> (also in 2017! hmm...). I of course don't have any insight into Slack's growth in the Enterprise. I'm fully aware of the economic incentives of going upmarket and forsaking low end customers.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="communities-over-teams">Communities Over Teams</h2> <p>The net result of all this is that Slack is now very much not <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-design/a/stewart-butterfield/">the operating system for your team</a> that it set out to be. However its entire user experience is tied to teams.</p> <p>More specifically - having one single home team, interacting with that team on one device, and the assumption that you don't join or change teams very often. Perhaps this is the disconnect we are sensing.</p> <p> Slack's focus on teams may be becoming outdated in this new world we live in, where Deep Work and organized knowledge bases come at a premium, and our professional work crosses professional and personal boundaries, and spans across multiple devices, modalities and even multiple communities we both lead and participate in. Discord's focus on communities may win hearts and eventually wallets. Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/kurtkemple/status/1260947289436303367?s=20">Kurt Kemple on Discord's community features</a>, for thought: </p> <blockquote> <p>Discord is more community friendly IMO. Things like moderation, roles, boosting, group A/V, all make it a great place for a more democratized and scaleable platform.</p> </blockquote> <p>By focusing on communities instead of siloed teams, Discord becomes a friend of community leaders. In other words, <strong>Discord aggregates aggregators</strong>. In a world of <a href="https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation Theory</a>, this is a very good thing.</p> <p>I thought it was Paul Graham or Benedict Evans who said this, but am unable to find the source: "What hackers do for fun today, we will do at work tomorrow".</p> <p><strong>Hackers are deserting Slack in droves</strong>.

<div>
<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>In her 2001 book <em>Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke</em>, Professor Napier showed that many fans of
anime work in computer science and its related fields. The survey also happened to show that “over
70 percent had a grade point average of 3.0 or higher, which is especially impressive when one
considers the academic rigor of scientific fields.”</p>
<p>Anime has a pretty well-known reputation for creating <a href="https://youtu.be/755BDwzxv5c?t=3">men of culture</a>. That’s a clear
indication that anime fans can be profoundly affected by the medium. In addition, many prolific
open source contributors have anime characters as their profile picture. So that got me to thinking,
does being a fan of anime also make you a more intelligent person?</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laynH/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books/master/C%2B%2B/Sakura_Nene_CPP.jpg" alt="sakura nene cpp"></p>
<p>Of course, a question like that is nearly impossible to answer directly. After all, there’s
countless ways to measure intelligence, and anime fandom is so broad that no one definition can fit
all cases. For example, should we consider someone who has only watched <em>Spirited Away</em>, and liked
it very much, but has no exposure to other forms of anime, to be an anime fan? What about people who
only read manga? Or those who exclusively watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leader_(web_series)">whatever this is supposed to be</a>?</p>
<p>A smaller question that’s easily answerable would be to see if having an anime profile picture
correlates with you being a better programmer. After all, if someone takes the effort to set their
profile picture to a waifu, they clearly have some fondness for anime. As for being a “better
programmer,” we’ll just equate being better with having more activity on GitHub. And being good at
programming does require an amount of critical reasoning at logic skill, which should equate to a
higher intelligence. Of course, this metric could be easily abused by having a <code>cron</code> job making a
ton of commits, but it’s a measure of programming activity that should be Good Enough™.</p>
<p>Luckily, Google provides their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">image labelling API</a> for very cheap (or free, if you
have GCP credit). As an example, putting in an image of best girl Mai Sakurajima from <em>Rascal Does
Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai</em> into the demo provided, I’ll get this list of labels back from it:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/mai_google_vision.png" alt="mai"></p>
<p>Notice how one of the labels is “Anime”? That’s a surprise tool that will help us later :) Google
also provides a Python API, which makes it even easier to check images, since all you have to do now
is check if “Anime” is one of the tags:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>anime_or_not</span><span>(</span><span>image</span><span>):</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>label_detection</span><span>(</span><span>image</span><span>=</span><span>image</span><span>)</span>
    <span>labels</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>label_annotations</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>labels</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>item</span><span>.</span><span>description</span> <span>==</span> <span>"Anime"</span><span>:</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As for GitHub commits, we can use the <a href="https://docs.github.com/v3/activity/event_types/">events API</a> that’s roughly analogous to the
contribution history graph of a user. We’ll be measuring user activity just by the number of events
for each user, so each event (opening a PR, creating a repo, etc.) is given equal weight. That’s
roughly analogous to how green a user’s contribution heatmap is.</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/github_contribution_graph.png" alt="contribution map"></p>
<p><a href="https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyGitHub</a> wraps the GitHub API into an easy to use library, so getting the number of
events for a user, as well as their profile picture’s URL, is pretty simple:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>g</span><span>.</span><span>get_users</span><span>()</span>

<span>for</span> <span>user</span> <span>in</span> <span>users</span><span>:</span>
    <span>event_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>event</span> <span>in</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>get_events</span><span>():</span>
        <span>event_count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>

    <span>is_anime_image</span> <span>=</span> <span>check_if_weeb</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>avatar_url</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>GitHub does rate limit the API to 5000 requests per hour for authenticated users. That’s enough to
run about 2000 requests per hour. To get around that, we can take advantage of how GitHub profile
IDs are numbered sequentially and process profiles in batches of 1000:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>github_id</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1200000</span><span>,</span> <span>1201000</span><span>):</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>g</span><span>.</span><span>get_user</span><span>(</span><span>github_id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
        <span>continue</span>

    <span># do user stuff here
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>I’ve modified the <code>get_user</code> function here to use the undocumented <code>/user/:id</code> endpoint. This hasn’t
been implemented in PyGitHub yet, but <a href="https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/1615">this issue</a> seems to be tracking it.</p>
<p>All that’s left is to link these APIs up and save the data. It’s trivial to just loop through all
users using the <code>/users</code> GitHub API endpoint, send their image over to the Google Vision API, note
down whether they had an anime profile picture and the number of events for that user, and finally
log it into a CSV for analysis later. That’s exactly what I did, and you can see my code
<a href="https://github.com/h313/anime-face">here</a>. It’s very research quality, so don’t expect much.</p>
<p>So now I’ve got a table of 3497 GitHub profiles, of which only 23 have anime profile pictures.
Here’s a box plot that displays the distribution of user activity by profile picture type:</p>
<p><img src="https://h313.info/blog/assets/img/github_boxplot.png" alt="box plot"></p>
<p>Hmm, the users with an anime profile picture do seem to have a higher average number of
activities. But we can’t stop here. Keep in mind that there’s way more samples of users without
anime profile pictures compared to those with, as well as the comparatively high amount of
outliers in both groups. To be sure that the difference here is statistically significant,
we’ll need to do a T-test:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>scipy.stats</span> <span>import</span> <span>ttest_ind</span>

<span>cat1</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>[</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'is_anime_face'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>True</span><span>]</span>
<span>cat2</span> <span>=</span> <span>df</span><span>[</span><span>df</span><span>[</span><span>'is_anime_face'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>False</span><span>]</span>

<span>ttest_ind</span><span>(</span><span>cat1</span><span>[</span><span>'contribs'</span><span>],</span> <span>cat2</span><span>[</span><span>'contribs'</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That provides a p-value of <code>0.2371</code>. We now have to conclude that the higher average we got isn’t
statistically significant, since our p-value of 23.7% doesn’t meet the traditional 5% cutoff.
Therefore, we must once again acquiesce to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines">Betteridge’s law</a>, and adopt our null
hypothesis, that having an anime profile picture does not necessarily correlate with your abilities
as a programmer.</p>
<p>Further work into this topic can be done, however. Since this project only looked at a small
number of users, who were among the first to register, it is not a representative slice of the
GitHub user population. In addition, it may also be enlightening to include the inactive users
skipped in this experiment.</p>

<p>Wirth’s law is not really a law. Actually, none of them ever are laws. They are adages:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>a proverb or short statement expressing a general truth.</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/adage">https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/adage</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Here is another law that is not a real law:&nbsp;<em>Moore’s law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years.</em></p>



<p>This means that we can expect the speed and capability of computers to increase while lowering the costs. Sadly, this is where Wirth’s law comes in:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Wirth’s law is an adage on computer performance which states that software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster.</em></p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>And while Moore’s law has proven to be true since 1975, Wirth’s law seems to be true as well. Niklaus Wirth, the designer of Pascal, wrote an article in 1995:</p>



<blockquote><p>About 25 years ago, an interactive text editor could be designed with as little as 8,000 bytes of storage. (Modern program editors request 100 times that much!) An operating system had to manage with 8,000 bytes, and a compiler had to fit into 32 Kbytes, whereas their modern descendants require megabytes. Has all this inflated software become any faster? On the contrary. Were it not for a thousand times faster hardware, modern software would be utterly unusable.</p><cite>Niklaus Wirth – A Plea for Lean Software</cite></blockquote>



<p>The problem of modern software development is manyfold. Wirth points out one crucial aspect: time.</p>



<blockquote><p>Time pressure is probably the foremost reason behind the emergence of bulky software.</p><cite>Niklaus Wirth – A Plea for Lean Software</cite></blockquote>



<p>And while that was true back in 1995, that is no longer the most important factor. We now have to deal with a much bigger problem: abstraction. Developers never built things from scratch, and that has never been a problem, but now they have also become lazy.</p>



<p>It was Edsger W. Dijkstra who tried to improve the quality of code and coined the concept of <em>structured programming</em>. He tried to get programming out of the state of crisis it was in, and he found support in programmers like Harlan D. Mills, Richard C. Linger and Bernard I. Witt. For a short period of time, programming was seen as a real craftmanship. Programmers cared about the quality of their programs, and that included clarity and efficiency.</p>



<p>Those times have passed. With the introduction of higher-level languages such as Java, Ruby, PHP and Javascript all in 1995, the same year in which Wirth wrote his article, programming became more abstract. </p>



<p>Languages like these made programming a lot easier and took many things out of the programmer’s hands. They were object-oriented and came with things as an IDE and garbage collection.</p>



<p>This meant that programmers had fewer things to worry about, which is of course great. Sadly, everything comes with a price. Having fewer things to worry about, also means having fewer things to think about. 1995 was the year in which programmers stopped thinking about the quality of their programs.</p>



<p>It also marked the beginning of the widespread use of libraries, probably one of the bigger problems. Don’t get me wrong, I love libraries. They are the only reason I am able to get things done. However, a library never comes with the exact things that you need.</p>



<p>Because a library is not made for one specific project, it probably has a bit more functionalities than you really needed. No problem, you would say. However, things pile up pretty quickly. Even the people who like libraries, don’t want to reinvent the wheel. This results in what we call dependency hell. <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/04/09/ride-down-the-javascript-dependency-hell.html">Nikola Duza wrote a post about that issue in Javascript</a>.</p>



<p>The problem does not seem that big, but try to grasp what is happening here. In another tutorial that Nikola wrote, he built a simple todo-list. It works in your browser with HTML and Javascript. How many dependencies did he use? <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2020/05/14/javascript-growing-pains-from-0-to-13000-dependencies.html">13,000.</a></p>



<p>These numbers are insane, but this problem will only keep increasing. As new, very useful libraries keep being built, the number of dependencies per project will keep growing as well.</p>



<p>That means that the problem Niklaus was warning us about in 1995, only gets bigger over time. </p>



<p>And no, you don’t have to learn assembly and start writing your web application in that. A good way to start would be to split up libraries. Instead of creating one big library that does everything you could ever possibly need, just create many libraries. Your god-like library could still exist, but solely as a wrapper. </p>



<p>This way a programmer only has to select the libraries he really requires, while ignoring the functionalities he is not going to use in his application. Not only are his dependencies smaller, but they will also use less of their dependencies because the dependencies of the unused functionalities do not have to be installed.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Note: </strong>The proposed solution obviously is not <em>the</em> solution. It would for example require a good way of versioning software to avoid a new dependency hell.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><span>A Tale of Two Charts</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows the monthly average <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin">price of bitcoin</a> since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1238" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-26/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png" data-orig-size="782,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-26" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=782" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png 782w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-26.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px"></figure>



<p>This second chart shows the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=bitcoin">Google Trends Score</a> by month for the search term “bitcoin”, also since October 2013.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1239" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-27/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-27" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-27.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>When I first saw the second chart, I thought it looked remarkably similar to the first. Sure enough, it does. Below are the two charts together. The darker line shows the price according to the left-side axis and the lighter line shows the Google Trends Score according to the right-side axis.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1240" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-28/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png" data-orig-size="783,306" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-28" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-28.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>It turns out that bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score are quite correlated.</p>



<p>Specifically, they have had a 72% positive correlation since October 2013. This compares favorably to bitcoin’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-correlation-with-gold-is-weakening-says-new-kraken-report">26% correlation with the stock market and 24% correlation with gold</a> over the last year.</p>



<p>I should note that the correlation between bitcoin’s price and its Google Trends Score was much stronger up until both price and score peaked in December 2017 (98%) than it has been since (59%).</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the purpose of this analysis is not to argue about the level of correlation nor to assert causation one way or another (though it seems logical that the price and popularity feed off of each other). Rather, the purpose of this analysis is to make a speculative projection regarding what bitcoin’s price could be if and when its popularity (as measured by its Google Trends Score) returns to and surpasses its previous all-time high.</p>



<p>In order to make this projection, we first must consider the historical ratio between bitcoin’s average price and its Google Trends Score on a monthly basis. Let us refer to this as the <em><strong>price:score ratio</strong></em><strong> </strong>for short.</p>



<p><strong><span>Bitcoin’s Price:Score Ratio</span></strong></p>



<p>The chart below shows how bitcoin’s price:score ratio has increased over the last several years.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1241" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-29/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png" data-orig-size="783,307" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-29" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-29.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>For a ratio that has been relatively volatile historically, it has remained unusually consistent for the last two months (June &amp; July) at 729, just 4% short of its all-time high of 758 in November 2019.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s price:score ratio has been above 645 for 9 of the last 12 months after having only reached such a level once before, and barely (646 in October 2018).</p>



<p>The 3 months in the last year during which the ratio was lower than 645 can be fairly easily explained. They took place this past March, April, and May as hype grew in anticipation of bitcoin’s once every four years halving event on May 11, 2020. Additionally, people perhaps were searching more than usual for information about alternative assets (including bitcoin) when the stock market crashed ~30% in the early days of the lockdown resulting from the pandemic. Those two factors together seem sufficient to explain the uptick in bitcoin’s Google Trends Score over that period. On the other side of the price:score ratio, bitcoin’s price fell along with the market, and so with the price going down and the score going up, the decreased price:score ratio over those few months makes sense.</p>



<p>Since the stock market substantially recovered and the halving event came and went without materially moving bitcoin’s price, the Google Trends Score has returned to the pre-pandemic, pre-halving-hype range. For the last two months (June &amp; July), bitcoin’s monthly Google Trends Score has stayed steady at 13, which is equal to its average from April 2018 (after the peak) through February 2020 (before the halving hype and market crash).</p>



<p>For some additional context, it should be noted that bitcoin’s Google Trends Score has only been equal to or greater than 21 in 7 months since bitcoin’s inception and they all took place consecutively surrounding bitcoin’s last major surge from September 2017 through March 2018 (with scores chronologically of 21, 22, 44, 100, 55, 39, and 23).</p>



<p><strong><span>Flying Under The Radar</span></strong></p>



<p>Sufficed to say, bitcoin’s average score of 13 since the last surge, excluding the three aforementioned months from earlier this year (14 if we include them), shows objectively that bitcoin is flying under the radar (in terms of its popularity as a search term at least). Of course, it may not seem this way to people who follow crypto closely and daily but the algorithmic and mass-data collecting Google Trends Score should be trusted over any single person’s speculative and subjective observation about the current level of hype and attention.</p>



<p>If you, like me, believe that bitcoin is and has been flying under the radar for more than two years now, the natural question to ask is this. What do we expect to happen when that is no longer the case? In other words, what happens to bitcoin’s price if and when it reaches the pinnacle of its next hype cycle? How high might bitcoin fly the next time we see a situation similar to that of December 2017?</p>



<p><strong><span>Projecting Bitcoin’s Price</span></strong></p>



<p>I believe a reasonable response to this question can be made by applying bitcoin’s average price:score ratio over the last twelve months (643) to a Google Trends Score of 100 to estimate what bitcoin’s price would be if the price:score ratio stays about constant and bitcoin’s popularity in terms of search returns to its all-time high. The price implied by this projection is about $65,000 as is demonstrated by the maximum value in the top right corner of the chart below. Basically, if one believes that bitcoin will at least at some point return to the level of popularity it attained in December 2017, this methodology would lead that person to expect bitcoin to attain a price of at least $60,000 at that time.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1242" data-permalink="https://blogofjake.com/image-30/" data-orig-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png" data-orig-size="783,308" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-30" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=783" src="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=783" alt="" srcset="https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png 783w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=150 150w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=300 300w, https://theblogofjake.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/image-30.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px"></figure>



<p>This estimate can be made less conservative in two ways. The first is to assume that the price:score ratio will continue to increase as it has all along (6% month-over-month), rather than calculating the price using the LTM average of the ratio. The second is to assume that bitcoin’s popularity as a search term will well surpass its previous all-time high set in December 2017 just as that all-time was more than twice as great as any high before it and more than 8 times greater than the all-time high before May 2017 (which was set in December 2013, perhaps not coincidentally exactly 4 years or one halving period prior to the latest all-time high). I hesitate to call either of these two less conservative assumptions aggressive because they are not only reasonable but actually probable if one is to simply assume that the historical trends will continue in terms of the score and the ratio.</p>



<p>As such, I will close by presenting a chart which one can use to approximate the price implied by their own inputs for the Google Trends Score and the price:score ratio. In this chart, I show the ratio for the last 12 months, 2 years, 3 years, and so on, and use the average year-over-year growth rate between those figures (16%) to project the next twelve months (“NTM”), next two years (“N2Y”), and next three years (“N3Y”) ratios.</p>



<p>The highest price projected on the chart is right around $300,000 based on a Google Trends Score of 3 times the previous all-time high (300) and a projected N3Y price:score ratio of 996 (the LTM average of 643 increased 16% 3 times for 3 years). Of course, this maximum price projection is limited only arbitrarily by the maximums I have decided to present on this chart for both the score and the ratio.</p>

<p><strong><span>To Be Continued…</span></strong></p>



<p>Many people have employed many methodologies in attempting to accurately project bitcoin’s price. For example, <a href="https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD">PlanB</a>‘s stock to flow ratio looks at scarcity to make one of the more convincing price projections I’ve seen. My price:score ratio looks at popularity in endeavoring to do the same. This analysis was not intended to be totally comprehensive. My intention was merely to introduce this methodology for others to critique. As such, my hope is that this becomes widely enough read so that I may receive ample critical feedback for further consideration and refinement of the methodology.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what motivates software developers. If
you believe that <a href="https://thenewkingmakers.com/">Developers are the new
Kingmakers</a>, then this is an important subject!</p>
<p>It's certainly true that developers can be opinionated, but I’m not sure I
agree with statements like the following;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[a developer] typically just wants to use the best
tool for the job”<sup>1</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout my career I’ve seen it over and over that developers want to
reinvent the wheel instead of talking to another team, or using a pre-existing
solution. Sometimes it seems like the primary goal of developers is to find
excuses to write a lot of code. There are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boondoggle">so</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">many</a>
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/">examples</a> of developers picking things that let them
muck around with code, instead of making the best choice for the business.</p>
<p>Code, rather than results has this mythical status in the industry. Candidates
for highly-paid developer jobs, like the one I used to hold, are tested on
their coding ability first, and other skills second. These skills, like
communication, and listening are often derisively referred to as soft skills.
I've seen interview debriefs where interviewers act like being able to code
trumps all other skills.  The reality is that those "soft" skills are the most
important skills, and they only get more important as you progress in your
career. The technical leaders that I admire the most, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOYdKht1YwE">James
Hamilton</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc6X3sj6q8">Heidi
Howard</a> are great communicators
above all. Those are the people who change industries, and upend the
<a href="https://fortune.com/2015/10/21/hp-public-cloud/">status</a>
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2013/10/29/ibm-capitulates-amazon-gains-cia-contract/#60d44d204bbf">quo</a>.</p>
<p>So why is it code and coding that holds this mythical status? Why are all the
hopeful university and bootcamp graduates studying <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Coding
Interview</a> in the hopes of landing
a six-figure salary at a tech company?</p>
<p>Two things finally made it click for me. Firstly, I listened to a podcast
about achieving <a href="https://anchor.fm/curiousclimberpodcast/episodes/Cameron-Norsworthy---The-Path-to-Flow-eboqkc">flow state, and how it applies to
climbing</a>.
Secondly, I finally watched the 1995 cult-classic Hackers. In that movie, the
main character Dade is basically addicted to his computer. He stays up all
night, much to his mother’s distress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the
zone, is the mental state in which a person performing an activity is fully
immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in
the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by the complete
absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of
time. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Hacking movie collage" src="https://blog.drgriffin.com.au/hacking-collage-v2.jpeg">
A selection of scenes involving coding, or 'hacking', from War Games, Hackers,
The Matrix , Swordfish , The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, and Halt and Catch
Fire.</p>
<p>People like me love to deride ‘hacking’ scenes in hollywood movies as being
unrealistic.  But after watching Hackers I realised... I have behaved like
Dade, many times; and not just recently during this
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6344-time-is-an-illusion-lunchtime-doubly-so">pandemic</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Me playing my GameBoy" src="https://blog.drgriffin.com.au/gameboy.jpeg">
That's me engrossed in a GameBoy sometime in the 90s.</p>
<p>When I think about it, that search for flow has had a huge impact on my life
and career. It was while I had some spare time<sup>2</sup> as a ski-bum that I
did Zed Shaw's <a href="https://shop.learncodethehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard
Way</a>.  That, along with my Electrical
Engineering degree is what lead me down the path towards Amazon, and Seattle.
You could argue that I spent two (Australian) summers as a ski-bum, and learned
a new programming language in search of that flow state.  Some other examples
of things I've done over the years perhaps in search of flow are sailing,
hiking, climbing, and weightlifting. In that context, those hollywood scenes of
caffeinated hackers staying up all night don't seem so far off the mark.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about a stereotypical software developer, what were they
like as a child? Did they love LEGO? Did they play computer games? Did they
read lots of books? Are they into comic books? Did they excel at math? The list
goes on.</p>
<p><img alt="My first lego set?" src="https://blog.drgriffin.com.au/bob-lego-and-me.jpeg">
How many engineers began their journey with a set of LEGO?</p>
<p>It turns out that the people who defined and researched flow, like Mihaly
Csikszentmihályi, and Jeanne Nakamura outlined some specific conditions that
need to be met to achieve the flow state, again from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Wikipedia</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and
   progress.  This adds direction and structure to the task. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback. This helps the
   person negotiate any changing demands and allows them to adjust their
   performance to maintain the flow state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One must have a good balance between the perceived challenges of the task
   at hand and their own perceived skills. One must have confidence in one's
   ability to complete the task at hand.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These principles have been used pretty heavily by games, and the techniques of
game designers are now common in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">everyday
life</a>, sometimes with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/06/its-no-accident-that-facebook-is-so-addictive/">questionable
outcomes</a>.
But bringing it back to developers, many things you can see in the software
industry look like attempts to find flow.</p>
<p>Firstly, a clear set of goals and progress?  Hello <em>tasks</em>. From Agile,
to Scrum, to Kanban, most software development methodologies are built around
the <em>task</em>.  <em>Tasks</em> are created precisely to set goals and measure progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, feedback. One of the key things that attracted me to software, over
the other branches of electrical engineering was the immediate, almost
addictive feedback loops you can get while coding.</p>
<p>And thirdly, endless ink has been spilled over the years about aligning
challenges with skills. Every discussion you’ve ever seen about organizational
structure has some element of trying to align the challenges of the
organization with the skills of it's people. All the work I've done around
mentoring and growth, from when I was a 14 year old Patrol Leader in Scouts, to
Amazon, was about finding the right level of challenge for people.</p>
<h2>Maybe they weren't crazy after all</h2>
<p>So now when I think back to my first job, the way I ended up owning a bespoke
"distributed lock service" built on top of NFS<sup>3</sup> makes much more
sense to me. It makes sense why my predecessor chose to build this instead of
using some simpler, or off-the-shelf solution. When Csikszentmihályi describes
flow state as the “optimal experience”, he's giving us a clue. People probably
aren’t optimizing for making money, or increased feature velocity, or more
reliable software, or better customer experiences, and your employees are
especially not optimizing for shareholder value. People are optimizing for
their <em>own</em> happiness, which often involves finding ways to reach a flow state.
Of course, often we pop out of that state to align our work with the customer,
with making money, or other external factors. Just like whales, we must come up
for air. But people certainly enjoy it more when they get to spend as much time
as possible approaching flow.</p>
<p>Hopefully by now you’re convinced that the flow state, or optimal experience is
a real thing, and that many developers are searching for this state through
coding. Being in a state of flow has the potential to make people both happier,
and more productive. If you’re an employer, it can be a win-win.</p>


<p>But I'm not (currently) an employer. Although I am building some things aimed
at developers.</p>
<h2>Can we design for flow?</h2>
<p>I think the answer is yes. A slightly bolder claim would be that developers
only truly <em>love</em> products that help them reach a state of flow.</p>
<p>There are two extremes from which developers will critizise most products. Some
lucky products manage to get both criticisms at the same time.</p>
<p>The first is if the product is incomplete, too low-level, or difficult to use.
This often results in large amounts of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:yak_shaving">yak
shaving</a> to get anything
useful done. You can't get into a flow state if you're staring into the
abyss of errors, or constantly having to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>. Here are some examples of things
that fit into this category, from my personal experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuration languages like CloudFormation, or TerraForm.</li>
<li>Compiling from source (think Linux WiFi and graphics drivers<sup>4</sup>).</li>
<li>Deciding which of the 200+ AWS services are right for my use case.</li>
<li>Programming in assembly (Motorola HC11) at university many years ago.</li>
<li>A certain internal Amazon <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">tool</a>, that I can't
  name for fear of breaking my NDA (and also causing PTSD in current and former
  Amazon engineers reading this).</li>
</ul>
<p>The other extreme from which developers will critizise products is being too
high-level, restrictive, or not having enough options. You can't get into that
flow state if you don't get to engage your brain! As an example, the Wikipedia
page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework#Rationale">software
frameworks</a> has
some hilarious "<em>[citation needed]</em>" back-and-forth about the pros-and cons of
frameworks. The interesting thing is that <em>both sides</em> of this debate want to
write lots of code and be productive. They're just looking at it differently.
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY">OG framework demo</a> was all
about how quickly you could start writing code. Meanwhile opponents of
frameworks say that they spend more time learning how to use the framework than
coding. </p>
<p>Another area where I wonder if the products are too high-level, or restrictive
is the so-called <em>NoCode</em> space.  There are a bevy of well-funded startups,
like AirTable, ReTool, and Webflow that claim to eliminate the need for coding
to build websites. The thing is, I have tried a couple of them, and the UIs
aren't as intuitive as you might hope. I also can't imagine myself achieving a
state of flow with them. I've spent many, many hours in my life writing things
like this blog post, or programming in Java and Python. To me, graphical UIs
don't get you that feeling of <em>building</em> that you get from typing at a command
line, or even typing up a document.</p>
<p>I can imagine people reaching a flow state if they're really proficient users
of, say, Photoshop. But I'm not sure that these NoCode tools encourage the high
level of mastery that a professional photographer, or editor might have. As
such, while they're interesting tools, I struggle to see them catching on in a
way that justifies the kind of valuations that VCs are looking for.  But it's
still early in this space, the jury is still out.  Maybe I'll …</p></div></div>

    <p>My colleague
<a href="https://twitter.com/jyasskin/status/1288308864786419713">Jeffrey Yasskin</a>
asked an interesting question on Twitter:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://emilymstark.com/assets/jyasskin_pake_tweet.png" alt="Tweet asking why we advise developers to use password hashing functions instead of PAKEs to check the password without sending it">
  <figcaption><i></i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Jeffrey is referring to Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocols.
PAKEs allow two parties to negotiate a cryptographic key based on a password,
which might be known by one or both of the parties. When people talk about using
PAKEs in the web setting, however, they usually aren’t directly interested in
negotiating a cryptographic key. Instead, they’re interested in using a PAKE to
authenticate a user, and they’re specifically interested in PAKEs because some
PAKEs allow a client to prove to a server that the client knows the correct
password without revealing the password to the server. In contrast, when using
traditional password-based authentication, the client sends the password to the
server, and the server compares it with a value stored in its database
(hopefully hashed with a strong password hashing function).</p>

<p>Not sending the password to a server is appealing for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The server can’t leak the password if it never sees the password. In
traditional password-based authentication, we partially mitigate this risk by
hashing the password when it’s stored in a database, so that a database breach
won’t leak the password. Some developers worry about leaking passwords before
they reach the database – for example, passwords might get accidentally
written to frontend log files that get leaked – and using a PAKE could
mitigate this risk.</li>
  <li>A malicious server can’t steal the password if it never sees the password.
However, this goal is irrelevant to Jeffrey’s question about web apps
implementing PAKEs. The web server provides the JavaScript code that
implements the PAKE, so a malicious server could just steal the password
directly on the client. (However, it is interesting to think about how the
browser itself might intervene to stop malicious servers from obtaining the
password; see <a href="#browser-mediated-pakes">Browser-mediated PAKEs</a> below.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If web apps were to use PAKEs, the security gain would be via the first
property: the server can’t leak the password. My position is that PAKEs provide
a very marginal security gain in the web app setting (funnily enough, many years
ago I was to <a href="https://twitter.com/estark37/status/1288319710744834049">blame</a>
for exorcising one of the few PAKE implementations on the web), but to argue
that position coherently, I first need to discuss why web developers care about
leaking passwords in the first place.</p>



<p>I’m not talking about <em>how</em> we hash passwords – e.g., which password hashing
function to use, how many rounds, etc. I’m talking about a much more basic
question: why do we bother hashing passwords rather than just sticking them in
the database like other data? (Sidenote: I think this would make a great warm-up
interview question for a security engineer… of course now that I’m blogging
about, I won’t be able to use it.)</p>

<p>At first glance, it might seem obvious that websites hash passwords so that a
database breach doesn’t yield long-term access to all the site’s users’
accounts. But, if an attacker gains read access to a website’s database, the
attacker can likely leak session cookies or other bearer tokens as well as all
the other sensitive user data that the website handles. The main reason we hash
passwords is to mitigate users’ tendency to reuse passwords across different
services (in other words, to protect against
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing">credential stuffing attacks</a>
in which a leaked password at one service is reused at another). If a website’s
database gets breached, it is a catastrophic security incident for that website
regardless of whether the attacker leaks plaintext passwords or other data. But
if the attacker leaks plaintext passwords, the breach is also a catastrophic
security incident for other websites. The value of hashing passwords is to
prevent a security incident at one service from spreading laterally across huge
swaths of the web.</p>



<p>That’s why my answer to Jeffrey’s question was that, in the web setting, PAKEs
don’t buy you much that client-side password hashing doesn’t also buy you (and
client-side password hashing is much simpler). Both protect against credential
stuffing attacks in the event of any server data leak, which, as I argued above,
is the main threat that password protections aim to mitigate. A PAKE is stronger
in that it prevents a server data leak from yielding long-term access to users’
accounts. In contrast, leaked client-side-hashed passwords do give the attacker
access to users’ accounts on that service, because the hashed password
effectively is the password. But I just don’t find that very compelling in light
of all the other interesting data (session cookies, sensitive user data, etc.)
that an attacker would be able to access with a server data leak.</p>

<p>This is not to say that I recommend client-side password hashing – just that
any web developer considering implementing a PAKE should take a close look at
their threat model and consider if client-side hashing is a much simpler way to
get what they want. Personally I’d recommend that web developers focus their
cycles on moving users towards stronger auth in the form of
<a href="https://webauthn.io/">WebAuthn</a>, rather than investing in either a PAKE or
client-side password hashing.</p>



<p>Reasonable people can disagree on the answer to Jeffrey’s question, and another
reasonable answer might be “historical accident.” PAKEs were patent-encumbered
for some period of time, and some had <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/should-you-use-srp/">less than ideal security
properties</a>.
Furthermore, until the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">WebCrypto</a> API
came along and offered native implementations of cryptographic algorithms to
JavaScript, implementing a PAKE would have involved hand-rolling cryptographic
primitives in a slow language that isn’t particularly well-suited to it. So it
could be that the advice to use a strong password hashing function took root in
the web developer community and wasn’t easy to overturn once
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/163.pdf">stronger PAKEs</a> and native crypto
implementations came along.</p>



<p>PAKEs don’t provide protection against malicious servers in the web setting,
because a malicious server could serve evil JavaScript that reads the plaintext
password off the page as the user is typing it. This problem invites an
alternative design to implementing a PAKE in JavaScript. What if the PAKE was
implemented in the browser itself and exposed via JavaScript API, with
trustworthy browser UI collecting the password from the user so that malicious
JavaScript can’t steal it?</p>

<p>At first glance, a browser-mediated PAKE appears to be a powerful anti-phishing
tool as well as a protection against server data leaks. But there are some
problems with this idea:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It poses a usable security and ecosystem challenge. The vast majority of
websites would have to migrate to the browser-mediated PAKE in order for users
to get out of the habit of typing passwords directly into webpages. Otherwise,
users wouldn’t notice anything amiss as they type their password directly into
a phishing webpage, even if the victim website used the browser-mediated PAKE.
Even if all websites magically migrated away from plaintext passwords to a
browser-mediated PAKE, a phishing website could likely convincingly spoof the
browser password entry UI to trick the user into typing the password into the
page, where it is accessible to JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Historically, browser-mediated authentication hasn’t seen widespread adoption
on the consumer web. Browser developers tend to view
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic Auth</a>
as legacy cruft that we’re stuck with due to entrenchment in enterprises. The
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Credential_Management_API">Credential Management API</a>
was a more recent attempt, and not many websites use it. I’m not sure why this
is<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, but one hypothesis is that web developers don’t like to have the
browser mediate user authentication and prefer to integrate it into the look
and feel of their website. <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID">WebID</a> is a
brand-new attempt aimed at moving federated login into the browser to prevent
cross-site tracking, so it will be interesting to see if and how that gains
adoption.</li>
  <li>If we could solve these usable security challenges, particularly the challenge
of training users to not type passwords directly into webpages, then browsers
could defend against phishing with much simpler means, e.g. by getting users
to log in to websites exclusively using a password manager that refuses to
fill credentials on the wrong sites. The marginal value of adopting PAKEs then
reduces to the same question I discussed above: is the complexity of a PAKE
worth the benefits in the event of a server data leak when you consider all
the other sensitive data that could be leaked?</li>
</ul>

<p>One final approach I’ll mention: TLS includes
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-barnes-tls-pake-04">PAKE ciphersuites</a>.
One could imagine browsers using this feature as a way of implementing a
browser-mediated PAKE. I think this is unlikely to achieve widespread adoption
in browsers and web servers, or solve any of the security problems I’ve
discussed. It suffers from all the usability and adoption challenges I just
mentioned, plus it’s implemented at the wrong layer for web applications:
TLS-terminating frontends don’t typically know about application authentication
state. Similarly, TLS client certificates aren’t widely used outside of
enterprises (though client certs suffer from other problems that further inhibit
their adoption). I think TLS PAKE ciphersuites are probably designed for
non-browser use cases.</p>

<p>Overall, one can construct various theories as to why web apps don’t implement
PAKEs, but my personal theory is that the marginal security gain is just not
worth the effort and complexity, and I predict that we won’t see widespread PAKE
adoption on the web.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes I would get some interesting questions from my friends about internet security, such as whether it is possible to leak the bank account password when logging to the online bank via an untrusted network, whether it is possible that the message you received from someone via an untrusted network got modified maliciously, and whether it is possible that someone pretends to be you and send messages in your name. My answers to those questions are as long as your computer and cell phone are uncontaminated they are almost impossible thanks to our modern public-key crytosystems and digital signatures.</p>



<p>There are a couple of introductions to the public-key crystosystems and digital signature available online. However, I think most of them are incomplete or hard to understand. In this blog post, I am going to describe the public-key crystosystems and digital signatures using extremely simple math, so that there would be no ambiguity at all.</p>

<h3 id="usages">Usages</h3>

<p>The modern cryptosystems are public-key encryption systems in which everyone has a public-key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public-key is seen by everyone, but the private is only accessible by the owner. The public-key encryption systems could also generate digital signatures which could be used to verify whether the message you received is unmodified and truly sent from the sender.</p>



<p>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a typical algorithm for the public-key cryptosystems used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. However, we are not going to introduce the RSA algorithm in this blog post. Instead, we would describe the public-key cryptosystems and digital signatures at a high level.</p>

<h3 id="essential-features">Essential Features</h3>

<p>Each user has their own encryption and decryption functions, $E$ and $D$, using public-key and private key respectively. We use $M$ to represent the message to be encrypted and sent. There are four features that are essential to a public-key cryptosystem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decrypting an encrypted message gives you the original message (Of course!). Specifically,</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>Encrypting a decrypted message gives you the original message (Hmm…). Specifically,</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>$E$ and $D$ are easy to compute. This means the encryption and decryption process should be fast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$. This means you could hardly find a way to decrypt the encrypted message, even if you know how to encrypt the message.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We would ignore how to satisfy the four features in this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="message-encryption-and-decryption">Message Encryption and Decryption</h3>

<p>Suppose we have two people, Alice and Bob. Both of them are using the same public-key cryptosystems. This means Alice and Bob both have their private keys stored secretly and have their public key published to some authorities. From the authorities, we could find the public keys of Alice and Bob unambiguously. We denote encrypting the message using Alice and Bob’s public keys to be $E_A$ and $E_B$ respectively, and decrypting the message using Alice and Bob’s private keys to be $D_A$ and $D_B$ respectively.</p>



<p>One day, Alice wanted to send a private message $M$ to Bob. Alice found the public key of Bob, encrypted the message $M$ using Bob’s public key. The encrypted message for Bob is denoted as $C$.</p>



<p>Once Bob received the encrypted message $C$, he could decrypt $C$ using his private key.</p>



<p>Even if the network was compromised and someone intercepted $C$, it is still almost impossible to decrypt $C$ because of that $D_B$ is unknown and the feature “the publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$” for public-key cryptosystems.</p>



<p>The message content is safe because of the public-key encryption systems. However, it does not provide any assurance about the sender. For example, James could send Bob a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, encrypt it using $E_B$, and send it to Bob. If there is no author verification procedure and Bob is not careful enough, Bob might actually think the message is sent from Alice. In some other scenarios, James might have intercepted the encrypted message $C$ sent out from Alice to Bob, prevented the message transmission to Bob, replaced the original message to $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, encrypt it using $E_B$, and send it to Bob. Bob might also be convinced that the message content $M^\prime$ was actually the original message Alice has sent. Specifically,</p>



<p>Digital signatures, derived from the public-key cryptosystems, are designed to solve these authentication problems.</p>

<h3 id="digital-signatures">Digital Signatures</h3>

<p>In addition to the encrypted message $C$ that Alice sent to Bob, Alice would also have to send her digital signature $S$ to Bob. Namely,</p>



<p>Alice could find $E_B$ using Bob’s public key and $D_A$ using her private key.</p>



<p>Once Bob received both $S$ and $C$, he could decrypt both $S$ and $C$ using his private key and Alice’s public key. Specially,</p>



<p>We found actually the two decrypted messages from $S$ and $C$ are exactly the same. This is expected if the message was sent from Alice and the content of the message was not modified. Let’s further see what will happen if someone pretends to be Alice to send a message to Bob, or the content of the message has been modified.</p>



<p>James, again, wanted to send Bob a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, or had intercepted an encrypted message $C$ from Alice, blocked it and created a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice. To make the message readable by Bob, James encrypted $M^\prime$ using $E_B$, send the encrypted message $C^\prime$ to Bob.</p>



<p>Because Bob does not accept any message without a signature, James had to make up a signature. However, because James knew nothing about Alice’s private key, he used a decryption function $D_J$ which is different from Alice’s secrete $D_A$. The signature James generated would be</p>



<p>Once Bob received both $S^\prime$ and $C^\prime$, he could decrypt both $S$ and $C$ using his private key and Alice’s public key as usual. Specially,</p>



<p>In this case, Bob would see the two decrypted messages are not the same. Bob would then realize that there is something unusual happened and he should not trust anything about the message.</p>

<h3 id="hacking-the-public-key-cryptosystems">Hacking the Public-Key Cryptosystems</h3>

<p>As long as the four features of the public-key cryptosystems hold, cracking it is almost impossible. If somedayy, when the almighty quantum computer is available, the feature “the publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$” would be compromised, therefore the modern public-key cryptosystems would no longer be reliable. I may talk about this topic in the future.</p>



<p>There is another way to send fake messages to Bob in name of Alice, without using a quantum computer. If James could somehow crack the account name and password of Alice on the web application, replace the Alice’s public encryption function from $E_A$ to $E_J$, when Bob tried to retrieve Alice’s encryption function, he would get $E_J$ instead of $E_A$. The decryption of signature $S^\prime$ would become $M^\prime$ instead of $M^{\prime\prime}$ then. Concretely,</p>



<p>In this case the two decrypted messages match. Bob would be convinced that the message is from Alice and it has not been modified.</p>



<p>It should be noted that James was replacing Alice’s public encryption function from $E_A$ to $E_J$, instead of replacing his private decryption function from $D_J$ to $D_A$. In principle, $D_A$ would only be kept on Alice local computer and not anywhere else. Even if James has Alice’s account name and password on the web application, he would not get a copy of $D_A$ unless he specifically hacked Alice’s physical computer.</p>



<p>This reminds us that actually keeping our password safe is the most important.</p>

  <div><p>A lot of people write about chess as having an opening game, a middle game and an endgame. When you're playing is that what's going through your head?</p></div>

  <div><p>Everyone has an opening repertoire. Many people just have one answer for each question they might reasonably expect their opponents to ask, which means they get very good at playing those answers, but equally become very predictable. There are some openings that are razor sharp and precise, and require knowing many 15-20 move variations in order to not get destroyed without the game even starting. I personally prefer openings that are more conceptual, which tend to be slightly more flexible, require much less knowledge, but arguably lead to somewhat more boring positions because of this.</p></div><div><p>So when the middlegame comes around, it's probably the kind of position I've played many times before. My strategy is usually to throw lots of pieces at their king and hope they die or I can win some material. Since I'm hoping to win at this point, I probably don't start thinking explicitly about the endgame until little suggestions of things that might become relevant start cropping up. So if pawns become isolated or doubled, or we end up with opposite colored bishops, or with a bishop on the same color square as most of our pawns, etc. If I can take one of these small positional advantages then I will, and then effectively "bank" it until the endgame actually comes around. Having one or more of these might make me more likely to head towards an endgame too.</p></div><div><p>Endgames are really hard and require a lot of technique that I don't really have. Fortunately most other people don't either, because you just don't get to play that many of them.</p></div><div><p>It probably is fair to say that I'm pretty aware of the opening/middlegame/endgame distinction. The opening is where I'm playing pretty much from memory, the middlegame is where I try and win, and the endgame is what I might head towards if I think I have a tangible advantage but try and avoid otherwise.</p></div>

  <div><p>So when you say that the endgame is what you might head towards - is the endgame not just the 'end of the game'? In which case won't most games have one? I know in the extremely amateur world of chess that I play in that most games come to a end where one side is actively checkmated. Is the endgame more unusual the higher up you go because a party will often resign when one side is in a dominant position?</p></div>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>I guess this is a question for statistics to answer properly, but my gut says that there possibly are fewer endgames in higher level play. If you lose a bishop or a knight without any obvious compensation, you will almost definitely resign on the spot. That said, it's probably also true that fewer boneheaded mistakes mean that neither side may have had much of a chance to win before the endgame. Overall I'm not sure!</p></div><div><p>But when I say "might head towards the endgame", I mean that I might deliberately choose to swap off pieces and accelerate progress towards the end of the game. If I'm a pawn up then trading off pieces is likely a huge win for me, because whilst a queen + 2 rooks + 1 bishop + 2 knights + 7 pawns v the same but 6 pawns is not a huge advantage, a bishop + 5 pawns v a bishop + 4 pawns probably is. Small material advantages are a much bigger deal in the endgame and leave less room for your opponent to generate compensation, so if you are slightly ahead then deliberately swapping off pieces is very important. Games can naturally meander towards an endgame where neither side is too psyched about their chances, or they can be forced.</p></div>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>Honestly I like openings that allow you to put your pieces on nice squares without thinking too hard, and then throw them all at your opponent's king. This is not a very sophisticated strategy, but it can be very hard to deal with if you aren't prepared (this is a good example). If you can get off the beaten track without doing anything too insane then you become much more familiar with the kinds of positions that result than your opponents, and develop a big box of patterns that have worked in the past.</p></div><div><p>This becomes somewhat less effective the higher level and more famous you get, as you start to become notorious for particular openings, and opponents can start preparing counters to them. This is where a degree of flexibility and unpredictability becomes invaluable, so that your opponents can't just put all their time into preparing for your Stonewall Dutch or Trompowsky, and also have to keep in mind that you might throw in a Benko Gambit or English Opening. It can be worthwhile playing these alternatives in high profile tournaments that will get their games into databases that your future opponents will see and get confused and upset by.</p></div>

  <div><p>1) Knights on the edge of the board don't attack many squares, knights in the centre of the board do. Because of their uniquely short range, they are the one piece that really benefits from being in the centre. A rook or bishop in the corner can still rake across the entire board, but a knight in the same spot looks pretty dumb.</p></div><div><p>2) If you want to attack the king (I do), you need to have your pieces attacking him and the squares around him! Even if you aren't planning on immediately checkmating anytime soon, you may be able to use threats against him to force smaller concessions or weaknesses.</p></div><div><p>3) An open file is one that isn't blocked by any of your pawns or pieces, and so if you put a rook at one end of it you'll be probing into some part of their position (hopefully a weak part!). This is the most direct way for your rooks to influence the game. As mentioned above, you don't necessarily need to be destroying or capturing anything in order for your pieces to be making your opponents' life awkward, so principles like "rooks on open files" will almost always be good things to at least look out for.</p></div>

<p>The term asynchronous means “not occurring at the same time” and in the context of distributed systems and messaging it implies that the processing of a request occurs at an arbitrary point in time. There are many advantages of asynchronous interactions over synchronous ones but also new challenges introduced by it. In this post, we will focus on a few specific considerations for choosing a suitable asynchronous messaging infrastructure for implementing <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/event-driven/" target="_blank">event-driven</a> systems. Let’s see a few of the subtle differences between asynchronous interaction styles.<br></p><h2>Message Business Value</h2><p>Not all messages are created equal. Some are valid and valuable only for a short period of time and obsolete later. Some are valuable until they are consumed regardless of the time passed. And some messages are valid and useful for repeated consumption. Considering the validity and the value of messages relative to time and consumption rate, we can qualify interaction styles between services into the following categories:</p><div><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p9AE1uCT-lY/XyQrM2kw2LI/AAAAAAAAOi8/9VSsF63jc_0u3NSab9nn5nYwCtS4fce_QCLcBGAsYHQ/s2576/business_value.png"><img alt="Message types by business value" height="136" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p9AE1uCT-lY/XyQrM2kw2LI/AAAAAAAAOi8/9VSsF63jc_0u3NSab9nn5nYwCtS4fce_QCLcBGAsYHQ/d/business_value.png" title="Message types by business value" width="400"></a><br><i>Message types by business value</i></p><h4>Volatile</h4><p>These are ephemeral messages where the value is time-bound. Valuable now, but not in the short future. There is no point in storing events that are useless in the future and using messaging systems with such characteristics gives the best performance with the lowest latency possible as the disk is skipped. In such a scenario, the system is aware of the connected consumers and the event disseminated to all consumers online at the time of publication. If a consumer is disconnected, the messaging system forgets about these consumers. What is important in such a system is the ability to handle a large number of dynamic clients with low latency interaction needs such as IoT devices.</p><h4>Durable</h4><p>However, in some situations you want the messaging system to be aware of the consumers and store the messages while the consumer is not available. That is a traditional message broker which will hold on to the messages for the consumers that he knows about and allow the consumers to re-connect and consume the events that were produced in his absence. Once an event is consumed by all the interested parties, it will discard the messages. Here the broker knows about registered consumers and messages are stored durably until read by all registered consumers. Here the goal is to do reliable messaging among services with strong ordering and delivery guarantees.</p><h4>Replayable</h4><p>Here, the messaging system is not aware of the consumers that are interested in the event. It simply stores the events published to a stream for some time or until capacity is reached. Then a consumer can come along at any time, connect and consume the events and perhaps replay the stream from the beginning. Consumers can move back and forth in the stream as required and replay the messages repeatedly. Here, the driving force is extreme scalability combined with the ability to replay messages for existing or new consumers.</p><h2>Message Semantics</h2><p>Apart from the technical characteristics of the messages, it is important to distinguish the language we use, the semantic aspects, and the intent of the interactions. Some messages are targeted for a specific consumer and demand concrete actions. Some are querying the latest state of a system without requiring a state change. And some notify the world about a change that has happened in the source system. From a messaging semantic perspective, there are the following types of messages:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RMxJzN21Bbk/XyQrihOt9FI/AAAAAAAAOjE/3jg_mU4oqN0WB1G8OOqQ43FC2JNmt5yMACLcBGAsYHQ/s2568/Screenshot%2B2020-07-28%2Bat%2B07.39.01.png"><img alt="Message types by semantics" height="135" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RMxJzN21Bbk/XyQrihOt9FI/AAAAAAAAOjE/3jg_mU4oqN0WB1G8OOqQ43FC2JNmt5yMACLcBGAsYHQ/d/Screenshot%2B2020-07-28%2Bat%2B07.39.01.png" title="Message types by semantics" width="400"></a><i><br></i></p></div><p><i>Message types by semantics</i></p><div><h4>Command</h4><p>A command is a request for action that usually leads to a state change on a known target system. Typically there is a response indicating that action was completed and even there might be a result associated with it. When a response is expected, commands are typically implemented over synchronous protocols such as HTTP, but it is possible to implement request/response or fire and forget style commands over asynchronous messaging systems. With a command based asynchronous messages, there is some coupling between the source and the target systems in the form of command semantics.</p><h4>Query</h4><p>A query is like a command, but it is a read-only interaction that does not lead to a state change. By its very nature, a query expects a response, and it is common to see synchronous implementations here. But asynchronous and non-blocking implementations over messaging systems and even fire and forget style interactions for long-running operations where a response is written to a different location are common too.</p><h4>Event</h4><p>An event is a notification that something has changed. A system sends event notifications to notify other systems for a change in its domain. An event is different from a command in that often the event emitting system doesn’t expect an answer at all. In addition to being asynchronous, event messages are not targeted to a specific recipient and thus, they enable even further decoupling. Similar to other asynchronous interactions, events are implemented as messages on queues, which are often called streams. Martin Fowler covers in-depth the different types of events in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0" target="_blank">this</a> talk.</p><h2>Summary</h2></div><div><p>One approach you can take is to follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank">Law of the Instrument</a> approach defined by Maslow as “If the only tool you have is a hammer, treat everything as if it were a nail." You could certainly use a classic message broker such as Apache ActiveMQ to implement the different interaction styles. It would be a familiar technology to many and easier to start with, but hard to implement some use cases such as replayable messaging. Or you could take the other extreme and try to use Apache Kafka for everything. It would require a larger amount of hardware resources and human effort to manage it, but it would cover the replayable messaging and extreme scalability needs. While both of the above approaches are fine to start with, when you have a large number of services with different messaging needs, using the right tool for the right job is a better option. We can map the above-described messaging patterns to see what messaging infrastructure is best suited for each.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MTuOiuBjh48/XyQr8TVfwuI/AAAAAAAAOjQ/JwY1yhgOkGY8l-upOVl2vqR9kvYdXh9tQCLcBGAsYHQ/s2768/Screenshot%2B2020-07-28%2Bat%2B07.39.17.png"><img alt="Mapping messaging subtleties to different messaging infrastructures" height="135" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MTuOiuBjh48/XyQr8TVfwuI/AAAAAAAAOjQ/JwY1yhgOkGY8l-upOVl2vqR9kvYdXh9tQCLcBGAsYHQ/d/Screenshot%2B2020-07-28%2Bat%2B07.39.17.png" title="Mapping messaging subtleties to different messaging infrastructures" width="400"></a><br><i>Mapping messaging subtleties to different messaging infrastructures</i></p><p>We at Red Hat love any open source technology.

      <p>This is going to be a practical overview of how I reduced the compilation time and binary sizes of Release Mode (-O3 or /Ox) C++ software. The goal of this will be to review some of the things that help with the goal, and some of the things that C++ as a language is fundamentally incapable of producing satisfactory answers to. Let’s<!--more--> dig in!</p>



<p>We were able to save some things for a project with 2.5K class bindings:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Version</td>
      <td>sol2</td>
      <td>sol3 (patron-only alpha)</td>
      <td>sol3 (now)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Build Time</td>
      <td>2 hours, 3 minutes</td>
      <td>2 hours, 11 minutes</td>
      <td>1 hour, 53 minutes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Binary Size</td>
      <td>119.0 MB</td>
      <td>138.0 MB</td>
      <td>103.0 MB</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>I added 3 new core template types that all abstractions get milled through. I also committed some of the sins below in improving the functionality and streamlining the code. To be honest, I’m actually surprised it only cost me 7 more minutes over sol2! But, let’s talk about the things I did in order to get to where we are now, and what I needed to identify as problem points…</p>



<p>This was a combination of intuition and empirical evidence. I had suspicions about what increased my compile time, but I did not want to go off on a wild hunt trying to figure out what was going on. Much as Templight and other tracers exist (and are <a href="http://aras-p.info/blog/2019/01/16/time-trace-timeline-flame-chart-profiler-for-Clang/">currently being worked on</a>) I kept my assumptions in the back of my mind but checked them by asking a few companies and individual users of sol2 to send me their largest object files VIA Discord and other means:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2019-01-19/biggest-you-have.png" alt="Mmmn, girthy."></p>

<p>In doing so, I could confirm my suspicions by seeing what was serialized into the object file. Note that while this does not perfectly translate to the final code (especially in release builds), it is a good proxy for (1) link times, due to having to resolve all of the (possibly non-unique) definitions from a single object file with all the others in the project; and (2) compile times, because the compiler has to vomit all of this stuff into these object files to begin with.</p>

<p>One of the object files I studied was 14 megabytes big from a Visual Studio 2017 Release build. the fun started when I expanded the <code>.7z</code> file:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2019-01-19/file-sizes.png" alt="Goodness...!"></p>

<p>Mama mia that’s a spicy 16.4x file size increase!</p>

<p>This is a screaming red flag that we have a LOT of redundancy (because it compresses so obscenely well under default settings). Duplicate symbols are rife in any TU that heavily uses templates, and sol3 <em>is</em> a template-heavy, header-only library. But, this probably doesn’t explain the absolute ballooning in size when going from the packed 7zip I was sent to the big thing in the actual binary.</p>

<p>To help me dig in, I <a href="https://twitter.com/chieltbest">relied on someone else</a> who did all the hard work for benchmarking what were the more expensive operations one could perform in relation to templates. I also use this brilliant person’s Rule of Chiel:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2019-01-19/rule-of-chiel.png" alt="The Rule of Chiel"></p>

<p>Armed with this knowledge and a bunch of object files, I set off to find the worst offenders in my code. I targeted what was either SFINAE + types, or SFINAE + function templates, since those were my typical things that destroyed my code. sol2 uses a lot of struct specialization SFINAE, which is probably the most damaging to compile-times right now. Coupled with some very gnarly function template SFINAE and other things, I figured that this and other things were probably the root of the cause.</p>

<p>Just where I found that bloat – asides from the obvious places where I used exactly those techniques – was even more of a surprise…</p>



<p>Lambdas are ultra convenient and – in some cases – even more powerful than structs you declare locally (for example, you can’t template function-local structs but you can do it with a lambda and <code>auto</code>/Concept function argument types!) But, I needed to tear them down in several places where I had capturing lambdas inside of templated code. I only did this in a handful of places – 6 or 7 total in the whole library, up from 1 or 2 in sol2 – and it did a fair amount of to save me the mental overhead when programming. They’re just Immediately Invoked Function Expressions, right? How costly can they be?</p>

<p>It turns out capturing Lambdas – even entirely local ones – don’t optimize out cleanly in terms of <em>code size</em> for C++ and a lot of it gets dumped into the object file and the resulting executable. I used <code>dumpbin</code> to get me all the symbols in a text file (an 11 megabyte text file) and then proceeded to just goof around and scroll through it. Some things there was nothing I could do about, like all the string spam for my Compile-Time Type Strings work I was doing. But, for this 1 object file where only 1 class was being bound using an alpha of sol3, I ran a count for the times <code>lambda</code> showed up:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2019-01-19/lambda-count.png" alt="Goodness Gracious..."></p>

<p>Sheesh… a few more pointed searches for certain identifiers with the lambda revealed that most of those belonged to my detail namespaces and inner workings. Remember, this is just for binding one class! All this symbol spam from the template-capturing lambdas revealed one thing, though: <em>each lambda, when inlined, results in a fat slab of code that is different per-instantiation</em> (I mean, duh, that’s the point of a template, right?). The compiler marks all of this code inline and dumps it into the resulting function instantiation, which is expected. The problem is that capturing all the variables in a templated function means that any time you have enough variable initializations and function declarations that depend on said templates, it is impossible for the optimizer to combine these bits of code together, even if its fundamentally the same code for all invocations!</p>

<p>The solution here was to roll up my sleeves and get out the dough, because it was time for…!</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/pexels/baked-baking-chef.jpg" alt="Only the best ingredients for your code base."></p>

</p>


<p>Since the 1990s, like your mothers and their mother’s mothers, and your fathers and their father’s fathers, I took to the oven to bake only the freshest lambda to trump them all, taking advantage of the fact that all of the routines were identical and that I could use some of Grandma’s <code>void*</code> and Great Aunt Mary’s function pointers. To top that off, Lua is a runtime ingredient so all the compile-time shenanigans weren’t exactly necessary at the point of my lambda. I lowered down my <code>if constexpr</code> spices into regular <code>if</code> statement herbs, powered by runtime booleans initialized with constant expressions. The result was a creamy yet spicy French struct with so many delicious members. Ultimately a reduction but the culinary blend saved me quite a bit of symbol spam in the object file and lambda-based template spew by quite a bit, making for some <em>chef kiss</em> nice improvements:</p>

<p>Food silliness aside, this helped a lot. To recap the point in a more clear way, though, here are some snippets illustrating the various degrees of (non-)trouble you can get yourself into.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>func</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>auto</span> <span>iife</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]()</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>/* work */</span>
	<span>};</span>
	<span>iife</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Also good:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>arg</span><span>,</span> <span>my_class</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>foo</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>auto</span> <span>iife</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>]()</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>/* work */</span>
	<span>};</span>
	<span>iife</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, but be careful…:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>T</span> <span>arg</span><span>,</span> <span>my_class</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>foo</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>auto</span> <span>iife</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>]()</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>/* work */</span>
	<span>};</span>
	<span>iife</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Worse:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>typename</span><span>...</span> <span>Args</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>void</span> <span>func</span> <span>(</span> <span>my_class</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>Args</span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span>...</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>auto</span> <span>iife</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>]()</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>/* work */</span>
	<span>};</span>
	<span>iife</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Screaming in the distance:</em></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>Binding</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>binding</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>typename</span><span>...</span> <span>Args</span><span>&gt;</span>
	<span>void</span> <span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>my_class</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>Args</span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span>...</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>auto</span> <span>iife</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>]()</span> <span>{</span>
			<span>/* work */</span>
		<span>};</span>
		<span>iife</span><span>();</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, this is easy to see in these examples. But when working with complex template functions, it’s very easy to just make a fully-capturing lambda that gets you all the local variables and arguments you need with very little fuss. Just be careful if it’s a common use point in your API, and especially if there is a forwarding capture reference and you are expected to have string literals come into your API. String literals are actually the worst offenders for the bloat, because <code>"set"</code> is not the same type as <code>"super_set"</code> (they’re both different-sized C-style arrays).</p>

<p>Having a (imaginary) <code>std::c_string_view</code> or some <code>std::string_literal</code> <code>constexpr</code> type be the default here might help that out but I doubt the C++ Committee will ever bite on a <code>std::string_literal</code>-by-default type anytime soon. (After all, backwards compatibility etc. etc. – someone is bound to be broken if we change the fundamental type of <code>"blah"</code> in C++!) But, what may happen is a <code>std::string_literal</code> type that can <em>only</em> be created magically by the compiler. This will give us some interesting information to work with (read-only, string is interned, etc.), and from there we could probably at least fix some of C++’s strange warts, even if we still get <code>const char[N]</code> and <code>const char*</code> from template deduction and <code>auto</code>-deduction.</p>

<p>The point being, if you expect <code>my_template_f("blah")</code> to be a thing your users write, be careful!</p>



<p>Is anyone really surprised this shows up?</p>

<p>Parsing stuff in C++ is its own particularly special nightmare. I provided a <code>sol_forward.hpp</code> to ease on this parsing adventure. But I didn’t really put enough stuff in there. So I added some more forward declarations in there for sol3, and now the single header generates a proper <code>sol/sol.hpp</code> and a <code>sol/forward.hpp</code> for users to include. The result was pretty good gains:</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2019-01-19/forward-declarations.png" alt="forward.hpp bringing huge benefits."></p>

<p>Forward declarations are good. Honestly, we should probably be providing very small Modules for the standard library, and also be providing incredibly fine-tuned headers too. <code>&lt;functional&gt;</code> alone is absolutely enormous, and it would be nice if we just had <code>&lt;functional_fwd&gt;</code> when we really don’t need the whole thing. I have some ideas in this space, but it’s going to take some time before I can let it manifest. (I have a lot to do over the next 3 years…!)</p>



<p>Tag dispatching – while a good technique – results in the compiler having to pick between overloads, even if its only 2. The worst part about any overload set is that the compiler cannot short circuit what it finds: it needs to walk over all of the possible function entities in an overload set before selecting the right one.</p>

<p>My tag dispatching code was …</p></section></div>

<p>For the past month or two, my brother, a friend of ours, and I have been working on creating a new board game. All three of us are extremely into board games and have always wanted to create one. It’s been really fun, but definitely not easy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When making a board game, there are a ton of edge cases and variables you have to consider. You have to run tests, fix issues and iterate on things that may need some improvement. This entire process made me realize that making a board game is a lot like writing software. It’s so similar in fact, that I believe creating a board game should be an activity done in schools to teach younger (and older) students the benefits of planning, thinking about edge cases, extensibility, iteration and probably more that isn’t popping into my head right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first step in board game creation was thinking of an idea and refining it into a general set of rules. This is very similar to software where once you think of an idea, you have to define a set of features and acceptance criteria. There are many things that we originally wanted to include but felt didn’t offer enough benefit, maybe even added confusion, so we left them out. We also had to think about whether the board game was fun at each step of the process, similar to thinking about if your software is adding value.</p>



<p>Once we had our general idea, we started thinking about edge cases. What happens if a player does this, what happens if they do that. In software you have to do the same thing. The difference is that in software (at least nowadays) you usually have the opportunity to go back and fix some of the edge cases after releasing it. With the board game, our goal is to fund it and release it. Once you release a board game, you can’t just patch it whenever you like. Any edge cases you may have missed are now there for people to run into (or exploit).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ok, so you finished writing your software… I mean… finished creating your first board game prototype. Now what? Well you have to test it. There’s no such thing as automated testing for board games, so you have to play test it. This is the most lengthy process of the creation process (At least so far. This is the stage we’re at now.). As you test, you’ll notice certain mechanics that don’t work, and have to patch them. This is similar to fixing bugs or improving on certain features in software.</p>



<p>Once you’ve finished play testing it and feel confident in your board game, that’s when you can start releasing it to the public. This requires you to write the rules in a way that is understandable to your target audience. Similar to software, documentation is very important. In software, documentation can take many different forms; API docs, instruction manuals, etc. Each of these documents has a different target audience and should be written with that target audience in mind. When writing the rule book for your board game, know your target audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is one other aspect of board game creation that might not apply to all board games but is a good thing to keep in mind. Expansions. A lot of board games come with expansion packs. The only way you can create an expansion pack is if you created your board game in a way that allows for this sort of extensibility. This is very similar to how in software you don’t want to write spaghetti code and should always keep extensibility in mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creating a board game has been super fun and rewarding. It made me realize that I can put my software engineering skills to use in other areas seemingly unrelated. I believe that creating a board game, and maybe even converting it to code should be an activity done in schools in software courses.&nbsp;Especially for younger students who may not be interested in software yet.</p>



<p>This is my insight into board game creation and how it relates to software. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:ddorosz@katsudo.io">ddorosz@katsudo.io</a> if you have any questions, want to chat, or are interested in finding out more about the board game and when we plan on releasing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the second part of our look at the basic structure of food production (particularly grains to make bread) in the pre-modern world.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">Last week</a>, we began by looking at the great majority of our rural population, the little farmers.  Now I know everyone is eager to get to the mechanics of planting, harvesting, threshing, milling, baking and so on, but we have one more group of people in the countryside to talk about: the much smaller group of larger landholders, or as they are often generally referred to, the ‘big men.’</p>



<p>Now I should begin by noting that not all of our ‘big men’ are, in fact, men – though most were.  Exactly how many large rural landholders are women varies from one pre-modern society to the next (though it is almost always a minority), but it was generally not zero, save in a relative handful of societies which specifically <em>completely </em>barred women from independent landholdings by law (some Greek <em>poleis</em> did this, for instance); even in sharply patriarchal societies like Rome, there would always be a handful of great estates run by women, particularly widows.  Nevertheless ‘big man’ (or ‘big person’) is a fairly common way to refer to these fellows across languages (for instance, magnates from Latin <em>magnati</em>, literally ‘big men,’ mirrored by the Greek μεγιστᾶνες (‘big men’) which has the same meaning; ‘grandees’ has the same sense, coming from Portuguese).  I don’t want to use many of the language-specific terms because they often come with additional meaning – we could call these fellows ‘nobles’ or ‘aristocrats’ or ‘the gentry’ in various times and places, but these terms often imply rigid social classes which don’t apply cross-culturally (and in many cases might have no real equivalent in societies which still have recognizable rural ‘big men’).  Almost all of these traditional terms for the ‘big men’ (who again, are not all men) are loaded with some sort of meaning which won’t do for our very general look at the basic structures of pre-modern cereal agriculture.</p>



<p><strong>So instead, I am going to go with the somewhat clinical and bland “large landholders”</strong> most of whom are men (but some of whom are women), but <strong>all of whom hold lots of land</strong>.  But what I want to stress is that these fellows were understood as being ‘big’ in the sense that they held a lot of agricultural <em>capital</em> but <em>also</em> generally ‘big’ in the sense that they dominated, socially and politically, their societies (notice though how the words used to describe them above often <em>also</em> imply ‘bigness’ of ability or character – like ‘noble’ – they certainly <em>believed this about themselves</em> and they write most of our sources; one assumes the  peasantry viewed the matter quite differently, though they only infrequently get a chance to say it to us).  Now I know that capital is a scary word in some quarters, worry not.  We are going to use it in a fairly simple, direct way just to mean all of the things – land, animals, equipment, infrastructure – which make farming productive.  While these large landholders <em>almost always</em> represent a legally or socially privileged class,<strong> what matters for us is how their large landholdings and capital reshaped farming in the countryside</strong>.  I am not going to get too deep into the landholders themselves beyond these effects – they already get <em>quite enough</em> attention in their role as military, political and cultural elites as it is (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/">even </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/12/collections-a-trip-through-cicero-natural-law/">elsewhere </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/05/collections-a-trip-through-thucydides-fear-honor-and-interest/">on </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">this </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/03/27/a-trip-through-dhuoda-of-uzes-carolingian-values/">blog</a>).</p>



<p><strong>So how do these large landholders function in a countryside mostly composed of small subsistence farmers?</strong>  Let’s walk out of the village and up to the manor and find out.</p>

<h2>Farming Capital</h2>



<p>What generally defines our large landholders is their greater access to <em>capital</em>.  Now we don’t want to think of capital in the sort of money-denominated, fungible sense of modern finance, but in a very concrete sense: land, infrastructure, animals, and equipment.  As we’ll see, it isn’t just that the big men hold more of this capital, but that they hold fundamentally different <em>sorts</em> of capital and often use it very differently.</p>



<p>Of course this begins with <strong>land</strong>.  The thing to keep in mind is that prior to the modern period (really, later still – we might equally say prior to the industrial revolution; c. 1760 instead of c. 1500) the vast majority of economic activity was the production of the land.  That meant that land was both the primary form of holding wealth but also the main income-producing asset.  <strong>Consequently, larger land holdings are the assets that <em>enable</em> the accumulation of all of the other kinds of capital we’re discussing</strong>.  By having more land – typically <em>much</em> more land – than is required to feed a single household, these larger farmers can (as we’ll discuss in a bit) produce for markets and trade, enabling them to afford to acquire labor, animals, equipment and so on.  Our subsistence farmers of the last post, focused on producing for survival, would be hard-pressed to acquire much further in the way of substantial capital.</p>



<p>The next most important category is generally <strong>animals</strong>, particularly a <strong>plow team</strong> (typically two oxen, but sometimes draft horses and sometimes four instead of two).  I realize I didn’t spell this out explicitly in the previous piece, <strong>but while our small subsistence farmers may keep chickens or pigs on some small part of the pasture they have access to, they probably <em>do not</em> have a complete plow-team for their own farm</strong> (but I should note there is a <em>lot</em> of variability in this; my impression is that moving forward chronologically, you tend to see more plow-teams in the middle ages compared to the ancient world, and more in the early modern compared to the middle ages, occasionally held in common by villages).  Oxen and horses are <em>hideously</em> expensive, both to acquire but also to feed and for a family barely surviving one year to the next, they simply cannot afford them.  They also do not have herds of animals (because their small farms absolutely cannot support acres of pasturage) and they probably have limited access to <em>herdsmen</em> generally (that is, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">transhumant pastoralists</a> moving around the countryside) because those fellows will tend to want to interact with the community <em>leaders</em> who are, as noted above, the large landholders.  All of which is to say that while the small farmers may keep a few animals, they do not have access to significantly large numbers of animals (or humans), which matters, as we’ll see.</p>

Apologies for poor quality of the image, getting a decent picture that is of the painting itself and not a reproduction is difficult; this one is from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Tomb_of_Sennedjem#/media/File:Deir_el-Medina-20-Grab_1-Sennedjem-Pflueger-Saeerin-1982-gje.jpg">wikipedia</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first impact of having a plow-team is fairly obvious: <strong>a plow drawn by a couple of oxen is more effective than a plow pushed by a single human</strong>.  That means that a plow-team lets the same amount of farming <em>labor</em> sow a larger area of land (and if your thought is, “ok, but what about the <em>harvest</em>” – good, keep a pin in that, we’ll come back to it). <strong> It also allows for a larger, deeper plow, which in turn plows at a greater depth, which<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19093521/"> can improve yields </a></strong>(we’ll get into why and how plowing works next week).  You can easily see why, for a landholder with a large farm, having a plow-team is so useful: whereas the subsistence farmer struggles by having too much labor (and too many mouths to feed) and too little land, the big landholder has a lot of land they are trying to get farmed with as little labor as possible.  And of course, more to the point, the large landholder has the wealth and acreage necessary to buy and then pasture the animals in the plow-team.</p>



<p>The second major impact is <strong>manure</strong>.  Remember that our farmers live before the time of artificial fertilizer.  Crops, especially bulk cereal crops, wear out the nutrients in the soil quite rapidly after repeated harvests, which leaves the farmer two options.  The first, standard option, is that the farmer can fallow the field (which also has the advantage of disrupting certain pest life-cycles); depending on the farming method, fallowing may mean planting specific plants to renew the soil’s nutrients when those plants are uprooted and left to return to the soil in the field or it may mean simply turning the field over to wild plants with a similar effect.  The second option is using fertilizer, which in this case means manure.  Quite a lot of it.  Aggressive manuring, particularly on rich soils which have good access to moisture (because cropping also dries out the soil; fallowing can restore that moisture) allows the field to be fallowed less frequently and thus farmed more intensively.  In some cases it allowed rich farmland to be <em>continuously</em> cropped, with fairly dramatic increases in returns-to-acreage as a result.  And by increasing the nutrients in the soil, it also produces higher yields in a given season.</p>



<p>Now the humans in a farming household aren’t going to generate enough manure on their own to make a meaningful contribution to soil fertility.  But the larger landholders generally have two advantages in this sense.  <strong>First, because their landholdings are large, they can afford to turn over marginal farming ground to pasture for horses, cattle, sheep and so on</strong>; these …</p></div></div>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/freakwave.jpg" alt="Freak wave"></p>

<p>During the pandemic, I’ve done my civic duty and spent lockdown reading a ton of random stuff on the internet. In the midst of a Wikipedia binge, I went down a rabbit hole on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave">rogue waves</a>: massive waves that occur in the middle of the ocean, endangering ships and generating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu4ogCy5d4k">kickass Youtube content</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of a rogue wave reminded me of a particularly challenging stage in the life of many venture-backed enterprise SaaS startups. Similar to how a rogue wave forms, during this phase many Small Problems coincide and create a Big Problem. Also like rogue waves, this moment in the life of a high-growth enterprise SaaS business is uncommon – it seems to occur around $5-20 million ARR, which relatively few companies reach, and can seem almost mythical. And finally, the effects of both rogue waves and this challenging startup stage are predictable: if you spend long enough on the high seas, they’re waiting for you.</p>

<p>I’ve seen this phenomenon both in-person as an operator and as an observer of other companies, and I do believe it’s real. I’m writing this essay in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share what I’ve seen</li>
  <li>Provide some opinions on what you can do about it</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully I can be the crusty old mariner bringing back tales that others find useful.</p>

<h2 id="hitting-the-wall">Hitting the Wall</h2>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/boat.jpg" alt="Big boat, bigger wave">
Startups can be stressful</p>

<p>The rogue wave typically seems to hit between $5M and $20M in ARR. If you’re operating with a common venture-backed SaaS model of <a href="https://www.saastr.com/how-to-figure-out-your-competitors-revenues-in-about-70-seconds/">$1-200k ARR per employee</a>, this is around where you’ll hit the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191001-dunbars-number-why-we-can-only-maintain-150-relationships">Dunbar number</a> of ~150 people: the point where you can no longer operate as a large family, and need to start acting like a corporation. <em>(Note that the post linked is from 2012 – SaaS has since exploded, and more companies are raising huge rounds and hiring more on less revenue)</em></p>

<p>Crossing the 150-person barrier is both operationally and emotionally difficult:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operational: We have so many teams, we need regular status reports!</li>
  <li>Emotional: Why do I need to send <em>you</em> a status report all of a sudden, I thought we were all friends here?!</li>
</ul>

<p>This transition point is also when many leaders who excelled in scrappy startup mode <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/06/27/hardest-part-of-startup-scale-yourself.html">struggle to level up</a> in a larger organization. Some successfully scale themselves (slow, painful) and others will leave the company (fast, but often even more painful).</p>

<p>Many of the first contracts that you closed post-traction come up for renewal around this point (in the enterprise – SMB SaaS has less predictable growth profiles). If you’re following a <a href="https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/">triple-triple-double-double-double</a> growth path, you’ll be at roughly your second triple. There will be too many customers for the founding team to personally visit and retain everyone.</p>

<p>At this point you’ll need to renew “real” customers, not just friends who took a flyer on your infant product. These aren’t the earliest adopters who will be with you through thick and thin and are really closer to partners. These are real live paying customers who will leave if your product is screwed up. As these renewals approach, a mature post-sales motion becomes essential.</p>

<p>The expectations around your revenue also become more real at this stage. Under about $10M ARR, your revenue projections can be a mild shitshow. But the expectation that you’ll have at least some semblance of predictability steadily increases.</p>

<p>And through it all you need to continue to scale the product. Your code is no longer a series of never-ending green fields rolling off into the distance, and non-trivial parts of your product will need to be meaningfully restructured. You’re burdened by decisions made years ago, often by people who are no longer on the team.</p>

<p>This is especially true for enterprise SaaS. Enterprise products are much more unwieldy than jewel-box consumer products, as they have to support many more users and workflows. Consumer products are like Chipotle: a small, carefully curated set of menu items, built for elegance and efficiency. Enterprise products are like the Cheesecake Factory: you can get steak, pasta, a milkshake and 4 kinds of margarita in the same meal. You need to level up how your team builds products.</p>

<h2 id="cresting-the-wave">Cresting the Wave</h2>

<p>I’m writing about this phenomenon because if you haven’t seen or heard about it, there isn’t really a good way to realize that it might be coming. Even if it isn’t preventable, it’s better to know what’s on the horizon. After all, being able to see around corners is why many companies hire experienced operators.</p>

<p>I won’t claim to be an expert on how to react, but I can share a few things that I think work well and a few that don’t, and what I would do if I had to go through this phase again.</p>

<h3 id="the-crew">The Crew</h3>

<p>First, I would do my best to get the right team in place in advance. In particular, I would make sure that I had very strong functional heads for the functions that will be strained the most: Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support, and Customer Success. You don’t need every role covered, but it saves headaches to know that some parts of the team are bulletproof. This isn’t the time for unforced errors.</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/pirate-crew.jpg" alt="Pirates of the Caribbean crew">
You want a senior crew. You can tell that Sharkman here has experience and won’t freak out when the database goes down or a large account churns.</p>

<p>I also recommend hiring senior team members who can help see around corners and anticipate issues. This is a taxing time period because it’s so damn busy, and raw, well-directed horsepower tends to carry the day in those situations. More importantly, seasoned operators have typically seen challenging times before, and have the composure to handle them calmly because they know that things are always on fire.</p>

<p>It’s tempting during these busy times to make very junior hires such as new college graduates or coding bootcamp grads just to put butts in seats. These folks can be excellent hires in calmer times, but the chaos caused by too many inexperienced employees is very difficult while you’re cresting the wave.</p>

<h3 id="steering-the-ship">Steering the Ship</h3>

<p>Startups are generally fairly stressful, and that’s heightened in this time period. When operational problems strike in stressful times, it’s common to blame the people involved rather than processes – in reality, bad processes or incentives are usually the root cause.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the faster you’re growing, the more lightweight your processes should be. When you’re in rapid scaling mode your operational tempo is constantly changing, so there’s no point boiling the ocean to create a perfect process when next month so much will have changed.</p>

<p>For example: when confronting a startup rogue wave, I would not choose to reinvent a completely new system for launching new features. Instead, use 20% of the time to set up a simple, predictable process that gives you 80% of the value. Example: set up a recurring check-in meeting where upcoming releases are discussed by PMs and Tech Leads + a Slack thread where all new releases are announced when they go-live. It won’t be perfect, but you can get this up and running in 15 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="commit">Commit</h3>

<p>This is not the time to hedge your decisions or waffle on strategy.</p>

<p>For example: in general, I prefer to give people a generous window of time to grow into stretch roles. Promoting from within builds continuity, leads to a more invested team, and motivates others by demonstrating that you’re creating strong career paths. But in this phase it’s especially important that you commit to keeping or replacing leaders fast, as there’s just too much going on.</p>

<p>If you’re 30% of the way up a 100 foot wall of water and decide to adjust course, you’re going to get slammed.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-calm">Keeping Calm</h3>

<p>Whatever you do, <em>don’t freak out</em>. When it feels like shit is hitting the fan everywhere, it’s easy to want to react and search for magic solutions. Hire a new Head of X! Spend less! No wait, spend <em>more</em>! Pause development and focus on tech debt! Actually our largest customer needs more features, cancel all tech debt projects!</p>

<p>In reality, to take a line from The Sopranos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_po7So0MKq4">it won’t be cinematic</a>. Life isn’t a movie. There are no magic fixes – this challenging phase gets resolved by showing up and executing in an unflashy way for months. Magic fixes never really exist, and that’s especially true since this crucible stems from several medium-sized problems amplifying one another.</p>

<p>Searching for a unified solution to your troubles risks distraction. The road is reasonably straightforward and the challenges are tractable: there are just a lot of them. Just like an actual rogue wave, you can’t flee or dodge the factors that make crossing these rogue waves so difficult. You succeed by pointing your boat right at the problem and hitting the gas. Keeping calm doesn’t mean being stubborn or refusing to change, but it does mean that you can’t second guess your decisions – especially when it feels like you’re climbing a wall of water.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Not everyone makes it over the wave – of the roughly 10 cases that I’ve observed, roughly half had their growth stunted for at least several years after hitting this stage. In my opinion this SaaS rogue wave should be taken seriously.</p>

<p>But the good news is that once you’ve crossed the wave, you can speed up again. As you’re rising up the wall everything goes into slow motion; but once you’ve crested the top, your acceleration can increase again as you’ve set yourself up with a more stable operating model and a hardened team.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful time, as there’s so much opportunity. Your team is still in place. The market opportunity is there, and people are buying. And once you’re over the top, the water is much calmer towards the horizon.</p>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many challenging situations tend to arise simultaneously when high growth enterprise SaaS companies hit roughly $5-20 million ARR.</li>
  <li>The good news is that after this phase things get easier – the bad news is that it’s not easily avoidable.</li>
  <li>The best way to move forward is to focus on executing – and don’t be overly reactive.</li>
</ul>

<br/>
July 31, 2020 | https://sorbet.org/blog/2020/07/30/ruby-3-rbs-sorbet | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sorbet.org/blog/2020/07/30/ruby-3-rbs-sorbet">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Yesterday Square <a href="https://developer.squareup.com/blog/the-state-of-ruby-3-typing/">posted an article</a> to their blog introducing
<a href="https://github.com/ruby/rbs">RBS</a> (Ruby Signature), a type syntax format for Ruby 3.</p>
<p>We’d like to take a second to speak to how RBS relates to Sorbet. The short
version: Sorbet will happily incorporate RBS as a way to specify type
annotations, in addition to the existing syntax Sorbet supports. Stripe still
has a very strong commitment to Sorbet’s continued progress and success. While
the Ruby core team has been working on syntax, we’ve been working on features
that build on top of that syntax.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I’d love to start a discussion of some of the finer points of
what this announcement means for Ruby, and for Sorbet.</p>
<!--truncate-->
<h2>RBI? RBS?</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://youtu.be/2g9R7PUCEXo?t=2076">Matz announced at RubyConf 2019</a>, Ruby 3 plans to ship type
annotations for the standard library in a particular format. We’ve been meeting
with Matz and the Ruby core team to provide input on our experience and learn
from them how they’re thinking about types so that Sorbet wil be ready. We’re
<a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/faq#when-ruby-3-gets-types-what-will-the-migration-plan-look-like">committed</a> to supporting Ruby 3’s type syntax.</p>
<p>In the mean time, we’ve kept busy. While the Ruby core team has been working on
the RBS syntax over the past year, the Sorbet team has delivered tons of other
features. A sampling of features that didn’t exist a year ago:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Definition (Aug 2019)</li>
<li><a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/exhaustiveness">Exhaustiveness checking</a> (Aug 2019)</li>
<li><a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/tenum">Typed enums</a> (Nov 2019)</li>
<li>Autocompletion (Nov 2019)</li>
<li>Step-function improvements in IDE speed (Feb 2020, June 2020)</li>
</ul>
<p>These features make Sorbet users more productive, empowering them to do more
with Sorbet. We’ll happily incorporate any other syntax the Ruby core team wants
to build.</p>
<h2>Wait, a wholly separate file?</h2>
<p>RBS type signatures are placed in a separate file. While Sorbet also offers
inline syntax (more later), we believe that supporting type signatures in a
separate file is necessary. Consider: most of the Ruby standard library is
implemented in C for performance (e.g., all <code>Array</code> and <code>Hash</code> functions, and
many others). There must be a way to ascribe types to these internally defined
classes and methods.</p>
<p>Providing types for the standard library is incredibly important! In completely
untyped, unannotated Ruby codebases, people who try out Sorbet for the first
time find that about 25% of call sites already have static type coverage. Why?
Everyday Ruby code uses the standard library abundantly, and Sorbet includes
type definitions for the standard library out of the box!</p>
<p>Additionally, there will always be libraries that prefer not using type
annotations. To integrate an untyped library into a typed Ruby codebase, there
must be a place for these types to live outside of that project. In fact, we
already have the <a href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet-typed">sorbet-typed</a> repo for this purpose.</p>
<p>Thus, both Sorbet and Ruby 3 support type annotations in separate files (via RBI
files and RBS files, respectively).</p>
<h2>What about inline type annotations?</h2>
<p>There are people using Ruby who still prefer type annotations to live in the
code itself. We’ve built Sorbet to cater to both groups: those who <strong>like and
don’t like</strong> type annotations benefit from Sorbet.</p>
<p>How? Sorbet implements a <a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/gradual">gradual type system</a>. Without any type annotations,
Sorbet will do its best to understand and offer feedback on your code. With type
annotations exclusively in separate files, Sorbet will understand more and offer
better feedback. With inline type annotations, people can tell Sorbet every
little detail about their code so Sorbet can offer incredible feedback. For
these people, reading the types is as valuable as reading the code itself.</p>
<p>Sorbet has always provided syntax for inline type annotations. Annotations
aren’t required by Sorbet—they’re there for the people who want to empower
Sorbet to help them even more. Whether you love type annotations or not, Sorbet
still provides value.</p>
<h2>Why are inline type annotations useful?</h2>
<p>As we mentioned above, for those teams and projects who really want static
typing, inline type annotations become essential. Types carry intent, and there
are frequently places where inferring the intent could be ambiguous. Consider
this snippet:</p>
<pre><code>xs = [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>]
xs &lt;&lt; <span>nil</span>


</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://sorbet.run/#%23%20typed%3A%20true%0A%0Axs%20%3D%20%5B1%2C%202%2C%203%5D%0Axs%20%3C%3C%20nil">→ View on sorbet.run</a></p>
<p>A type checker could infer one of two types here:</p>
<ol>
<li>either the programmer meant for <code>xs</code> to be an array of <code>Integer</code>'s and
<code>nil</code>'s (i.e., <code>T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)]</code> in Sorbet’s syntax), or</li>
<li>the programmer made a mistake, and didn’t intend to allow <code>nil</code>'s in <code>xs</code>
(i.e., it was intended to be a <code>T::Array[Integer]</code>, and this code should
report a static error).</li>
</ol>
<p>Any static checker must assume one of these outcomes, but there are times when
either might make sense. Explicit annotations resolve these ambiguities. In this
case, Sorbet assumes (2) by default, but other type systems do other things. For
example, Flow <a href="https://flow.org/try/#0MYewdgzgLgBAHhGBeGBtAjAGhgJmwZgF0BuAKAQDoAHAVwgAsAKMGgG1YEpig">assumes (1) by default</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how to use an inline annotation in Sorbet to explicitly declare that (1)
is intended:</p>
<pre><code>xs = T.let([<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)])
xs &lt;&lt; <span>nil</span>


</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://sorbet.run/#%23%20typed%3A%20true%0A%0Axs%20%3D%20T.let(%5B1%2C%202%2C%203%5D%2C%20T%3A%3AArray%5BT.nilable(Integer)%5D)%0Axs%20%3C%3C%20nil">→
View on sorbet.run</a></p>
<h2>Inline type annotations must be Ruby syntax</h2>
<p>For the time being, Matz and the Ruby core team want to experiment with type
annotations without changing Ruby syntax, because that would require everyone to
upgrade to a specific Ruby version to benefit. Because Sorbet values inline type
annotations, we embedded a type annotation language in Ruby with no syntax
changes needed:</p>
<pre><code>extend T::Sig

sig {params(<span>strings:</span> T::Array[String]).returns(Integer)}
<span><span>def</span> <span>count_letters</span><span>(strings)</span></span>
  strings.map(&amp;<span>:length</span>).sum
<span>end</span>
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://sorbet.run/#%23%20typed%3A%20true%0A%0Aextend%20T%3A%3ASig%0A%0Asig%20%7Bparams(strings%3A%20T%3A%3AArray%5BString%5D).returns(Integer)%7D%0Adef%20count_letters(strings)%0A%20%20strings.map(%26%3Alength).sum%0Aend">→
View on sorbet.run</a></p>
<p>Sorbet’s syntax is 100% valid Ruby, which has tons of benefits!</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax highlighting for type annotations already works in 100% of Ruby
editors.</li>
<li>There’s no transpiler step required—Ruby code with Sorbet type annotations
runs directly.</li>
<li>Every RuboCop rule ever written works with Sorbet type annotations.</li>
<li>Any Ruby IDE with Go to Definition already has Go to Definition on type
annotations.</li>
<li>Sorbet’s RBI files are just Ruby code with empty method bodies, reusing the
inline syntax.</li>
<li>It’s backwards compatible with all supported versions of Ruby.</li>
</ul>
<p>The obvious downside is that there are prettier inline type annotation syntaxes
that are not valid Ruby. The Ruby grammar is not so complicated that it couldn’t
be changed to support type annotations. But again, this syntax does so well
<strong>because</strong> it doesn’t fracture the Ruby community with incompatible syntax
changes.</p>
<h2>Sorbet is committed to improving</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s not a choice between Ruby 3 or Sorbet—you can have
both at the same time. We love that the Ruby core team is bringing types to
Ruby, and we’re happy to incorporate their work into Sorbet. We plan to give
back too: it’s likely that the initial release of RBS files for the Ruby
standard library will be created by converting Sorbet’s already extensive
standard library annotations into the RBS format.</p>
<p>At the same time, we’re hard at work improving Sorbet. Stripe has millions of
lines of Ruby code and that number is only growing. We’re nearing our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#Percentage_calculation">second
nine</a> of percentage of files at <code># typed: true</code> or above—which is to say, those
millions of lines of Ruby use a lot of types. We have hundreds of engineers
writing Ruby and using our Sorbet-powered IDE every day.</p>
<p>Sorbet type checks these millions of lines of Ruby code in seconds, helps
prevent countless production incidents, and helps new Stripe engineers spin up
fast. And it does all this today! If you want to try it out, check out the docs:</p>
<p><a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/adopting">→ Adopting Sorbet in an Existing Codebase</a></p>
<p>or play around with small Sorbet examples online:</p>
<p><a href="https://sorbet.run/">→ Sorbet playground</a></p>
<p>Sorbet already has extensive type annotations for the Ruby standard library,
thanks in large part to the nearly 200 contributors to Sorbet that you can find
<a href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/graphs/contributors">on GitHub</a>, the vast majority of whom come to Sorbet from outside
of Stripe and the Sorbet team.</p>
<p>We’re happy that the Ruby core team is focused on continually improving Ruby,
because we are too. ❤️</p>

<p>The age of information is not what we all hoped it would be. We successfully digitized the majority of human knowledge, and we even made it freely accessible to most. Now the problem is different, we have <em>too much</em> information. Answers to most questions can be found in thousands of distinct places online, and the new problem is <em>“whos information can we trust?”</em></p>



<h2>What Platforms Think They Should Do About Fake News</h2>



<p>Twitter and Facebook have recently been under scrutiny for their censorship of coronavirus related misinformation. For example, a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/53559938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video claiming Hydroxychloroquine is a Corona cure</a> recently went viral on Facebook, and the video keeps getting taken down. The video contains some wild assertions, made by Stella Immanuel, who also believes that gynecological problems are the result of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yCXCP3evAg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiritual relationships</a>.</p>



<p>By removing content they believe to be dubious, Twitter and Facebook have made themselves arbiters of truth. Anecdotally, all the posts I’ve seen them remove HAVE contained misinformation, but the fact remains… these platforms have become self-appointed authorities on the veracity of our information.</p>



<p><strong>This is a problem.</strong></p>



<h2>So We Can’t Censor?</h2>



<p>We certainly can, and we certainly should in some cases. Let’s get some obvious ones out of the way:</p>



<ul><li>Child Pornography</li><li>Death Threats</li><li>Doxing</li></ul>



<p>There may be some other clear examples where censoring is unquestionably the right choice, though I doubt there are many. Let’s look at some more controversial examples:</p>



<ul><li>Hate Speech</li><li>Misinformation</li></ul>



<p>I would posit that here the answer is contingent on <em>who </em>is doing the censoring. While hate speech and misinformation are disgusting, I don’t want a government deciding <em>what </em>is hate speech, or deciding <em>what </em>is truth.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/war-is-peace-300x225.jpg" alt="war is peace 1984 orwell" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/war-is-peace-300x225.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/war-is-peace-768x576.jpg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/war-is-peace.jpg 877w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/war-is-peace-300x225.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/war-is-peace-768x576.jpg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/war-is-peace.jpg 877w" data-src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/war-is-peace-300x225.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>George Orwell, 1984</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>That said, I certainly want an online system where hate speech and misinformation are effectively filtered out of the conversation. Ideally, every online participant is a virtuous, educated, and concerned conversationalist. If this were the case, posts of an undesirable nature would effectively be ignored due to not receiving the likes, shares, upvotes, and comments they need to spread.</p>



<p>In reality, we can’t have such a pacifistic approach. We need to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tscc3e5eujrsEeFN4/well-kept-gardens-die-by-pacifism" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">protect our gardens</a>.</p>



<h2>Misinformation – What Should Platforms Do?</h2>



<p>It starts here. All online platforms are responsible for the tools they provide for moderation, if not for the moderation itself.</p>



<p>Platforms <strong>should</strong>:</p>



<ul><li>Remove dangerous content such as doxing, threats, child trafficking, etc</li><li>Provide tools for users to mark content as harmful or misleading</li><li>Mark content as dubious</li></ul>



<p>Platforms <strong>should not:</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>Remove </em>misleading content</li></ul>



<p>By removing misleading content, platforms run the risk of fueling an <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_martyrdom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argumentum ad martyrdom</a> mentality. Removing information can have an adverse effect, causing people to suspect we have a nefarious reason for removing it.</p>



<blockquote><p>But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses. They laughed at&nbsp;Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown.</p><cite>– Carl Sagan, Probably</cite></blockquote>



<h2>What Should Users Do About Misinformation and Fake News?</h2>



<p>Users <strong>should</strong>:</p>



<ul><li>Read entire articles before liking, sharing, or commenting</li><li>Deploy extra skepticism to information with a clear political or monetary agenda</li><li>Be self-aware about their preconceived notions and confirmation biases</li><li>Look for the primary source of information</li><li>Ensure information is up-to-date</li></ul>



<p>Users <strong>should not:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Reward clickbait titles with engagement</li><li>Exclusively follow, subscribe, or search for content that aligns with their current beliefs</li><li>Assume your position is valid because people are trying to remove your content</li><li>Trust articles and posts coming from sites that appear <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sitelock.com/blog/is-this-website-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">unsafe</a></li></ul>

Whether it becomes visible sooner rather than later depends on the consistency guarantees offered by the database.</p><p>“But wait, aren’t databases supposed to take care of consistency issues for me?” I hear you ask. Some databases come with counter-intuitive consistency guarantees to provide high availability and performance. Others have knobs that allow you to chose whether you want better performance or stronger consistency guarantees, like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels">Azure’s Cosmos DB</a>. Because of that, you need to know what the trade-offs are, and whether there are knobs you can use to tune your database to your specific use-case.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what happens when you send a request to a database. In an ideal world, your request executes instantaneously:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>But we don’t live an ideal world - your request needs to reach the data store, which then needs to process the request and finally send back a response to you. All these actions take time and are not instantaneous:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>The best guarantee a database can provide is that the request executes somewhere between its invocation and completion time. You might think that this doesn’t look like a big deal - after all, it’s what you are used to when writing single-threaded applications - if you assign 1 to x and read its value right after, you expect to find 1 in there, assuming there is no other thread writing to the same variable. But, once you start dealing with data stores that replicate their state on multiple machines for high availability and scalability, all bets are off. To understand why that’s the case, we will explore the trade-offs a system designer has to make to implement reads in a simplified model of a distributed database.</p><p>Suppose we have a distributed key-value store, which is composed of a set of replicas. The replicas elect a leader among themselves, which is the only node that can accept writes. When the leader receives a write request, it broadcasts it asynchronously to the other replicas. Although all replicas receive the same updates in the same order, they do so at different times. </p><p>You are tasked to come up with a strategy to handle read requests - how would you go about it? Well, a read can potentially be served by the leader or a replica. If all reads were to go through the leader, the throughput would be limited by what a single node can handle. Alternatively, any replica could serve any read request - that would definitely scale, but then two clients, or observers, could have a different view of the system’s state, as replicas can lag behind the leader and between them.</p><p>Intuitively, there is a trade-off between how consistent the observers’ views of the system are, and the system’s performance and availability. To understand this relationship, we need to define precisely what we mean by consistency. We will do so with the help of <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">consistency models</a>, which formally define the possible views of the system’s state observers can experience. </p><h2 id="strong-consistency"><a href="#strong-consistency" aria-label="strong consistency permalink"></a>Strong Consistency</h2><p>If clients send writes and reads exclusively to the leader, then every request appears to take place atomically at a very specific point in time as if there was a single copy of the data. No matter how many replicas there are or how far behind they are lagging, as long as the clients always query the leader directly, from their point of view there is a single copy of data.</p><p>Because a request is not served instantaneously, and there is a single node serving it, the request executes somewhere between its invocation and completion time. Another way to think about it is that once a request completes, it’s side-effects are visible to all observers:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Since a request becomes visible to all other participants between its invocation and completion time, there is a real-time guarantee that must be enforced - this guarantee is formalized by a consistency model called <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/linearizable">linearizability</a>, or strong consistency. Linearizability is the strongest consistency guarantee a system can provide for single-object requests. </p><p>What if the client sends a read request to the leader, but by the time the request gets there, the server that received the request thinks it’s still the leader, but it actually was deposed? If the ex-leader was to process the request, the system would no longer be strongly consistent. To guard against this case, the presumed leader first needs to contact a majority of the replicas to confirm whether it still is the leader. Only then is it allowed to execute the request and send back the response to the client. This considerably increases the time required to serve a read.</p><h3 id="sequential-consistency"><a href="#sequential-consistency" aria-label="sequential consistency permalink"></a>Sequential Consistency</h3><p>So far, we have discussed serializing all reads through the leader. But doing so creates a single chokepoint, which limits the system’s throughput. On top of that, the leader needs to contact a majority of replicas to handle a read. To increase the read performance, we could allow the replicas to handle requests as well.</p><p>Even though a replica can lag behind the leader, it will always receive new updates in the same order as the leader. If a client A only ever queries replica 1, and client B only ever queries replica 2, the two clients will see the state evolving at different times, as replicas are not entirely in sync:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>The consistency model in which operations occur in the same order for all observers, but doesn’t provide any real-time guarantee about when an operation’s side-effect becomes visible to the observers, is called <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/sequential">sequential consistency</a>. The lack of real-time guarantees is what differentiates sequential consistency with linearizability. </p><p>A simple application of this model is a producer/consumer system synchronized with a queue - a producer node writes items to the queue, which a consumer reads. The producer and the consumer see the items in the same order, but the consumer lags behind the producer.</p><h3 id="eventual-consistency"><a href="#eventual-consistency" aria-label="eventual consistency permalink"></a>Eventual Consistency</h3><p>Although we managed to increase the read throughput, we had to pin clients to replicas - what if a replica goes down? We could increase the availability of the store by allowing a client to query any replica. But, this comes at a steep price in terms of consistency. Say there are two replicas 1 and 2, where replica 2 lags behind replica 1. If a client queries replica 1 and right after replica 2, it will see a state from the past, which can be very confusing. The only guarantee a client has is that eventually, all replicas will converge to the final state if the writes to the system stop. This consistency model is called eventual consistency. </p><p>It’s challenging to build applications on top of an eventually consistent data store because the behavior is different from the one you are used to when writing single-threaded applications. Subtle bugs can creep up that are hard to debug and to reproduce. Yet, in eventual consistency’s defense, not all applications require linearizability. You need to make the conscious choice whether the guarantees offered by your data store, or lack thereof, satisfy your application’s requirements. An eventually consistent store is perfectly fine if you want to keep track of the number of users visiting your website, as it doesn’t really matter if a read returns a number that is slightly out of date. But for a payment processor, you definitely want strong consistency.</p><p>There are more <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">consistency models</a> than the ones presented in this post. Still, the main intuition behind them is the same: the stronger the consistency guarantees are, the higher the latency of individual operations is, and the less available the store becomes when failures happen. This relationship is formalized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACELC_theorem">PACELC theorem</a>. It states that in case of network partitioning (P) in a distributed computer system, one has to choose between availability (A) and consistency (C), but else (E), even when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C). </p><p>In my <a href="https://systemdesignmanual.com/">system design book</a>, I explore other tunable trade-offs data stores make to guarantee high availability and performance, like the isolation guarantees that prevent a group of operations within a transaction from interfering with other concurrently running transactions. </p><hr></article></div>]]>

<p>The shares of Alphabet , Amazon (AMZN) , Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) responded to the announcement of unexpectedly good quarterly figures for the four tech companies in pre-market trading session on Friday. As a result, the shares were close to their respective record highs (Amazon and Alphabet) or even higher (Apple and Facebook).</p>



<p>And during the FB earnings conference call from Thursday, July 30, CEO of Facebook Inc talked, among other things, about the future of remote work within the Company. He said that even before COVID Facebook had a long-term goal of enabling more remote work since the ability to feel present even when you’re remote is a core aspect of their own product work on video presence, workplace and virtual and augmented reality. </p>



<blockquote><p>“the reason why we’re shifting to more remote work is that we think that culturally, it will allow us to attract more talented people. We’re not doing this primarily as a cost-saving measure.”-Mark ZuckeRberg</p></blockquote>



<p>He added that Facebook is:”using this moment to accelerate these plans. And I expect that up to 50% of our employees will be remote long term within the next 5 to 10 years. This will enable us to attract and retain broader pools of talent regardless of where they live.”</p>



<p>David Wehner, Facebook CFO also touched this topic and said:”We had our <strong>strongest hiring quarter ever in Q2</strong>, adding over 4,200 net new hires, primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 52,500 full-time employees, up 32% year-over-year.” and continued on remote work “The main thing we’re trying to do is access a greater talent pool, which ultimately might give us more opportunity to grow head count. So I think there’s an effect there that’s, I think, in addition to cost in the sense that we would have a greater pool of people that we could recruit from.”.</p>



<p>Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (NASDAQ: FB) price went up 7% in the pre-amrket session on Friday which is more than $16.00 higher then Thursday afternoon.</p>



<p>At the same time, the number of users continued to rise rapidly: in the past quarter, FB added more than 100 million monthly active user – and now there are a total of 2.6 billion. At nearly $ 5.2 billion, the profit was about twice as high as in the same quarter of the previous year.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.byteant.com/internet-of-things-development-services" target="_blank">Internet of Things, or IoT for short</a>, is a promising branch of technology that together withÂ&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.byteant.com/blog/7-ways-how-big-data-can-supercharge-your-business/" target="_blank">Big Data</a> is conquering the digital world now. The idea of smart interrelated gadgets and consumer electronics able to work independently has been evolving since the end of the 20th century. This technology has successfully resulted in a highly-developed far-reaching system of middleware between the devices and user applications. The universal popularity of the IoT strategy is easily explained by the fact that there are billions of devices worldwide in all aspects of human life: medicine, industry, commerce, farming, lifestyle, to name just a few.</p>

<p>You should bear in mind, though, that open source solutions are not totally equal to free software. The terms may mean the same and are used interchangeably sometimes. However, open source software (OSS) goes both ways: it can come to you at no cost as well as offer you quite expensive price tags. The difference lies in its open nature of the software development approach as it allows side code enthusiasts to easily join the programming process.</p>

Quite obviously, some organizations opt for having the competitive IoT-backed solutions integrated with their processes, like these actionable use cases for <a href="https://www.byteant.com/blog/case-study-iot-and-saas-solutions-for-auto-repair-startup/">Automobile</a> and <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.byteant.com/blog/case-study-how-iot-and-bigdata-transform-sports-industry/" target="_blank">Sports </a>industries. Some decide to double down on buying out or creating their own open source platforms to maximize revenues. Either way, it leads us to the exponential increase of software development initiatives driven by IoT. Hereâ€™s a list of some facts that just add fuel to the fire of IoT-based potential.

<h2>Utilizing OSS: Some benefits and drawbacks explained</h2>
<p>At first glance, the IoT tools mentioned above may seem quite similar and enlist homogeneous features but these platforms can come in handy going far beyond. Alternatively to proprietary software, open source technologies are completely customizable and scalable â€“ as the code is open it can be adjusted and modified to the businesses needs. OSS allows developers and enterprises to move between different frameworks without complications â€“ the necessary toolkit provided.</p>
<p>With a great number of automated protocols and functions, open source frameworks save much time of IoT engineers and tech-professionals. This IoT solution is better for handling deployment flexibility issues and reducing expenses. Being of the major priority, data privacy and security is the main standpoint of any business, so you may choose from diverse open source framework vendors worldwide.</p>
<p>There are still some challenges you can face on this far-reaching way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open means free access, i.e. contributors are not always specialists.</li>
<li>Secure maintenance is always vulnerable.</li>
<li>Data privacy gains a growing legal interest.</li>
<li>A number of best open source platforms may cost a fortune.</li>
<li>Bugs happen.</li>
<li>The set of available standard features doesnâ€™t fit all your business needs.</li>
<li>Open source IoT platforms are not for a mediocre user.</li>
</ul>

				<p><em>I have built a custom search functionality for this blog,
based on Java and the Apache Lucene full-text search library,
compiled into a native binary using the Quarkus framework and GraalVM.
It is deployed as a Serverless application running on AWS Lambda,
providing search results without any significant cold start delay.
If you thought Java wouldn’t be the right language for this job, keep reading;
in this post I’m going to give an overview over the implementation of this feature and my learnings along the way.</em></p>
<p>Having a search functionality for my blog has been on my mind for quite some time;
I’d like to give users the opportunity to find specific contents on this blog right here on this site, without having to use an external search engine.
That’s not only nice in terms of user experience, but also having insight into the kind of information readers look for on this blog should help me to identify interesting things to write about in the future.</p>
<p>Now this blog is a static site — generated using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> — which makes this an interesting challenge.
I didn’t want to rely on an external search service
(see "Why No External Search Service" below for the reasoning),
and also a purely client-side solution as described in this <a href="https://endler.dev/2019/tinysearch/">excellent blog post</a> didn’t seem ideal.
While technically fascinating, I didn’t like the fact that it requires shipping the entire search index to the client for executing search queries.
Also things like result highlighting, customized result scoring, word stemming, fuzzy search and more seemed a bit more than I’d be willing to implement on the client.</p>
<p>All these issues have largely been solved on the server-side by libraries such as <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a> for quite some time.
Using a library like Lucene means implementing a custom server-side process, though.
How to deploy such service?
Operating a VM 24/7 with my search backend for what’s likely going to be not more than a few dozen queries per month seemed a bit like overkill.</p>
<p>So after some consideration I decided to implement my own search functionality,
based on the highly popular Apache Lucene library,
deployed as a Serverless application,
which is started on-demand if a user runs a query on my website.
In the remainder of this post I’m going to describe the solution I came up with and how it works.</p>
<p>If you like, you can try it out right now, this post is about this little search input control at the top right of this page!</p>

<p>Why No External Search Service?</p>
<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1284925378868518913">tweeting</a> about my serverless search experiment, one of the questions was "What’s wrong with <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>?".
To be very clear, there’s nothing wrong with it at all.
External search services like Algolia, <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search">Google Custom Search</a>, or an Elasticsearch provider such as <a href="https://bonsai.io/">Bonsai</a> promise an easy-to-use, turn-key search functionality which can be a great choice for your specific use case.</p>
<p>However, I felt that none of these options would provide me the degree of control and customizability I was after.
I also ruled out any "free" options, as they’d either mean having ads or paying for the service with the data of myself or that of my readers.
And to be honest, I also just fancied the prospect of solving the problem by myself, instead of relying on an off-the-shelf solution.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_why_serverless">Why Serverless?</h2>
<div>
<p>First of all, let’s discuss why I opted for a Serverless solution.
It boils down to three reasons:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Security:</em> While it’d only cost a few EUR per month to set up a VM with a cloud provider like Digital Ocean or Hetzner, having to manage a full operating system installation would require too much of my attention; I don’t want someone to mine bitcoins or doing other nasty things on a box I run, just because I failed to apply some security patch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cost:</em> Serverless does not only promise to scale-out (and let’s be honest, there likely won’t be millions of search queries on my blog every month), but also scale-to-zero.
As Serverless is pay-per-use and there are free tiers in place e.g. for AWS Lambda,
this service ideally should cost me just a few cents per month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Learning Opportunity:</em> Last but not least, this also should be a nice occasion for me to dive into the world of Serverless, by means of designing, developing and running a solution for a real-world problem, exploring how Java as my preferred programming language can be used for this task</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_solution_overview">Solution Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>The overall idea is quite simple: there’s a simple HTTP service which takes a query string,
runs the query against a Lucene index with my blog’s contents and returns the search results to the caller.
This service gets invoked via JavaScript from my static blog pages,
where results are shown to the user.</p>
<p>The Lucene search index is read-only and gets rebuilt whenever I update the blog.
It’s baked into the search service deployment package,
which that way becomes fully immutable.
This reduces complexities and the attack surface at runtime.
Surely that’s not an approach that’s viable for more dynamic use cases,
but for a blog that’s updated every few weeks, it’s perfect.
Here’s a visualization of the overall flow:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.morling.dev/images/serverless_search_overview.png" alt="Serverless Search Solution Overview">
</p>
</div>
<p>The search service is deployed as a Serverless function on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>.
One important design goal for me is to avoid lock-in to any specific cloud provider:
the solution should be portable and also be usable with container-based Serverless approaches like <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a>.</p>
<p>Relying on a Serverless architecture means its start-up time must be a matter of milli-seconds rather than seconds,
so to not have a user wait for a noticeable amount of time in case of a cold start.
While <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/building-class-data-sharing-archives-with-apache-maven/">substantial improvements</a> have been made in recent Java versions to improve start-up times,
it’s still not ideal for this kind of use case.
Therefore, the application is compiled into a native binary via <a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus</a> and <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>,
which results in a start-up time of ~30 ms on my laptop, and ~180 ms when deployed to AWS Lambda.
With that we’re in a range where a cold start won’t impact the user experience in any significant way.</p>
<p>The Lambda function is exposed to callers via the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway</a>,
which takes incoming HTTP requests, maps them to calls of the function and converts its response into an HTTP response which is sent back to the caller.</p>
<p>Now let’s dive down a bit more into the specific parts of the solution.
Overall, there are four steps involved:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_data_extraction">Data extraction:</a></em> The blog contents to be indexed must be extracted and converted into an easy-to-process data format</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_search_backend_implementation">Search backend implementation:</a></em> A small HTTP service is needed which exposes the search functionality of Apache Lucene, which in particular requires some steps to enable Lucene being used in a native GraalVM binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_wiring_things_up">Integration with the website:</a></em> The search service must be integrated into the static site on GitHub Pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_deployment_to_aws_lambda">Deployment:</a></em> Finally, the search service needs to be deployed to AWS API Gateway and Lambda</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>The first step was to obtain the contents of my blog in an easily processable format.
Instead of requiring something like a real search engine’s crawler,
I essentially only needed to have a single file in a structured format which then can be passed on to the Lucene indexer.</p>
<p>This task proved rather easy with Hugo;
by means of a <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/#output-formats-for-pages">custom output format</a> it’s straight-forward to produce a JSON file which contains the text of all my blog pages.
In my <em>config.toml</em> I declared the new output format and activate it for the homepage
(largely inspired by this <a href="https://xdeb.org/post/2017/06/11/make-hugo-generate-a-json-search-index-and-json-feed/">write-up</a>):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[outputFormats.SearchIndex]</span>
<span>mediaType</span> <span>=</span> <span>"application/json"</span>
<span>baseName</span> <span>=</span> <span>"searchindex"</span>

</div>
</div>
<p>The template in <em>layouts/_default/list.searchindex.json</em> isn’t too complex either:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>{{- $.Scratch.Add "searchindex" slice -}}
{{- range $index, $element := .Site.Pages -}}
  {{- $.Scratch.Add "searchindex" (dict "id" $index "title" $element.Title "uri" $element.Permalink "tags" $element.Params.tags "section" $element.Section "content" $element.Plain "summary" $element.Summary "publicationdate" ($element.Date.Format "Jan 2, 2006")) -}}

<h2 id="_search_backend_implementation">Search Backend Implementation</h2>
<div>
<p>My stack of choice for this kind of application is Quarkus.
As a <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-streams-guide">contributor</a>, I am of course biased, but Quarkus is ideal for the task at hand:
built and optimized from the ground up for implementing fast-starting and memory-efficient cloud-native and Serverless applications,
it makes building HTTP services, e.g. based on JAX-RS, running on GraalVM a trivial effort.</p>
<p>Now typically a Java library such as Lucene will not run in a GraalVM native binary out-of-the-box.
Things like reflection or JNI usage require specific configuration,
while other Java features like method handles are only supported partly or not at all.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_apache_lucene_in_a_graalvm_native_binary">Apache Lucene in a GraalVM Native Binary</h3>
<p>Quarkus enables a wide range of popular Java libraries to be used with GraalVM,
but at this point there’s no extension yet which would take care of Lucene.
So I set out to implement a small Quarkus extension for Lucene.
Depending on the implementation details of the library in question, this can be a more or less complex and time-consuming endeavor.
The workflow is like so:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>compile down an application using the library into a native image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>run into some sort of …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

It's all about the sales and marketing." Many of the same people will say things like, "software is easy... the hard part is marketing".</p> <p>It's generally easy to dismiss these claims. Not only is it clear that organizations such as governments and banks often spend great deal of money <em>completely</em> fail to make decent web apps, but the other half of the statement fails as well. Rand Fishin's excellent book <a href="https://sparktoro.com/book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lost &amp; Founder</a> goes into detail about just how difficult it can be for even a world-class marketer to compete with more technical rivals.</p> <p>A truer claim would be, "the hard part" is whatever isn't in the founder's skill set.</p> <h2 id="tech-is-done"><a href="#tech-is-done">#</a> Tech is done</h2> <p>One reason why many people see less value in technical talent or a "good tech stack", whatever that may mean, is the belief that tech is "done". Many people are building the same kinds of B2B SaaS web apps or consumer-focused content sites in 2020 that were being built in 2007. There absolutely are deeper technology challenges being tackled, but that's a topic for another day.</p> <p>There really <em>isn't</em> much challenging in building a Reddit clone or a Zendesk clone in 2020. Using a productive framework like Rails, Laravel or Phoenix, a mid-level full-stack dev could crank out an MVP in a day. Even without a such a framework, shipping it over a weekend wouldn't be uncommon.</p> <p>A week ago, I saw an interesting <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23923104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> from an startup-employee and entrepreneur that took the idea a step further:</p> <blockquote><p>I work in early stage product startups.</p> <p>What R&amp;D do you need? CRUD is solved, hosting is solved, UX is solved, scaling is solved, marketing is solved ...</p> <p>Everything to do with web and mobile is very solved at this point. Most problems come from tripping over ourselves and cobbling things together to fit new domains.</p> <p>All real hard R&amp;D happens inside faang these days.

"Everybody" knows how important it is to build an email list, test landing pages, talk to early customers, etc, etc, etc.</p> <p>The secret isn't locked up in a few expensive members-only communities or Silicon Valley-based startups. It's out. It's gone global.

The few that were tended to be highly credentialist.</p> <p>Now it's so cheap that founders are building on the side and keeping their jobs until reaching a replacement salary. Fundraising options have also exploded—traditional investors have multiplied, crowd funding is a force, blockchain-based models are popping up and there are even <a href="https://earnestcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some investors</a> who fund bootstrappers with no intention of <em>ever</em> building a gigantic business.</p> <p>It still doesn't hurt to have gone to Stanford, Harvard or similarly elite institution but it's far less of an uphill struggle for those who haven't in 2020 than it was in the past.</p> <h2 id="the-remaining-question"><a href="#the-remaining-question">#</a> The remaining question</h2> <p>If the skills that were an unfair advantage in the aughts are now widespread, then what <em>is</em> the edge in 2020?</p>  <h2 id=""><a href="#">#</a> <br></h2> <p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?t=%22Everything%22%20is%20done.%20&amp;u=https://questinglog.com/everything-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comment on HN</a></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al.

The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve. It was only recently <span data-cites="badia_agent57_2020">Badia et al. (2020)</span> <span data-cites="ecoffet_first_2020">Ecoffet et al.

In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output. The canonical example is translation: When producing an output word, it typically maps to one or more specific input words.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a> <span data-cites="kingma_adam_2017">Kingma and Ba (2017)</span></li> </ul> <p><strong><strong>Implementations</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/adam.html">Implementing Adam in Python</a></li> <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/optim/adam.html">PyTorch Adam implementation</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.2.0/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/adam.py#L32-L281">TensorFlow Adam implementation</a></li> </ul> <figure> <img src="https://dennybritz.com/assets/deep-learning-most-important-ideas/optimizer-benchmark.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function, such as the average classification error, using an optimizer.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GPT-3 is an amazing technology. Within a few weeks after beta API access opened, a <a href="https://twitter.com/xuenay/status/1283312640199196673" target="_blank">host of jaw-dropping demos</a> popped up, from <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" target="_blank">automatic code generation</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">automated therapy bots</a> to <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank">writing original poetry and Navy SEAL copypasta memes</a>. It does things that would have been science fiction 10 years ago.&nbsp;GPT-3 and its successor algorithms are going to change entire industries.</p><p>Naturally, tech founders and VC investors are salivating at the possibilities of turning GPT-3 applications into businesses.</p><p>But a good technology doesn’t necessarily make for a good business. <strong>The fact that GPT-3 works so well out of the box should be terrifying to founders.</strong> Here’s why:</p><ul><li>If it’s easy to make a good-enough app out of the box, the barriers to entry are mercilessly low. Dozens of competitors for your idea will spring up literally overnight, as they already have in these Twitter demos.</li><li>It’s not just about new entrants. If GPT-3 is so easy to adopt and build products with, incumbents will do it too. Thus, in Clayton Christensen’s framework, GPT-3 looks more like a <strong>sustaining innovation</strong> than a disruptive innovation. This will strengthen existing winners more than it creates openings for new startups.</li><li>If the baseline GPT-3 performance cannot be substantially improved to create a substantial (10x) proprietary edge, the competition will shift away from technology to other dimensions of competition—particularly in marketing and distribution. This is where incumbents beat startups.</li><li>Meanwhile, the profits will accrue to the true beneficiaries: 1) the algorithm owners,&nbsp; OpenAI (and, by extension, Azure), 2) to marketing platforms, particularly Google and Facebook. Both can raise pricing to the point where companies built on each are barely profitable.</li></ul><p>Let’s dive more into these ideas.</p><h2><span id="Low_Barrier_to_Entry_Fierce_Competition"><strong>Low Barrier to Entry = Fierce Competition</strong></span></h2><div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=471&amp;ssl=1 471w, https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/05/28/moats-before-gross-margins/" target="_blank">Moats provide an enduring competitive advantage</a>. The wider and deeper the moat, the higher the barrier to entry to compete with your business, and the less capably a hotshot teenager can start a new company to compete.</p><p>If a moat is shallow, hundreds of competitors can pop up overnight and provide a good-enough competing product. If you can’t build a meaningful product advantage, then the grounds of competition shift to other dimensions of competition—namely, marketing and distribution.</p><h3><strong>The Parable of Online Mattresses</strong></h3><p>The online mattress industry had shallow moats and played out predictably. A few years ago, if you wanted to start a new mattress company, you only needed to cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A manufacturer</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>At the peak of the industry, there were <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/18/there-are-now-175-online-mattress-companiesand-you-cant-tell-them-apart.html" target="_blank">175 online mattress companies</a>. None had a meaningful product advantage—many used the same mattress manufacturers. (And having personally tried several of these mattresses in stores, they really did feel about the same.)</p><p>The grounds of competition thus shifted to marketing and branding, which is why a year ago you heard so many podcast ads for Casper, Purple, and the like. When product 17 and product 130 are identical, then the only way to win is to get buyers more familiar with product 17. But <strong>when competition meets a narrow dimension of competition, profits evaporate</strong>—companies bid up marketing prices to the highest that they can endure. It became a game of chicken—how much are <em>you </em>willing to spend to acquire a customer? The best-funded startups “won” this branding battle.</p><p>But this was a short-lived victory. <strong>The ultimate result: perpetually unprofitable businesses</strong>, with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cspr/financials" target="_blank">companies spending most of their revenue on COGS and user acquisition</a>. Casper now has a market value of just $350 million, down from its peak private valuation of $1.1 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries of all this funding are:&nbsp;</p><p>1) the companies selling shovels in the gold rush, including mattress manufacturers and marketing platforms (particularly Google and Facebook)</p><p>2) customers, who enjoyed rock-bottom mattress prices subsidized by venture capital.</p><p>This situation played out in meal kit companies too, and one could argue the same is true of Uber vs Lyft and the food delivery war going on now.</p><h2><span id="Can_You_Differentiate_Yourself_with_GPT-3"><strong>Can You Differentiate Yourself with GPT-3?</strong></span></h2><p>Because GPT-3 works so well out of the box, I see this playing out a similar way. To start a new AI company, you need only cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A product built on GPT-3’s (very easy to use) API</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>As we see with Twitter demos, the products you can make off the shelf will frankly be pretty good.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the products built on GPT-3 will be identical to each other, and few will have a meaningful edge. We’ll dive more into this next.</p><h3><strong>Differentiated Technology</strong></h3><p><strong>To win a market with technology, your product needs to be <em>obviously</em> better to the user.</strong> When Google first came out, it delivered such better search results than other engines—possibly by a subjective factor of 10 or more—that there was little reason to use any competitor. When Dropbox first came out, its syncing and ease of use was unbeatable. Right now SpaceX has a rocket that can do what no other company’s can, at an unbeatable price. These companies have real technology moats.</p><p>In contrast, if an industry has products that are are more or less identical—like online mattresses—the grounds of competition shift elsewhere other than product (like marketing and distribution), and there is no technology moat.</p><p>So imagine: If 100 companies build an AI therapy bot with GPT-3, how different will their user experiences be? How far ahead will company #1 be above company #2, and then over company #10? <strong>Will there be a 10x difference? Or more like a 5% difference?</strong></p><p>I argue: <strong>The better GPT-3 works out of the box, the harder it will be for any single company to build meaningful differentiation.</strong> Frankly, <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">early demos already look very good</a>.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I thought you made a good point so I did another run being as depressive as I could. I sampled most “John” lines only once, I think I ran one twice. I’m really impressed</p><p>The prefix makes a difference but that could be automatically prepended by an end-user therapy app <a href="https://t.co/YZmQL9EXqW" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/YZmQL9EXqW</a></p></div>— Nick Cammarata (@nicklovescode) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Imagine how much better it can get with just a <em>little</em> more work—a modicum of fine tuning on therapy conversations and user safeguards. This is the new baseline, the “table stakes” for any new entrant, which is going to be relatively easy to achieve.</p><p>And then from this baseline, how much better could any one company get?</p><p>Here’s one way to think about it. The pinnacle of AI therapy would be a bot that rivals the <em>best</em> human therapist. Call this the 100% experience. The <em>average</em> human therapist might be somewhere at the 85% bar. And then a human user might be willing to tolerate a “good enough” AI performing at 70%—it’s clearly worse than a human therapist, but usable enough that it can keep up a coherent conversation and remembers that you were bullied in 5th grade.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/d-9mr1Bo8EgQaIlWnKd4EQuSrjjJuoBmjOkpcbPwJ0h9xnyIGz832tT133eTopDQZQWr2pXAJ-lS9mhaP9KBInUCnGtSqJKAtdZV-acn55hQ25c-p7bwdHgjyl-zFJ54I9Hg4aVX" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Before GPT-3, building anything </strong><strong><em>close</em></strong><strong> to the Good Enough AI was really hard.</strong> A company would have needed to invest many millions into its own algorithms and data cleanup to get anywhere close to the human user bar.&nbsp;</p><p>In this environment, the leading company had a few advantages:</p><ul><li>The barrier to entry was high, so it faced less competition.</li><li>The spread between the #1 and #3 companies was high, meaning the leading company had a sizable moat.</li><li>It still had a lot of room to grow to get to 85%+ level—this is room in which it could carve out a meaningful edge over competition.</li><li>It owned its own technology, so it could iterate to continuously improve its experience.</li></ul><p>Here’s how the landscape might have looked:</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fz675xiZWljHeS4HWUGNcrO8qbaLtjJ9zfqJNCa2HhthN84Nt7JCQpMMhC4SzO9dWfSkGpWxOwIkaz745S-XJijAd91g0JDS2A7nDXrv6ku2fckVbW5kCl-UEyZci3tRgrb4aNwl" alt=""></figure><p>(In practice, I don’t know of any <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/chatbots-reviews#7" target="_blank">pre-GPT-3 AI therapy bot</a> that comes anywhere close to a human therapist. So competitive lead notwithstanding, I don’t think there have been any good AI therapy businesses to date.)</p><p>Then comes GPT-3. <strong>Now <em>anyone</em> can produce a “good enough AI therapy bot,”</strong> with a modicum of fine-tuning and UX design. This outcome wouldn’t be shocking—people were producing <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">plausible demos</a> within days of accessing the private beta. Imagine what can be done with just a few weeks of work and $500,000 of investment.</p><p>The result: the range of competition narrows:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BiYRcsL4EKmlGKyc5gFDCCkQ_79ijr-jBknzfVb2MVuPj-Rp-D56fLeNhVnV9F46I3tWmUgzJLfV_hh5Q-oOZuR531DWJwI11JKQWgRfFt0fDDDGybrQX7yuTvAGp0TDWmem8_K5" alt=""></figure><p>Compared to the previous situation:</p><ul><li>There are many more competitors who can offer a “good enough” product.</li><li>The range of competition is compressed into a narrower band. It becomes much harder for any single product to stand out from the median product, which is already quite good.</li><li>Because the companies don’t own the core technology behind GPT-3, their ability to improve beyond the baseline performance is limited. Yes, they can fine-tune GPT-3 with their proprietary data, but how much is this going to improve on the core algorithm, which <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/openai-launches-an-api-to-commercialize-its-research/" target="_blank">cost $12 million to train</a> on 40GB of Internet text? <strong>And won’t everyone else be fine-tuning like this too?</strong></li></ul><p>Again, this really gives credit to OpenAI for how well GPT-3 works—out of the gate, you can produce a pretty usable product. But for startups, this merely <em>raises the table stakes</em> instead of offering a competitive advantage, and it <strong>neutralizes the technology edge</strong> any single company can have over another. Great for OpenAI, not great for new startups.</p><p><strong>Then imagine how much worse this will get when GPT-4 comes out. And again with GPT-5. </strong>The minimum bar of quality will keep inching up inexorably, and the range of competition will be compressed further and further.</p><p>Plus, it’s likely that <strong>any proprietary progress you make on GPT-3 will be totally wiped out by GPT-4</strong>; the same way your tweaks on GPT-2 would have been wiped out by GPT-3.</p><p>We’ve talked about AI therapy here, but this argument extends easily to automated code generation, creative writing tools, chatbots, Q&amp;A services, games, and so on.</p><h3><strong>Other Avenues of Differentiation</strong></h3><p>Yes, the algorithm isn’t everything. Products can still differentiate with their user experience, product design, customer support, adding on human services, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>But as far as AI companies typically go, this is not really the <em>hard</em> …</p></div></div>

posts</a> I will explain
the best practices that I use, so that you may be able to benefit from them. So
that writing software hopefully takes you less effort and gives you more
pleasure.</em></p><h2 id="a-creative-pursuit">A Creative Pursuit</h2><p>A decade or so ago, I had the good fortune to work with a group of extremely
smart scientists. Without going into details, their job was to conceive
algorithms for image processing, and improve them. They had huge volumes of
data, and the ability to create more. The algorithms had to be robust in the
face of all kinds of variations in that data. Much like software development,
their work was <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">a creative pursuit</a>.</p><p>They would have regular meetings to discuss progress, results and challenges. In
those meetings, I remember being surprised now and then. For example, you might
hear a conversation like this<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Betty</strong>: Say, John, didn't you have some progress on «some algorithm
feature» a few weeks ago? I'm running into some issues and I think your
findings may help me here.</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Yeah, that's right, I remember having some results when I was
working on «something else». I'm not sure which algorithm variant
I used exactly though, or which test data for that matter. If it's important
to you, we can sit together and see if we can reproduce that.</p></blockquote><p>While this was commendable in terms of team spirit, I always felt it wasteful
that apparently things had not been tracked and documented in such a way that it
was easy to recover what people had tried and done.</p><p>🤔</p><h2 id="not-a-unique-problem">Not A Unique Problem</h2><p>It turns out that software development is not that different from research in
the sense that they are both creative pursuits. Also software development
requires a good amount of trial-and-error, backtracking, rethinking, trying
again, going back to something that wasn't so stupid after all. The difference
is that we, software developers, are lazy to the point that we try to automate
just about anything that we can. So we use tools. And yes, nowadays probably
everybody understands that I'm going to say "git" (or "mercurial" or something
similar)<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. So I'm not going to explain what git is here. Plenty of
good resources out there on that topic. No, I'm going to tell you a bit about
how I use it.</p><p>🛠</p><h2 id="a-logbook-on-steroids">A Logbook On Steroids</h2><p>My version control system (e.g. git) is like a logbook. I use it to record
relevant things about my work that are not part of the code itself. For example,
in a commit message I type the reason why I'm doing things a certain way. Or I
might record that I tried something but it failed. Let's go into some details to
better explain.</p><h3 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h3><p>For any kind of writing, an important question is: who is your target audience?
Whether it's a blog post like this one, a scientific paper, a conference talk,
you always ask yourself: for whom am I writing this? For version control, the
answer is:</p><ol><li>My future self. Much like the researchers in the example above, I cannot hold
everything in my head. I forget details, I forget why I tried certain things,
I forget why other things failed. By documenting them, I can remind myself
when I need to in the near or not-so-near future.</li><li>My team. Even though I very much like pair programming, and I hope one day to
be part of a team that wants to do <a href="https://040code.github.io/2019/03/15/mob-programming">mob programming</a>, in
reality I cannot share all relevant details with the rest of my team all the
time. By documenting them, I allow my team mates to step into my shoes and
follow my reasoning.</li><li>Successors or other people who may have to work on the code when I'm not
around. Even though the average "best before" date of software is a fair
bit closer than people prefer to believe, it still happens that I write code
that others need to continue working on when I'm not available, for example
because I'm in a different department or working for a different employer.
Again, by documenting things I try to enable them to decide what pieces are
important to them and which are not.</li></ol><h3 id="tell-a-story">Tell A Story</h3><p>Well, maybe that's a bit overdoing it. My kids are going to be bored out of
their socks by these stories. But still, I do try to commit in such a way that
the sequence of all commit messages can be understood by others. They say more
than the individual commits in isolation, because the succession of commits
allows you to distill my reasoning, from where to where I'm going.</p><h3 id="record-frequently">Record Frequently</h3><p>This requires to commit frequently. "Oh but I do! I commit at least every day
before I leave the office! And sometimes even more!", you say? Well, we're
thinking of a different order of magnitude then. When I'm "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">in flow</a>" I
commit <em>many times every hour</em>. Every few minutes when I'm really on a roll. No,
of course not always. When I'm grinding on a hard problem I may have nothing to
commit for a few hours. That's ok, but it should be exceptional, not the norm.</p><p>Committing frequently also means that I make separate commits when reasonably
possible. For example, as I'm writing this blog post, I'm making a few changes
to the CSS style sheet. I could commit those as part of the blog post, or as a
separate commit. Instead, I chose to create
<a href="https://github.com/svdo/unfolded.dev/commit/3fec2de430168ad50cbdee7144b5f5f827321be4">three</a> <a href="https://github.com/svdo/unfolded.dev/commit/63c1a75a857b8c6075c9d8302535309b1857ec37">separate</a> <a href="https://github.com/svdo/unfolded.dev/commit/9fb7189a19b5d1b0f53113996d9a95259395b193">commits</a> because each
makes sense on its own, without the other two. This way I can later revert any
of the three changes by simply reverting the corresponding commit. Of course
some people find this rather extreme<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>, and that's fine. YMMV.</p><h3 id="rewrite">Rewrite</h3><p>And like any good story, this one also needs to be polished and rewritten to be
as good as it can be. I do that all the time. When I'm working on a feature, I
may for example have ten commits that form a logical whole. Then I notice
that there was a change that should have been part of one of those commits, but
I overlooked it at that time. So I make a new commit with that single thing that
I forgot, I move that new "fixup" commit to the commit where it belongs, and I
combine the two. I look at the commit messages and edit them if needed.
I reorder commits. And then, when I'm satisfied, only then I push my commits to
the remote, so that others will only see the polished version of my story.
Obviously having a great git client tremendously helps with this. I can't
recommend anything specific on Linux or Windows, but on macOS <a href="https://gitup.co/">GitUp</a> is
extraordinary in this regard: hitting "d" moves a commit down, hitting "f" does
a fixup (combine it with the commit before it), "e" edits the commit message. I
don't know of another git client that can do this so easily.</p><h3 id="record-failures">Record Failures</h3><p>One final thing to note here: don't hesitate to also record failures. Most of
the time there is more to be learned from failures than from successes. So when
rewriting my commits before pushing, I may either delete a few commits that were
failures, but sometimes I actually decide to leave them there and explain (in
the commit messages) why. Same for "reverse commit". I try something that
doesn't work but is already committed. I may then delete that last commit before
pushing, but I can also "reverse commit" it. Again, so that it may be clear that
I tried something and that it failed, so that others don't have to try
themselves as well.</p><p>📔</p><h2 id="when-to-use-it">When To Use It</h2><p>In closing, I want to say a few words about <em>when</em> I use a version control
system. The answer may surprise you, because it is: "almost always". Yesterday
and today, I was trying out a few different crypto libraries for some finite
field arithmetic that I needed to do. So I created a few small projects to
quickly try a few libraries. And for each of those, I created a git repo. Just
on my own computer, mind you. Unless I end up creating a spike that I think has
value to others, I won't create a remote for these repos. But just typing <code>git init</code> after creating a new project doesn't cost me anything. When I don't need
it anymore, I remove the project, and the embedded <code>.git</code> folder with the
history is automatically deleted as well. So why not?</p><p>Like Woody Zuill says it: "turn up the good!" If using a version control system
like git is good, turn it up. Use it more than you used to, and then more still,
and see what happens. If committing to git is good, turn it up. Commit more
frequently, and then more frequently still. Maybe you'll be surprised. I hope it
will bring you the satisfaction it has given me!</p><p>🤠</p><p>Since this is a privacy-friendly static web site, I'm not including the ability
to post comments directly here. I do love feedback though, so I created a ticket
on GitHub that you can use to leave your comments. Tell me if it's bad, tell me
if it's good, but please don't forget to tell me <em>why</em>. So please head over
there and <a href="https://github.com/svdo/unfolded.dev/issues/1">leave your comments</a>!</p>

    <p>Press Release<br>July 30, 2020</p>

<h3><strong>Google removes all Danish music from YouTube </strong></h3>
<h5>While the negotiations on a new joint Nordic agreement are in full swing, Google have chosen to leverage their total dominance in the market in the strongest way possible. On the evening of Thursday 30 July, Google announced that they will soon remove all Danish music content on YouTube.</h5>

<p>Under the auspices of the Nordic alliance of collecting societies, Polaris, negotiations on a joint Nordic agreement on the use of music on YouTube are currently in full swing. The agreement will replace the local agreements of the Norwegian, Finnish and Danish composers and songwriters’ societies, combining them in a single, joint agreement with Google. In the case of Koda, the national agreement for Denmark expired in April, after which it was temporarily extended – as is standard practice in the industry while negotiating a new agreement.</p>
<p>Now, however, Google have issued a new demand: if the agreement is to be temporarily extended, Koda must agree to reduce the payment provided to composers and songwriters for YouTube’s use of music by almost 70% – despite the fact that YouTube’s use of music has increased significantly since Koda entered into its last agreement with Google.</p>
<p>Of course, Koda cannot accept these terms, and Google have now unilaterally decided that Koda’s members cannot have their content shown on YouTube and that their fans and users on YouTube will be unable to listen to Koda members’ music until a new agreement is in place.</p>
<p>Although the parties involved in the negotiations on the new joint agreement are by no means in concord yet, progress has been made in recent weeks, and Koda is puzzled by the extremely aggressive approach taken by Google in the negotiations this time.</p>
<h5><strong>Koda’s media director, Kaare Struve, says:</strong></h5>
<p>‘Google have always taken an “our way or the highway” approach, but even for Google, this is a low point. Of course, Google know that they can create enormous frustration among our members by denying them access to YouTube – and among the many Danes who use YouTube every day. We can only suppose that by doing so, YouTube hope to be able to push through an agreement, one where they alone dictate all terms’.</p>
<p>Ever since the first agreement was signed in 2013, the level of payments received from YouTube has been significantly lower than the level of payment agreed to by subscription-based services.</p>
<h5><strong>Koda’s CEO, Gorm Arildsen, says:</strong></h5>
<p>‘It is no secret that our members have been very dissatisfied with the level of payment received for the use of their music on YouTube for many years now. And it’s no secret that we at Koda have actively advocated putting an end to the tech giants’ free-ride approach and underpayment for artistic content in connection with the EU’s new Copyright Directive. The fact that Google now demands that the payments due from them should be reduced by almost 70% in connection with a temporary contract extension seems quite bizarre’.</p>

        <p><span><span>H</span>ow to differ a bad contractor from a good partner?</span> There can be many advantages of working by the outsourced model, but also a lot of risks. Finding a good partner is difficult, but it is an ambitious and necessary task. We wrote this article to <span>differ</span> it from a bad and irresponsible contractor. What kind of mistakes do contractors make, so it`s not worth working with them?</p>
<h3><b>SIGN #1 WORK OF THE TEAM IS NOT VISIBLE</b></h3>
<p><span>The manager assured that the team was working and would show the result “in the nearest future”, and after weeks of work, it wasn`t clear what the result of the project is and whether work is underway.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>Use the Scrum project management methodology:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Carry out daily calls where show the status of the tasks</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make the result demonstration each sprint (2 weeks)</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Analyze the results of each sprint</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see not only the final result but also understand the progress along with the sprint</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see delays and problems on time and keep your finger on the pulse</span></p>
<h3><b>SIGN </b><b>#2 DOUBTFUL CODE QUALITY</b></h3>
<p><span>In a rush, programmers write low-quality code that cannot be supported. Because of this, in the future, it will be necessary to rewrite the system from scratch or it will not perform the necessary tasks and functions at all. </span><span>The system may run slowly due to poor-quality and unstructured code, so it will be extremely difficult and expensive to finalize a new module.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make and show a code quality assessment using special programs – professional tools for analysis</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Work on git-flow, where some programmers check others to avoid mistakes</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You don’t need to overpay for alterations</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get a working system that is easy to refine and scale</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Other programmers and teams can easily work with the code</span></p>
<h3><img src="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png" alt="Подрядчик в IT" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png 800w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-300x207.png 300w, https://proarea.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></h3>
<h3><b>SING #3 NO DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT</b></h3>
<p><span>The contractor simply performs the task pool, not wanting to delve into the subtleties of the project and study it. </span><span>Developers just write the code the way they understand the task.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Make a competitor analysis and study successful counterparts in the market to understand trends and delve deeply into the project</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Fix errors and improve the system along the way, playing the role of business analysts</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Developers write code, taking into account business requirements, think about creating a product that will be interesting and convenient for the user</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ The contractor isn’t just “hands” that build, but also a “head” that will find and come up with the best solution</span></p>
<h3><b>SING #4 JUST THE VISIBILITY OF WORK, MANY EXTRA MOVEMENTS</b></h3>
<p><span>The team creates the appearance of work – constantly there are new documents with a description, new work files. </span><span>The code is simply written just for fact and over time it turns out that the functions aren’t logical, inconvenient, or impossible to use. </span><span>Business doesn’t get results – a system that can be used.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Iteratively create a finished product that can be used after the first sprints</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Instead of 20 sheets of documentation, make one prototype and clearly show how the new module will work</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Don’t just write code but offer a solution for business – work functions that are needed</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get the result – a system that you can use&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Save time and money</span></p>
<h3><b>SING</b><b> #5 DON`T CARE ABOUT DESIGN</b></h3>
<p><span>Bad contractors focus only on functionality and don’t consider design as an important stage in product development and as a tool to achieve project goals. </span><span>Don’t reuse logic/components from already developed system modules. </span><span>Don’t use a design system – a unified style and approach to project design.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Follow the best solutions of modern UI/UX design with care for the user</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Don’t just develop functionality to the level of “everything works fine”, but make a big emphasis on the visual part to the level of “comfortable and beautiful”</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Use ready-made solutions and components from already completed system modules</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Use the design system and templates in the design to speed up the work and improve its quality</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Time for design and engineering is allocated as efficiently as possible</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Users get a product that looks like they want to use it all the time – all because it has a responsive, understandable, convenient, inspirational design!</span></p>

<h3><b>SING</b><b> #6 GO TO NEW FUNCTIONS WITHOUT COMPLETING PREVIOUS</b></h3>
<p><span>For your product, you have conceived many functions that are described in the specifications for the contractor. He began developing all the functions at once but didn’t complete any of them properly. Six months later, all the modules are “almost ready” but none can be used.</span></p>
<p><span>How it is needed:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Give the revised functions – correctly working modules that take into account all the scenarios. Screens are correctly displayed on all devices and all operating systems. Pages correctly show information, even if there is no data, there is no Internet or the user entered an incorrect value</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Develop all functions in stages, bringing them to the desired result – a modified functional that you can use</span></p>
<p><span>✓ Pass to the new task only after the previous one is fully completed</span></p>
<p><span>What is the benefit for you:</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You see how your product is formed – gradually, but with visible results</span></p>
<p><span>✓ You get working functions after the end of the current sprints, and not at the very end of the project when it turns out that something remains unfinished</span></p>
<p>We think you have found at least a couple of matches with the work of your current or ex contractor. Their mistakes and lack of professionalism can cost you the success of the entire project, so we advise you to carefully choose the company to which you are ready to entrust your business. We try to follow the principles described in the paragraphs “how it is needed”, taking care of you and the end-users of your product. Speaking of the importance of outsourcing, <span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/07/08/why-its-important-to-outsource-right-now/#a0dbea670e9a">Forbes wrote an excellent article</a>.</span></p>
<p>The next step after choosing a contractor will be writing a statement of work (SOW or specifications). In our article <span><a href="https://proarea.co/blog/how-to-make-correct-requirement-specifications/">“How to make correct requirement specifications”</a></span>, we have written everything you need to consider. Good luck with implementing your ambitious ideas!</p>

<li><span>overpay for work and edits;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>waste time;</span></li>
<li><span>get not at all what you want and again overpay for edits;</span></li>
<li><span>close the project due to the fact that there are no more resources for corrections.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>And in order to prevent this, it is important to write requirement specifications. In order for the team to understand specific tasks and be able to implement them so that the expectation and the final product result coincide.</span></p>
<h3><strong>THE SPECIFICATIONS` ROLE IN DIFFERENT PROJECT STAGES</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span><b> Formation of business requirements</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>This is the foundation for project implementation. At this stage goals and budgets are set. Here the requirement development begins because it determines the future product success. All further work on specifications should be based on business requirements.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span><b> MVP development</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>It’s almost impossible to build the perfect product on the first try. In any case, it will change based on the feedback of the market and users. Therefore, it is logical to start with MVP – the minimum viable product. For the development of MVP, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are as important as for the development of the main product. At this stage, the </span><span>specifications</span><span> task defines:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>basic functions and user interface needed to test a hypothesis;</span></li>
<li><span>criteria necessary for understanding the success of the implementation and launch of the first product version on the market.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>So, </span><span>specifications</span><span> at the MVP development stage describe which functions are needed and how it is necessary (minimal and sufficient) to implement in order to test the hypothesis.</span></p>

<ol start="3">
<li><span><b> Main product development</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>After the successful launch of MVP, </span><span>requirements</span><span> for the main product are finalized based on the results: a positive market reaction, as confirmation that the business model is working. That is necessary to take into account and describe in </span><span>specifications</span><span>, we wrote in detail in the 3rd section of this document. At this stage, </span><span>requirements </span><span>play a crucial role:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>take into account market features (business opportunities, necessary budgets, target audience);</span></li>
<li><span>define the project objectives;</span></li>
<li><span>demonstrate use cases;</span></li>
<li><span>captures functional, non-functional, and technical requirements so that the product is properly designed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>At this stage, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are a complete guide to action, completely describing all important points, starting from a business analysis of the market and target audience, ending with colors, fonts, and other details.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span><b> Marketing promotion</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>In good </span><span>specifications,</span><span> there is a place for market research, competitors, communication channels with potential users, and resources for promotion. Marketing promotion is the logical and necessary project support at the start and after it. If you don’t initially plan marketing activity, you probably won’t take into account the resources (in particular, the money) needed for a confident release. You run the risk of being left completely without promotion since the main resources will go to development. So, without the described marketing, you can confront a lot of problems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>lack of promotion resources;</span></li>
<li><span>lack of understanding of the market and its users;</span></li>
<li><span>failure to provide your product benefits to the audience;</span></li>
<li><span>and as a result – market failure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>At this stage, </span><span>specifications</span><span> are the answer to the question “what to do after the release?”</span></p>

<p>This article documents the thought process and steps involved in refactoring a distributed monolith to microservices. We are going to remove API GW, use Amazon Event Bridge and implement BASE consistency in the system to truly decouple our microservices.</p>



<p><em>This blog is also available as a presentation. Reach out
if you would like me to present it at an event. </em></p>



<p>I will use the codebase from the previous installment to the series that can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/general/aws-serverless-you-might-not-need-third-party-monitoring/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The first part focuses on creating the codebase and implementing AWS native observability, monitoring and alerting services. As always you can find the code that we used in the respective GitHub repositories over here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroService" target="_blank">https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroService</a>.</p>



<h2>Original System</h2>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="original system (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/general/aws-serverless-you-might-not-need-third-party-monitoring/index.html" target="_blank">original system</a> is a distributed monolith that consists of three microservices. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-1024x715.png" alt="" width="1024" height="715" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-1024x715.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-300x210.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture-768x536.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_01_SystemArchitecture.png 1111w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Original system (Click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Within each project you can find an <strong>OpenAPI </strong>(<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/rehanvdm/MicroServicePerson/blob/master/part1/src/lambda/api/api-definition.yaml" target="_blank">part2/src/lambda/api/api-definition.yaml</a>) file that defines the API definition for each service.<strong> AWS CDK</strong> is used and they all follow the similar stock standard CDK project layout: Typescript for the CDK and <strong>ES6 JS</strong> for the application code. NPM commands have been written to do deployments and it also contains<strong> end-to-end tests </strong>using Mocha and Chai. In addition, each service contains a detailed README inside the /part2 path. Note that I only have a single Lambda for the API endpoint and do internal routing. Yes, I believe in a <strong>Lambalith for the API</strong> 😊 and also prefer JSON POST over REST (more about this later). </p>



<p>A <strong>problem </strong>arises as soon as these microservices start to call one another. We will focus on the creation of a new person to demonstrate how this <strong>tight coupling</strong> is working. </p>



<p>The client service stores clients and has basic <em>create-client</em> and <em>find-client</em> functionalities as well as an endpoint to increment the person count for a specific client. The person service also has basic <em>create-person</em> and <em>find-person</em> endpoints. When a person is created, it calls the common service which notifies me by email about the new person that was added using an SNS subscription. The common service first needs to do a lookup on the client service so that it can enrich the email. It also increments the counter on the client. Click on the image below to see the step-by-step path for creating a person:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-1024x553.png" alt="" width="1024" height="553" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-1024x553.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-300x162.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus-768x415.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_02_SystemArchitecturePathFocus.png 1442w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption> <br>Original system – full create person flow (Click to enlarge) </figcaption></figure>



<p>The <em>create-person</em> call is highly dependent on the common service and does not even know that the common service is dependent on the client service. As a result, the person service is also dragged down if either the common or the client service is down. Not to mention that it now has to wait for the completion of every step in the synchronous chain. This wastes money and increases the probability of hitting the API Gateway timeout of 29 seconds.</p>



<h2>Decoupling with Amazon Event Bridge</h2>



<p>Amazon Event Bridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to work with <strong>event-driven architectures</strong>. It works on a basic <strong>publish and subscribe</strong> model. We use it to emit certain events like: <em>person-created </em>and <em>client-created.</em> Other services can then listen to only the events that they want and act on it. The new system is refactored to incorporate this and remove the direct HTTP API calls between services. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-1024x522.png" alt="" width="1024" height="522" srcset="https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-1024x522.png 1024w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-300x153.png 300w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge-768x391.png 768w, https://www.rehanvdm.com/contents/data/2020/07/refactor_dist_mon_03_EVentBridge.png 1531w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption> <br>New system (Click to enlarge)  </figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>client service</strong> has not changed much. It is still
fronted with API Gateway (GW). It now emits an event onto the bus whenever a
client is created. A new Lambda function is added that listens to the <em>create-person</em> events. This increments the person counter for that specific client.
This feature was previously on the common service but has now moved to the
client service.</p>



<p>The <strong>person service</strong> is working exactly as before. Just
like the client service, it also emits an event onto the event bus,
specifically the <em>create-person</em> event.</p>



<p>The <strong>common service</strong> no longer needs to be fronted by
API GW. Instead it listens to both the <em>create-client</em> and <em>create-person</em>
events. The common service stores the client data in its own DynamoDB table. It
uses this to look the client up within itself (locally), rather than calling an
HTTP API to get the data for a specific client. The common service still sends
an email when a new person is added. </p>



<p>From an <strong>external integration point of view</strong>, all API endpoints stayed exactly the same. The diagrams below clearly illustrate that each service is only concerned with its own data and responsibilities. The event that is emitted onto the bus is also added for convenience.</p>

<p><strong>Internally</strong> the common service has an Event Bridge Rule with the Lambda function as target. It listens to the <em>create-client</em> events and then stores only the client-id and client name fields within its own DynamoDB table. This <strong>removes the need for it to do an HTTP API call</strong> to the client service as it can now just do the lookup locally against its own data store.</p>

<p>The common service also listens to the <em>create-person</em> event. It <strong>looks up the client information in its own DynamoDB table</strong> and then sends the SNS message. <strong>At the same time</strong>, the client service also listens to the <em>create-person</em> events. It uses the client-id that comes with the event to increment the person counter for that specific client in the client service DynamoDB table. </p>

<h2>What has changed?</h2>



<p>We used Event Bridge to<strong> remove direct HTTP API calls</strong> between microservices. It also allowed us to <strong>move some logic</strong> to where it belongs. The common service should not be responsible to increment the specific client’s person counter in the first place. That functionality is now contained within the client service, where it belongs. </p>



<p>We basically borrowed two principles from the <strong>SOLID OOP principles</strong>: </p>



<ul><li>Single Responsibility – Each service is only concerned with its own core functionality.</li><li>Open Closed – Each service is now open for extension, but the core functionality is closed for modification.</li></ul>







<p>Then we introduced <strong>BASE consistency</strong> into the system: </p>



<ul><li><strong>B</strong>asic <strong>A</strong>vailability – Even if the client service is down the common service can still operate as it has a copy of the data. Thus the data layer/plane is still operational.</li><li><strong>S</strong>oft State – Stores don’t have to be write-consistent or mutually consistent all the time.</li><li><strong>E</strong>ventual Consistency – The system will become consistent over time, given that the system doesn’t receive input during that time.</li></ul>







<p>A BASE system is almost always going to be an <strong>AP system</strong> if you look at the CAP theorem. Meaning it favors <strong>A</strong>vailability and <strong>P</strong>artitioning over <strong>C</strong>onsistency. </p>

<p><strong>DynamoDB </strong>is an example of an <strong>AP system</strong> as well. Your data is stored on multiple 10GB partition drives spread over multiple Availability Zones. That replication takes a few milliseconds, up to a second or two. Obviously, there are cases where you need to read the data back directly after writing. That is why you can specify a Strongly Consistent read, which just goes back to the writer node and queries the data there instead of waiting for the data to have propagated to all nodes. </p>



<p><strong>S3 </strong>has <strong>read-after-write consistency for the PUT item</strong> command but all <strong>other commands are subject to eventual consistency.</strong> This means that after updating an item, the old content may still be returned for a short amount of time until the content of that file has propagated to all the storage nodes. There are more examples such as these all over the AWS ecosystem.</p>



<p>Event-driven architectures come with their own <strong>pros and cons</strong>. Firstly, you need to <strong>approach the problem with a different distributed mindset</strong> that needs to be present within the company/team as well. Event <strong>versioning and communication</strong> between teams that own microservices are also crucial. It is a good idea to have a service that keeps a <strong>ledger of all events that happen</strong> in the system. Worst case, this history of events can be replayed to fix any processing errors in the downstream processing. </p>



<p>Event bridge, like SNS and SQS, guarantees delivery of a message at least once. This means your <strong>system needs to be idempotent</strong>. An example of an idempotent flow is when the client is created and the common service does a PUT command into the DynamoDB table. If that event gets delivered more than once, it just overwrites the current client with the exact same data.</p>



<p>An example of a non-idempotent flow is when the person is
created. If the client service gets more than one message, it increments the
client-person counter more than once. There are ways to make this call
idempotent, but we’ll leave that for a different blog. </p>



<p>Another thing to consider is that not all systems can accept the delay that eventual consistency introduces into a system. It is perfectly acceptable in our system as a person will probably not be created immediately within one second after a client has been created. Thus, whenever the common service does the client lookup locally, it can be assured that the client data is always populated. </p>



<h2>Resilience to Failure</h2>



<p>One of the benefits that we have achieved by refactoring to a microservice system is that we are now r<strong>esilient to complete services failure</strong>. The client service can still operate if the person and common service is down. Similarly, the person service can operate on its own and is not dependent on the other services.</p>



<p>We also <strong>removed any timeout problems that was introduced</strong> by the previous architecture that synchronously chained API calls. If an Event Bridge target service (like Lambda, in our case) is down, it will retry sending the message with exponential bakeoff for up to 24 hours. </p>



<p>All Lambda functions that process the asynchronous events from Event Bridge have <strong>Dead Letter Queues</strong> (DLQ) …</p></div></div>

  <blockquote>
<p>TL;DR - These are my notes for a potential computer hobbyist personal computer architecture. Someone called it "Minix for motherboards".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This roughly describes an architecture of off the shelf microcontroller components that can be used to create a basic standalone PC, somewhere in the neighborhood of performance of an old 286/386 DOS style PC.</p>
<p>If I build this, it will almost certainly be done in Rust. I do hope to specify the protocol/operational semantics well enough that you could create a component that was written in Micro/Circuit Python, C/C++, Ada, or maybe even as an embedded linux PC.</p>
<p>I currently am working on other projects, but I feel like this would be a fun project to stream, or maybe even write a book about learning embedded systems, or learning Rust with embedded systems?</p>
<p><strong>If you'd be interested in taking a class building/using a system like this, or would be interested in seeing this happen, <a href="mailto:james.munns@ferrous-systems.com">send me a message</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to design a PC-ish architecture that makes it easy for people learning embedded systems to build a single component. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making the system resistant to failure of a single component</li>
<li>Use only protocols/components that can be easily purchased</li>
<li>Be adaptive to allow for variety of components used</li>
<li>Value simplicity over performance</li>
<li>Make the steps to initial success very short</li>
<li>Make this fun for me and other collaborators to work on</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="project-anti-goals">Project Anti-Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Designing something that is wholly useful in commercial deployments</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="interesting-ideas">Interesting Ideas</h2>
<p>These are ideas that I think will help make the project successful.</p>
<h3 id="every-component-is-a-microcontroller-any-microcontroller">Every Component is a Microcontroller - Any Microcontroller.</h3>
<p>The idea is to have every part (or <strong>Component</strong>) of the system be its own standalone microcontroller system. Honestly, this is how most computers work today anyway, but the idea is to be able to use almost any microcontroller, from 8051, to Arm Cortex-M, to RISC-V parts, for any piece of the PC. At some point, I can see people even making parts of the PC out of FPGAs as well.</p>
<p>This includes all of the following PC parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Main CPU/Processor</li>
<li>An input controller (Keyboard/Mouse/Touch)</li>
<li>A network interface (Ethernet/Wi-Fi/LPWAN)</li>
<li>A storage controller (SSD/SD/HDD/RAMFS/USB)</li>
<li>A Sound Card</li>
<li>A graphics card (framebuffer, shaders)</li>
</ul>
<p>The system should use a protocol that almost every device has support for, and is forgiving. For that reason, I plan to use SPI for system communication.</p>
<h3 id="the-bus-protocol-spi-but-weird">The Bus Protocol - SPI, but weird.</h3>
<p>So, SPI is a simple, fast, and reliable protocol, but the trick is that it is WAY easier to write a SPI Controller, rather than a SPI peripheral. Since I want things to be simplest for the people writing the Components, they should be the SPI Controllers. But this leaves us with a problem, how do we make a PC with N SPI Controllers work with a single SPI peripheral? Here is where it gets weird.</p>
<ol>
<li>Every Component is a SPI Controller, with SCK, COPI, and CIPO pins wired to a central <strong>Arbitrator</strong>.</li>
<li>Every Component also has two GPIOs:
<ul>
<li>An output that is a "Request" line. This signals to the Arbitrator that the Component would like to talk</li>
<li>An input that is a "Go-Ahead" line. This signals to the Component to begin talking to the Arbitrator</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this system, the Arbitrator will either support being a SPI Peripheral for a lot of lines, or will handle MUXing the SCK/COPI/CIPO pins as necessary.
The Arbitrator will decide which component it wants to talk to, and for how long.
When a Component pulls its Request line low, the arbitrator will eventually acknowledge this by pulling the Component's Go-Ahead line low.
The Component can begin clocking SPI data at whatever speed it feels like, up to the maximum speed supported by the Arbitrator.
When the Component is done sending/receiving data, it checks whether the Go-Ahead line is still low.
If so, then the message was "accepted" by the arbitrator.
If the Go-Ahead line is released high before the Component releases the Request line, this means that the arbitrator has "hung up" on the Component, meaning either an error or timeout has occurred.</p>
<h3 id="the-arbitrator-basically-a-northbridge-chip">The Arbitrator - Basically a Northbridge chip</h3>
<p>The Arbitrator has two primary tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arbitrating the Bus Protocol as described above, servicing and discovering components that have been connected</li>
<li>Managing memory allocations used to communicate between devices</li>
</ol>
<p>I've already described the lowest level of the protocol above - we'll use an awkward SPI communication. However I haven't described how the higher protocol layers work.</p>
<p>All devices will communicate through a mailbox system.
The arbitrator will take data from the Components, and place them in an in-memory object store.
Each created item will be assigned a UUID, which will be returned to the Component on creation.
This UUID can then be placed in a mailbox to another component, sending access to the data to that component.
Each item is read-only.</p>
<p>Example (psuedocode):</p>
<pre><span>// A binary RPC messages are sent from Component to the Arbitrator
// The format will probably be binary, but maybe with an alternative
// command to use the following REPL format?
//
// Components are also assigned a UUID on boot. This Component has
// the own-address of 9ea8b6a7-2967-4db8-98b8-d4577548ed04.

// Data can be stored to the Arbitrator memory space. Data can then be
// referenced as inter-device storage using UUIDs as a reference. Data
// is allocated on a FIFO basis, with oldest memory items becoming
// dropped.

// The arbitrator may choose to limit the rate, maximum size or other
// parameters of creating memory items based on configuration.

    "Hello, world!",

    // No UUID provided to send to another component, just return
    // the newly created UUID. If provided, this would place
    // the created UUID into the mailbox of another component

)
// The following UUID is returned to the Component on success
-&gt; Result&lt;3b2fd5d1-ae16-46af-afc1-f60241d0a5b6, CreateError&gt;

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hypervisor memory introspection (HVMI) has been around for quite some time now, and there are several open-source projects utilizing virtual-machine introspection (VMI), one way or another. Generally, existing projects focus on debugging or tracing the execution of a guest VM. In this blog post, we introduce a slightly different approach to memory introspection; live protection of guest VMs. We cover the motivation behind our HVMI engine, how it was conceived, how it evolved over time, and finally, why we made it available for everyone.</p>

<p>Throughout this blog, we assume the reader has some basic knowledge about virtualization technologies (Intel VT-x specifically) and about OS internals (both Windows and Linux), although we try to cover as much ground as possible when it comes to technical details.</p>

<h2 id="what-hvmi-is">What HVMI Is</h2>

<p>Memory introspection is the technique of analyzing the contents of a guest VM from outside. The most common way to achieve this is using a hypervisor – running guest VMs are analyzed or introspected by the hypervisor. The CPU context can be viewed, the contents of the physical memory can be observed, and so on. In addition to simply analyzing the state of the VM, the introspection logic, or HVMI (how we refer to it from here on) also leverages the virtualization features provided by the CPU to provide security.</p>

<p>For example, by using the Extended Page Table (EPT) feature provided by Intel CPUs, HVMI overrides the guest OS memory protection policies. HVMI could, for example, enforce a no-execute policy for certain memory areas, and an exploit would fail even if it compromised the OS kernel. In addition to using the EPT to enforce memory access restrictions, HVMI can also use other virtualization capabilities to offer security. It can prevent modification of certain critical resources, such as control registers or model specific registers. Rootkits or exploits that rely on modifying these will fail because HVMI blocks the modifications.</p>

<p>HVMI is not about just advantages; it does have some drawbacks. One of the most important disadvantages of HVMI is the semantic gap – from outside the VM, we see only raw physical memory, with no apparent meaning. To do something useful, we must infer what those memory pages contain. Is it a process structure, is it a stack page, etc. In addition to the semantic gap, providing protection for certain system resources may prove challenging, from a performance point of view. Many legitimate accesses made inside a page that contains a protected structure may induce a severe performance overhead; this makes choosing what structures to protect a very difficult task. Finally, implementing HVMI is often very complex since it often requires reverse-engineering chunks of OS kernel, advanced knowledge about virtualization and, of course, software engineering.</p>

<h2 id="hvmi-history">HVMI History</h2>

<p>HVMI began as a research idea almost 10 years ago (late 2011). The team initially consisted of only one researcher (yours truly), who developed the initial PoC (simple driver-object protection via EPT, to block the TDL rootkit). Once the blessing from the powers that be was received, more time and effort was invested into this research, and the team began to grow. What was initially very straightforward code capable of protecting a handful of non-paged kernel memory pages on Windows 7 grew to become a beast capable of protecting all Windows versions starting with Windows 7, several Linux distros, and, on each of these, even user-mode processes, from various types of attacks.</p>

<p>HVMI was available as a commercial product in 2017, as part of the SVE package – Security for Virtualized Environments. During this time, it was polished, performance was improved, and several new features were developed. In late 2019, we decided to open-source the technology to make it available for everyone to see, use, play with, and extend with new features and capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="how-hvmi-works">How HVMI Works</h2>

<p>In essence, HVMI requires a hypervisor that provides the required API to provide protection. The required API can be explored in the official documentation TODO ref. Once such an API is provided, HVMI places several types of hooks inside the guest. For example, it can intercept control register 3 (CR3 - the register containing the address of the page-tables used for translating linear addresses to physical addresses) – this way, HVMI intercepts context switches inside the guest. By intercepting, for example, SYSCALL MSR writes, HVMI intercepts and blocks attempts to manipulate the SYSCALL entry point address. Most importantly, it uses the EPT to alter physical memory access permissions, thus overriding and restricting access to certain areas of the guest memory.</p>

<h3 id="general-architecture">General Architecture</h3>

<p>The HVMI engine is a standalone library, self-contained (it has no explicit external dependencies), and can be run in user-mode, kernel-mode, or even VMX root-mode. It is written entirely in C, with small bits and pieces written in assembly. The HVMI engine expects an interface containing several API functions to be exposed to it by whatever integrates with it. In this context, the integrator is a tool that binds the HVMI library to a particular hypervisor which provides a uniform API.</p>

<p>Supported hypervisors include our internally built Napoca hypervisor TODO ref, and the well-known open-source hypervisors Xen and KVM. Using the Napoca hypervisor, the HVMI engine runs directly inside VMX root, alongside the HV. In Xen and KVM, the HVMI engine runs as a regular user-mode process inside a special VM (or domain), or even dom0. The general architecture of HVMI is illustrated in the following image:</p>

<p><img src="https://hvmi.github.io/blog/assets/architecture.png" alt="General HVMI architecture on Xen/KVM"></p>

<p>From a functional perspective, HVMI is an event-driven library. When introspection is enabled for a guest VM, HVMI starts by identifying the guest operating system type, version, to find various important structures inside its memory. This process is asynchronous, meaning that once the initialization function returns, there’s no guarantee that HVMI has finished initialization; some parts of the guest introspection process occur when various events take place (for example, when CR3 is written). Once introspection is enabled, HVMI kicks-in when interesting events take-place within the guest; when a process is created or terminated, when a new memory region is allocated inside a protected process, or when memory accesses take place inside a protected region.</p>

<h2 id="making-use-of-hvmi">Making Use of HVMI</h2>

<p>Although we won’t go into very deep details (yet!) regarding the internals of the HVMI engine, here’s a list of the most important features HVMI exposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The list of loaded kernel mode drivers, with load/unload events;</li>
  <li>The list of user-mode processes, with create/terminate events;</li>
  <li>For processes that are protected, the list of loaded user-mode DLLs with load/unload events, and the list of Virtual Address Descriptors for that process with alloc/free events;</li>
  <li>On Windows, access to the Page Frame Number (PFN) Database;</li>
  <li>On Windows, the ability to parse the object tree (this is currently used to search for driver-objects inside guest memory, but it can easily be extended to handle any kind of object);</li>
</ul>

<p>As for OS agnostic features HVMI provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guest hardware registers state query;</li>
  <li>Guest physical memory access;</li>
  <li>Ability to place read/write/execute hooks on physical memory;</li>
  <li>Ability to place read/write/execute hooks on virtual memory;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on control registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on model specific registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to place access hooks on descriptor table registers;</li>
  <li>Ability to intercept exceptions that take place inside the guest (for example, #PF, #BP, etc.);</li>
  <li>Ability inject exceptions inside the guest;</li>
  <li>Access to swapped out guest memory (by injecting #PF inside the guest);</li>
  <li>Ability to hide certain guest memory contents (reads issued inside the guest will be fed with custom values);</li>
  <li>Advanced instruction decoding and handling (the disassembler used by HVMI provides extended information about the decoded instructions, making information extraction and emulation very simple)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="protection-features">Protection features</h3>

<p>The primary purpose of the HVMI engine is to, above all, provide protection. The following list contains the main types of threats HVMI was built to mitigate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Binary exploits inside protected processes;</li>
  <li>Code and data injection techniques inside protected processes;</li>
  <li>Function hooks inside protected processes, on designated system DLLs;</li>
  <li>Rootkits (various techniques are blocked, such as inline hooks inside the kernel or other drivers, SSDT hooks, Driver-object hooks, system register modifications, etc.);</li>
  <li>Kernel exploits;</li>
  <li>Privilege escalation;</li>
  <li>Credentials theft;</li>
  <li>Deep process introspection (prevents process creation if the parent process has been compromised);</li>
  <li>Fileless malware (powershell command line scanning).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="start-contributing">Start Contributing</h2>

<p>We see great potential for the HVMI project, which is why we decided to open-source it and make it available to everyone. Researchers are welcome to clone the project, run it, experiment, and add new features. We also accept pull-requests – if you think your feature is cool enough, be sure to make it available on the main HVMI repo!</p>

<p>Intel is continuously developing new virtualization technologies which make HVMI better and faster. Some of these have already been released, such as the Virtualization Exception (#VE), VM Functions (VMFUNC) and Sub Page Permissions (SPP), and HVMI makes use of them. Others, such as Hypervisor Linear Address Translations (HLAT) have recently been announced, and will make it into silicon in the upcoming years. We are sure that other technologies are yet to come, showing that both hardware vendors and software developers want to invest time and effort to create new virtualization features!</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Service meshes have attracted an enormous amount of hype around them. With at least a few talks about service meshes during each tech conference, one can easily be convinced that having a service mesh in their infrastructure is a must. However, hype isn’t a good indicator of whether the new shiny tech is the right solution for your problems. So below, I’ll try to express an anti-hype opinion on service meshes to hopefully make it less confusing when you want to decide whether you may or may not need one.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/rick.png" alt="rick"></span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a lesson here, and I’m not going to be the one to figure it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
— Rick Sanchez
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_invention">The invention</h3>
<p>Let’s take a step back in history and take a look at one of the <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/envoy-7-months-later-41986c2fd443">early articles</a> about introducing Envoy at Lyft.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, almost every company with a moderately-sized service oriented architecture is having the same problems that Lyft did prior to the development and deployment of Envoy:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An architecture composed of a variety of languages, each containing a half-baked RPC library, including partial (or zero) implementations of rate limiting, circuit breaking, timeouts, retries, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differing or partial implementations of stats, logging, and ….</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>While Envoy is not a service mesh by itself, the outlined problems describe the exact reason why service meshes were invented. They add “rate limiting, circuit breaking, …” and other reliability, observability, and security features to the services by enforcing the communication to go through the service mesh proxies, a data plane. Additionally, they require a separate component, a control plane, to control the configuration.</p>
<p>However, at this point, a lot of people miss the context in which service meshes were introduced. Service meshes are able to solve the problem not because it’s impossible to solve them in any other way. There are many battle-proof RPC libraries that take on the challenges of a separate data plane layer, <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finagle">Finagle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/grpc">gRPC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/line/armeria">Armeria</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/servicetalk">Servicetalk</a>, to name a few. After all, the very first service mesh - Linkerd 1.0 <a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd">is powered by Finagle</a>. The RPC libraries will need a component which provides service discovery and configuration management to make it a true mesh. For instance, Zookeeper, or Consul, a component that service meshes call a control plane.</p>
<p>Why introduce a new concept to solve the problems that have been solved before? The service mesh concept wasn’t introduced to address problems that hadn’t been addressed before but rather address them in a way that doesn’t require any modifications to the application code, which is incredibly convenient when it’s hard to introduce an RPC layer into an existing heterogeneous microservice environment.</p>
<p>When you hear service mesh, Istio with Envoy might be the first thing that comes to mind, but it wasn’t the first service mesh to enter the market. Linkerd authors who pioneered the space, described exactly this situation in the <a href="https://linkerd.io/2017/04/25/whats-a-service-mesh-and-why-do-i-need-one/#why-is-the-service-mesh-necessary">"why is the service mesh necessary"</a>. Interestingly, in many hype-y articles on the Internet this context is often forgotten, or omitted.</p>
<p>Solving a problem well, even if it’s a problem that a lot of people have, doesn’t magically provide the tech with a lot of hype. There is always a sponsor behind it. I don’t know who the sponsor was here, and I’m going to speculate, but it’s hard to sell an RPC library in the world where open source is a fundamental requirement. There is no clear business model there, that’s why most of the mature RPC libraries were open-sourced by large tech companies for which it’s not a part of the core business model. A library is just code, not a piece of infrastructure. Service meshes are a different story. It’s an isolated non-trivial piece of infrastructure. As a vendor, not only can you provide consultancy around the configuration and deployment, but you can also sell complete hosted solutions around it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_disillusionments">Disillusionments</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve established the problems, the solution, and most importantly, the context in which the solution was made, let’s take a look at the alternatives. The most obvious one, in the spirit of KISS, is to use an RPC library for your preferred language. Here is where the context is crucial: if you have a large fleet of services, each written in its own language/ecosystem, and the only language that they share is HTTP then having a single shared RPC library is going to be hard. Perhaps, you’ve got a fabric of deployed and running services, but everyone is afraid of touching them, no one knows how they work, and each redeploy is an adventure. A service mesh is here to help you, because at least you’ll be able to roll out new infrastructure features to the mesh regularly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have a fleet of healthy services written in a single application stack, then it’s a good idea to think twice before introducing a service mesh. By simply introducing or evolving a shared RPC library, you’ll get the exact same benefits and avoid dealing with the downsides of maintaining service meshes. By studying the service mesh limitations thoroughly, you can avoid finding yourself in the trough of disillusionment.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/servicemesh/curve.png" alt="Hype Cycle"></span></p>
<div>
<h4 id="_different_ecosystem">Different ecosystem</h4>
<p>The ecosystem of the service mesh of your choice will likely be different from the ecosystem of your services. Beautiful websites always make you believe that the solution is plug’n’play, always works and never goes down. In reality, sooner or later problems, bugs, quirks in behaviour will reveal themselves, as they always do. At that point, you’ll need to have engineers who work on the service-mesh’s ecosystem which when it’s different from the main app, effectively limits the set of people who can introduce changes or fix problems. This is likely to reintroduce silos, which is against the whole DevOps spirit. Yes, having a DevOps team of engineers who are doing DevOps-y things <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/2012/10/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-devops-team/">is against DevOps</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_unnecessary_overhead">Unnecessary overhead</h4>
<p>Not only having a proxy in front of each service adds overhead (often significant, talking about <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/performance-and-scalability/">90pt</a> rather than 99pt in the performance summary <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-response-time/">doesn’t make software run faster</a>) and consumes resources, but you also requires time (or rather a team of people) to manage them. Yes, it can help to make some of the tasks potentially easier - yay, you can now add canary deployments with a few lines of YAML to simple applications now. However, you still need to manage canary deployments of the proxies themselves which don’t have a proxy in front of them. The problems just get pushed up the stack.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_limiting_your_architecture_to_what_the_proxy_supports">Limiting your architecture to what The Proxy supports.</h4>
<p>As you’re reading this paragraph, HTTP/3 is slowly being rolled out to the Internet. It uses UDP as transport. Why use UDP rather than create a completely new protocol you ask? That’s because anything but TCP and UDP is simply “blocked” by the boxes, various proxies on the internet - routers, gateways, etc. This phenomenon got named <a href="https://http3-explained.haxx.se/en/why-quic/why-ossification">ossification</a>. So, only TCP or UDP are left is the practical chose, and even UDP is partially blocked by various corporate proxies which slows down the adoption.</p>
<p>Even though your microservice environment is probably much smaller compared to the Internet, you can draw parallels with service meshes. Proxies can ossify your application architecture by limiting how your services talk to each other, and there is not much benefit in having proxies if you can bypass them. Suppose you want to build a reactive application which is using RSocket over pure tcp? Or perhaps a message-driven application using an actor model? Or maybe push the performance boundaries with Aeron? Not going to happen until the box in the middle becomes aware of the protocol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_do_i_need_one">Do I need one?</h3>
<p>What does it all mean for you as an engineer? The answer to whether you need to adopt the service mesh approach comes down to the state of the microservice environment you’re trying to improve. As we have established, compared to an RPC framework, service meshes allow you to:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deploy the infra changes more often than deploying your services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce infra changes without touching the service code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The point 1. is important when for whatever reason you can’t redeploy your services very often, e.g. maybe no one remembers how it’s done anymore, or maybe there are other restrictions. The point 2. is important when your stack is heterogeneous, e.g. some services are built in Go, some in Java, some in Haskell, etc. Where are you on the interval from a huge set of heterogeneous services with unknown deployment schedules to a set of homogenous regularly deployed services defines whether a service mesh is the best solution for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Service meshes have a lot of hype around them, and way too much in my opinion. However, before committing to a piece of technology, it’s crucial to understand the problems it solves, and the context in which the solution was made. A service mesh is not an ultimate “good practice” but simply one of the patterns to solve a set of issues, and it’s quite a heavy one.</p>
<p>Rather than jumping on board, look carefully - the last thing you want is to find out that you have invested in a solution for a problem that you don’t have. Service meshes are an amazing piece of tech solving a whole lot of problems. Not in every case, it is the best solution.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

<p>As usual, when a new blog post comes out on <a href="https://blog.golang.org/">blog.golang.org</a>, I’m all
eager to read it as soon as possible. The most recent one, <a href="https://blog.golang.org/contributors-summit">Contributors
Summit</a>, is a nice write-up on the issues that the Go
contributors have been talking about. While reading it, I stumbled upon a sentence that made me
write this post. Here is is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, it would be nice if io.Reader accepted a context so that blocking read operations
could be canceled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gave me chills. This is what <code>io.Reader</code> would look like with a context.</p>

<pre><code>type Reader interface {
        Read(ctx context.Context, p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
</code></pre>

<p>I did some research and found that some people already <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20280">proposed this
change</a> for Go 2. Thankfully it received a decent amount
of thumbs down, so it’s likely not making it.</p>

<p>This post is about all of the things that are wrong with the <code>"context"</code> package, why it is useful
 despite that, and that Go 2 should do something about it. So, grab some popcorn and let’s get
 started!</p>

<h2 id="go-is-a-general-purpose-language">Go is a general purpose language</h2>

<p>First things first, let’s establish some ground. Go is a <em>good</em> language for writing servers, but Go
is not a <em>language for writing servers</em>. Go is a <em>general purpose programming language</em>, just like
C, C++, Java or Python. For example, I’ve been using Go for about 2 years and I’ve never written a
single server in it.</p>

<p>For this reason, when designing the Go language and it’s standard library, we need to approach it
from a general purpose language perspective. Now, I’m not trying to say that context is only useful
for server people. But mostly, it is.</p>

<h2 id="context-is-like-a-virus">Context is like a virus</h2>

<p>This is the first and most important problem with context: it spreads! As mentioned in <a href="https://blog.golang.org/context">this blog
post about the context package</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At Google, we require that Go programmers pass a Context parameter as the first argument to every
function on the call path between incoming and outgoing requests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every such function also needs to propagate the context down it’s call path, or else it wouldn’t be
fully cancelable. This means that all the potentially slow functions from other libraries that are
being called from a function accepting a context should also accept a context.</p>

<p>In short, if you’re writing a library that has function which can take some significant amount of
time and your library is <em>potentially</em> going to be used by a server application, you have to accept
a context in those functions.</p>

<p>That’s how context spreads like a virus. What’s bad about that? Let’s recap:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go is a general purpose language.</li>
<li>If a library is <em>potentially</em> going to be used by a server, it should accept a context.</li>
<li>Now, everyone has to deal with the context, even the ones who don’t need it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, I can just pass <code>context.TODO()</code> everywhere, but that’s just gross, it hurts readability,
makes my code look ugly and simply removes a part of fun I have with Go.</p>

<p>If the Go language ever comes to the point where I’d have to write this</p>

<pre><code>n, err := r.Read(context.TODO(), p)
</code></pre>

<p>put a bullet in my head, please.</p>

<p>You might argue: <em>A library can provide two version of each function, one with a context and one
without a context.</em> Sure, just take a look at the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/"><code>"database/sql"</code></a> package. Although it does solve the problem
partially, it smells quite bad.</p>

<p>Also, imagine teaching Go to a student. You start explaining the context-equipped <code>io.Reader</code>
interface (or anything else which occasionally requires a context) to them and they ask: <em>What is
that <code>ctx context.Context</code> thingy there?</em> And the answer would probably just be: <em>Don’t worry about
that, just pass <code>context.TODO()</code> there for now.</em> Sounds a lot like <code>public static void</code> to me.</p>

<p>The message is: Context spreads like a virus and I (alongside almost everyone who doesn’t write
servers in Go) don’t want to deal with it when I don’t have to.</p>

<h2 id="the-context-package-itself-is-not-that-good">The <code>"context"</code> package itself is not that good</h2>

<p>The first thing is a personal opinion, but for me, the <code>context.Context</code> interface has too many
methods. Now, the more serious problems.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-use-ctx-value-in-my-non-existent-company-you-re-fired">If you use <code>ctx.Value</code> in my (non-existent) company, you’re fired</h3>

<p>I’m not sure who came up with this idea that context should carry a map of meaningless objects to
meaningless objects. There are just so many things that are wrong with it. Let’s list a few:</p>

<ol>
<li>An obvious one, it’s not statically typed at all.</li>
<li>It requires documenting which values (keys and their types) a certain function supports and uses.
As we all know, documentation is mostly a code that never runs.</li>
<li>It’s very similar to thread-local storage. We know how bad of an idea thread-local storage is.
Non-flexible, complicates usage, composition, testing.</li>
<li>This probably doesn’t happen often, but it’s prone to name collisions.</li>
<li>It’s just magic. An error-prone magic.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know that <code>ctx.Value</code> makes some things easier. But, I believe that designing your APIs without
<code>ctx.Value</code> in mind at all makes it always possible to come up with alternatives.</p>

<h3 id="context-is-mostly-an-inefficient-linked-list">Context is mostly an inefficient linked list</h3>

<p>The way <code>WithCancel</code>, <code>WithDeadline</code>, etc. constructors from the <code>"context"</code> package work is they
create a linked list. Among other things, this sometimes requires creating a
<a href="https://golang.org/src/context/context.go#L261">goroutine</a> for <code>WithCancel</code>, which propagates
cancelation signals from the previous context to the new one. Of course, if the context is never
canceled, this goroutine is leaked.</p>

<p>The <code>WithValue</code> constructor takes a context and returns a context which propagates the previous
context but also contains a value under the specified key. This is, obviously, achieved by creating
another node in the linked list, the purpose of which is to return the correct value for that key
and propagate the previous context otherwise. So, <code>ctx.Value</code> is not only a map of meaningless
objects to meaningless objects, it’s also a terribly slow map of meaningless objects to meaningless
objects.</p>

<h3 id="and-lastly">And lastly</h3>

<pre><code>ctx context.Context
</code></pre>

<p>is a lot like</p>

<pre><code>Foo foo = new Foo();
</code></pre>

<p>One of the things Go was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnDgT73v8s">created to avoid</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-the-context-package-actually-solve">What does the <code>"context"</code> package actually solve?</h2>

<p>Despite all of the bad things described above, the <code>"context"</code> package is genuinely useful, because
it solves one thing that is kinda hard to do in Go: <strong>cancelation</strong>. That’s the only problem the
<code>"context"</code> package really solves (or attempts to solve).</p>

<p>Let’s face it, cancelation in Go is hard. There is a whole talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDDwwePbDtw">‘Advanced Go Concurrency
Patterns’</a>, which discusses this problem in depth. This
talk happened before the <code>"context"</code> package was introduced into the Go standard library and thus it
discusses solutions to the cancelation problem which only involve simple channels.</p>

<p>There are number of reasons why solutions proposed in the talk don’t scale very well. Here are a few
of them:</p>

<ol>
<li>The cancelation channels are usually not accepted by other libraries and functions and thus
cancelation is only possible ‘in-between’ the slow operations.</li>
<li>Considering a ‘tree of goroutines’ (where children goroutines are the ones spawned by the parent
goroutines), it’s easy to cancel the whole tree (just close the cancelation channel), but it’s
harder to cancel a sub-tree (you need to introduce another channel for that, or some other
solution).</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>"context"</code> package does solve these problems. Inefficiently and with numerous problems, but
solves them better than anything else out there. <strong>In Go, we need to be able to solve the
cancelation problem</strong>. Solving it is usually necessary anytime a decent usage of goroutines is
involved.</p>

<h2 id="go-2-should-explicitly-address-the-cancelation-problem">Go 2 should explicitly address the cancelation problem</h2>

<p>I think it’s a weakness of the Go programming language that we needed to introduce a package like
<code>"context"</code>. Go makes it very easy to create goroutines and communicate between them. However, the
<code>"context"</code> package is a proof that Go makes it hard enough to <em>arrange goroutines to finish</em>. I
believe this problem should be solved directly in the language. The language should provide a
solution, which is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simple and elegant.</li>
<li>Optional, non-intrusive and non-infectious.</li>
<li>Robust and efficient.</li>
<li>Only solves the cancelation problem. Values can be omitted. Timeouts can also be implemented on
top of a very simple cancelation.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might argue: <em>I like context, it’s an elegant solution to the problem without changing or
complicating the language</em>. I disagree. For all the reasons described above it’s not an elegant
solution and although it’s not an integral part of the language, it is and is becoming more and more
an integral part of the libraries. In the end, it makes the language harder to use.</p>

<p>I have a few solutions in mind, but I’ll leave them for another post or a proposal, or I’ll leave
them for myself if someone comes up with a better solution. The purpose of this post is just to
point out the problem.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This post was trying to point out a problem in the Go language. In short, cancelation is a problem
in Go and the <code>"context"</code> package does not solve this problem very well. I can’t think of any other
solution that would solve this problem good except for a language change. That is up for Go 2.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I’m looking forward to your feedback and <del>hate comments</del> objections ;).</p>

If I find myself having an abstract thought in my head that it is hard to express in words, penning them down can help to solidify and refine the idea.</p> <p>In the rest of the article, I will be going through my note-taking journey, and the various techniques &amp; concepts I use to make my note-taking more effective.</p> <h2 id="active-recall-and-spaced-repetition">Active Recall and Spaced Repetition</h2> <p>When I was a student in junior college studying for ‘A’ Levels, the content we were learning were becoming more and more complex. So I started searching up study techniques to optimize my learning.</p> <p>I came across <a href="https://youtu.be/ukLnPbIffxE">Ali Abdaal’s YouTube videos</a> on <em>Active Recall</em> and <em>Spaced Repetition</em>, and these techniques stuck with me till this day. These were legitimate, scientifically backed<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> advice, in contrast to the plethora of “<em>Top 101 Study Tips</em>” listicles online that sounds good but doesn’t work.</p> <p>(Spoiler alert: Active Recall trumps other study techniques like rereading, highlighting and blindly writing notes, in terms of examination performance.)</p> <p> <strong>Active Recall</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>: <em>This involves retrieving information from your brain after learning something, typically through testing yourself. The act of recalling strengthens your ability to retain your information and solidifies the connections in our brain between different concepts.</em> <br><strong>Spaced Repetition</strong><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>: <em>The act of reviewing materials at spaced intervals. This is effective in memory retention and countering the forgetting curve.</em> </p> <p>If you ever want to learn something effectively, it is key to utilize both techniques to maximize your retention rate.</p> <h2 id="second-brain">Second Brain</h2> <p>On the never-ending quest for maximum productivity, I chanced upon an <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/">article by Forte Labs</a> that explained this conundrum I had in my head:</p> <blockquote> <p>How many brilliant ideas have you had and forgotten? How many insights have you failed to take action on? How much useful advice have you slowly forgotten as the years have passed?</p> <p>We feel a constant pressure to be learning, improving ourselves, and making progress. We spend countless hours every year reading, listening, and watching informational content. And yet, where has all that valuable knowledge gone? Where is it when we need it? Our brain can only store a few thoughts at any one time. Our brain is for <em>having</em> ideas, not storing them.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Without a little extra care to preserve these valuable resources, our precious knowledge remains siloed and scattered across dozens of different locations.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mind = Blown 🤯. This perpetual problem that has always bothered my mind (but could never find the words for it) was perfectly articulated by this excerpt.</p> <p>The article then introduced a solution: <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Building A Second Brain</a>. BASB is a methodology for “preserving your ideas, and turning them into reality”. The article explains it like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>We are constantly generating ideas. Yet, without a little extra care to preserve these valuable resources, our precious knowledge remains siloed and scattered across dozens of different locations.</p> <p>By offloading our thinking onto a “second brain,” we free our biological brain to imagine, create, and simply be present.</p> </blockquote> <p>Information overload is a plague of today’s society. Building a digital system where you can deposit all your thoughts and learnings there is quintessential for knowledge workers in this day and age.</p> <p>Another similar concept is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management">Personal Knowledge System</a>. PKM involves the bottom-up approach of <em>collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activities.</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p> <h2 id="note-taking-app-roam-research">Note-Taking App: Roam Research</h2> <p><i>(This segment talks about my favourite note-taking app, Roam Research. If you wish to skip to the next segment of the article, click <a href="#how_i_take_notes">here.</a>)</i></p> <p>In search for an appropriate medium for BASB, I discovered <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. I have been using it ever since and have never looked back.</p> <picture> <img src="https://www.ivan-ang.com/assets/roam-showcase.png" height="100%" width="100%"> <figure> <figcaption><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>'s official site.</figcaption> </figure> </picture> <h3 id="what-makes-roam-different-from-the-other-note-taking-apps">What makes Roam different from the other note-taking apps?</h3> <p>Note-taking apps typically function <strong>hierarchically</strong>.</p> <p>You create categories, and within each categories are sub-categories and within them contain notes. The problem with this is that we face the issue of deciding where to put these notes under, since they can belong to multiple categories.</p> <p>Roam Research is a note-taking application for <strong>networked thought</strong>.</p> <p>It seeks to make note-taking function more like how a brain processes information. Whenever you have an idea, your brain will create multiple associations to it. Thinking of linked concepts will help you recall that idea.</p> <p>Likewise, Roam seeks to associate notes with other notes via <em>bi-directional linking</em>, making it easier to connect your ideas. It becomes your second brain. Your notes do not just sit there idly like other note apps. Roam encourages serendipity and <em>Spaced Repetition</em> by letting you to continuously revisit past notes.</p> <p>For those tinkerers out there, you can even create your own custom CSS and JavaScript themes! (Shameless plug: check out my theme <a href="https://github.com/hiivan/CyanoRoam">CyanoRoam</a> on Github).</p> <h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3> <p>The bummer is that after their 31-days free trial, they start with a whopping $15/month and $7.50/month for students afterwards. If you are not willing to spend that much money on it, I recommend looking into other <a href="https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-alternatives">Roam alternatives</a> like <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and <a href="https://giffmex.org/experiments/stroll.experiment.html">TiddlyStroll</a>.</p> <p>(I was lucky enough to have been part of their beta program so my graph is free indefinitely 😁.)</p> <p>If you are interested to know more about how Roam Research works, you can also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpikCLhpIRY">Ali Abdaal’s video on Roam</a>.</p>  <h2 id="how-i-take-notes">How I Take Notes.</h2> <p>Personal Knowledge System/Building A Second Brain or whatever you want to call it, below are the multiple facets of how I take my notes. See and pick what works for you.</p> <h3 id="quick-capture">📸Quick Capture</h3> <p>Our brains are constantly coming up with new ideas. Sometimes, this can get very distracting and take away from what we are currently focusing on.</p> <p>A way I have come up to curb this problem is that whenever I come up with a new idea or inspiration, I will immediately <strong>capture them</strong> down on Roam.</p> <p>I keep quotes, reading highlights, podcast insights and everything you can think of. I find this very liberating as it helps to take the load off my brain so I can focus what is important presently.</p> <p>Then, at the end of the day, I can go back to review whatever I have written the entire day, and decide whether I will add them to the list of stuff to work on.</p> <h3 id="bookpodcastarticle-notes">📚Book/Podcast/Article Notes</h3> <p>This is the most obvious kind of note-taking: writing notes on stuff you read.</p> <p>Whenever I read, or other content I consume online e.g. podcasts, articles, I try my best to paraphrase and summarize every book. Especially when coming across a foreign concept that I wish to learn more on, I find it best to actively engage with the material for better learning.</p> <p>Take note <em>(pun intended)</em>: When taking notes, paraphrase and try not to refer back to the material at hand. This is the essence behind <em>Active Recall</em>.</p> <h3 id="️quantifying-my-productivity">⚖️Quantifying My Productivity</h3> <p>I subscribe to the notion of the <strong>1% Rule</strong>: if you improve yourself by 1% everyday for one year, you will end up 3800% better than where you started off a year ago. I first read this from James Clear, the author of the best-selling book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a>.</p> <picture> <img src="https://www.ivan-ang.com/assets/marginal-gains.jpg" height="85%" width="85%"> <figure> <figcaption><b>Source:</b> <a href="https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains">Marginal Gains</a> by James Clear. <br><i>"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement."</i></figcaption> </figure> </picture> <p>Of course, in reality, the metric to quantify your productivity is slightly more unclear, and you might not exactly be 38x better. But the 1% Rule proves how powerful compound interest can be and how it can do wonders to your life.</p> <p>I follow a simple system of quantifying my output to track my productivity. I have a section called <span>⏳Timeline of My Life</span>. In there, I record down the notable things that I have learnt or accomplished that day, or when I have reached a certain milestone in my life.</p> <p>This is especially useful if you wish to do <strong>weekly reviews</strong> on your personal development.</p> <p>Looking at all your past notes can give you a birds-eye view of what you have accomplished the entire week. By reviewing, you are applying <em>Spaced Repetition</em> to your learning. Occasionally looking back at the mini-achievements you have done can also do wonders to your motivation and self-esteem :P.</p> <p>I am considering using a software tool like <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> in the future to relegate this mini-project to. Maybe one day, I will reach the level of <a href="https://julian.digital/2020/02/23/my-quantified-self-setup/">julian.digital</a>.</p> <h3 id="journaling">📝Journaling</h3> <p>As mentioned in my article on journaling, I also use Roam as a tool for writing down my thoughts and reflections. You can read the article <a href="https://www.ivan-ang.com/journaling-as-a-tool-for-self-help/">here</a>, where I talk more about how I use it to manage my emotional and mental health.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>So this is a brief overview of the theories behind how I do my note-taking. I hope you have gained some insights after reading this post, and perhaps even incorporate some of these concepts into your own life.</p> <picture> <img src="https://www.ivan-ang.com/assets/my-roam-graph.png" height="95%" width="95%"> <figure> <figcaption><b>My Roam Graph:</b> An overview of how all my notes are …</figcaption></figure></picture></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al. (2013)</span> have since become a standard benchmark in Reinforcement Learning research. The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve. It was only recently <span data-cites="badia_agent57_2020">Badia et al. (2020)</span> <span data-cites="ecoffet_first_2020">Ecoffet et al.

In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output. The canonical example is translation: When producing an output word, it typically maps to one or more specific input words.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a> <span data-cites="kingma_adam_2017">Kingma and Ba (2017)</span></li> </ul> <p><strong><strong>Implementations</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/adam.html">Implementing Adam in Python</a></li> <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/optim/adam.html">PyTorch Adam implementation</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.2.0/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/adam.py#L32-L281">TensorFlow Adam implementation</a></li> </ul> <figure> <img src="https://dennybritz.com/assets/deep-learning-most-important-ideas/optimizer-benchmark.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function, such as the average classification error, using an optimizer.

        <h2 id="backstory-and-first-attempts">Backstory and first attempts</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post I’ve been working on reverse engineering the PLA chip in the C128.
I’m now mostly done with this process so I think it’s time to share some of the findings.</p>
<p>This has been a very interesting project as I did not really know much about semiconductor design
and manufacturing. My existing knowledge extended to having seen some die shots and admiring the pretty
looking pictures.</p>
<p>It all started with me buying a cheap microscope to help with soldering surface mount components.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/cheapo-microscope.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Cheap microscope">

</a>
</p>
<p>Some time later I ended up watching a video on youtube showing a simpler way of getting silicon dies out
of the packaging.</p>


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZQeHHYJYWXo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This looked simple enough to try at home as I already had all the equipment needed. Decapping an IC usually involves heated sulphuric acid or
other similar nasty chemicals which I do not really want to play with at home. So I dug out a couple of broken MOS chips I had lying around
(never throw things away, could come in handy). After fiddling around a bit I ended up with two 8521R0 dies and one 8721 PLA.
The first real photo was the one show in the last post.</p>

</a>
</p>
<h2 id="better-microscope">Better microscope</h2>
<p>While this was a success I quickly realised that this microscope did not have enough resolution for me to be able to capture images of high
enough quality. The maximum magnification is 90x, when using a 2x barlow lens. Additionally it does not have a stage so I had to place the die
on a table and then move the whole microscope, which is very unstable and makes it hard to capture the bits you want to see.</p>
<p>As such a better microscope was sourced and purchased, still within reasonable money.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/amscope-me580t.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AmScope ME580-T microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/amscope-me580t.jpg" alt="AmScope ME580-T microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>This proved to be much better at taking pictures of decent quality, I was however not happy with the camera I bought with it. It’s a cheap camera with no capability for me to manage it remotely except using the AmScope application. Around this time, the Raspberry Pi foundation
released the new High Quality camera for the Raspberry Pi. This camera has a C-mount on it which matches the microscope so I quickly bought
one and put in on the microscope. This camera is fantastic for this job, full control of the whole process from the comfort of linux.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/8521r0-detail.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Silicon die detail from 8521R0">

</a>
</p>
<p>All in all a vast improvement to the previous setup. With the higher resolution I started needing to stitch the photos together to make
larger pictures. This sounded simple at the start and ended up being (as you can probably guess) not very easy at all. I’m still struggling
with the stitching, but slowly improving. One of the key things for a successful panorama stitch is to have consistent photos when it comes
to panning, focus, white balance etc. etc. The more even the photos, the easier and better the stitching becomes.</p>
<h2 id="motorizing">Motorizing</h2>
<p>This led me to start working on motorizing the table. It was getting really tiresome having to manually move the table around and the photos
ended up being moved in multiple axis etc.</p>
<p>Lots of design work, 3D printing and research into CNC firmwares later I ended up with the following setup:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/modded-me580t.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Modified AmScope ME580-T microscope">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/modded-me580t.jpg" alt="Modified AmScope ME580-T microscope">
</a>
</p>
<p>Going from the top we have a Raspberry 7” display, with a Raspberry Pi4 mounted on the back. Not see is also the RPi HiQ camera mounted on
the microscope. The RPi takes photos, displays previews on the display and also runs the python code that controls the CNC board.</p>
<p>The stage and the levelling table is motorized with 28BYJ-48 steppers controlled using a small board with an ESP32 running <a href="https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32">Grbl_Esp32</a> and four AD4498 stepper motor controllers.</p>
<p>This whole setup has some issues both in software and hardware but it works well enough for now to enable me to do some work.</p>

<p>With the logistics now sorted out I returned to the work of reverse engineering the chip itself. My initial focus was on the PLA chip
as this should be one of the simpler ones to figure out. PLA stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_array">Programmable Logic Array</a> and is a very common structure in designs from this era.</p>
<p>Looking at the schematic diagram from wikipedia we should expect to see two main arrays, AND and OR. Inputs are connected to AND and
outputs from the OR array.</p>
<p>Going back to the previous die shot with can improve it with some annotations for the pins and the general areas of the chip. Once we
have established the pins we can see that all the inputs are connected to one array and all the outputs to the other array, just as
expected. This also helps us establish which array is which.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/pla-annotated.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Annotated die shot of 8721 PLA">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/pla-annotated.png" alt="Annotated die shot of 8721 PLA">
</a>
</p>
<p>Here we see the I/O pins marked up with how they are connected to the lead frame and the pins on the DIP itself. We can also see the two main
areas that make up a PLA structure, the AND array and the OR array. Additionally there is some extra logic at the bottom marked with a question
mark. The function of this was unknown to me but as all the output pins are passing through it I was guessing that it was an output stage of
some kind.</p>
<h2 id="and-array">AND array</h2>
<p>So, if we take a closer look at the AND matrix to start with we will see the following. The colours are a bit off as this was still done
using the AmScope camera and I didn’t figure out how to set the white balance on it.</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-metal.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix with metal layer">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-metal.jpg" alt="AND matrix with metal layer">
</a>
</p>
<p>This was not very helpful to understand what was going on as all the interesting bits are covered up by the top-most metal layer. This was
early on when I was still learning a lot so to remove the metal I took a very brute force approach. I use heavy mechanical scrubbing to
remove the metal which I also learned once I put it back in the microscope had removed everything but the substrate itself. Oops.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the details that I needed were in the diffusion embedded into the substrate:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-delayer.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix substrate">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/and-matrix-delayer.jpg" alt="AND matrix substrate">
</a>
</p>
<p>Looking closely at this image we can see little squiggly lines where a transistor is located to create a connection within the matrix.</p>
<h2 id="or-array">OR array</h2>
<p>Moving on to the OR array we see the exact same pattern. Hard to tell with the metal layer in place, though easier compared to the AND
matrix. Much easier with just the substrate and diffusion left.</p>


<h2 id="full-matrix-decode">Full matrix decode</h2>
<p>Armed with this knowledge we can now proceed with extracting the full PLA logic matrix from the images.</p>
<p>I marked all transistors in each matrix with a dot and got the following picture:</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/decoded-matrix.jpg" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="AND matrix with metal layer">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/decoded-matrix.jpg" alt="AND matrix with metal layer">
</a>
</p>
<p>All inputs are horizontal in the AND matrix, with each line having a normal and an inverted signal being fed in.
All outputs are horizontal in the OR matrix and they are connected with vertical lines called product terms.</p>
<p>By looking at the dots, we can decode the product terms by doing logic and for all vertical lines in the AND matrix, for example</p>
<pre><code>    p0 = CHAREN &amp; HIRAM &amp; BA &amp; !MS3 &amp; GAME &amp; RW &amp; AEC &amp; A12 &amp; !A13 &amp; A14 &amp; A15
</code></pre><p>For the outputs we instead look horizontal for each output and combine with or, for example</p>
<pre><code>    SDEN = p42 | p43 | p66 | p69
</code></pre><p>So now we have the entire set of logic equations. Hooray!</p>
<h2 id="output-stage">Output stage</h2>
<p>Going back to the full die picture, we now have everything but the box marked with a question mark in the output path.</p>
<p>Looking at higher resolution photos of this we can see similar structures for each output. In all cases except two the structure
is bypassed and the output from the OR matrix goes directly to the output pin. This is however not the case for the two pins <code>DWE</code> and <code>CASENB</code>.</p>
<p><code>DWE</code> is the Write Enable signal going to the main system DRAM chips, CASENB is gating the CAS signal towards the RAM. These two signals are
processed in some form using these output gate structures, so I had to reverse engineer this block.</p>


<p>After quite some time reading up on silicon chip design and manufacturing and a lot of attempts I managed to come up with a schematic
for this that makes sense. I’m not going to go into the whole process here but I will document and post it later. Here I would also like
to thank <a href="https://www.patreon.com/androSID">Frank Wolf</a> for his help, please support his project if you can!</p>

<p><a href="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/output-schematic.png" data-mediabox="gallery" data-title="Output block schematic">
    <img src="https://c128.se/posts/silicon-adventures/output-schematic.png" alt="Output block schematic">
</a>
</p>
<p>Going a bit further, the way this is used in the <code>DWE</code> and <code>CASENB</code> outputs makes it a normal D-latch. The latch enable for this also comes
for the PLA matrix in a pair of lines in the OR matrix.</p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>So as a final result we can now write down the full HDL code for the C128 PLA chip. I’m using verilog for this. Mind you this is the first
verilog I’ve ever written so it’s probably suboptimal. Using a D-latch for the output in verilog is normally seen as a bad thing, however
in this case I am doing it to replicate the logic and function of the existing chip.</p>
<p>I have validated this to the best of my knowledge, but if I’ve missed anything please let me know!</p>
<p>In difference to the C64 PLA the C128 PLA can not be replaced with just an EPROM or similar due to the presence of the output latches.</p>

<p>Apple makes the argument that developers should have to pay for the running of the App Store, but it’s not the largest developers using by  far the most App Store resources who are paying.</p>



<p>Apps by Facebook surely account for some huge percentage of all downloads on the entire App Store. Facebook pays just $99 per year for this service.</p>



<p>Google – $99 per year. Amazon – $99 per year + a special deal for video that no one else gets.  Netflix – $99 per year.</p>



<p>Funny how small developers have to pay 30/15%, and have no way to work around it, but there’s exceptions everywhere for other monopolies and mega-corporations.</p>



<p>“The only apps that are subject to a commission are those where the developer acquires a customer on an Apple device and where the features or services would be experienced and consumed on an Apple device” says Tim Cook. </p>



<p>Tim, how is it possible given todays rules for a small developer to write an app where the developer could prove that they did not “acquire the customer on an Apple device” but instead acquired them via advertising the developer had to pay for (e.g. ads on Google, or via their own website) and therefor should not pay 30%? I’d like to see the steps on how to do that.</p>



<p><em>Note to non-technical audience members: Apple is not providing some kind of amazing technical service here. If you build and distribute an app via the App Store that sells a t-shirt instead of a digital photo you don’t have to use Apple payments and you don’t pay 30%. They have just drawn a line in the sand where they want it to be.</em></p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Using Python, we want to convert words to numbers. In this challenge, we will explore how to convert a string into an integer.</p>
<p>The strings simply represent the numbers in words.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<ul><li>“one” =&gt; 1</li><li>“twenty” =&gt; 20</li><li>“two hundred forty-six” =&gt; 246</li><li>“seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen” =&gt; 783919</li></ul>
<h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
<ul><li>The minimum number is “zero” (inclusively)</li><li>The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)</li><li>The “and” in e.g. “one hundred and twenty-four” is optional, in some cases it’s present and in others, it’s not</li><li>All tested numbers are valid, you don’t need to validate them</li></ul>
<h2>Test cases</h2>
<pre title="">Test.assert_equals(parse_int('one'), 1)
Test.assert_equals(parse_int('twenty'), 20)
Test.assert_equals(parse_int('two hundred forty-six'), 246)
</pre>
<h2>The solution in Python</h2>
<pre title="">def parse_int(textnum, numwords={}):
    # create our default word-lists
    if not numwords:

      # singles
      units = [
        "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight",
        "nine", "ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen",
        "sixteen", "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen",

<li><strong>Improved build performance</strong> with smaller, faster builds</li>
<li><strong>New Svelte + TypeScript</strong> app templates</li>
<li><strong>Bug fixes, usability improvements &amp; more!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Plus, we hit some VERY exciting project milestones last month:</p>
<ul>
<li>❤️ <strong>150</strong> <a href="https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/graphs/contributors">open source contributors</a> (and growing!)</li>
<li>🏆 <strong>1000+</strong> discussions, issues, and pull requests</li>
<li>⭐️ <strong>10,000+</strong> stars on GitHub</li>
<li>👋 <strong>New companies using Snowpack:</strong> <a href="https://www.1688.com/">Alibaba</a> &amp; <a href="https://airhacks.com/">Airhacks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve been waiting for an excuse to give Snowpack a try, now is a great time to start! Try out a Create Snowpack App (CSA) template or install Snowpack into any existing project:</p>
<pre><code><br><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> --save-dev snowpack<p><br><span>yarn</span> <span>add</span> --dev snowpack</p></code></pre>
<h2 id="redesigned-plugin-api">Redesigned Plugin API</h2>
<p>Snowpack v2.7 features an major rewrite of our&nbsp;internal build pipeline to support a more reliable and expressive plugin API. New optimizations and file type builders are unlocked with the redesigned <code>load()</code>, <code>transform()</code>, <code>run()</code> and <code>optimize()</code> plugin hooks (with more on the way in future versions).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/snowpack-27-screenshot-1.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>Snowpack 2.7 is fully backwards compatible with older plugins, so you can upgrade Snowpack without worrying about version mismatches.</p>
<p>Every hook is documented in our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/plugins">Plugins Guide</a> for plugin authors. The new API is heavily inspired by <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">Rollup</a>, so we hope it already feels familiar to many of you.</p>
<h2 id="simplified-configuration">Simplified Configuration</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/snowpack-27-screenshot-3.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>Snowpack v2.0 originally introduced the concept of build <code>"scripts"</code> as a way to configure anything from file building to HTTP request proxying. Scripts were flexible, but hard to document and frustrating to debug.</p>
<p>Our internal plugin rewrite presented an opportunity to improve the developer experience while keeping the flexibility of direct CLI tooling. You can now connect third-party tooling directly into Snowpack’s build pipeline using one of two new utility plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@snowpack/plugin-build-script</code>: Use any CLI directly to build files for Snowpack.</li>
<li><code>@snowpack/plugin-run-script</code>: Run arbitrary CLI commands during dev/build.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other options like <code>mount</code>, <code>proxy</code>, and <code>alias</code> (see below) are now easier to customize as well with top-level config options that take the guesswork out of common configuration.</p>
<p>The <code>"scripts"</code> configuration format will continue to be supported in Snowpack v2, but we recommend migrating any custom scripts to <code>"plugins"</code> and plan to remove support in a future major release.</p>
<h2 id="new%3A-import-aliasing">New: Import Aliasing</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/snowpack-27-screenshot-2.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>In previous versions of Snowpack, import aliasing was hard to understand and configure (and it didn’t support all types of aliasing). Starting in Snowpack v2.7, <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#import-aliases">Import Aliases</a> gets a new top-level <code>alias</code> config so that you can define as many custom aliases as you’d like. Package import aliases are also supported.</p>
<h2 id="improved-build-performance">Improved Build Performance</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s official webpack plugin is now more powerful than ever, with new support for multi-page website bundling and better default performance settings (based on the <a href="https://web.dev/granular-chunking-nextjs/">latest research from Google</a>). Special shout out to <a href="https://github.com/mxmul">@mxmul</a> (Yelp) for leading these community contributions!</p>
<p>If you don’t use a bundler in production, you’ll still see a smaller build. That’s because Snowpack v2.7 now ships with minification on by default. We plan to keep improving the default unbundled build performance story over the next few releases, so stay tuned.</p>
<h2 id="svelte-%2B-typescript-support">Svelte + TypeScript Support</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/svelte-ts.png" alt="snowpack screenshot"></p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-and-typescript">Svelte announced official support for TypeScript</a>. We’re huge fans of both projects and couldn’t pass up the chance to test the new support out in a brand new Svelte + TypeScript app template for Snowpack.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/tree/master/packages/create-snowpack-app">Create Snowpack App</a> for a list of all of our new app templates.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you%2C-contributors!">Thank You, Contributors!</h2>
<p>Finally, Snowpack wouldn’t be possible without the <a href="https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack/graphs/contributors">150+ contributors</a> who contributed features, fixes, and documentation improvements. Thanks again for all of your help.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
            
                <article>
                    

                    <div>
                                                    <p>Web development provides opportunities to work on different kinds of projects, learn all sorts of things, and dive deeply into specific areas of interest. It makes for a rewarding career choice. But if I’m being honest, the magic of the refresh button, the code-save-refresh feedback loop of digital creation is what drove my interest in web development when I started back in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>My first projects—the ones I approached with little more than slapdash curiosity—were essential to solidifying my passion of making web things and leading me to an eventual career doing it.</p>
<p>But they were simple, half-baked ideas. They were side projects. And to this day I believe that the ability to dream up and execute a side project is the single, coolest, and funnest aspect of web dev.</p>
<p>In a way, calling them <em>side</em> projects doesn’t do them justice. I suppose most people would think of a side project as something that is, at most, secondary to your main job. But I don’t think of them as much in those terms. Sure, my job is important to me and I enjoy it and am grateful to have it. That said, in a longer-term view of things, I consider my side projects as equally important. I need to have both my job and my personal projects to feel like I have life balance; to feel fulfilled by my work.</p>
<p>Side projects are important. Unfortunately they are also notorious for going unfinished—whether by lack of time or motivation. I’m not a prolific creator by any means, but I have managed to make a thing or two (despite living with a <a href="https://www.curesma.org/about-sma/">progressive physical impairment</a> that necessitates that I peck out this article one key at a time on an <a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/writing-and-coding-with-the-macos-accessibility-keyboard/">onscreen keyboard</a>).</p>
<p>I’ll share some tips and tricks I’ve picked up along the way that helped me through the rough patches.</p>
<h2>Small things are OK (and fun!)</h2>
<p>Projects come in all shapes and sizes, and that’s cool. My personal definition of a side project can be something as small as a <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> or as big as a large website. I enjoy working on small side projects for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be completed quickly before your motivation runs dry.</li>
<li>A finished project is a success, and a series of small successes can give you the momentum you need to achieve larger ones.</li>
<li>They are good for learning, whether it’s something technical, like a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS trick</a>, or just something that serves as a proof of concept for a bigger idea.</li>
<li>They’re fun!</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’ve got an afternoon and you just want to get something accomplished, a <a href="https://blakewatson.com/space-invaders/">tiny side project</a> can be the perfect outlet.</p>
<h2>Scary things aren’t scary after you face them</h2>
<p>I often experience this phenomenon where there is one particular part of my project that, for whatever reason, I am absolutely terrified of. I will put off doing that part of the project—often going to great lengths of procrastination just to avoid facing it at all. Sometimes it’s enough to halt a project in its tracks. I think it’s related to imposter syndrome. It’s as if this one tricky thing is going to finally prove to myself that I’m not a real developer, that my goal it is too lofty to accomplish.</p>
<p>That thought process is bullshit. Even if the thing in question is difficult, it doesn’t <em>prove</em> anything. Furthermore, it’s been my experience that the thing I’m scared of turns out to be nothing whenever I finally look into it. You can’t escape learning in web dev. Once you accept the fact that you’re going to be doing some searching and some Stack Overflow-ing, you can start to move past the idea that you’re going to hit some insurmountable obstacle.</p>
<h2>The one new thing strategy</h2>
<p>Speaking of scary things, a good way to face them is one at a time. I often start projects where I’m going to use familiar tools and strategies except for <em>one new thing</em> that I want to use or learn. For example, I was scared of learning <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> for a long time. CSS is already hard enough, the thought process went, without adding all these extra rules and setup. But eventually, on some side project, I decided that this would be the project where I would finally use Sass. It was my one new thing for that project.</p>
<p>This little strategy has served me well. It allows for experimentation while building on the solid foundation that is your existing knowledge. I learned jQuery, Sass, Knockout, Vue and a whole lot of other stuff by making them my one new thing on a project.</p>
<p>Beyond a learning tool, it can also help you keep things fresh and exciting. Maybe you always use WordPress, but this time you want to use a fancy <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> thing just because. Maybe you always wanted to try a popular library, but never had a reason to move away from the one that you are most familiar with. Well now you have a reason—just to have one new thing.</p>
<h2>Git is not just for source control</h2>
<p>If you are writing code, you should probably be using some sort of source control like Git; you could even make it your one new thing!</p>
<p>But I have found another great use for Git. Well, it’s more of a side effect really. A commit in Git represents a little piece of something you created or fixed. It’s an accomplishment. And the more they accumulate, the better. If you feel your motivation seeping away, take a look at your commit history and remind yourself how far you’ve come. It’s an automatic to-done list.</p>
<p>You should commit as often as it makes sense for your project. In my experience, making small commits with relevant messages helps you stay on track by knowing what you were working on previously, what you are doing now, and giving you that feeling of progress being made.</p>
<h2>Scratching an itch</h2>
<p>A great motivator for a side project is making something for yourself. Completely original ideas are rare, but maybe no one is solving a particular  problem the way <em>you</em> want to. Most of my side projects start with this being the core motivation.</p>
<p>I didn’t like the built-in new tab page in web browsers so I made <a href="https://afinestart.me/">A Fine Start</a>. I didn’t like the dice rolling applications available for the Mac, so I made <a href="https://d20app.me/">d20</a>. I wanted a better way to maintain a digital character sheet for my D&amp;D character, so I made <a href="https://minimalcharactersheet.com/">Minimal Character Sheet</a>. I wanted to listen to and collect the best synthwave mixes on YouTube, so I made <a href="https://synthwave.live/">synthwave.live</a>.</p>
<h2>Don’t rely on memory</h2>
<p>We don’t always control when ideas strike. Even though you are working on the user login feature, your brain might suddenly come up with the perfect animation for the hero section of your homepage. When these situations happen, you need low-friction tools at your disposal to capture your thoughts before they evaporate into the ether.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the issue tracking capabilities of GitHub or the simplicity of a plain text list, you need a way to record an idea and be confident that you (or someone else if you have contributors) are going to tackle said thing in the future.</p>
<p>For me, that mostly involves keeping notes in <a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a> and keeping my todo list in <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> or <a href="https://www.taskpaper.com/">Taskpaper</a>. When I truly need low-friction and can’t be bothered to categorize or even give a title to quick note, I use <a href="https://tot.rocks/">Tot</a> as a virtual sticky note. Before Tot, I used macOS’ built-in app, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/stickies/welcome/mac">Stickies</a>, which is also great for just having a place to write something down.</p>
<p>It doesn’t really matter what tool you use as long as you have one that you <em>will</em> use. We can’t keep everything in our heads—we’re only human.</p>
<h2>Other motivators</h2>
<p>I already covered making something for yourself to “scratch an itch” but there other motivators for side projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making money. Not every side project needs to be a business. But one certainly <em>could</em> be. Even if it’s just a little bit of hobby money, it feels good when people give you cash a thing you created.</li>
<li>Portfolio / resume / self promotion. This is especially helpful if you’re just starting out in web development. No matter what skills you say you have, what education you might have, employers want to see what you can do. Side projects serve well for building out your portfolio when you don’t have as many real-world examples.</li>
<li>Making helpful things. This is related to scratching an itch, but it’s about scratching someone else’s itch. This metaphor is going in a weird direction. All I’m trying to say is that it feels good when people use something you’ve made and it helps them. It’s a pretty darn good motivator.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Time is relative</h2>
<p>You may have deadlines whether they be external or self-imposed; that’s fine. Deadlines can be a good motivator. But in my experience, putting too much pressure on yourself is a good way to snuff out a project before it gets going. What helps me is to remember that as long as progress is being made, that’s a win.</p>
<p>When you start thinking about your project and everything it entails, it can be overwhelming. But if you’ve used your tools to gather your thoughts, and if you have a to-do list of any sort, then try to focus on just a small piece. Go for a small win. Every little bit of progress gets you that much closer. And like we’ve already said, small successes can lead to big ones.</p>
<p>Figure out whatever takes the pressure off and use that. Pace yourself. Slow and steady wins the race.</p>
<h2>Just do it</h2>
<p>These are just a few of the tips and tricks that help me to stay motivated and productive when working on side projects. But even with all of these tools at my disposal, I can procrastinate and binge media with the best of them. And sometimes that’s okay. You don’t always need to be working on something.</p>
<p>But if you feel like you’re stuck or unmotivated, it might be time to rip off the band-aid and just get started already. Sometimes starting is half the battle. Use whatever productivity method (or lack thereof) you prefer and make yourself focus for at least a little bit of time on making progress on your side project. You may stumble upon a motivator, like the ones we discussed, that revives your interest.</p>
<h2>My side projects</h2>
<p>I’ll leave you with a quick note about some of my projects in case you’re interested in checking them out. Most of them can be found on my …</p></div></article></div></div>

Android Market (now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play" target="_blank">Google Play</a>) was introduced two months later, with the same cut: 70/30. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Store" target="_blank">Windows Store</a> was four years late to the party, so Microsoft decided to set bait. Developers started with a 70/30 cut, but then were upgraded to an 80/20 cut after they had reached $25,000 in sales.</p><p>In eight years, Apple experimented with <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-accessories-designs-2015-12?IR=T" target="_blank">dubious design choices</a>, the Microsoft board decided that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc4MzqBFxZE" target="_blank">Ballmer should stop dancing</a>, but app store pricing didn’t change. Yes, Apple <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/8/11880730/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview" target="_blank">introduced an 85/15 cut</a>, but only for subscriptions, and only after the first year. On the other side, Microsoft <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-wants-bigger-cut-revenue-windows-developers" target="_blank">ditched its initial discount in 2015</a> and went with the standard 70/30. Which begs the question:</p><p><i>Is 70/30 some magic ratio or just an arbitrary convention?</i></p><p>Let’s examine that. From a developer’s perspective, the app stores provide the following benefits:</p><ul><li><b>Payment processing</b>. For developers, it eliminates the pain of connecting to credit card systems and merchant accounts. For users, it reduces payment friction, making them buy more.</li><li><b>Hosting</b>. App stores do reliable hosting, even when there is a surge of traffic. No more updating servers, or waking up in the night because of a hacker intrusion or a DDoS attack.</li><li><b>Quality review</b>. Before publishing, apps need to pass an acceptance review. Developers often hate this procedure, but a marketplace without viruses or broken apps makes a user experience better. Satisfied users buy more.</li><li><b>Marketing</b>. It is hard to reach users. App stores promise that if you have a high-quality app, it will go up in the rankings and maybe end up in the featured section.</li><li><b>Platform access</b>. Apple, Google, and Microsoft invested hugely in creating a platform and devices on which you can run your apps. Maybe a part of their 30 percent cut is a fee to access their platforms?</li></ul><p>Reasons to use app stores are quite compelling, and all platforms are moving in that direction.</p><p>But, the value of listed benefits changes significantly with the <i>perceived user value of the app</i>. This dynamic is not intuitive, so let’s use two imaginary developers as an example:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i> app is a simple, casual game, made by one developer in his spare time. It costs $1.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i> app is a complex editing tool for photographers and illustrators. Made by a team of 200 people, it costs $100.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These developers’ views on the above app store benefits are quite different:</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Payment processing</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>FlappyElephant</i>: Great, I get charged only 30 cents on the dollar! Other payment collectors charge up to <a href="https://sandbox.plimus.com/pricing.shtml" target="_blank">75 cents per transaction</a>. And there is no way a customer would otherwise take out a credit card for a $1 indie game.</td><td></td><td><i>AcmeShop</i>: $30 per transaction!?

While <i>FlappyElephant’</i>s developers would pay even 50 percent, <i>AcmeShop</i>’s developers consider everything above 10 percent to be a ripoff.</p><p>There is a way to satisfy both parties: <i>progressive pricing</i>. The commission should fall as the price of the app increases, which can be implemented in many ways.</p><p>For example, this funky-looking formula:</p><p><i>Commission</i> = 22 / (9 x <i>Price</i> + 90) + 7 / 90</p><p>Has a nice property of commissions for <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=a%2F(1%2Bb)%2Bc%3D0.3,+a%2F(10%2Bb)%2Bc%3D0.2,+a%2F(100%2Bb)%2Bc%3D0.1" target="_blank">$1, $10 and $100 being round numbers</a>:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Price</b></td><td><b>Commission</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>$1</b></td><td><b>30.00%</b></td></tr><tr><td>$2</td><td>28.15%</td></tr><tr><td>$5</td><td>24.07%</td></tr><tr><td><b>$10</b></td><td><b>20.00%</b></td></tr><tr><td>$20</td><td>15.93%</td></tr><tr><td>$50</td><td>11.85%</td></tr><tr><td><b>$100</b></td><td><b>10.00%</b></td></tr><tr><td>$200</td><td>8.94%</td></tr></tbody></table><p><i>Price</i> can be either actual transaction price, or, arguably more fair, <i>cumulative user spend per app</i>. In the case of latter, after user purchases 10 times a $10 monthly subscription, cumulative user spend is $100 and the developer is given a 10% commission. Again, this is just one of progressive pricing options.</p><p>I think that makes perfect sense. I purchase many $1 apps impulsively, thanks to the app stores. But I never purchase anything above $20 without going to the Internet and researching all the alternative options. I buy an expensive app because I trust the developer, and then the app store just makes it more expensive. Not just 30 percent. App stores make it 42 percent more expensive (30/70=42.8%).</p><p>Of course, big developers like <i>AcmeShop</i> are not stupid. They have found a way to have their cake and eat it too. The solution is simple:</p><ol><li>Make your apps free.</li><li>In order to use the app, users need a separate “cloud” account.</li><li>The free account doesn’t offer much.</li><li>The free app unlocks content or features that can be purchased in the “cloud.”</li></ol><p>One by one, big developers have started implementing exactly that strategy.</p><p>For example, the Amazon Kindle iOS app doesn’t allow book purchasing:</p><p><img title="Kindle FAQ, credits: Author" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-1024x542.png" alt="ipad_kindle_faq_cropped" width="584" height="309" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-1024x542.png 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-300x159.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-768x407.png 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped-500x265.png 500w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iPad_Kindle_FAQ_Cropped.png 1617w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></p><p>Kindle’s Android app is even more blunt; it circumvents Play Store with a built-in browser (!):</p><p><img title="Android Kindle, credits: Author" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle-169x300.png" alt="android_kindle" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle-169x300.png 169w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle-576x1024.png 576w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Android_Kindle.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px"></p><p>Microsoft Office mobile is free for devices <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2900830/microsoft-office-will-be-free-for-screens-under-10-inches.html" target="_blank">smaller than 10.1 inches</a>, but larger devices need a separate <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans" target="_blank">Office 365 subscription</a>:</p><p><img title="Collaborate using microsoft word for ipad, credits: https://www.vioreliftode.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18.png" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-1024x430.png" alt="collaborate_using_microsoft_word_for_ipad_app_18" width="584" height="245" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-1024x430.png 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-300x126.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-768x323.png 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18-500x210.png 500w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Collaborate_Using_Microsoft_Word_For_iPad_app_18.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></p><p>Spotify has a slightly different system. It offers in-app purchases, but they are more expensive than purchasing a subscription on their website. Spotify even sends an email to users warning that they made a stupid decision:</p><p><img title="Spotify Premium, credits: https://scdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Attachment-1.0.jpg" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium.jpg" alt="spotify-premium" width="648" height="574" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium.jpg 648w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium-300x266.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Spotify-Premium-339x300.jpg 339w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"></p><p>Practically every music subscription service has been <a href="https://musicmachinery.com/2011/08/04/how-are-music-services-responding-to-apples-new-tos/" target="_blank">circumventing app store payments since 2011</a>.</p><p>So, congratulations, dear app store product manager. You just shot yourself in the foot. You were greedy for 30 percent and now you are getting zero percent. And users of your app store are annoyed that purchasing something requires switching to a browser. But what can you do? If you kick Kindle, Office, and Spotify off your app store, then nobody will care about your platform. So maybe big developers are right—maybe you should pay them to publish great software on your store? Like when Microsoft was paying selected developers <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-pays-big-bucks-for-windows-phone-8-apps-2013-6?IR=T" target="_blank">up to $100,000 to port their apps to Windows Phone</a>.</p><p>Mobile app stores have a problem with big developers avoiding payment systems, but desktop app stores have an even bigger problem: they are avoided altogether.</p><p>This year, the co-founder of Epic Games wrote a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/04/microsoft-monopolise-pc-games-development-epic-games-gears-of-war" target="_blank">long rant about UWP and Windows 10 Store</a>, asking for Microsoft’s guarantee (among other things) that:</p><p><i>“…users, developers, and publishers will always be free to engage in direct commerce with </i><i>each other, without Microsoft forcing everyone into its formative in-app commerce monopoly </i><i>and taking a 30% cut.”</i></p><p>But the Windows 10 Store is good compared to the Mac App Store, which is a joke. It is only useful for downloading Apple apps—in which case Apple pays a commission to itself. Even top-grossing featured apps <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/developers-keep-leaving-mac-app-store/" target="_blank">are leaving</a>, and switching to manual installation. Compare that experience to that of a mobile app store install:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>MacOS manual install</b></td><td></td><td><b>iOS</b></td></tr><tr><td><ol><li>Google for a developer webpage.</li><li>Find and download a Mac version.</li><li>Mount the downloaded DMG (double-click).</li><li>Open the mounted drive. It contains two files: an app and a shortcut to the application folder.</li><li>If you clicked the app, you just made a mistake! That is just going to run the app from the mounted drive.</li><li>Instead, <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Install_Drag_Drop.png" target="_blank">drag and drop the app</a> to the application folder (there is usually an arrow so you don’t get confused about what to drag where).</li><li>Eject the mounted drive (using the right-click menu).</li><li>Delete the DMG.</li><li>When starting the app for the first time, authorize it using a <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Security-dialog.png" target="_blank">security dialog</a>.</li></ol></td><td></td><td><ol><li>Find an app in the app store.</li><li>Tap the “Get” button.</li></ol></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Mounting drives? Dragging and dropping to a system folder? What is this, an 80s Mac with a floppy drive?!</p><p>And, in case a Mac app doesn’t have an automatic updater, for every upgrade you have to <i>repeat the exact same procedure.</i></p><p>On Windows, manual installation is a few steps simpler, and you often get a nice malware as a reward for your effort. Like the PCs of my extended family. One of them has so much malware it would be the envy of the Kaspersky Lab researchers.</p><p>Why are Mac and Windows still in the Stone Age of app distribution?</p><p>Back to the original question. I argue that a 70/30 cut is an arbitrary ratio trying to be one-size-fits-all. It fails at that because the value proposition is completely different for developers of low-price versus high-price products. And app stores fail to profit on high-price apps, because that high price is listed somewhere else.</p><p>So, we are now in a triple loss-loss-loss situation:</p><ul><li><i>Users</i> have a bad experience because purchasing or installing an app is convoluted.</li><li><i>Developers</i> have to create workarounds that create user friction.</li><li><i>App store owners</i> make zero money on high-price products.</li></ul><p>And it is all because of tech politics.</p><p>I will end with that conclusion, as I need to go and mount/unmount some drives.</p><p>UPDATE: Check the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5fj2y9/why_app_stores_need_progressive_pricing/">discussion on Reddit</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>I envy voracious book readers. They seem worldly and wise. Also, whatever is happening in their lives, theyâ€™re never completely on their own â€“ they always have their books. My mother is one of these life-long devourers of literature, for whom books are a constant companion. She recalls contracting tuberculosis as an eight-year-old girl, before there was a vaccine, and being sent to spend six months at a convalescent home in Margate, more than 100 miles from her family. â€˜Books saved me from what would have been unbearable, allowing me to escape from that bed to have adventures in other places and other lives,â€™ she says.</p><p>Avid readers often look back on their book-reading with fondness. â€˜My first memories of reading are of my late mum taking me to our local library, and both of us taking out as many books as we could carry,â€™ says Clare Reynolds, author of the Years of Reading Selfishly <a href="https://yearsofreadingselfishly.blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>. â€˜We didnâ€™t have a car so had to make sure we could manage them all on the bus.â€™</p><p>Reynoldsâ€™s passion for reading continued through adolescence and led her to study English literature at the University of Leeds, but then the demands of work and family caught up with her, and for years she found herself in what she calls the â€˜reading wildernessâ€™. Anecdotally, many of us recognise this overwhelming sense of competing demands on our time. We hanker for the space to read more. We buy the books, they pile up, but we never get round to reading them â€“ the Japanese even have a term for it, <em>tsundoku</em>.</p><p>Data back this up: a US <a href="https://blog.scribd.com/home/the-benefits-of-reading" target="_blank">survey</a> found that more than one-third of adults report a desire to read more books, with book reading second only to exercise as the most wished-for activity. Similarly, in France, 65 per cent of people aged 15 years and over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416780/wish-to-read-more-books-france/" target="_blank">said</a> they wished they read more books, rising to 77 per cent among those already reading at average levels.</p><p>If youâ€™re one of these people, opening a book might have become something to do when you havenâ€™t got anything else going on, which is almost never. Itâ€™s as if you decided at some point, likely without conscious thought, that even though you love books, book reading is effectively the least important thing in your life â€“ youâ€™ll squeeze it in, if you can. And if you are clinging to the remnants of a book reading habit, Iâ€™ll bet you save it for the end of the day, or perhaps only for when youâ€™re on holiday.</p><p>To read more books, you need to make it a higher priority, which means changing your daily habits and routines to accommodate more reading. People who are â€˜super readersâ€™ by virtue of their profession â€“ such as literary editors, agents and book award judges â€“ show us just how much reading is possible if you are willing and able to give it a high enough priority. Consider Ed Needham, former editor at magazines such as <em>FHM</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, who in 2018 launched his own magazine, <em>Strong Words</em>, which features more than 100 book reviews every month. Needham reads or listens to every one of the reviewed books. â€˜I just have to find the time, thereâ€™s no way around it,â€™ he says. â€˜I produce an issue of <em>Strong Words</em> every six weeks, and we worked out that for five of those six weeks I read the equivalent of <em>War and Peace</em> every week.â€™</p><p>When reading books is your livelihood or essential to fulfil your responsibilities, then it becomes the priority around which the rest of life must bend. You donâ€™t need to go as far as Needham, of course, but to read more books you do need to take a hard look at whether, given the value you place on books, you are providing the activity with the attention and time it deserves in your life.</p><p>â€˜Sometimes, you just need the slightest encouragement to displace something that isnâ€™t earning its keep in your routine,â€™ says Needham. â€˜I remember [the US filmmaker and writer] John Waters saying he found it really easy to read every night because he never watched television. That made me realise it is really easy to stop watching television, because I get more from books than I do from the vast majority of television programmes.â€™</p><p>When there are so many options competing for our time, itâ€™s worth reminding yourself of the unique rewards of book reading. I read the newspaper every morning and my day job involves reading countless essays and articles, but when I manage to find the time to immerse myself in a quality nonfiction book, itâ€™s a wholly different experience â€“ you can almost feel the presence of the author alongside you on a personal intellectual journey. By the end, youâ€™re somehow changed, you see the world differently. And although TV and video games of course offer escapism, thereâ€™s nothing quite like devouring the pages of a beautiful novel, sitting quietly in one place while letting words transport you to another. Screens show you whatâ€™s happening; novels, by contrast, construct those fictions within your mind, allowing you to become anyone, and go anywhere.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>It will take significant effort for you to read more books, at least at first. To succeed long-term, you need to develop new reading habits, so that reading is something you do without resorting to conscious effort and willpower. But before getting into details of how to do this, there are some preliminary steps to ease the way.</p><p>The first is to reflect on <em>why</em> you want to read more books. Benjamin Gardner is a social psychologist at Kingâ€™s College, London and an expert on the psychology of habits. His theory of habit formation begins with the need for sufficient motivation. â€˜Think about why is it exactly you want to do it? What would the benefits be? Answering these kinds of questions can make you more motivated,â€™ he says.</p><p>Thereâ€™s little doubt that you will benefit from reading more books. People who read literary fiction in particular tend to be better at reading othersâ€™ <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233378" target="_blank">emotions</a> and have greater <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-15352-001.html" target="_blank">moral sensitivity</a>, possibly due to their <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21762-4_13" target="_blank">simulation</a> of the lives of complex characters; and reading nonfiction will increase your knowledge and broaden your mind. In fact, reading books is considered a cognitive â€˜<a href="https://www.oatext.com/Cognitive-reserve-the-evolution-of-the-conceptual-framework.php#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">reserve building</a>â€™ activity that could help to protect you from Alzheimerâ€™s and related illnesses. However, also relevant here is the distinction between intrinsic motivation, which means you find reward in doing something for its own sake, and extrinsic motivation, which is when you’re motivated by the promise of some kind of external pay-off. Note that, especially when starting out, you are more likely to prevail if you choose books to read that are inherently enjoyable for you, be that because you find them entertaining, calming, moving or intellectually stimulating and fascinating. This might require some trial and error until you find a genre and/or author that matches your tastes and priorities.</p><p>James Clear, the author of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1112146/atomic-habits/9781847941831.html" target="_blank"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> (2018), agrees. He recalls the approach of the Indian-American entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant:</p><blockquote>[Ravikant] says something along the lines of â€˜Read whatever the hell you want to read in the beginningâ€™ because the real thing that youâ€™re focused on is building the habit of reading, not necessarily the knowledge. Like if you just want to read romance novels. Awesome. Read that. If you just want to read fantasy, read that. Read whatever helps you fall in love with the act of being a reader or the habit of reading. And once you fall in love with the habit, then itâ€™s easy â€¦ Now youâ€™ve got a lot of options because itâ€™s part of your life.</blockquote><p>A related point is giving yourself permission to quit books that youâ€™re not enjoying. â€˜I had spent so many years picking up books that people had told me I â€œshouldâ€� read,â€™ says Reynolds. â€˜I diligently ploughed my way through literature prize longlists and shortlists. I would try to push on until the end of every one, even when I really didnâ€™t enjoy them. Then one day, I just put a book down I didnâ€™t love, and picked up another one which I did. It was then the idea for my Reading Selfishly blog and ethos was born.â€™</p><p>â€˜A lot of people feel locked in from the start,â€™ adds Clear. â€˜But the little phrase I try to keep in mind is <em>start more books, quit most of them, read the great ones twice</em>. I think that a lot of readers would be well-served if they did that.â€™</p><p>A next preliminary step is to look at your surroundings. How easy is it for you to grab a book â€“ paper or digital â€“ and start reading? â€˜The more frictionless [a habit] is, the easier it is to pick it up,â€™ says Clear. He recommends making changes to your digital and physical environments so that reading is easy and effortless â€“ including making reading apps especially prominent on your phone, and placing books in the physical places that you most often frequent. â€˜Being around books makes it very easy to pick them up and check them out. If you want something to be a big part of your life, make it a big part of your environment.â€™ Of course, if you are prone to <em>tsundoku</em>, this is a lifestyle tip that you have already mastered â€“ just try to remember to actually pick up those books.</p><p>A final preliminary step is to consider your goals. Clear recommends having modest goals for your new reading habit initially. If you try to achieve too much, too quickly, youâ€™re more likely to fail. â€˜I would say giving yourself the permission to just read one page per day or something like that,â€™ he says. Clear calls this â€˜the two-minute ruleâ€™. By getting into the routine of just â€˜showing upâ€™, even for just 120 seconds, the new activity is more likely to become an entrenched part of your daily routine. â€˜There is a deep truth about habits in general that people overlook,â€™ Clear says, â€˜which is a habit must be established before it can be improved<em>.</em>â€™</p><p>Now, having laid the foundations for your new reading habit, then according to Gardnerâ€™s model, the next stage involves creating new â€˜action associationsâ€™, which in the context of books means …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="articleBody">
  
<p>No one likes it when you go to a web page and it automatically starts playing a video loudly. Browsers have changed their auto-play policies to let JavaScript auto-play a video only if it's inline and muted. (See posts for <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/">Safari</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes">Chrome</a>).</p>

  <img alt="Meme saying: One does not simply autoplay videos, and I will find you and I will pause you" loading="lazy" width="700" height="349" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/media-pool/meme.jpg">
</figure>
<h2>Problem: Playing a video queue</h2>
<p>This change in policy is great, but it may restrict some use cases. Say, you have created a queue of videos (or audios). You'd want the next one to play as soon as the first one finishes. Instagram/Snapchat like stories is a good example for this.</p>
<p>Normally one would implement this by listening to your video's progress and as soon as it ends, call <code>play</code> on the next video. But, if the video is not muted, it will not play according to the browser's media policy.</p>
<p>Unmuted videos can be played if they were triggered by a user action. But, when playing one video after another, asking the user to tap to play again doesn't feel like a great user experience.</p>
<h2>Reusing the media element</h2>
<p>Once a media element (<code>&lt;video&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>) has been triggered by a user action, it gets <strong>cleared</strong> by the browser for future use. i.e. Later on, some script can play the video unmuted.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the very basic solution is to create a single media element, and re-use it for every video. This, however, may not be a great user experience. Loading the next video may take time, so transitioning from one video to another will not be a smooth one.</p>
<h2>Media Pool</h2>
<p>In an ideal world where resources and browser limitations do not exist, one could load every video in memory. But it's not good practice, and some browsers (like iOS Safari) limit the number of media elements in memory.</p>
<p>So we create a <strong>Media Pool</strong>. This is similar to <em>thread pools</em> in multi-threaded languages where you allocate a thread to a task and when the task is done, the thread is released to be used by another task.</p>
<p>Applying this model to media elements, we can keep a few videos in memory for a smooth experience, and release them back to the pool when they are done playing. As new videos get queued up to play, they request a media element from the pool. The pool will provide an unused or a recycled media element.</p>
<p>In the following diagram, we have a pool of seven media elements <span>♦</span>. We keep the last video in memory, and preload the next one. So there are only 3 allocated media elements at a time. As the videos leave this three-video-window, the media element is released back into the pool.</p>

</figure>
<p>When video-3 finishes, video-4 starts playing. video-2 is outside the window so it releases the media element back into the queue. video5 gets a new element allocated from the queue.</p>

</figure>
<h2>Blessing the Media</h2>
<p>A media pool sounds like a great way to reuse video elements but we have not addressed the original problem - playing unmuted videos automatically. I discovered that Google's AMP project had the <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/1.0/media-pool.md">same problem</a> as this, and they use a term called <em><strong>blessing</strong></em> a video element.</p>
<p>When the user takes their first action to unmute a video or to start an unmuted video; in the same event handler, the media-pool will <em>unmute</em> all the videos in the pool (allocated, unallocated, and released ones). It will then mute the ones that are not active right away. By doing this, all videos have been <strong>cleared</strong> by the browser. If we use AMP's terminology, these videos have now been <em><strong>blessed</strong></em>.</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="How to bless a video" loading="lazy" width="800" height="233" src="https://shihn.ca/stuff/posts/media-pool/pool3.png">
</figure>
<p>As one video finishes, the script can now call <code>play</code> on a blessed video element to start playing it even when it's unmuted.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind when implementing a <em>blessing</em> based media pool. Firstly, one cannot invoke operations like <code>mute</code>, <code>unmute</code>, <code>play</code> on a media element if it doesn't have any media loaded. That's why the unallocated media-elements should be loaded with an empty video file. Secondly, in some browsers operations of media elements can be interrupted when invoked in a certain way, for example calling <code>load</code> after calling <code>play</code> can reject the <code>play</code> promise. The AMP project creates a queue of operations per media element. I decided to do the same in my case.</p>
<h2>Media Pool implementation</h2>
<p>I have created a small framework independent <a href="https://github.com/pshihn/media-pool">media-pool implementation</a> that you can use if you like, or feel free to look at the code to create a new one. AMP's version of media pool is <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/1.0/media-pool.js">available here</a> but it may be a bit AMP specific.</p>
<p>I have further optimized my <a href="https://github.com/pshihn/media-pool">media-pool implementation</a> so it lazy-releases a media-element; which means if the video is active again it can reuse its old media-element even though it was released. This prevents re-attaching to DOM and re-loading videos. In the case where the released media-element has been allocated to some other video player, the video player will get a new one from the pool.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>This post is personal one. It is a painful one. I adapted the reflections that I sent to Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Peter Rosseau recently. I have largely redacted names, except for public interactions or my own correspondences.</p>
<p>Everyone who is privileged enough to hold a PhD in economics should reflect on our toxic culture. Before you start, read the American Economics Association (AEA)&nbsp; <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/code-of-conduct">code of professional conduct</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-policy-harassment-discrimination">policy on harassment and discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>Students please understand that I and many others are working to make your journey better than ours. Economics is hard enough without others who demean you. I love the energy of youth; however, you need allies. We all do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I am healthy now, due to my hard work in managing my bipolar disorder and the loved ones who carry me when I struggle.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Burn it down: economics failed us.</em></strong></h2>
<p>Economics is a disgrace. The lack of diversity and inclusion degrades our knowledge and policy advice. We hurt economists from undergraduate classrooms to offices at the White House. We drive away talent; we mistreat those who stay; and we tolerate bad behavior.</p>
<p>Some experiences I share may seem innocuous. Taken together, they demonstrate a systemic problem. One economists refuse to tackle. We blame bad behavior on victims. I was blamed. We tell them to toughen up. I was and did. We say the harasser is good economist and imply the victim is not. He was supposedly better than me. He is not.</p>
<p>I chose to name the senior men economists [many redacted here], who hurt me and others. They are well-respected. You know them. By doing nothing, you allow them to hurt people. You allow them to teach bad behavior to the next generation. I did too. I blame myself and did not speak up. I am sorry, and that is why I am sharing now. I am not filing a complaint. I am sharing. After more than a decade as a macroeconomist, I am fine. You know me. It is painful to share a part of me you did not know. It is painful to revisit. I do not name names to tar and feather. I do it to make our problem concrete.</p>
<p>I mentor many people. They come to me as an ally, as someone who will listen. I do. Some conversations are happy, people looking for advice on how to be an economist. Some conversations are sad, people dealing with painful experiences in economics. Some get better. Some do not. Last year a Black woman undergrad asked me how to get from her satellite-school state university to a PhD program in economics. We talked and I gave her advice. I emailed her a few months later to see what she had decided.&nbsp; Her brother replied that his sister had killed herself. She will not be an economist. Other became economists then we drove them away. The tenure of a Native American woman economist was revoked after her men colleagues turned on her. I talk with her regularly. We talk about how she could return to academia after she is healthy again. Do you know how many Native American women are economist? Very few. Do you know how many Black economists work at the Fed? One out of 406. Economics is a disgrace.</p>
<p>The indignities are astounding. The new woman economist at the Board who was asked by the men colleagues at lunch if she “satisfied” her husband. Her husband is an economist I know well. An officer sabotaged her work . She moved to another group. He stayed. I have talked with the woman and her husband several times. Broke my heart. Her tormentor is good friends with mine. I thought it was me. It was not me. It was them and they have not stopped. I told her she would get better. I did. No one told me that in 2011 when I broke. I was told that I was not the first woman he targeted. WTF? No one told me I could report him. WTF?? Both tormentors are senior officers at the Board, instrumental to monetary policy decisions. Neither said they were sorry.</p>
<p>Or how about the Southeast Asian research assistant, who I met once? He called me hyperventilating as he told about his abusive work environment. After I hung up, I closed my door and sat in my office sobbing. Economists messed him up. I coached him on how to leave his job and find a new one. He did.</p>
<p>Finally, the woman economics major at Chicago, who went to office hours. She sat on the floor since the room was crowded. Her professor offered her a chair. She said she was fine sitting on the floor. He looked at her and said, “I see you like it on your knees; women do.” Oh yes, and he had had to apologize for telling a sexually explicit ‘joke’ in public. He continues to teach undergraduates.[If I ever cross paths with this old nasty man, I will beat the shit out of him.] Economics breaks people and it is broken. I am angry. You should be too.</p>
<p>I mainly share my experiences here. I am NOT special. Many have similar experiences, in some cases worse. I have written documents to back these incidents up. It is awful to have these records in my email inbox, my Twitter, my text messages. Do not tell me, good men are economists too. I do not care. You did not protect the victims. You did not protect me. You had to know something was wrong, and you did nothing. I spend considerable time picking up the pieces of people we break. It is not fair. It is wrong what we do.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Economics destroys its students</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We discourage undergraduates, women and men from studying economics. The <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/member-docs/final-climate-survey-results-sept-2019">AEA’s first climate survey</a> of economics clearly shows our toxic profession, especially among under-represented groups. The AEA should commission surveys of undergraduates, research assistants, pre- and postdoctoral students. Harassment begins in undergraduate classrooms and often does not stop unless you leave economics.</li>
<li>We do not nurture the next generation. Many graduate students and economists have mental health issues. <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/4/26/econ-grads-peer-support-network/">Research at Harvard</a> found notably higher rates of depression and anxiety among economics PhD students than other PhD students and the general population. Departments often do send students to campus health resources. The faculty place unrealistic expectations on the students. They are aggressive in private and in public settings. They do not mentor, even when they agree to be their advisors. Faculty suffer too. [Krueger, Weitzman, Sandholm, Farhi, rest in peace. I am so sorry.]</li>
<li>Last year, I reviewed several&nbsp;macro job market papers.&nbsp; I read their abstracts, introductions, and tables/charts. I reviewed students from MIT to India to Stockholm to Santa Barbara and everywhere in between. &nbsp;All their papers were technically impressive and they also benefited from better communication. I tried to help. It was advice not an order. They worked hard on every aspect of their research. [I apologize that my original phrasing was not appropriate. It was an honor to be a part of their journey.]&nbsp; They thanked and many said it added to the support from their professors. Some replies suggested that we could do more for our students, such as::
<ul>
<li>You are the first person who has read any part of my job market paper.</li>
<li>I finally understand my paper.</li>
<li>Our department does not teach us how to write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let me be clear, many advisors including the students&nbsp; (part and not part of my review) have support in their departments. Unfortunately some departments do teach writing. Many do. I got encouragement at Michigan. Some did not. I know too many graduates student that economists hurts. We must do better. Absolutely must. I will do better too.</li>
<li>After I saw some common issues, I wrote a <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/09/29/we-need-to-talk-more/">blog post on writing</a> for all job market candidates. It is my most read post by far. I was surprised. My advisor, Matthew Shapiro, taught me how to write research papers. Many advisors do not. Some do. I <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/12/15/joy-to-the-macro-world/">blogged each of the students revised papers</a>. I cheered &nbsp;them on during the job market. Once a woman candidate thanked me. My email came after an exhausting flyout in the middle of an exhausting week of flyouts. None of these students were my responsibility. I was a section chief, managing five economists, two early career, and three research assistants. We can all do more.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>Predators target research assistants, graduate students, and early-career economists</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Research assistants and pre-doctoral fellows are particularly vulnerable. Many are considering a career in economics; however, they do know the culture of economics. They have not chosen to navigate our aggressive norms. The explosion of pre-doctoral programs is a looming disaster. Basically, no economists who supervise these young adults have formal management training. The Board now sends every group manager and section chief to a months-long training. Training does not avoid all bad behavior. No training is much worse.</li>
<li>The Board is now recruiting research assistants from under-represented minorities. Even so, Black and Latinx research assistants vastly outnumber the economists of color. Research assistants have the least power at work. They often have bad experiences. One afternoon, a Black woman research assistant at the Board delivered forecast memos to a White officer. The officer thanked her, &nbsp;using the name of another Black woman research assistant. She corrected her. Six weeks later the officer made the same mistake. The research assistant gave up and asked one of the White research assistants to deliver memos to that officer.</li>
<li>Two research assistants, a Black Latinx woman and a Latinx man, designed the first Research Assistant Survey at the Board. I saw the first drafts, as someone who designs surveys. I could see from the start that the results would be uncomfortable. The discomfort of economists should not outweigh, but often does, the discomfort they cause. One striking finding: research assistants were reluctant to offer critical feedback because they were worried that as a result, they would not get a good recommendation for graduate school. Power dynamics are real and early career scholars do not have power. I was in the meeting where they presented the results to the officers and section chiefs. Not surprisingly, the men in the room tried to explain the uncomfortable findings away. It …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>If you want to free yourself from the past so you can fully move forward into the future, discuss your fears and insecurities with the world.</p>



<p>Or at least with a friend.</p>



<p>Growing comfortable expressing yourself with vulnerability, with full authenticity, will open an entire world of possibility that you never thought imaginable.</p>



<p>The idea is that when you express the fears and insecurities you have held onto for so long, it almost acts as a release valve in your mind. No longer will you have pent up pain, anger, or frustration. No longer will you feel trapped in certain aspects of your life. No longer will you be fearful of being a fully authentic version of yourself. Like an accident on the highway, you have to clean up the roadways in your mind before the traffic of your thoughts can resume moving smoothly.</p>



<p>What I’m going to tell you today is the greatest piece of truth you will ever need to hear. I know this for a fact, because it has helped me in recent weeks clear my own mental traffic jam. While I have no doubt the thoughts in this post will set you free, if acted upon, it will also serve as a catalyst for you to help set others free as well.</p>



<h3><strong>Where is the danger?</strong></h3>



<p>For 29 years, I have kept hidden from the world a <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/08/01/growing-up-with-two-mentally-ill-parents/">very painful, very <em>real</em> part of my life</a>. In recent weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time in the deep end of the vulnerability pool, breaking down the walls in my own mind about the “dangers” of publishing an essay on this most profound aspect of my life.</p>



<p>Only recently have I begun to discuss it outwardly with people besides my family. It’s something I’ve held so close to the vest for so long that I haven’t talked about it even with my closest friends. But <em>why is that</em>? What is it in my mind that has kept me quiet for so long? Is it fear? Is it pride? Is it some sort of perceived danger?</p>

<p>To illustrate how difficult it has been to get three decades of pent up feelings into one essay, I’ll tell you a little about my writing process. Normally when writing an essay, I can pump out 2,000 words in just a few hours. The thoughts come to me like a surging river. But for my upcoming essay, the vulnerability and deep personal aspects of the topic made it excruciatingly difficult to put words into coherent sentences. Thoughts came to be with the scarcity of searching for water in a dried-up riverbed.</p>



<p>After almost three weeks, patching together maybe 200 words per day, I finally have a piece of writing ready to publish this coming Saturday. But the experience made me think a lot about the subtle, unconscious forces at play when addressing such an ingrained pain point. These forces can be a result of our minds perceiving danger, whether real or not, and can reveal themselves in difficulty communicating, difficulty expressing emotions, and could even lead to serious cognitive consequences if not dealt with appropriately.</p>



<p>For me, I believe that sitting down to directly address this pain point, day after day, has required me to focus on two primary factors that could be slowing me down, and hampering me in other areas of my life: lack of self-compassion, and my irrational fear of vulnerability.</p>



<h3><strong>Self-Compassion</strong></h3>



<p>When I interact with people, I typically treat them with respect and do my best to understand them in a deeper way. I give them the benefit of the doubt. If they’re having a hard time with an aspect of their life, I try my best to help them up. If they are feeling down about what they are doing, how they look or how they come across to others, I do my best to encourage them. <em>So why don’t I act with the same sympathy and compassion towards myself?</em></p>



<p>While watching a recent video of myself discussing the difficulties of self-expression on personal matters, I had a realization. Not a realization regarding my confrontation with fear. Not a realization regarding anything I am doing, writing, or building. But a realization so sharp, so piercing, so powerful, and so simple: “I need to give myself a break.”</p>



<p>What I mean is that I need to stop being so hard on myself. I need to have more compassion for myself. When I watch myself on video, I tend to think “my voice sounds weird,” or “I look strange.” I would never say that to someone else, so why do I say it to myself?! At every turn, it has become a habit to talk down to myself, talk myself out of things, and tell myself I’m not good enough. Where I see ugliness in myself, others see beauty. When I see imperfection in what I’m doing, others see perfection in my efforts. Where I see negativity in my mind, others see positivity.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, I’ve taken a step back. As an observer of myself, I have begun to understand that most often, I am the one limiting myself. I am the one not giving myself a chance. And it’s only when I can push through with self-compassion and self-belief that I can make an impact in this world.</p>



<p>By “giving myself a break,” I will allow myself freedom of expression with no limits. It is certainly not an overnight process, but limiting negative self-talk has allowed me the freedom to simply <em>take action</em>.</p>



<h3><strong>Offsetting fear</strong></h3>



<p>When you hold something in from the world for almost three decades, there is an accumulation of things that only serve to constrain the way your mind works. These unconscious mental blocks, these fears, and these insecurities build up and calcify in your mind, clogging up its natural flow.</p>



<p>What results are deep, subconscious insecurities and fears that the conscious brain isn’t always able to control. Left unchecked, your unconscious brain begins irrationally making up stories as to why you cannot or should not do something. And without challenging those stories, you begin to believe them, leading to inaction.</p>



<p>Our brains are evolved from those of our ancient ancestors, who were always on the lookout for tigers and lions waiting to eat them. We have grown acutely aware of possible danger in every area of our lives. On one hand this has allowed us to survive and thrive on earth. On the other hand, because we no longer live in such an environment, our brains still operate in survival mode even if it is only putting words on paper or hitting “publish” when it’s time to share them with the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this problem, I’ve been exploring the method of “fear-setting.” This is a simple, 20-minute process that, once done, can show you that the danger you perceive in writing vulnerably or in public speaking isn’t actually going to kill you like a tiger in the Savanna.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of believing everything you think, apply the following questions when facing doubt or a fear-inducing situation:</p>



<ul><li>What’s the worst that can happen? What’s so bad about that?<ul><li>So what?…So what?…So what?</li><li>What does that mean about you?</li><li>What’s so bad about that?</li><li>So what?…So what?…So what?</li></ul></li><li>How can you stop those things from happening?</li><li>If the worst happens, how do you repair it?</li><li>What’s the cost of inaction?</li><li>What are the benefits of action?</li><li>Is there proof from your past that you can, in fact, take the above steps?</li></ul>



<p>Confronting the irrational fear of vulnerability in such a direct way is like unclogging a toilet after many years. Forgive my language, but the moment you decide to confront your fears, all that <em>shit</em> built up in your mind will eventually clear.</p>



<h3><strong>Setting myself free</strong></h3>



<p>While this may have seemed like just a stream-of-consciousness rumination on my own difficulties with vulnerability, I want this to serve as an example of how you can approach your own irrational fears of vulnerability.</p>



<p>Realize that telling your story–your unique perspective, is something people <em>want</em> you to do. They want to hear an honest, authentic version of you—not the perpetuation of a façade. When people see your scars and your scrapes and your imperfections, they instantly resonate with you. In putting your truth out there, others become comfortable in being open with theirs.</p>



<p>So when I hit publish on Saturday morning, telling my story to the world, it will be the most significant, most meaningful milestone—more than anything I’ve done or accomplished in my entire life. I say that because it will have set me free from my heaviest mental burden, in a way that no achievement or bullet-point on a resume could.</p>



<p>I will be free to be the most complete version of myself. Because if I can destroy the walls of the self-imposed box I’ve been living in for 29 years, if I can somehow become comfortable and open with the deepest pain in my life, then there is nothing in this world that will stop me from achieving what I’ve been put on this earth to do.</p>



<p>In the perceived “danger” of expressing your innermost feelings and insecurities, realize that it is actually immense power.</p>



<p>In vulnerability there is fear, undoubtedly.</p>



<p>But in expressing that vulnerability, there is magnificent freedom.</p>



<p>If you want to free yourself from the past so you can fully move forward into the future, discuss your fears and insecurities with the world.</p>



<p>Or at least with a friend.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GPT-3 is an amazing technology. Within a few weeks after beta API access opened, a <a href="https://twitter.com/xuenay/status/1283312640199196673" target="_blank">host of jaw-dropping demos</a> popped up, from <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" target="_blank">automatic code generation</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">automated therapy bots</a> to <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank">writing original poetry and Navy SEAL copypasta memes</a>. It does things that would have been science fiction 10 years ago.&nbsp;GPT-3 and its successor algorithms are going to change entire industries.</p><p>Naturally, tech founders and VC investors are salivating at the possibilities of turning GPT-3 applications into businesses.</p><p>But a good technology doesn’t necessarily make for a good business. <strong>The fact that GPT-3 works so well out of the box should be terrifying to founders.</strong> Here’s why:</p><ul><li>If it’s easy to make a good-enough app out of the box, the barriers to entry are mercilessly low. Dozens of competitors for your idea will spring up literally overnight, as they already have in these Twitter demos.</li><li>It’s not just about new entrants. If GPT-3 is so easy to adopt and build products with, incumbents will do it too. Thus, in Clayton Christensen’s framework, GPT-3 looks more like a <strong>sustaining innovation</strong> than a disruptive innovation. This will strengthen existing winners more than it creates openings for new startups.</li><li>If the baseline GPT-3 performance cannot be substantially improved to create a substantial (10x) proprietary edge, the competition will shift away from technology to other dimensions of competition—particularly in marketing and distribution. This is where incumbents beat startups.</li><li>Meanwhile, the profits will accrue to the true beneficiaries: 1) the algorithm owners,&nbsp; OpenAI (and, by extension, Azure), 2) to marketing platforms, particularly Google and Facebook. Both can raise pricing to the point where companies built on each are barely profitable.</li></ul><p>Let’s dive more into these ideas.</p><h2><span id="Low_Barrier_to_Entry_Fierce_Competition"><strong>Low Barrier to Entry = Fierce Competition</strong></span></h2><div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?w=471&amp;ssl=1 471w, https://i1.wp.com/www.allencheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/05/28/moats-before-gross-margins/" target="_blank">Moats provide an enduring competitive advantage</a>. The wider and deeper the moat, the higher the barrier to entry to compete with your business, and the less capably a hotshot teenager can start a new company to compete.</p><p>If a moat is shallow, hundreds of competitors can pop up overnight and provide a good-enough competing product. If you can’t build a meaningful product advantage, then the grounds of competition shift to other dimensions of competition—namely, marketing and distribution.</p><h3><strong>The Parable of Online Mattresses</strong></h3><p>The online mattress industry had shallow moats and played out predictably. A few years ago, if you wanted to start a new mattress company, you only needed to cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A manufacturer</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>At the peak of the industry, there were <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/18/there-are-now-175-online-mattress-companiesand-you-cant-tell-them-apart.html" target="_blank">175 online mattress companies</a>. None had a meaningful product advantage—many used the same mattress manufacturers. (And having personally tried several of these mattresses in stores, they really did feel about the same.)</p><p>The grounds of competition thus shifted to marketing and branding, which is why a year ago you heard so many podcast ads for Casper, Purple, and the like. When product 17 and product 130 are identical, then the only way to win is to get buyers more familiar with product 17. But <strong>when competition meets a narrow dimension of competition, profits evaporate</strong>—companies bid up marketing prices to the highest that they can endure. It became a game of chicken—how much are <em>you </em>willing to spend to acquire a customer? The best-funded startups “won” this branding battle.</p><p>But this was a short-lived victory. <strong>The ultimate result: perpetually unprofitable businesses</strong>, with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cspr/financials" target="_blank">companies spending most of their revenue on COGS and user acquisition</a>. Casper now has a market value of just $350 million, down from its peak private valuation of $1.1 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries of all this funding are:&nbsp;</p><p>1) the companies selling shovels in the gold rush, including mattress manufacturers and marketing platforms (particularly Google and Facebook)</p><p>2) customers, who enjoyed rock-bottom mattress prices subsidized by venture capital.</p><p>This situation played out in meal kit companies too, and one could argue the same is true of Uber vs Lyft and the food delivery war going on now.</p><h2><span id="Can_You_Differentiate_Yourself_with_GPT-3"><strong>Can You Differentiate Yourself with GPT-3?</strong></span></h2><p>Because GPT-3 works so well out of the box, I see this playing out a similar way. To start a new AI company, you need only cobble together a few components:</p><ul><li>A product built on GPT-3’s (very easy to use) API</li><li>A website</li><li>A marketing campaign</li></ul><p>As we see with Twitter demos, the products you can make off the shelf will frankly be pretty good.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the products built on GPT-3 will be identical to each other, and few will have a meaningful edge. We’ll dive more into this next.</p><h3><strong>Differentiated Technology</strong></h3><p><strong>To win a market with technology, your product needs to be <em>obviously</em> better to the user.</strong> When Google first came out, it delivered such better search results than other engines—possibly by a subjective factor of 10 or more—that there was little reason to use any competitor. When Dropbox first came out, its syncing and ease of use was unbeatable. Right now SpaceX has a rocket that can do what no other company’s can, at an unbeatable price. These companies have real technology moats.</p><p>In contrast, if an industry has products that are are more or less identical—like online mattresses—the grounds of competition shift elsewhere other than product (like marketing and distribution), and there is no technology moat.</p><p>So imagine: If 100 companies build an AI therapy bot with GPT-3, how different will their user experiences be? How far ahead will company #1 be above company #2, and then over company #10? <strong>Will there be a 10x difference? Or more like a 5% difference?</strong></p><p>I argue: <strong>The better GPT-3 works out of the box, the harder it will be for any single company to build meaningful differentiation.</strong> Frankly, <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">early demos already look very good</a>.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I thought you made a good point so I did another run being as depressive as I could. I sampled most “John” lines only once, I think I ran one twice. I’m really impressed</p><p>The prefix makes a difference but that could be automatically prepended by an end-user therapy app <a href="https://t.co/YZmQL9EXqW" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/YZmQL9EXqW</a></p></div>— Nick Cammarata (@nicklovescode) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Imagine how much better it can get with just a <em>little</em> more work—a modicum of fine tuning on therapy conversations and user safeguards. This is the new baseline, the “table stakes” for any new entrant, which is going to be relatively easy to achieve.</p><p>And then from this baseline, how much better could any one company get?</p><p>Here’s one way to think about it. The pinnacle of AI therapy would be a bot that rivals the <em>best</em> human therapist. Call this the 100% experience. The <em>average</em> human therapist might be somewhere at the 85% bar. And then a human user might be willing to tolerate a “good enough” AI performing at 70%—it’s clearly worse than a human therapist, but usable enough that it can keep up a coherent conversation and remembers that you were bullied in 5th grade.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/d-9mr1Bo8EgQaIlWnKd4EQuSrjjJuoBmjOkpcbPwJ0h9xnyIGz832tT133eTopDQZQWr2pXAJ-lS9mhaP9KBInUCnGtSqJKAtdZV-acn55hQ25c-p7bwdHgjyl-zFJ54I9Hg4aVX" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Before GPT-3, building anything </strong><strong><em>close</em></strong><strong> to the Good Enough AI was really hard.</strong> A company would have needed to invest many millions into its own algorithms and data cleanup to get anywhere close to the human user bar.&nbsp;</p><p>In this environment, the leading company had a few advantages:</p><ul><li>The barrier to entry was high, so it faced less competition.</li><li>The spread between the #1 and #3 companies was high, meaning the leading company had a sizable moat.</li><li>It still had a lot of room to grow to get to 85%+ level—this is room in which it could carve out a meaningful edge over competition.</li><li>It owned its own technology, so it could iterate to continuously improve its experience.</li></ul><p>Here’s how the landscape might have looked:</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fz675xiZWljHeS4HWUGNcrO8qbaLtjJ9zfqJNCa2HhthN84Nt7JCQpMMhC4SzO9dWfSkGpWxOwIkaz745S-XJijAd91g0JDS2A7nDXrv6ku2fckVbW5kCl-UEyZci3tRgrb4aNwl" alt=""></figure><p>(In practice, I don’t know of any <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/chatbots-reviews#7" target="_blank">pre-GPT-3 AI therapy bot</a> that comes anywhere close to a human therapist. So competitive lead notwithstanding, I don’t think there have been any good AI therapy businesses to date.)</p><p>Then comes GPT-3. <strong>Now <em>anyone</em> can produce a “good enough AI therapy bot,”</strong> with a modicum of fine-tuning and UX design. This outcome wouldn’t be shocking—people were producing <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1283326066338062337" target="_blank">plausible demos</a> within days of accessing the private beta. Imagine what can be done with just a few weeks of work and $500,000 of investment.</p><p>The result: the range of competition narrows:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BiYRcsL4EKmlGKyc5gFDCCkQ_79ijr-jBknzfVb2MVuPj-Rp-D56fLeNhVnV9F46I3tWmUgzJLfV_hh5Q-oOZuR531DWJwI11JKQWgRfFt0fDDDGybrQX7yuTvAGp0TDWmem8_K5" alt=""></figure><p>Compared to the previous situation:</p><ul><li>There are many more competitors who can offer a “good enough” product.</li><li>The range of competition is compressed into a narrower band. It becomes much harder for any single product to stand out from the median product, which is already quite good.</li><li>Because the companies don’t own the core technology behind GPT-3, their ability to improve beyond the baseline performance is limited. Yes, they can fine-tune GPT-3 with their proprietary data, but how much is this going to improve on the core algorithm, which <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/openai-launches-an-api-to-commercialize-its-research/" target="_blank">cost $12 million to train</a> on 40GB of Internet text? <strong>And won’t everyone else be fine-tuning like this too?</strong></li></ul><p>Again, this really gives credit to OpenAI for how well GPT-3 works—out of the gate, you can produce a pretty usable product. But for startups, this merely <em>raises the table stakes</em> instead of offering a competitive advantage, and it <strong>neutralizes the technology edge</strong> any single company can have over another. Great for OpenAI, not great for new startups.</p><p><strong>Then imagine how much worse this will get when GPT-4 comes out. And again with GPT-5. </strong>The minimum bar of quality will keep inching up inexorably, and the range of competition will be compressed further and further.</p><p>Plus, it’s likely that <strong>any proprietary progress you make on GPT-3 will be totally wiped out by GPT-4</strong>; the same way your tweaks on GPT-2 would have been wiped out by GPT-3.</p><p>We’ve talked about AI therapy here, but this argument extends easily to automated code generation, creative writing tools, chatbots, Q&amp;A services, games, and so on.</p><h3><strong>Other Avenues of Differentiation</strong></h3><p>Yes, the algorithm isn’t everything. Products can still differentiate with their user experience, product design, customer support, adding on human services, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>But as far as AI companies typically go, this is not really the <em>hard</em> …</p></div></div>

<blockquote><p>“I’m here for one reason and one reason alone. I’m here to guess what the music might do a week, a month, a year from now. </p><p>That’s it. Nothing more.”</p><cite>John Tuld, <a href="https://youtu.be/UOYi4NzxlhE?t=83">Margin Call (2011)</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>A lot of time in the tech community is dedicated to understanding growth and moat dynamics like network effects and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=loops%20from%3Akevinakwok&amp;src=typed_query">loops</a>. While both of these components contribute to the building of individual companies, business models, and sectors, inflection points are the bookends to all of those and more, representing the beginning and end of larger movements.</p>
<p><strong>If loops are the power source that accelerate the flywheel, inflection points build the physical properties of the flywheel, create the initial spin, and eventually are the resistance which stops the wheel dead in its tracks.</strong></p>
<p>Andy Grove defines inflection points as “an event that changes the way we think and act.” There are few skills as powerful as understanding when things change.</p>
<p>Matt Cohler of Benchmark <a href="http://matt cohler job is to see the present clearly" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">once said</a> “<em>Our job as investors is to see the present very clearly, not to predict the future.”</em>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This quote is often <a href="https://www.quora.com/You-were-quoted-in-2012-about-VC-as-saying-My-job-is-not-to-predict-the-future-its-to-notice-the-present-first-What-do-you-notice-these-days" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">misinterpreted</a>. Seeing the present clearly is merely one function in the equation. In reality it is understanding what the past and present does to the future that matters most.</p>
<p>As seed stage investors, we help companies build, survive, and scale, but one of the main components of my job is understanding how and when the world is going to change. Our portfolio is a collage of various futures that we believe in, and our capital and expertise are assets to hopefully pull these futures forward.</p>
<p>Within <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://compound.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compound</a> we often speak of <em>technical inflection points</em> as a concept that we love and deeply understand. When we say this, we mean companies that are creating or utilizing a sizable technological shift to create a venture-scale business. While many of our companies do follow this paradigm, at a higher level our focus in being thesis-driven is to understand multiple types of possible inflection points and predict the timing of such events in order to build various&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@compoundvc/compound-theses-1f97fc56e436" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">theses</a>.</p>
<p>If we are to understand what the next decades of inflection points are to hold, we must build a framework for how to look at these important events.</p>
<h3><strong>WHY INFLECTION POINTS Matter</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you’re an investor, researcher, startup founder, or scaled operator, by understanding inflection points, you’re able to best position yourself to be ahead of where the futures you believe in are going. Decoding inflection points past, present, and future all have varying value.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Past inflection points</strong> allow you to pattern match prior events to the present and future, as well as build a better view on where in a given cycle you are, or what other next order effects could come.</li><li><strong>Present inflection points </strong>allow you to identify how to prioritize learning, understand competitive dynamics, as well as begin to more properly look at companies through this lens to answer the most important question of “why now?”</li><li><strong>Future inflection points</strong> allow you to understand who are the types of people that can bring forward this future, and invest in a longer-term time horizon of building institutional learning and brand network effects to be best positioned to exploit the first and subsequent waves that result from the given inflection point.</li></ul>
<blockquote><p>Given the amorphous nature of an inflection point, how do you know the right moment to take appropriate action, to make the changes that will save your company or your career? Unfortunately, you don’t.</p><p>But you can’t wait until you do know: Timing is everything…When you’re caught in the turbulence of a strategic inflection point, the sad fact is that instinct and judgment are all you’ve got to guide you through.</p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66863.Only_the_Paranoid_Survive_Lessons_from_the_CEO_of_INTEL_Corporation">Only the Paranoid Survive</a>, Andy Grove, 1998</cite></blockquote>
<p>Thinking through these allow us to be better prepared to navigate the proverbial idea maze and understand what ripple effects users, researchers, companies, and governments are creating, to inform our decisions today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>This understanding can build a core knowledge base which helps answer questions including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul><li><strong>Who/what are the existential or emerging threats to my area of focus? </strong></li><li><strong>Which parts of the stack are ready to be built within a given category?</strong></li><li><strong>Where will value accrue/moats be built in both the short-term and more importantly, the mid to long-term</strong>?</li><li><strong>Who are the right groups of people that are best positioned to build in a given space?</strong><ul><li>Examples of this include the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/@mhdempsey/2007-darpa-grand-challenge-roster-e1d05fccf428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2007 DARPA Grand Challenge roster</a> (they formed much of the basis of the self-driving industry for the next decade), the early Willow Garage team (built ROS and founded multiple robotics companies), and even early researchers in deep learning that were deemed too early (and crazy) like Geoff Hinton and Yann Lecunn and their resulting students/researchers that went on to build some of the first deep learning startups in the 2010s.<sup data-mfn="1">1</sup><span data-mfn="1">We often call these groups “mafias’ however there is a notable difference between the underlying founder/market fit within these groups versus a perceived broader excellence like is interpreted in the Paypal Mafia, as well as with potential mafias today made up of ex-Stripe, AirBnB, or Uber employees. There is signal here though in some specific groups. For instance, as data science became incredibly complex with large datasets, we saw a ton of institutional knowledge creation within large companies like Uber, leading to a strong founder/market fit for these teams to spin out core internal technologies and democratize them for the masses as second-mover companies needed new infrastructure.</span></li></ul></li><li><strong>What is the scale of value creation we will see within a given company or industry?</strong><ul><li>Series B+ venture investing has become increasingly about having a view on outsized value creation relative to other investors, which then drives round pricing. For those that understood the scale of technology proliferation, as tech went from local to global, and capital intensive to scalable, there was meaningful alpha relative to others who didn’t anticipate these changes.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Inflection points matter because they create shifts that cascade down for multiple decades and can cause companies to outlast, take advantage of, and thrive during bull markets, and more relevant today, downturns.</p>

<blockquote><p>Great companies are started in all markets.</p><cite>– All VCs as the world began to meltdown due to COVID-19</cite></blockquote>
<p>Over the past few months, as the reality of our economic situation has set in due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tech’s echo chamber has produced a rallying cry of <em>“Great companies are started in all markets”</em></p>
<p>This echo chamber paired with our industry’s blind optimism can lead to a proliferation of startup cliches that miss the forest for the trees and/or are frozen in time, not naturally evolving with our tech ecosystem. Statements like:<em>“Do things that don’t scale”</em>, <em>“Move fast and break things”</em>, and today <em>“Great companies are started in all markets”</em>.</p>
<p>This paradigm is comforting during an onslaught of horrible news and seemingly little light at the end of the tunnel in the near term, as we sit inside our homes in some semblance of fear or exhaustion from the world, seeking respite on Zoom calls, Twitter threads, and Clubhouse rooms.</p>
<p>We are missing what is really happening. Great companies are not merely built at all times just because we say so. Though, there are reasons as to&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;many say this.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Startups are outliers building on a decade long timeline.</strong><sup data-mfn="2">2</sup><span data-mfn="2">This is probably the strongest argument of any, and also the most hand-wavy. Startups are built on multi-year timelines, but the unfortunate reality is they are slaves to fundraising cycles as they trade profits for scale. Despite the continual cry for alternative financing products and steady growth, as private markets have become incredibly well-capitalized and institutionalized at all stages of the venture capital stack, it can be necessary to make that trade in order to survive as a venture-scale company.</span></li><li><strong>Broader competition theoretically decreases during a recession. </strong>This can happen across incumbent, talent, and startup company competition. <sup data-mfn="3">3</sup><span data-mfn="3"><strong>Incumbents:</strong> Incumbents must focus and slow-down non-core areas of investment. This is the weakest argument in 2020. We have the most innovation-hungry and sprawling incumbents in history and are not slowing down during this time. If anything they finally see opportunities to deploy their war chests of cash towards these large scopes of ambition.<br><strong>Talent:</strong> While layoffs could bring down the cost of talent marginally, Facebook announced plans <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/facebook-hiring-10000-workers-small-business-grants-1234570018/">to add 10k+ workers in 2020</a> and with the rise of remote work, the incumbents aren’t just shopping in our tech capital backyards anymore.<br><strong>Capital availability and startup company competition:</strong> All rounds of the private capital stack have institutionalized as private markets have shown that they increasingly are capturing a massive % of returns. Some founders may wait out the downturn before diving into a new company, but&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mhdempsey/status/1214655919293894661">we learned last year that capital is not a differentiator</a>, and there is plenty of depth within private markets to fund fast followers, and mega-fund multiple ideas. Being a founder for better or for worse is now seen as a job, and there are many who will not stop applying for that job.</span></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.kauffman.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/theeconomicfuturejusthappened.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">That Kauffman Study</a></strong> from 2009 that highlights 57% of Fortune 500 companies were founded during a recession. <sup data-mfn="4">4</sup><span data-mfn="4">This data is borderline worthless in 2020, especially as we’ve seen replacement rates continually increase.</span></li></ul>
<h4><strong>What Actually Happened?</strong></h4>
<p>What we see during downturns is a strong proliferation of have and have nots within the tech ecosystem, where certain categories are materially overbid, while others are near impossible to raise for.</p>
<p>When we look at past recessions through this lens we can obtain learnings about the catalysts surrounding the various companies<em> </em>that lived and died through these recessions and how this influences haves and have nots moving forward.</p>
<p>These catalysts …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Mexico's new copyright law was rushed through its Congress without debate or consultation, copy-pasting the US copyright system into Mexican law as though America's system was working perfectly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-puts-human-rights-jeopardy</a></p>
<p>The law poses grave risks to Mexicans' human rights, especially (and most obviously), their right to free expression.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/how-mexicos-new-copyright-law-crushes-free-expression">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/how-mexicos-new-copyright-law-crushes-free-expression</a></p>
<p>But perhaps even more urgent is the impact this law will have on the Mexicans' cybersecurity: the security of their devices and thus the integrity of their data and even their personal safety:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-cybersecurity-and-human-rights">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/mexicos-new-copyright-law-cybersecurity-and-human-rights</a></p>
<p>The new law imports the USA's "anti-circumvention rule" – a rule that makes it both a criminal and civil matter to tamper with the "technical protection measures" that restrict access to a device, even if it's your device, and even if you're not infringing copyright.</p>
<p>This law has been a serious impediment to independent security audits – when a researcher investigates the devices we're using, to ensure that they aren't leaking our data or exposing us to risk – say, by allowing hackers to send lethal shocks to our implanted pacemakers.</p>
<p>That's because security testing often involves bypassing a TPM to get at the device's internals, and the output of those tests is often "proof of concept" code, which incontrovertibly demonstrates the defects, overriding any denials from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Both of these run afoul of both US and (new) Mexican copyright law, and since the only way to determine whether a system is secure is to subject it to independent scrutiny, this leaves devices vulnerable to serious attacks with real consequences.</p>
<p>Mexicans have direct experience with this. Pegasus, a digital weapon sold by the arms dealer NSO Group, was used to attack independent journalists, anti-sugar campaigners, and even young children:</p>
<p><a href="https://threatpost.com/pegasus-spyware-targets-investigative-journalists-in-mexico/139424/">https://threatpost.com/pegasus-spyware-targets-investigative-journalists-in-mexico/139424/</a></p>
<p>The same weapons were implicated in the Saudi kidnapping, murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi; they rely upon lingering security defects in devices that the arms dealers exploit and sell to dictators and wealthy thugs.</p>
<p>Like the US law, the Mexican law contains an "exemption" for security research; in fact, it is nearly a verbatim translation of the US clause. That exemption is entirely useless. How useless? In 22 years, no one  in the USA has ever managed to use it.</p>
<p>And in case there was any doubt, the US Copyright Office has officially acknowledged the insufficiency of this exemption and has created larger, more explicit carve outs (that are still insufficient).</p>
<p>The US law lets the Copyright Office make these changes; the Mexican law not only does not define a process for fixing these overreaches, it's also starting without the USA's 22 years' worth of exemptions.</p>
<p>No nation can afford to tie the hands of cybersecurity researchers. Mexico's lawmakers could have easily written a law that accommodated security – all they'd have had to say was, "None of this applies unless you're infringing someone's copyright." They didn't.</p>
<p>Now it's down to the National Commission for Human Rights, which has until Jul 31 to announce that it is reviewing the law. If you are in Mexico or are Mexican, here's a petition to the Commission:</p>

<p>Late last June, Google bought out "North," a tech company based in Waterloo, ON, which manufactured "Focals," a line of "smart glasses." A month later, the company is turning off the servers the glasses rely on, bricking every pair they ever sold.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.bynorth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045128691">https://support.bynorth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045128691</a></p>
<p>The company is refunding its customers' money, but this is cold comfort for many. As I said when Microsoft revoked every ebook it ever sold by shutting off its DRM server:</p>
<p>"When I was a bookseller, nothing I could do would result in your losing the book that I sold you. If I regretted selling you a book, I didn't get to break into your house and steal it, even if I left you a cash refund for the price you paid."</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/06/28/jun-17-2004.html">https://boingboing.net/2019/06/28/jun-17-2004.html</a></p>
<p>Why would Google do this? The company stonewalled CTV News, but we can make some guesses.</p>
<p>First, Google is incredibly bad at making wearable products. They've spent hundreds of millions on glasses and watches and they all sucked and flamed out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/canadian-smart-glasses-going-offline-weeks-after-company-bought-by-google-1.5042010">https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/canadian-smart-glasses-going-offline-weeks-after-company-bought-by-google-1.5042010</a></p>
<p>Historically, companies that were bad at something would lose to companies that were good at it. But in the new Gilded Age, where we no longer enforce antitrust laws, companies that are bad at things can buy up companies that are good at them, a monopolistic tactic.</p>
<p>Google's buying a lot of wearable companies, like Fitbit. They have a buyer's market, because the company has stockpiled billions by maintaining the absurd pretense that it was headquartered somewhere in the Irish Sea, in a state of tax-free bliss.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/20/oil-in-the-cloud/#buying-things">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/20/oil-in-the-cloud/#buying-things</a></p>
<p>This isn't an advantage that its nascent rivals enjoy – until you have billions, you can't hide billions, because the enablers who create trusts and Double-Irish Dutch Sandwiches and other polite names for "fraud" are not interested in your business.</p>
<p>Google – and other Big Tech companies – literally buy companies more often than I buy groceries. This is by design: the companies have used monopolistic tactics to effectively foreclose on the possibility of their being unseated.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/16/labor-investors/#big-goog">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/16/labor-investors/#big-goog</a></p>
<p>As a result, the "exit" that most founders and investors seek from tech startups is acquisition – generally an "acqui-hire," where a company is purchased for its engineering team. The product is scrapped and the team become employees.</p>
<p>The "acquisition" fee is really just a hiring bonus, with a finder's fee to the "investors" disguised as a share purchase. America's tech investors are largely headhunters, a glorified, inefficient job-placement service.</p>
<p>And the "products" that the "investors" pay "founders" to make aren't really products: they're portfolio pieces, a post-grad project to prove that you can execute a product design.</p>
<p>The product was never intended to be used by humans – you, the customer, are simply a proof-of-concept. It's a wasteful, idiotic system that throws billions at imaginary products for the purpose of shifting fractional points from Big Tech's balance sheets to investors.</p>

<p>For a glimpse of the future of agriculture and energy, check out Justin Rowlatt's fascinating article on the role of solar energy in Afghan heroin cultivation, a booming phenomenon that has boosted yields from a single annual harvest to two or three.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53450688">https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53450688</a></p>
<p>As Rowlatt points out, there's only one reason that the heroin industry changes: to increase its profits. The switch to solar in war-torn Helmand is driven by the plummeting price of solar energy, not local subsidies or climate concerns.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that climate and subsidies aren't playing indirect roles here. Part of the reason solar panels are so cheap is that they scaled up thanks to subsidies elsewhere, like Germany and the USA; those countries' subsidies drove R&amp;D; and production efficiencies.</p>
<p>The solar is driven by droughts, which send farmers questing for water with deep wells, draining nonrenewable fossil aquifers. In theory, farmers elsewhere could use solar to power desalinators, but that has its own climate consequences (salt flushed into coastal waters).</p>
<p>And while Helmand's farmers don't just grow opium poppies – one farmer featured in the article also grows tomatoes – the global flood of cheap heroin has real humanitarian consequences (of course).</p>
<p>But all of that doesn't change the essential fact illustrated by solar uptake among these poor, illegal, desperate businesses: solar is cheap and easy. In the Lashkar Gah market, "solar panels are stacked 3 storeys high."</p>
<p>"And what the changes in Afghan opium production show us is that having a source of power independent of any electricity grid – or fossil fuel supplies – can bring significant innovation."</p>

<p>In "The molecular basis of thioalcohol production in human body odour," biologists from the University of York trace human body odor to a metabolite of the enzyme Cys-Gly-3M3SH when it is consumed by the bacterium staphylococcus hominis.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68860-z">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68860-z</a></p>
<p>The source of the "pungent, cheesy, oniony smell" has been something of a mystery because thioalcohols – the smelly substance – are not produced by most of our the microorganisms in our skin biomes. The team isolated the source of thioalcohols as a waste product of staph h.</p>

It also means, especially today, learning to separate signals from noise, taking responsibility for your decisions and actions, and tightening the loop between strategy, reflection, and course correction. This holds true for businesses as well.</p><p><strong>You said, "especially today." So, how has your thinking about resilience changed in 2020?</strong></p><p>Times like these shine a bright light on simmering challenges that we all face, like the yawning wealth gap, parenting and time poverty, and structural racism. This year has helped me see that while some people and organizations are hardwired for resilience and others less so, we will feel the impacts of this at the community-level for decades to come—the good, the bad, and the ugly of it.</p><p>Anyone with school-age children sees this playing out in our education systems: some districts were made for this moment, while others have struggled mightily.</p><p>It is in our collective best interest to ensure that our institutions demonstrate resilience in their operations, which to me means doubling down on supporting the least well-off. I have taken this for granted in years past, but not anymore.</p><p><strong>How have you come to understand the importance of resilience in your career?</strong></p><p>I've come to learn that resilience doesn't mean simply "plowing through" bumps in the road that block you from your goal. It also means reevaluating your goals, and that the journey itself (at least for me) truly is the destination.</p><p>My path has been meandering, and at times bizarre as a result, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.</p><p><strong>Do you ever check-in with yourself, and if so, when was the last time you did?</strong></p><p>When I broke down crying at an all-hands meeting June 1.</p><p><strong>There's a story there—perhaps for another day. Can you think of a time when you wish you were more resilient?</strong></p><p>I always wish I could do a better job helping others be more resilient.</p><p><strong>What's one big mistake you made and how did you bounce back?</strong></p><p>Too many mistakes to count, but here's one. When I left my position at IDEO, I had one negative interaction amidst an overwhelmingly positive farewell. It changed the way I interact with everyone when transitioning away from one thing toward another.</p><p><strong>What are some mistakes we all make when it comes to resilience?</strong></p><p>We believe there's a right or wrong answer on how to proceed.</p><p><strong>As you said, it's a journey. So, how can people be more resilient in their work-life?</strong></p><p>By taking real ownership over the decisions we make, while understanding that not everything is within our control. It creates a positive bias toward action with a real and justified self-defense mechanism for when things don't go as planned.</p><p><strong>If you could leave people with one piece of advice about how to deal with what's happening right now in the world, what would it be?</strong></p><p>Don't be too hard on yourself — and set higher expectations for how we as individuals can make decisions for ourselves and the health of our communities.</p><p><strong>How do you usually stay connected with your team?</strong></p><p>I stay connected on the usual channels, but have found the most effective and meaningful way is to simply pick up the phone and talk.</p><p><strong>Are there any books or resources that you’ve found particularly relevant to this moment?</strong></p><p>Bringing together small groups of people to discuss challenges and solutions, even if online-only, can be deeply informative. I learned more moderating group calls with our CEOs and Chief People Officers than anything else I've read or seen — although I have found the <a download="" href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/e422uarq/production/fc2ea7cdceb7fa547c6ae180a7f5ba98fb3c26c8.pdf?dl=remote-work-primer.pdf">Range Remote Work Primer</a> to be brilliant. 🙂</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@gabekleinman" rel="noopener" target="_self"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/f7640570e5e99d6fb8b1aff1766046b3cf7d4d69-2316x2316.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=330&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Gabe Kleinman having a dad moment"></a></p><p><strong>To make sure you don't miss our next 12 Questions article, <a href="https://www.range.co/newsletter">sign up for our newsletter</a>.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596133872468_9471"><div><p>Click <a href="https://www.philma.me/projects/everything-is-securities-fraud/#Examples">here</a> to jump to the examples!</p><h4>An overly-long story</h4><p>A friend of mine turned me onto <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine">Matt Levine</a> earlier this year for reasons I can no longer remember, but for which I am very grateful. Matt is a former lawyer/banker and currently a writer for Bloomberg where he puts out a lunchtime newsletter (almost) every weekday called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">MoneyStuff</a> in which he provides his take on “Wall street, finance, companies and other stuff”. His writing style is uniquely approachable (given the subject matter) and he is in fact, hilarious. Reading the newsletter gives me (what I believe to be) at least a light finger on the pulse of finance which I otherwise find very difficult to keep up with. He also occasionally links to other writers/twitter people I follow which makes me feel validated.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-07/no-rush-repaying-these-student-loans">January</a> and then again in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-02-21/money-stuff-the-companies-are-on-the-same-team">February</a>, Matt wrote about <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> (OpenAI’s language generation tool/model) and how cool/interesting people were putting it to use in cool/interesting ways. See: <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200310063743/https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/">here</a>. I had heard/read about machine learning in general and GPT specifically through headlines and the occasional doomsaying article, and I had played around with some of the text generators but it seemed like more of a diversion to me before Matt Levine brought it up (emphasis is mine): </p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;[GPT-2] is widely used as a sort of internet toy to write fake texts based on a model; <strong>you can put a paragraph of Money Stuff into GPT-2 and get back a new paragraph that kind of follows logically and kind of sounds like Money Stuff</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>and this:</p><blockquote><p>GPT-2 is an artificial-intelligence language model: You feed it a corpus of texts, and it gives you back some more texts that sound like they could have come from that corpus. <strong>You train GPT-2 on a bunch of Money Stuff columns, it learns to write Money Stuff, I am out of a job.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Challenge accepted? And so I sort of decided to take this on as a project to teach myself how to put together workable python code, and to dabble in ‘machine learning’. </p><p>Despite my reputation among my older family members, I am not much of a computer person. I was never formally trained in computer science, nor do I use it for work really. I have a vague understanding of how computers work mostly through googling problems as they arise, youtube videos, and from a brief period in the late 90’s where I would putz around on my computer aimlessly after I had run out of time on my AOL trial disk. I took a computer programming class (Pascal) in highschool, I sort of taught myself how to make rudimentary programs on my TI-83, I made it halfway through an online C++ course in college, and recently I took a more involved online course in Python geared towards data science. I thought that given my background, putting together a Matt Levine GPT-2 bot would take me like, a week. Tops. Lol. </p><p>I found a Matt Levine twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MattLevineBot">bot</a> and some of those tweets are very good, but I wanted to have GPT-2 make entire articles! Someone had already done this too, and they named it <a href="https://0xnf.github.io/posts/ml/machinelevine/">Machine Levine</a>! But as far as I could find, the bot was no longer hosted and he didn’t provide any examples. I’m sure it worked just fine, but it didn’t use GPT-2, so I decided that my cause was righteous and set off. </p><p><em>(Note: Why not GPT-3? When I began this project in February, it was not released. Also, at the point in time that I’m writing this (July 2020) GPT-3 was only available for poking and prodding to a small cohort of people who know what they’re doing. Also, it would likely require a whole cluster of TPUs to train which Google will almost certainly not let me play around with.)</em></p><p>I started off by attempting to gather every article of MoneyStuff I could find. I receive the newsletter in my inbox everyday (ish) so I figured I could start there, but I had only been reading him for a few months so this would have produced a relatively small amount of text for training data. Or so I read. I tried directly asking for the articles through <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">Urllib</a>, and <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a> but as it turns out, Bloomberg’s web admins are smarter and better at their jobs of web-admin-ing than a random person on the internet who just ‘learned’ python; surprise suprise! I kept triggering their bot-detection which was frustrating but fair since it’d probably be bad if they just let random people bombard their servers all the time with abandon. I ended up running a pretty simple <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a> script which was super friendly to their servers, which means it took like 2 days to run. I also subscribed to bloomberg for one of those gimme introductory trials since I felt bad for circumventing their paywall. </p><p>Next, I had to strip away the HTML and (and a bunch of other stuff I don’t understand) to get to the meat of the articles. My early attempts using various readability focused modules (<a href="https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">newspaper</a>, BS4’s built in gettext, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/">html2text</a>) were unsatisfactory since they tended to leave weird parts of the header in, or truncated parts of the article which I wanted to keep (or equally as likely, I just didn’t know how to use them properly). They also completely stripped the formatting which was disappointing because I sort of wanted GPT-2 to be able to generate full articles with titles, subtitles, and paragraphs (again, probably a way around this. Perhaps my stackoverflow-fu is lacking). I ended up frankensteining together enough script (using BeautifulSoup) from stackoverflow to prune out the navigation bar, ads, videos, pictures, and self-recommending links. Then I deployed Selenium to open each HTML file, select all the text, and paste the text into a text file. I think that my approach was a spectacularly dumb and inefficient way to do this and there is almost certainly an elegant way to do it with regular expressions (AAAHHHHH) or something in like 4 lines. But alas, I am bad at this. </p><p>I do not own an enterprise-grade GPU, or any GPU at all for that matter. My Macbook Pro is about 8 years old, and is rocking a Core i5 with integrated graphics. This probably wasn’t going to cut it if I wanted to train even the smallest GPT-2 model in a reasonable amount of time. I googled around and found out that Max Woolf had created a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce">Colaboratory notebook</a> with an attached GPU where you can run GPT-2 fine tuning for free! What a time to be alive. I settled on the 355M model (after reading up on what <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-2">Gwern</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/theshawwn">Shawn Presser</a> did earlier this year and in late 2019) because apparently this was the best I could accomplish using free Colaboratory notebooks. The colaboratory notebooks time out after 90 minutes and run for a maximum of 12 hours. So I wasted about half a week retraining the model after losing the checkpoint data on disconnect pretty much every day I tried it. So instead, I began just running it in batches everyday until I was satisfied. This is probably bad somehow, and there is likely a way to run fine tuning in Colab without babysitting, but you know. Whoops. </p><p>I don’t think I can stress this enough, but I don’t know what I am doing. I did not learn anything about actual Machine Learning through this project. GPT-2 was basically a black box for me which I fed a text file. Actual ML is likely way more complicated than I can reasonably imagine, and I honestly probably don’t remember enough math to get into the nitty gritty. Regardless, it was fascinating to see it go brrrr and spit out funny articles, and it was super cool of smart people to release these (super simplified) tools to the masses to play with. Anyway, the way to keep track of how well your model is doing (apparently) is by reading the ‘labeled’ numbers the terminal shoots out at you. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595860388311_4149"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595860388311_4439"><p>Google (mostly Gwern) tells me that ‘loss’ is Cross-Entropy Loss which sort of makes sense to me, but also it wouldn’t surprise me if it ended up meaning something else entirely. Avg is what I assume to be a running average of the loss which would show you a general trajectory of your model’s progress. As far as I could tell, this is only an average of the loss in the current training session. What I gleaned was that you’re supposed to read through the sample texts at the intervals you set (mine was every 500 steps) to check to see if the model is getting better, and also to check to see if your model’s loss is improving anymore (benefitting from further training) to know when to stop. In retrospect, I probably should have saved these terminal outputs and graphed the progress because it’d probably look cool and official to have that as a figure right about here. Oh well. </p></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596133872468_9025"><div><h4 id="Examples">Anyway</h4><p>
  Here are some (not cherry-picked) examples:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596054637616_8835"><p>And here are a few articles with the temperature (let’s GPT-2 be a little more creative with word choice) cranked a smidge higher:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595899551641_6156"><div><p>So, I’d say that at the very least, these are funny. I certainly thought so anyway. For context, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-27/spacs-aren-t-cheaper-than-ipos-yet">here</a> is a random MoneyStuff article to compare his writing style and structure. I’d say the model does a pretty good job at getting the structure down. I added the formatting to these examples but the plain text generated clearly (through use of a new line) generates the article titles, subtitle, and section headings itself. I was most impressed with the model’s ability to emulate Matt’s unique style which really was the point of me making this so, yay. Unfortunately, GPT-2 seems incapable (or equally as likely, I am incapable) of generating texts long enough to match a typical MoneyStuff article which usually spans about 3-5 sections. Also, the section headings often don’t match the subtitles, although they do seem to at least track well with the main …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  

  <p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is one of my favourite pieces of software
ever, and it’s great to see that it seems to be getting more and more attention
as a valuable tool.</p>
<p>I often do a kind of learning-and-note-taking exercise with Anki when reading
technical content, which I’m writing up here.</p>
<p>It’s not complicated or dogmatic, and the current version boils down to three
tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloze deletion for easy conversion of text into notes.</li>
<li>Noting short code samples with a dedicated Code note-type.</li>
<li>Use screenshots to turn anything into simple memory prompt notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how each of those works for me. I’m using the article <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-tricks-application-dba">“Some SQL Tricks
of an Application DBA”</a> as an
example technical text that I recently went through with these note-taking
approaches.</p>
<h2 id="cloze-deletion-for-easy-note-taking">Cloze deletion for easy note-taking</h2>
<p>One powerful aspect of how Anki works is that it lets you set up any number of
different note types. One of the built-in types is for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test">Cloze
deletion</a>, which is an old and
powerful memory reviewing technique.</p>
<p>Cloze deletion simply means removing part of some material to make it into a
mini-test with the <a href="https://www.chineseboost.com/blog/simple-test-chinese-study-methods/">chance to be
wrong</a>.</p>
<p>What makes Cloze deletion so useful as a note-making technique is how easy it
is. Any text can easily be made into a note by applying Cloze deletion. This
takes a couple of seconds but is highly effective. You just copy-and-paste some
short text you’d like to use as a memory prompt, highlight a key part, and use
the keyboard shortcut to Cloze that part out (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ctrl + Shift + C<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cmd + Shift + C<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>For example, in the SQL article, I made some Cloze notes like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>One way of “sorting a table on disk” by a specific index is to use the
{{c1::CLUSTER}} command.</em></li>
<li><em>Correlation measures how {{c1::“sorted”}} values of a specific
column are on disk.</em></li>
<li><em>Timestamp columns that keep track of when rows were created will usually
have a {{c1::correlation}} close to 1.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the goal with these is to act as a prompt for existing knowledge. It’s
supposed to keep you recalling what you learnt on a regular basis, so that your
mind keeps working on the memory and keeping it “alive” for you.</p>
<p>In other words, you are not trying to write down textbook-like explanations.
You are trying to create a memory trail of prompts that keeps your working
knowledge fresh and available.</p>
<p>Spaced repetition is a way to remember, not a way to learn.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-dedicated-code-note-type">Have a dedicated Code note-type</h2>
<p>As well as the versatile Cloze deletion note-type, I also have a Code note-type
in Anki. This is just a basic prompt/response note, except that I’ve named the
response side as “code” and applied a bit of CSS to it to put it in a monospace
font.</p>
<p>When I see short but useful or exemplary bits of code in technical content, I
just copy and paste them as one of these Code notes. Here are some examples that
I took from the SQL article:</p>
<p>Prompt:</p>
<p>“Sort a table physically on disk according to a specific index.”</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CLUSTER</span> <span>sale_fact</span> <span>USING</span> <span>sale_fact_sold_at_ix</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Prompt:</p>
<p>“See correlation of columns in a table.”</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>tablename</span><span>,</span> <span>attname</span><span>,</span> <span>correlation</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_stats</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>tablename</span> <span>=</span> <span>'foobar_table'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that they are short and readable in a couple of seconds, which is important
to make an effective card. Sometimes I edit the sample to make it a bit clearer,
and sometimes I just leave it.</p>
<p>Again, the goal here is not to perfectly memorise the response down to the
character. It’s to build a stronger memory along the lines of “there’s a way to
check column correlation in PostgreSQL and it looks something like this”.</p>
<h2 id="use-screenshots-to-turn-anything-into-a-prompt-card">Use screenshots to turn anything into a prompt card</h2>
<p>The third tactic is to make liberal use of screenshots to make general memory
prompts. This is similar to the Cloze deletion in that you can use it to turn
pretty much anything you have on screen into a long-term memory prompt.</p>
<p>There is an Anki plugin that lets you do actual <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094">Cloze deletion on
images</a>, but I tend not to bother
with that.</p>
<p>Instead I just grab screenshots of various things and chuck in a simple
prompt/response note, with “What does this represent?” above the image as the
prompt.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s very obvious from the image what it represents. For
example, I might put in a captioned diagram including the caption. The point is
to keep this diagram fresh in mind so that you can build on the knowledge it
represents.</p>
<p>There’s a big difference between looking at a diagram in an article or textbook
once, and seeing it over and over again in your spaced repetition system.
Pausing briefly each time to think about what the image represents makes it a
more active and useful memory for you long-term.</p>
<h2 id="wrap">Wrap</h2>
<p>Those are three ways I quickly make notes when reading some technical content
that seems useful to try and retain long-term. My Anki deck ends up as a
low-effort way to continuously review things I learned, often from several years
ago.</p>
<p>Finally, just as you can quickly create notes in this way, be willing to delete
them just as quickly. If a note turns out to be bothersome or unhelpful, delete
it. Both the deck and the knowledge-building are ongoing processes, and they
should be as frictionless as possible.</p>

<p>CTMU is a metaphysical theory of the universe by Christopher Langan, a man with the highest recorded IQ in the world. The crux of CTMU is that the universe is both procedure and object, code and data, function and parameter, effectively a self-modifying process that targets itself. The SCSPL<a href="http://ctmucommunity.org/wiki/Self-Configuring_Self-Processing_Language">[0]</a> is what CTMU terms as the BIOS or Operating System of our universe – it stands for Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language.</p>



<p>My main hypothesis is that the SCSPL is precisely the general solution to the Busy Beaver problem. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">[1]</a></p>



<p>Assuming our universe is infinite, its `cosmic egg`, the program that represents our universe, is the solution to $\displaystyle{\lim_{n \to \infty} BB(n)}$</p>



<p>BB visits as many possible states as possible before halting. In simple terms it asks: Find the longest running program that doesn’t get stuck in an infinite loop. Classically, BB is a challenge for Turing machines. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">[2]</a> Turing machines are notoriously hard to program because they do not distinguish between code and data.</p>



<p>We can and should extend BB to Von Neumann machines <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_machine">[3]</a>, like the one that you are reading this post on right now. Von Neumann machines differ from Turing machines because they make a distinction between code and data by reserving memory for each. Upon execution of a program on a VN, it is simply copied from the hard drive to reserved, read-only memory. The instruction pointer of the CPU, known as EIP, points to memory location of the code to execute and simply increments every time the CPU runs a line of code. Loops and conditional statements are accomplished by adding or subtracting from EIP. This is known as jumping. The important takeaway here is that the code is static and unchanging and in turn, it resides in reserved memory that must remain static and unchanging.</p>



<p>In a VN, a memory module of n bits, has $2^n$ possible states. Assuming one of these is a halting state, we could in theory write a program that would run through all or almost all of these states. However, we would almost certainly need to scrap the paradigm of storing programs in unchanging, read-only memory. For example, if our machine has 100 bits of memory, and our program takes up 90 bits, we could only hope to write a program that iterates through all possible states of the 10 non-reserved bits, a measly 1024 states. This is a far cry from the enormous size of the memory space of all 100 bits ~ 12676506002 28229401496703205376.</p>



<p>Self modifying programs dwarf static programs in runtime. This is because the entire memory is used for the state space – not just a small data section. Unfortunately, other than in the niche underground culture of blackhats writing viruses and worms, the principles of polymorphic code are poorly understood. We barely understand how to write self-modifying programs and neither Mathematics nor Computer Science have researchers or categories of study dedicated to elucidating it.</p>



<p>The lack of knowledge on self-modifying programs is sad in so many ways but one practical application really hurts all of humanity: compression. Self-modifying programs are actually the most concise family of programs. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">[4]</a> This is so much so, that a self-modifying program is what generates our entire universe.</p>



<p>If you care about having a real, tangible model of physics that rivals string theory and the standard model, then solving BB is imperative and urgent! Our place in the universe, in space and time, is many many steps into BB(∞). In order to peer back into the ontological basis of reality, our only solution is BB. Too many non-linear changes have occurred since the initial Big Bang, or BB, coincidence? I think not 😉</p>



<p>If there is a multiverse, BB would run through it. It truly is the holy grail representing the universe of ALL possibilities. I could go on, and talk about computational elements of self-modifying programs that reinforce themselves and create stable motifs, ala gliders in cellular automata, but I think this is enough for you to understand: BB is the code for our universe.</p>



<p>Let’s solve BB generally, for VN machines, and supplant string theory, particle physics, and bring the ontological computational truth back to reality on Earth. It is our duty.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="http://blog.nickwinter.net/upcoming-maniac-week">Last week</a> I set out to see how many hours of programming work I could do in one week on <a href="http://codecombat.com/">CodeCombat</a>, our multiplayer programming game for learning how to code. I clocked in at 120.75 hours. Here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0qlr22cF14">epic time-lapse video</a> I generated from <a href="https://github.com/nwinter/telepath-logger">Telepath</a> (watch in 1440p if you can):</p><figure id="w-node-b4ab708afc0e-58e10339"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0qlr22cF14"></iframe></p></figure><p>So what did I learn from this experiment?</p><p><strong>Adjustable height desks are amazing.</strong></p><p>I bought one from <a href="http://www.ergodepot.com/">Ergo Depot</a> a few days before. I must have switched between sitting and standing fifty times last week. I would never have survived otherwise.</p><p><strong>Viking metal is stronger than sleep.</strong></p><p>I usually sleep for 8.5 hours a night. I thought that for this week I could be tricky, starting at 04:00 and sleeping later and later so I'd only have to sleep six times for maybe eight hours a pop. Not only did it totally work, but my wake times didn't advance as fast as my bedtimes, so I only lost 6.38 hours per day to sleep.</p><p>I thought this would make me tired and unable to concentrate on difficult programming, but energy and focus were actually really good except for one hour early Sunday night. I blame it on epic Viking metal and other super-energizing music, plus maybe the seven bars of 90% dark chocolate I ate. I had one or two cups of tea but no other caffeine, and I woke without an alarm every morning.</p><p><strong>It's euphoric to never have to stop coding.</strong></p><p>I hadn't realized I how much more I enjoy coding when I don't have to answer emails for a week. (Note the unread emails climb to 402 by the end.) Even fixing bugs, supporting Internet Explorer, and struggling with algorithms I don't understand are all fun when I know I'm going to win--that I'll solve the thing before anything can distract me. And listening to music is one of my favorite things, so having a week filled with just code and music? Wonderful!</p><p><strong>I speed up the longer I go.</strong></p><p>Normally, I work a focused-but-relaxed 60 hours in a week. I doubled that last week, but I feel like I was perhaps three times as productive. I could keep the problems in my head without cache eviction due to memory pressure. (I mean, there wasn't anything else to think about.) With ever-deepening focus, I felt unstoppable. It was like getting 4.5 40-hour weeks' worth of work done in one.</p><p><em>How much did you actually get done?</em></p><p>It's hard to compare, but here are the major projects I did:</p><ul role="list"><li>Moved all game <a href="http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/">Systems</a> out of the codebase and into the database with live-coding System editing from within the level editor</li> <li>Completely redesigned and rewrote the spell editor, in the process solving 31 Trello tasks that depended on a new editor architecture</li> <li>With Scott, wrote a parser for vector sprite assets that allows us to use vector art directly in our game engine instead of exporting raster sprite sheets</li> <li>Implemented automatic, dynamic <a href="http://www.ai-blog.net/archives/000152.html">nav mesh</a> <a href="http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/NavigationMeshReference.html">generation</a> to support A*-based pathfinding for any unit's artificial intelligence</li> <li>Added support for Internet Explorer 9-11 (and 9 doesn't even have web workers!)</li> <li>Moved all world victory condition configuration from code to configurable scripts, refactoring the goal management to allow more flexible goals</li> </ul><p></p><p>On top of those major projects, most of the work was in all the little Trellos I slew and bugs I fixed.</p><p><em>Okay, but was the code any good?</em></p><p>Yes. It's expressive, well-organized, and (to me) pretty, if not solid or fast yet. But...</p><p><strong>My coding style changed.</strong></p><p>Most nights last week I programmed in my dreams, with vivid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effect">Tetris effect</a> one night of doing CSS tweaks. (One night I had a nightmare of watching a YouTube video and then panicking upon realizing I wasn't working.) Being that deep into my CoffeeScript, I found myself writing terser and terser code, since why do in five lines what you can obviously do in one? But as I coded, I didn't realize until too late that "obvious" is different between just-spent-120-hours-coding me and just-went-skateboarding me, let alone people are not me and <em>may not even know CoffeeScript if you can believe that.</em> Here's an example from spell_view.coffee:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ee5933dd8ba888022e10334/5ef0b7ced97fc3711e8c68d1_Screenshot2013111821.27.102b281ddcd7af03ddd45c107bb0d808e7.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>I don't even want to show you what the old code was, because it was uglier than a cowbear. But it was three times this long and did half as much. To me, this new code is luscious. But can a <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/02/portrait-of-n00b.html">sane coder</a> really understand this? Where are all the commas and braces and parentheses clarifying the operator and method call and array precedence?</p><p><strong>Processor speed changes everything.</strong></p><p>I had the idea to do this week a few months ago, but I wanted to wait until I could buy a freshly updated MacBook Pro to do it, since the old one was three years old and, though capable, pretty slow. After the laptop upgrade, I was surprised by how much more I wanted to work. The simple friction of slow builds and poor CodeCombat level simulation performance had been weighing down my enjoyment and efficiency this whole time. I'm never waiting three years to upgrade my gear again.</p><p><strong>This was a weird thing to do.</strong></p><p>Man barely moves for a week, staring at patterns of light on a flat object and trying to make the patterns change. Every 2-4 hours, a stimulus is presented and he records how happy he is. He eats and sleeps as fast as he can so he can go back to looking at the lights.</p><p>It is the happiest week he has ever recorded by a wide margin.</p><p>(I have been tracking happiness for over three years, and this week's average of 7.03 / 10 is a full 0.22 points higher than the week I first started writing <a href="http://www.nickwinter.net/the-motivation-hacker">my book</a> and learned to skateboard. Now, probably the best weeks are weeks when I wasn't at my computer consistently recording happiness pings, like the <a href="http://blog.nickwinter.net/wife-and-husband">week I got married</a> which was pretty much the best ever.)</p><p><strong>Overall, it was surprisingly easy.</strong></p><p>I think it would be much harder if I was under any stress (like deadlines), but this was just fun, and there were never any points when I wanted to stop working. I don't think I could hit these kind of hours without trying to set a personal record, though. (My previous record was only 87.3 hours.) I doubt I could have focused on only coding, rejecting all other activities, if I wasn't making a public precommitment and time lapse video of it.</p><p>I talked about my <a href="http://blog.nickwinter.net/upcoming-maniac-week">preparations and planning in the previous post</a>, which is exactly how it went down except that I kept waking up early. I asked for predictions as to how much I could do; friends guessed I'd do anywhere from 87.3 - 113 hours, with an average of 99.4. My wife Chloe wins the competition by guessing 113 (which was even higher than my own secret prediction of 112). So getting to 120.75 feels like an epic victory to me. Although my workweek offcially ended at 03:59, I couldn't go to sleep until 04:45 because I was so excited.</p><p>Final stats can be found in the last frame:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ee5933dd8ba888022e10334/5ee6ba2a202f05e6aded35c8_maniacweek1804f9d08782967b6b52cc5b94b8e7d6.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Here are some stats that <a href="https://github.com/nwinter/telepath-logger">Telepath Logger</a> doesn't show:</p><ul role="list"><li>Average happiness: 7.03 / 10 (awesome!)</li> <li>Energy: 6.64 (high for me)</li> <li>Health: 5.33 (5 is "okay")</li> <li>90% chocolate bars eaten: 7</li> <li>Daily work average: 17.25 hours </li> <li>Hours awake but not working (eating): 2.6 (0:22 per day)</li> <li>Hours sleeping: 44.65 (6.38 per day, 7.44 per night)</li> <li>Seconds per frame: 55</li> </ul><p></p><p>Oh, and if you're wondering about the videos showing while I'm sleeping: it's just my screensaver. I extracted still frames from some other YouTube videos with ffmpeg at 705 frames per second so that when played back in real time at three frames every seven seconds split across three screens, the main screen would produce a thirty-frame-per-second rerendering of the videos in time-lapse time.</p></div></div>]]>

<h4>Solution Verified in:</h4>
<ul>
<li>OpenNebula: 5.12</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Issue</h2>
<p>This tutorial will show how to access the Docker Hub marketplace from Sunstone (OpenNebula's WebUI), import an official Docker image and deploy an application as a <a href="https://opennebula.org/firecracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firecracker MicroVM</a>.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>To follow the tutorial you will need an OpenNebula cloud deployment with at least one Firecracker node.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<div>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>If you prefer a video-tutorial, have a look at the following screencast, which follows the procedure described in this article step by step:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TY5iS8_1Dl4" width="672" height="378" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>
<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360063198012/nginx.jpg" alt="nginx.jpg"></a></p>
<p>As a practical example, we are going to import the <strong>nginx</strong> application from the Docker Hub marketplace.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059758052/OpenNebulaMarketplaces.png" alt="OpenNebulaMarketplaces.png"></p>
<p>You can select <strong>nginx</strong> from the Apps tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059758032/OpenNebulaDockerHubApps.png" alt="OpenNebulaDockerHubApps.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924111/OpenNebulaNginxApp.png" alt="OpenNebulaNginxApp.png"></p>
<p>Now download it by selecting the image datastore and optionally a tag of the Docker image</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924091/ImportNginxApp.png" alt="ImportNginxApp.png"></p>
<p>When <strong>nginx</strong> is imported from Docker Hub, a VM template is also created. You'll have to update the template.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059758012/UpdateNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="UpdateNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<p>You can have to add a virtual network to access the <strong>nginx</strong> application</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924051/AddNetworkNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="AddNetworkNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<p>A kernel image should be set in the OS section. The kernel boot parameters are already setup during the import process.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059757972/AddKernelNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="AddKernelNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<div>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>A kernel image for Firecracker microVMs can be imported from the OpenNebula Public Marketplace:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360063360031/OpenNebulaFirecrackerKernel.png" alt="OpenNebulaFirecrackerKernel.png"></p></div>
<p>And the start script.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059757952/AddStartScriptNginxVMTemplate.png" alt="AddStartScriptNginxVMTemplate.png"></p>
<p>Don't forget to update the Custom Vars with a root password of your choice.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059924031/AddCustomVarsNginxTemplate.png" alt="AddCustomVarsNginxTemplate.png"></p>
<p>Once the VM template is updated you can instantiate it to create a Firecracker microVM.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360059757932/NginxVM.png" alt="NginxVM.png"></p>
<p>You can access the Firecracker microVM through VNC using the password you set earlier at the template's Custom Vars section:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/article_attachments/360060207071/VNCNginxVM.png" alt="VNCNginxVM.png"></p>
<p>Now you can use your browser to access the <strong>nginx</strong> application by using the IP of your VM. Voilà! <span>🤓</span></p>

<p>A study published in medical journal <em>Memory &amp; Cognition</em> has found learning music does not have a positive impact on children's cognitive skills, such as memory and academic achievement.</p> 
<p>Giovanni Sala at Fujita Health University, Japan, and Fernand Gobet at the London School of Economics and Political Science in the UK, examined evidence on the effects of music training on children's cognitive skills and academic achievement.</p> 
<p>Previous research indicated a link between music training and better skills and performance, with some researchers even suggesting that playing an instrument can raise your IQ.</p> 
 
<p>But after analysing data from 54 studies conducted on 6,984 participants between 1986 and 2019, Dr Sala’s team found music training was ineffective at enhancing cognitive or academic skills, regardless of the skill type, participants' age and duration of music training.</p> 

<p>The authors found studies with high-quality design, such as those which used a group of active controls – children who did not learn music but instead learned a different skill, such as dance or sports, for example – showed no effect of music education on cognitive or academic performance.</p> 
<p>"Our study shows that the common idea that 'music makes children smarter' is incorrect,” said Dr Sala, the lead author.</p> 
<p>"On the practical side, this means that teaching music with the sole intent of enhancing a child's cognitive or academic skills may be pointless.</p> 
<p>“While the brain can be trained in such a way that if you play music, you get better at music, these benefits do not generalise in such a way that if you learn music, you also get better at maths.</p> 
<p>"Researchers' optimism about the benefits of music training appears to be unjustified and may stem from misinterpretation of previous empirical data."</p>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/freakwave.jpg" alt="Freak wave"></p>

<p>During the pandemic, I’ve done my civic duty and spent lockdown reading a ton of random stuff on the internet. In the midst of a Wikipedia binge, I went down a rabbit hole on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave">rogue waves</a>: massive waves that occur in the middle of the ocean, endangering ships and generating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu4ogCy5d4k">kickass Youtube content</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of a rogue wave reminded me of a particularly challenging stage in the life of many venture-backed enterprise SaaS startups. Similar to how a rogue wave forms, during this phase many Small Problems coincide and create a Big Problem. Also like rogue waves, this moment in the life of a high-growth enterprise SaaS business is uncommon – it seems to occur around $5-20 million ARR, which relatively few companies reach, and can seem almost mythical. And finally, the effects of both rogue waves and this challenging startup stage are predictable: if you spend long enough on the high seas, they’re waiting for you.</p>

<p>I’ve seen this phenomenon both in-person as an operator and as an observer of other companies, and I do believe it’s real. I’m writing this essay in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share what I’ve seen</li>
  <li>Provide some opinions on what you can do about it</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully I can be the crusty old mariner bringing back tales that others find useful.</p>

<h2 id="hitting-the-wall">Hitting the Wall</h2>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/boat.jpg" alt="Big boat, bigger wave">
Startups can be stressful</p>

<p>The rogue wave typically seems to hit between $5M and $20M in ARR. If you’re operating with a common venture-backed SaaS model of <a href="https://www.saastr.com/how-to-figure-out-your-competitors-revenues-in-about-70-seconds/">$1-200k ARR per employee</a>, this is around where you’ll hit the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191001-dunbars-number-why-we-can-only-maintain-150-relationships">Dunbar number</a> of ~150 people: the point where you can no longer operate as a large family, and need to start acting like a corporation. <em>(Note that the post linked is from 2012 – SaaS has since exploded, and more companies are raising huge rounds and hiring more on less revenue)</em></p>

<p>Crossing the 150-person barrier is both operationally and emotionally difficult:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operational: We have so many teams, we need regular status reports!</li>
  <li>Emotional: Why do I need to send <em>you</em> a status report all of a sudden, I thought we were all friends here?!</li>
</ul>

<p>This transition point is also when many leaders who excelled in scrappy startup mode <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/06/27/hardest-part-of-startup-scale-yourself.html">struggle to level up</a> in a larger organization. Some successfully scale themselves (slow, painful) and others will leave the company (fast, but often even more painful).</p>

<p>Many of the first contracts that you closed post-traction come up for renewal around this point (in the enterprise – SMB SaaS has less predictable growth profiles). If you’re following a <a href="https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/">triple-triple-double-double-double</a> growth path, you’ll be at roughly your second triple. There will be too many customers for the founding team to personally visit and retain everyone.</p>

<p>At this point you’ll need to renew “real” customers, not just friends who took a flyer on your infant product. These aren’t the earliest adopters who will be with you through thick and thin and are really closer to partners. These are real live paying customers who will leave if your product is screwed up. As these renewals approach, a mature post-sales motion becomes essential.</p>

<p>The expectations around your revenue also become more real at this stage. Under about $10M ARR, your revenue projections can be a mild shitshow. But the expectation that you’ll have at least some semblance of predictability steadily increases.</p>

<p>And through it all you need to continue to scale the product. Your code is no longer a series of never-ending green fields rolling off into the distance, and non-trivial parts of your product will need to be meaningfully restructured. You’re burdened by decisions made years ago, often by people who are no longer on the team.</p>

<p>This is especially true for enterprise SaaS. Enterprise products are much more unwieldy than jewel-box consumer products, as they have to support many more users and workflows. Consumer products are like Chipotle: a small, carefully curated set of menu items, built for elegance and efficiency. Enterprise products are like the Cheesecake Factory: you can get steak, pasta, a milkshake and 4 kinds of margarita in the same meal. You need to level up how your team builds products.</p>

<h2 id="cresting-the-wave">Cresting the Wave</h2>

<p>I’m writing about this phenomenon because if you haven’t seen or heard about it, there isn’t really a good way to realize that it might be coming. Even if it isn’t preventable, it’s better to know what’s on the horizon. After all, being able to see around corners is why many companies hire experienced operators.</p>

<p>I won’t claim to be an expert on how to react, but I can share a few things that I think work well and a few that don’t, and what I would do if I had to go through this phase again.</p>

<h3 id="the-crew">The Crew</h3>

<p>First, I would do my best to get the right team in place in advance. In particular, I would make sure that I had very strong functional heads for the functions that will be strained the most: Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support, and Customer Success. You don’t need every role covered, but it saves headaches to know that some parts of the team are bulletproof. This isn’t the time for unforced errors.</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/rogue-wave/pirate-crew.jpg" alt="Pirates of the Caribbean crew">
You want a senior crew. You can tell that Sharkman here has experience and won’t freak out when the database goes down or a large account churns.</p>

<p>I also recommend hiring senior team members who can help see around corners and anticipate issues. This is a taxing time period because it’s so damn busy, and raw, well-directed horsepower tends to carry the day in those situations. More importantly, seasoned operators have typically seen challenging times before, and have the composure to handle them calmly because they know that things are always on fire.</p>

<p>It’s tempting during these busy times to make very junior hires such as new college graduates or coding bootcamp grads just to put butts in seats. These folks can be excellent hires in calmer times, but the chaos caused by too many inexperienced employees is very difficult while you’re cresting the wave.</p>

<h3 id="steering-the-ship">Steering the Ship</h3>

<p>Startups are generally fairly stressful, and that’s heightened in this time period. When operational problems strike in stressful times, it’s common to blame the people involved rather than processes – in reality, bad processes or incentives are usually the root cause.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the faster you’re growing, the more lightweight your processes should be. When you’re in rapid scaling mode your operational tempo is constantly changing, so there’s no point boiling the ocean to create a perfect process when next month so much will have changed.</p>

<p>For example: when confronting a startup rogue wave, I would not choose to reinvent a completely new system for launching new features. Instead, use 20% of the time to set up a simple, predictable process that gives you 80% of the value. Example: set up a recurring check-in meeting where upcoming releases are discussed by PMs and Tech Leads + a Slack thread where all new releases are announced when they go-live. It won’t be perfect, but you can get this up and running in 15 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="commit">Commit</h3>

<p>This is not the time to hedge your decisions or waffle on strategy.</p>

<p>For example: in general, I prefer to give people a generous window of time to grow into stretch roles. Promoting from within builds continuity, leads to a more invested team, and motivates others by demonstrating that you’re creating strong career paths. But in this phase it’s especially important that you commit to keeping or replacing leaders fast, as there’s just too much going on.</p>

<p>If you’re 30% of the way up a 100 foot wall of water and decide to adjust course, you’re going to get slammed.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-calm">Keeping Calm</h3>

<p>Whatever you do, <em>don’t freak out</em>. When it feels like shit is hitting the fan everywhere, it’s easy to want to react and search for magic solutions. Hire a new Head of X! Spend less! No wait, spend <em>more</em>! Pause development and focus on tech debt! Actually our largest customer needs more features, cancel all tech debt projects!</p>

<p>In reality, to take a line from The Sopranos, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_po7So0MKq4">it won’t be cinematic</a>. Life isn’t a movie. There are no magic fixes – this challenging phase gets resolved by showing up and executing in an unflashy way for months. Magic fixes never really exist, and that’s especially true since this crucible stems from several medium-sized problems amplifying one another.</p>

<p>Searching for a unified solution to your troubles risks distraction. The road is reasonably straightforward and the challenges are tractable: there are just a lot of them. Just like an actual rogue wave, you can’t flee or dodge the factors that make crossing these rogue waves so difficult. You succeed by pointing your boat right at the problem and hitting the gas. Keeping calm doesn’t mean being stubborn or refusing to change, but it does mean that you can’t second guess your decisions – especially when it feels like you’re climbing a wall of water.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Not everyone makes it over the wave – of the roughly 10 cases that I’ve observed, roughly half had their growth stunted for at least several years after hitting this stage. In my opinion this SaaS rogue wave should be taken seriously.</p>

<p>But the good news is that once you’ve crossed the wave, you can speed up again. As you’re rising up the wall everything goes into slow motion; but once you’ve crested the top, your acceleration can increase again as you’ve set yourself up with a more stable operating model and a hardened team.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful time, as there’s so much opportunity. Your team is still in place. The market opportunity is there, and people are buying. And once you’re over the top, the water is much calmer towards the horizon.</p>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Many challenging situations tend to arise simultaneously when high growth enterprise SaaS companies hit roughly $5-20 million ARR.</li>
  <li>The good news is that after this phase things get easier – the bad news is that it’s not easily avoidable.</li>
  <li>The best way to move forward is to focus on executing – and don’t be overly reactive.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the first part of a three-part series on Win32 development:</p>

<hr>

<p><span>L</span>et’s start with the obvious question right away:
Why should anyone write a new application using ‘90s technology like Win32 API in 2020?</p>

<p>Well, if you are working at a company like ENLYZE, there are plenty of good reasons to do so:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to send your customer a small and self-contained application which should just work without any installation</li>
<li>You don’t know if your customer’s computer is brand new or 20 years old, but you can be sure that it’s running Windows (welcome to the world of industrial manufacturing)</li>
<li>You want to create a familiar and functional user interface by using the operating system’s UI components instead of reinventing the wheel</li>
<li>You only want to do the job once, and therefore need a framework that is not going to be abandoned tomorrow</li>
</ul>

<p>If that also applies to your situation, welcome aboard!<br>
Even if not, this post may show you some interesting Windows frameworks to look at.
However, if your goal is to write a multiplatform application, you are probably looking for something like Qt or even Electron (if you don’t mind the umpteenth Chrome installation on your computer).</p>

<p>The Win32 API is probably the longest-living user interface framework still in use, with its initial release through Windows NT 3.1 in 1993 and its origins dating back to Windows 1.0 for 16-bit processors of 1985.<br>
It even predates the first C++ standard by a few years.
As such, don’t expect any fancy OOP classes or templates.
All you get is a purely procedural C interface, whose manual resource management and lack of encapsulation can make your life unnecessarily difficult in 2020.<br>
However, it has two major advantages no other Windows framework can offer:
Being the native user interface API, it comes preinstalled on every Windows version without requiring you to ship additional dependencies.
Furthermore, Microsoft has been keeping the API stable for more than 25 years, even when transitioning to 64-bit processors.
Win32 has thereby become a solid foundation not just for applications, but even for various user interface frameworks.</p>

<p>After releasing Win32, Microsoft introduced several other frameworks to ease Windows development, all with their own caveats:</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-foundation-classes">Microsoft Foundation Classes</h2>

<p>The <em>Microsoft Foundation Classes</em> (MFC) certainly make up the most prominent C++ framework around the Win32 API.<br>
They encapsulate almost all parts of the procedural Win32 API into object-oriented C++ classes.
They go even further and provide you with things not found in Win32, such as window splitters or helpers for a document/view architecture.
As you can imagine, all these features combined make MFC quite a heavyweight framework.
Your total binary size will increase significantly if you decide to use MFC.
Furthermore, MFC is as old as the Win32 API itself and therefore carrying a lot of legacy on top.<br>
If you want to develop a new Windows application using modern C++, there are usually better alternatives to MFC.</p>

<h2 id="active-template-library">Active Template Library</h2>

<p>The <em>Active Template Library</em> (ATL) proves that Win32 APIs can also be encapsulated into C++ classes in a lighter way.<br>
It is a mostly header-only library providing smart pointers and RAII wrappers around a delicate part of Win32, namely COM.
ATL is mature code with a stable interface, and as it comes bundled with Visual Studio, you don’t have the burden of managing the dependency yourself.
Consequently, you are advised to use it whenever your application deals with COM.<br>
There is no point in doing COM without ATL in 2020.</p>

<h2 id="windows-template-library">Windows Template Library</h2>

<p>The <em>Windows Template Library</em> (WTL) builds on top of ATL to provide similar template classes around the Win32 user interface APIs, not just COM.
It can be considered a lightweight alternative to MFC.<br>
However, it is a project run by a single Microsoft employee and severely lacking documentation, which is why I haven’t used it for my applications yet.
Your mileage may vary though.</p>

<h2 id="windows-implementation-library">Windows Implementation Library</h2>

<p>A young member to the 3-letter abbreviated frameworks is the <em>Windows Implementation Library</em> (WIL), another C++ header-only framework.<br>
It provides all sorts of wrappers for automatic resource management and simplified usage of Win32 APIs to make them ready for the modern C++ age.
Sounds exactly what we are looking for, right?
Well, not necessarily.<br>
WIL was originally called the <em>Windows Internal Library</em> and, as the name suggests, used exclusively inside Microsoft for Windows development.
As such, it generally targets the latest version of Windows and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/wil/issues/97#issuecomment-540369663">doesn’t try to be a solution with backward compatibility in mind</a>.
This is no option for the applications I am developing, which may still find themselves running on an ancient Windows XP machine.
After all, backward and forward compatibility is also one of the major advantages of the Win32 API that shouldn’t be sacrificed easily.
No matter if that is a constraint for you or not, WIL is definitely worth a look though.
Even if you’re unable to use it directly, you may be able to take over some of its concepts in your application :)</p>

<h2 id="net-framework-and-net-core">.NET Framework and .NET Core</h2>

<p>Finally, let’s not forget about the <em>.NET Framework</em> and its Windows Forms library for user interface design.<br>
This usually doesn’t fit into an article about C++ development due to its entirely different paradigm:
Code for the .NET Framework is likely written in C#, memory is garbage-collected, and the entire source is compiled to an intermediate language instead of native machine instructions.
However, along with its intuitive UI designer, .NET is often the tool of choice for Windows developers to quickly create graphical applications.
Does that mean we can just drop C++ and go with C# and .NET for all our tasks?
Hell no!</p>

<p>While compiled .NET executables are lightweight enough to fulfill that constraint, they always depend on the heavyweight .NET Framework.
And here comes the culprit:
Different Windows versions ship with different .NET Framework versions preinstalled, and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies">compatibility matrix</a> isn’t that easy.<br>
You want to target Windows 7?
Then your application needs to be written for .NET Framework 3.5, which is the only version that comes with Windows 7.
But keep in mind that your app won’t run under Windows 8 or 10 out of the box, which only ship with .NET Framework 4.x.
Yes, you read that right, .NET Framework 4.x won’t run applications written for .NET Framework 3.5.<br>
You are also screwed if you jumped on the train too early:
.NET Framework 1.x and all applications written for it are no longer supported starting with Windows 7.<br>
And if you still need to target out-of-the-box Windows XP installations, .NET Framework is no solution for you at all, because it doesn’t come preinstalled on XP.</p>

<p>Of course, the situation is different if you develop around a .NET Framework version that works on all your target platforms and always ship its installation package along with your application.
But then your software can no longer be considered lightweight or self-contained.
It may even require an installation with administrative rights on the target computer, which is the last thing we want here.</p>

<p>The experts among you may come and tell me:
Hey, there is a new kid in town.<br>
It’s called <em>.NET Core</em> and <em>.NET Native</em> and supports compiling C# code to native executables without any external framework dependencies!<br>
That’s right and I’m pretty sure it has a bright future.
However, it only targets Windows 10, which makes it no option if you need to support older Windows versions.</p>

<h2 id="recent-attempts">Recent attempts</h2>

<p>Since the release of Windows 8 in 2012, Microsoft has been trying to move people away from Win32 and came up with a variety of new frameworks:
<em>WinRT</em>, <em>UWP</em>, <em>WinJS</em>, <em>ReactXP</em>, and more recently <em>WinUI</em>.<br>
So far, none of this has proven to be a long-time safe bet.
WinJS confirms these fears, having already been abandoned after just 4 years.
And yet another time, all of these frameworks are no options if your application needs to run under Windows 7 or earlier.</p>



<p>As you see, nothing beats the backward and forward compatibility as well as the size of an application developed using only Win32 API.
Some lightweight C++ frameworks exist though, which wrap nicely around Win32 APIs and help us in situations where a pure C interface would be unnecessarily difficult to use.</p>

<p>Win32 is an integral part of the Windows operating system, which is not going to disappear tomorrow.
Due to the large reliance of components like .NET Framework on Win32, it is also unlikely that it ever will.
And as long as Windows system applications like Explorer and huge codebases like Microsoft Office are based around Win32, it is still a safe bet for writing new applications.</p>

<p>In the next posts, I am going to write a small DPI-aware wizard-style application using modern C++ features and Win32 API.
Making your application look properly on today’s high-resolution screens is one of the most neglected aspects in Win32 development.
I will also present some useful C++ wrappers along the way.</p>

<p>Welcome to the first part of the series of posts where I will guide you through the steps for creating a modern web application in Python and deploying it to the cloud using Elastic Beanstalk. By the end of this article, you will have a “Hello World” application available on the internet.</p>



<p>Pre-requisites </p>



<ul><li>Basic Python knowledge.</li></ul>



<h3>What is this blog post series about?</h3>



<p>You’ll find this series interesting if you want to create an app in Python that other people on the internet can use. This is actually not as trivial as it may seem. There is a lot of stuff you need to do. If you’ve never deployed a production-grade web application, I strongly suggest you read this series in the consecutive order starting with this post. If you’re an experienced engineer, feel free to review the table of contents and jump to the post that interests you the most.</p>



<h3>All posts in this series</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://blog.seamlesscloud.io/2020/07/how-to-deploy-a-python-flask-app-to-aws-elastic-beanstalk/">Part 1: How to deploy a Python Flask app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.seamlesscloud.io/2020/07/automated-deployment-to-aws-elastic-beanstalk-using-github-actions/">Part 2: Automated deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Github Actions.</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.seamlesscloud.io/2020/07/aws-elastic-beanstalk-infrastructure-in-code-with-terraform/">Part 3: AWS Elastic Beanstalk infrastructure in code with Terraform.</a></li><li>Part 4: In progress…</li></ul>



<p>Let’s jump right into it!</p>



<h2>Basic Flask Application</h2>



<p>Before we make our application available on the internet, let’s make sure we have it working locally. For the purposes of this article, we will need a simple web application, and the simplest way to make it in Python is&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flask</a>. If you don’t have it installed, please follow the instructions in their&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/" rel="noreferrer noopener">documentation</a>.</p>



<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we don’t really need a fancy application, a simple “Hello World” would do. Let’s just copy and paste a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application">Minimal Flask Application code</a>. Let’s create a file `application.py` and put the following code into it:</p>



<pre><code>from flask import Flask
application = Flask(__name__)


@application.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'</code></pre>



<div><p>Important!</p><p>Please note that the instance of Flask object is called `application` instead of `app` as in Flask documentation. This is actually important for the next step in this article. The default setting of AWS Elastic Beanstalk is to look into the file named `application.py` for the `application` variable. You can override this behavior later if you want.</p></div>



<p>Now you need to run the following in your terminal:</p>



<pre><code>export FLASK_APP=application.py &amp;&amp; flask run</code></pre>



<p>To check that it worked, please open the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/">http://127.0.0.1:5000/</a>&nbsp;URL in your browser. You should see this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-21-at-2.30.31-PM.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>That’s not the next big thing in the web applications world, but this is enough for us at the moment. Let’s deploy it somewhere, so it’s not just on our local machine.</p>



<h2>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</h2>



<p>There are hundreds of different services to host your application. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a decent choice for the following reasons:</p>



<ol><li>AWS infrastructure has everything in the world. You can probably spend your whole life learning all their services. As you develop your application, you may have different needs at different times, and chances are high AWS already can satisfy them.</li><li>Easy to get started. I will prove it by the end of this tutorial.</li><li>Scalable. We will get more into scalability later in this blog post series.</li></ol>



<h3>Setting up an account in AWS</h3>



<p>First things first, let’s create an account in AWS. You can do it here -&gt;&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://aws.amazon.com/free/</a>. If you already have an account in AWS – that’s awesome, you can use it.</p>



<div><p>Important!</p><p>If you’re new to AWS, you’ll get access to a free tier account for the first year. But you need to enter your credit card information to create an account. Throughout this tutorial, we’re going to use mostly free resources. However, I cannot guarantee that at the time you’re reading this article, AWS pricing is the same. Please be careful with settings in AWS and pay attention to the services you enable.</p></div>



<h3>Creating your first Elastic Beanstalk Application</h3>



<p>Now, let’s sign-in into the AWS console -&gt;&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">https://aws.amazon.com/console/</a>. At the top left corner of the screen, click on “Services,” type “Elastic Beanstalk” in the search bar, and click on the first result.</p>

I remember the first time I built user preferences into an app. At first, users just needed to be able to opt in or out of our weekly emails. "No big deal," I thought, "I'll just add a new field on the Users table." For a while, that was fine. A few weeks later, my boss asked me if we could let users opt into push notifications. Fine, that's just one more column on the database. Can't hurt, right?</p>
<p>You probably see where this is going.</p>
<p>Within months, my user table had 40 columns, and while <a href="https://nerderati.com/2017/01/03/postgresql-tables-can-have-at-most-1600-columns/">Postgres can handle it</a>, it gets pretty tricky for new devs to keep up with all of them. You can imagine it looked pretty similar to this settings screen of Quora.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Postgres provides rich support for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html">JSON fields</a>, which can be very handy in situations like mine. Both JSON data types (<code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code>) allow you to store entire objects or lists directly in your database. This means that you can store any number of user preferences in one column.</p>

<h2 id="why-two-types-of-json-fields"><a href="#why-two-types-of-json-fields" aria-label="why two types of json fields permalink"></a>Why two types of JSON fields?</h2>
<p>JSON support in Postgres gives you the flexibility of a document store database like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">Mongo</a> with the speed and structure of a relational database. JSON support is powerful, but because it comes in two types (<code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code>), it's helpful to understand which is the right choice for your application.
The <code>json</code> data type was <a href="https://datavirtuality.com/blog-json-in-postgresql/">added in Postgres 9.2</a> and enhanced in 9.3. This new data type allowed you to store <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> directly in your database and even query it. The problem was that <code>json</code> data was stored as a special kind of <code>text</code> field, so it was slow to query.</p>
<p>Postgres <a href="https://www.compose.com/articles/faster-operations-with-the-jsonb-data-type-in-postgresql/">introduced <code>jsonb</code> in 9.4</a> to combat this issue. Unlike <code>json</code> fields, <code>jsonb</code> fields are stored in a <strong>binary structure</strong> rather than text strings. While this means that writes are slightly slower, querying from <code>jsonb</code> fields is significantly faster. It also allows you to index <code>jsonb</code> fields. This makes <code>jsonb</code> the preferred format for most JSON data stored in Postgres, and the typical choice for Django applications.</p>
<h2 id="querying-jsonb-data-in-postgres"><a href="#querying-jsonb-data-in-postgres" aria-label="querying jsonb data in postgres permalink"></a>Querying JSONB data in Postgres</h2>
<p>The query syntax for accessing JSON in Postgres is not typical SQL. You have to use the specific <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html">JSON operators and functions</a>, so queries on JSON data look different from other Postgres queries.</p>
<p>For example, if you stored the following data in a Postgres table called <code>profiles</code>:</p>

























<table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>name</th><th>preferences</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><code>Mike</code></td><td><code>{"sms": false, "daily_email": true, "weekly_email": true}</code></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><code>Lucy</code></td><td><code>{"sms": true, "daily_email": false, "weekly_email": false}</code></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><code>Harriet</code></td><td><code>{"sms": true, "daily_email": true, "weekly_email": true}</code></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>And you wanted to query all users who have opted into your <code>daily_email</code>, you'd write a query like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> profiles
<span>where</span> <span>(</span>preferences<span>-</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>'daily_email'</span><span>)</span>::<span>boolean</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which would give you back the rows for <code>Mike</code> and <code>Harriet</code>.
I'm pretty good with SQL, but using JSON operators always slows me down. Fortunately, Django offers support for JSONB fields, so you don't have to become an expert at querying JSON in Postgres.</p>
<h2 id="django-support-for-jsonb"><a href="#django-support-for-jsonb" aria-label="django support for jsonb permalink"></a>Django support for JSONB</h2>
<p>Since Django 1.9, the popular Python framework has supported <code>jsonb</code> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/fields">several other Postgres-specific fields</a>. Native Django support means that creating <code>jsonb</code> fields, using them in your models, inserting data into them, and querying from them are all possible with Django's ORM. Let's take a look at how you can get started using <code>jsonb</code> with Django.</p>
<h3 id="creating-jsonb-fields-using-migrations"><a href="#creating-jsonb-fields-using-migrations" aria-label="creating jsonb fields using migrations permalink"></a>Creating JSONB fields using migrations</h3>
<p>Django's Postgres module comes with several field classes that you can import and add to your models. If you want to use a JSON field, import the <code>JSONField</code> class and use it for your model's property. In this example, we'll call the field <code>preferences</code>:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> models
<span>from</span> django<span>.</span>contrib<span>.</span>postgres<span>.</span>fields <span>import</span> JSONField
 
<span>class</span> <span>Profile</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    name <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>CharField<span>(</span>max_length<span>=</span><span>200</span><span>)</span>
    preferences <span>=</span> JSONField<span>(</span><span>)</span>
 
    <span>def</span> <span>__str__</span><span>(</span>self<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> self<span>.</span>name</code></pre></div>
<p>Django only supports the <code>jsonb</code> column type, so when you run your migrations, Django will create a table definition like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> app_profile
<span>(</span>
    id <span>serial</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span> <span>constraint</span> app_profile_pkey <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    preferences jsonb <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="adding-data-to-jsonb-fields"><a href="#adding-data-to-jsonb-fields" aria-label="adding data to jsonb fields permalink"></a>Adding data to JSONB fields</h3>
<p>Because JSON fields don't enforce a particular schema, Django will convert any valid Python data type (dictionary, list, string, number, boolean) into the appropriate JSON. For example, if you want to add a new row to the <code>app_profile</code> table created above, you can run the following in your Django application:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> app<span>.</span>models <span>import</span> Profile
 

p <span>=</span> Profile<span>(</span>name<span>=</span><span>"Tanner"</span><span>,</span> preferences<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>'sms'</span><span>:</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>'daily_email'</span><span>:</span> <span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>'weekly_email'</span><span>:</span> <span>True</span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
p<span>.</span>save<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will create a new user named <code>Tanner</code> who will receive our <code>daily_email</code> and <code>weekly_email</code>, but no <code>sms</code> messages.</p>
<h3 id="querying-jsonb-fields"><a href="#querying-jsonb-fields" aria-label="querying jsonb fields permalink"></a>Querying JSONB fields</h3>
<p>Django uses the double underscore pattern from <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/queries/#field-lookups">field lookups</a> to query JSON object keys. For example, if you want to get all the Profiles for users who have opted into our <code>daily_email</code>, you'd use the following code:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>results <span>=</span> Profile<span>.</span>objects<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>preferences__daily_email<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to check the SQL query that Django runs, you can print it from the <code>query</code> property on the results object:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span>results<span>.</span>query<span>)</span>

SELECT <span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"id"</span><span>,</span> <span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"name"</span><span>,</span> <span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"preferences"</span> 
FROM <span>"app_profile"</span> WHERE <span>(</span><span>"app_profile"</span><span>.</span><span>"preferences"</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> daily_email<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>'true'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, the query is slightly different from the one I manually wrote above (I cast <code>daily_email</code> to a <code>boolean</code>), but it accomplishes the same thing.
You can also filter records based on the keys they contain. For example, if some user accounts were created before you added the <code>sms</code> option, you might want to find them and let the users know about the new option. You can use the <code>isnull</code> field lookup on the <code>sms</code> key in your JSON data:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>results <span>=</span> Profile<span>.</span>objects<span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>preferences__sms__isnull<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are many other ways to filter queries using JSON fields, so be sure to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/#querying-jsonfield">check out the official Django docs for more</a>.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-of-jsonb-fields"><a href="#limitations-of-jsonb-fields" aria-label="limitations of jsonb fields permalink"></a>Limitations of JSONB fields</h2>
<p>It's worth noting that <code>jsonb</code> fields come with some drawbacks. I've already mentioned that it takes slightly longer to write data to <code>jsonb</code> fields than <code>json</code> because the JSON string must be converted to binary, but there are other reasons to avoid <code>jsonb</code> fields.</p>
<p>First, if your data needs to enforce a strict schema, JSON may not be an ideal choice. While you <a href="https://blog.hagander.net/json-field-constraints-228/">can use check constraints</a> to enforce the use of specific fields, this isn't natively supported in Django, so you'll need to write your own migrations to accomplish this.</p>
<p>A better way to address this shortcoming is by writing Django validation rules to enforce the structure you want. If you don't want to write the validation rules yourself, there's a popular package called <a href="https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"><code>jsonschema</code></a> that I'd recommend.</p>
<p>Another drawback to using JSON fields is handling changes to the shape of your data. If you want to add a new column to a database table in Postgres using Django, you simply update your model and run a migration. If you want to add a new field to a JSON column, it isn't quite as straightforward.</p>
<p>A pattern I've used before is to create a custom migration that loops through the affected records and updates each one individually. This naive method works for relatively small datasets, but it might not be a good idea if you need to update 1 million profiles in a production database. In that case, it might be better to write your code to handle the existence or absence of the key or run a <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-update-objects-inside-jsonb-arrays-with-postgresql-5c4e03be256a/">batch update on the JSON object</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While JSON data types come with some drawbacks, they are useful in situations where you need more flexibility in your data structure. Thanks to Django's native support for <code>jsonb</code>, you can get started using JSON data in your web applications without learning all the native Postgres query operators. </p>
<p>Next time you need more flexibility in your data model and want to benefit from the strengths of Postgres give <code>jsonb</code> fields a try.</p>

    <p>Say you want to display the contents of a file on the command line. The first tool we most of us reach for is <code>cat</code>, which does a fine job at just this.
But what happens when you are on a Linux machine and when you try to cat a file this happens:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat file.txt
-bash: cat: command not found
</code></pre></div><p>or even:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat file.txt
bash: fork: retry: No child processes
</code></pre></div><p>This post explores this idea and was a feature of this <a href="https://oops.cmdchallenge.com/#/oops_print_file_contents">challenge</a> where you needed to display a file’s contents without using any utility outside of the shell.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="using-shell-built-ins-redirection-and-subshell">Using shell built-ins, redirection and subshell</h2>
<p>Using the shell builtin <code>read</code> you can display the contents of a file, without a forking a new process:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>while</span> read line; <span>do</span>
  echo $line;
<span>done</span> &lt;file.txt
</code></pre></div><p>From the help page for <code>read</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One line is read from the standard input, or from file descriptor FD if the -u option is supplied, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, the contents of file.txt are redirected to the STDIN of <code>read</code>, which processes the input line by line, until it reaches the end of the file. <code>read</code> also can take a file descriptor as its input instead of STDIN, so this will also work:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">exec 3&lt;file.txt <span># Assign file descriptor 3 for reading</span>
<span>while</span> read -u <span>3</span> line; <span>do</span>
  echo $line
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This ends up being a lot more typing than just <code>cat file.txt</code>. With the <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code> there is a another way to display a file’s contents without using <code>cat</code>:</p>
<p>this method uses redirection and command substitution, and is mentioned in the bash man page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The command substitution $(cat file) can be replaced by the equivalent but faster $(&lt; file).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s faster, because you are not forking a cat, but does it matter? Probably not, and may not be clear to everyone what you are doing, but you can see a difference with a quick test on your shell:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ time <span>for</span> n in <span>{</span>1..1000<span>}</span>; <span>do</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    echo <span>$(</span>&lt;/etc/resolv.conf<span>)</span> &gt;/dev/null; <span>\
</span><span></span>  <span>done</span>

real	0m0.977s
user	0m0.380s
sys	0m0.604s
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ time <span>for</span> n in <span>{</span>1..1000<span>}</span>; <span>do</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    cat /etc/resolv.conf &gt;/dev/null;
  <span>done</span>

real	0m1.980s
user	0m0.626s
sys	0m1.224s
</code></pre></div><p>This syntax <code>$(&lt;file.text)</code> may look a bit strange, what you are doing is command substitution, where the contents of <code>file.txt</code> are sent to STDIN which is then echo’d as STDOUT. If you want to learn a bit more about redirection using <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code> see my earlier post about <a href="https://jarv.org/posts/cat-without-cat/posts/shell-redirection/">shell redirection</a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-other-utilities">Using other utilities</h2>
<p>How about other options? Without using shell built-ins but instead using other standard utilities you can also cat without cat:</p>
<p><code>ul</code> might inadvertently underline some words in your file but I think it might be the only way to cat a file with only two characters.</p>
<p>If you didn’t already guess, <code>tac</code> is GNU core util that is the reverse of <code>cat</code> so if you want to be clever you can pipe the output of <code>tac</code> to <code>tac</code> which is just a <code>cat</code>.</p>
<p>Of course using tools like <code>sed</code>, <code>perl</code>, <code>python</code>, etc. will allow you to cat files as well, happy cat’ing!</p>

<![CDATA[Beware of Async/Await]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
      

      

      

      


      <p>Can you spot the problem with this piece of code?</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Take a minute to look. Code just like this probably exists in more JavaScript codebases
        than not. Sometimes it flies right under the nose of people who know better,
        myself included. In fact a case where I made this mistake was what prompted me
        to write this post in the first place.</p>
      <p>I'll give you a hint. Here's what it looks like without async/await syntax:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>members</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>nonMembers</span> <span>=&gt;</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Do you see it now? It was actually tricky to even write this version, because
        this mistake is so hard to make <em>without</em> async/await.</p>
      <p>Here's what the above looks like in the network log:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/staggered.png" alt="Staggered waterfall"></p>
      <p>We've taken two independent, asynchronous tasks, and put them into a <strong>sequence</strong>.
        This function takes twice as long as it needs to.</p>
      <p>Here's what it should be:</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> both <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Or, without async/await:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span>
          <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>both</span> <span>=&gt;</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>And here's what that looks like:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/parallel.png" alt="Parallel waterfall"></p>
      <h2 id="easy-mistakes">Easy mistakes </h2>
      <p>Take note how much more complicated the "bad" version was when written as plain
        promises. The Promises API encourages parallelism, and gets clunky when you need to put
        things in sequence. Async/await largely arose as a solution for when you <em>do</em>
        need things to happen in sequence, like when you need to feed the output of one
        request into the next as a parameter. And it does arguably make both cases at
        least a little cleaner. But importantly, it inverts them, making <strong>the
sequential flow easier than the parallel flow</strong>.</p>
      <p>Even if you understand the Promises code that the syntax ends up translating to, it's
        easy to fall into this trap. If you <em>don't</em> already understand Promises and
        what exactly async/await is really doing, even more so.</p>
      <p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that async/await are "bad" (or perhaps,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">"considered harmful"</a>).
        Especially in languages that don't have a reasonable API like Promises, or do
        have other restrictions around closures that make them less trivial to use,
        async/await can make code much more readable overall.</p>
      <p>But they do come with a pretty large pitfall. Both the strength and the weakness of
        the syntax is that it allows us to take asynchronous things and pretend they're
        sequential again. Our brains have an easier time reasoning about sequential
        processes.</p>
      <p>But I think it's a shame that the easiest and clearest way to write
        something with async/await is, more often than not, wrong. And wrong in a subtle
        way that may never be noticed, because it only affects performance, not
        correctness.</p>
      <p>I'm a big believer in languages and libraries that make it easy to do the
        thing that's usually right, and hard to do the thing that's usually wrong. That
        said, I don't have a proposal for how async/await could have been done
        differently. I just regret the way things turned out.</p>
      <p>But at the very least, I think it's increasingly important - as more and more
        languages adopt this syntax - that people are aware of how it can easily be
        misused.</p>
      <h2 id="mitigating-the-problem">Mitigating the problem </h2>
      <p>If you're ever not sure how your code is behaving, look at the
        waterfall graph and see if you might have an easy opportunity to make your
        application much faster.</p>
      <p>You can also use this rule of thumb: If an <code>await</code>ed
        function call doesn't use the result from another <code>await</code>ed function call (or
        something derived from the result), you should use <code>Promise.all()</code> to make
        them happen at the same time.</p>

<![CDATA[What Is the PCI of Bank Payments?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Credit card users today can transact online with peace of mind because card-accepting merchants are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). PCI DSS was established in 2006 by a consortium of credit card companies to combat online fraud. <a href="#1">[1]</a> It sets exacting requirements on how merchants store, process, and transmit credit card data. <a href="#2">[2]</a> Merchants that don’t comply risk getting fined or even outright banned from the card networks.</p><p>Security is also a concern for bank payments. If anything, bank account numbers are even more sensitive than credit card numbers because they don’t change. In this post, we’ll examine the impact of ACH payment fraud, describe upcoming compliance requirements, and share what we consider to be security best practices.</p></div><h5>Sizing Bank Payments Fraud</h5><p>Before diving into a solution, it's worth assessing the fraud problem. After all, bank transfers have historically been perceived as the most secure payment method. A Federal Reserve study found that ACH payments in 2015 had the lowest fraud rate of all US payment methods at 0.0008%. <a href="#4">[4]</a> That works out to just 8 fraudulent cents for every $10,000 moved.<br></p><p>However, a deeper look reveals how that perception is challenged as bank payments volume moves online. The most recent figures show ACH volume on the internet grew to $2.9 trillion in 2018 up 14.2% from the prior year. <a href="#5">[5]</a> That same year, ACH was the only payment method to see an increase in fraud rates, according to research from the Association of Financial Professionals. <a href="#6">[6]</a> The percentage of surveyed organizations that encountered ACH credit fraud spiked to 20%, up from 7% a year prior. 33% of the surveyed organizations had encountered ACH debit fraud, up from 28% a year prior.</p><p>So ACH fraud has risen sharply in recent years. What security rules are in place to combat this?</p><h5>The NACHA Response</h5><p>The closest analogue to PCI DSS is the ACH Security Framework Rule introduced in 2013 by NACHA, the ACH network’s governing body. In a nutshell, the rule requires ACH network participants to “protect the confidentiality and integrity of [non-public personal information] until its destruction.” <a href="#7">[7]</a> Compliance is verified through an annual audit conducted by your Depository Financial Institution (DFI).</p><p>Large-scale ACH originators should know about an upcoming amendment to these rules that will require every non-DFI ACH originator, third-party sender, and <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/the-difference-between-a-third-party-sender-and-a-third-party-service-provider-in-payments" target="_blank">third-party service provider</a> to render bank account numbers unreadable when stored electronically.<a href="#8">[8]</a> Its enforcement dates are staggered by transaction count:</p><ul role="list"><li>Entities with more than 6 million ACH payments annually must comply by June 30, 2021.</li><li>Entities with more than 2 million ACH payments annually must comply by June 30, 2022.</li></ul><p>A couple things to note here. Firstly, with the history of PCI DSS as a guide, we predict that eventually <em>all</em> ACH participants will be required to obfuscate bank account information. Secondly, NACHA intentionally doesn’t mandate any particular data security methods or techniques. We have a few recommendations.</p><p>‍<br></p><h5>Security Best Practices</h5><p>Securing bank account information should be a foremost priority even if NACHA doesn’t prescribe how. We at Modern Treasury consider the following practices to be table stakes for businesses that accept bank payments:</p><ul role="list"><li>Use AES 256 encryption for data at rest and TLS to protect the contents of data in transit. Create a process with your team to rotate keys every 90 days.</li><li>Run internal and external vulnerability scans at least quarterly. Work with certified vendors to detect whether your systems are subject to known vulnerabilities.</li><li>Implement role-based access controls to limit which of your internal users can see sensitive information. Keeping permissions on a need-to-know basis minimizes the attack surface of your system.</li><li>Keep an audit trail of your internal users’ read and write actions. Here’s an <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/audit-logs" target="_blank">example</a> of the one we shipped.</li><li>Choose <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/how-to-get-a-soc-2" target="_blank">SOC 2</a> compliant vendors. Any data breach that your external vendor suffers is a data breach that your business suffers. You can minimize that risk by requiring your vendors to pass the technical audit of their security practices.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>One More Thing</h5><p>Here we’ve shared some thoughts on keeping bank account numbers out of the hands of attackers. Another thing to consider is whether you are paying and charging the right bank accounts in the first place. This is why bank account validation is so important. You should know who is taking custody of the funds you’re sending. NACHA is implementing an account validation rule that requires merchants to validate first-use consumer accounts, effective March 23, 2021. <a href="#9">[9]</a> Accepted account validation methods include:</p><ul role="list"><li>ACH prenotification</li><li>ACH micro-transaction verification</li><li>Third party validation services, e.g. Plaid</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>Conclusion</h5><div><p>Sending bank payments securely can be daunting. One option to accept bank payments while reducing your data security burden is to work with a provider like Modern Treasury. We can help you integrate with your bank securely and scale your business’ payment operations.

									<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: It gives your seed investors a level of extreme anti-dilution protection that is virtually unheard of in startup finance, making it worse than seed equity and conventional convertible notes in terms of economics for most seed stage companies. There are far better, more balanced ways to “clarify” ownership for seed investors without forcing founders and employees to absorb additional dilution risk.</p>
<p>Related Reading: TechCrunch:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/why-convertible-notes-are-safer-than-safes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why convertible notes are safer than SAFEs.&nbsp;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2020/01/03/race-to-the-bottom-startup-lawyers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Race to the Bottom in Startup Law</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A regular underlying theme you’ll read on SHL is that key players in the startup community are incredibly talented at taking a viewpoint that is clearly (to experienced players) investor-biased, but spinning / marketing it as somehow “startup friendly.”&nbsp; And lawyers <a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2017/01/01/avoid-captive-company-counsel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">captive to the interests of investors</a> are always happy to play along, knowing that inexperienced teams can be easily duped.</p>
<p>One example is how “moving fast” in startup financing negotiations is always a good thing for entrepreneurs. Investors are diversified, wealthy, and 100x as experienced as founders in deal terms and economics, but it’s somehow in the <em>founders’</em> interest to sign whatever template the investor puts on the table, instead of actually reviewing, negotiating, and processing the long-term implications? Right. Thanks for the awesome insight, champ.</p>
<p>Y Combinator’s move to have its SAFEs convert on a post-money, instead of pre-money, basis is another great example. Their argument is that it helps “clarify” how the SAFEs will convert on the cap table. Clarity is great, right? Who can argue with clarity?</p>
<p>What’s not emphasized prominently enough is that the way they delivered that “clarity” is by implementing anti-dilution protection for SAFE investors (like themselves) that is more aggressive than anything remotely “standard” in the industry; and that wasn’t necessary at all to provide “clarity.” <strong>Under YC’s new SAFE, the common stock absorbs <span>all</span> dilution from any subsequent SAFE or convertible note rounds until an equity round, while SAFE holders are fully protected from that dilution. That is <span>crazy</span>.</strong> It’s the equivalent of “full ratchet” anti-dilution, which has become almost non-existent in startup finance because of how company unfriendly it is. In fact, it’s&nbsp;<em>worse</em> than full ratchet because in a typical anti-dilution context it only triggers if the valuation is lower. In this case, SAFE holders get fully protected for convertible dilution even if the valuation cap is <em>higher</em>. It’s a cap table grab that in a significant number of contexts won’t be made up for by other more minor changes to the SAFE (around pro-rata rights and option pool treatment) if a company ends up doing multiple convertible rounds.</p>
<p>When you’re raising your initial seed money, you have absolutely no idea what the future might hold. <strong>The notion that you can predict at your initial SAFE closing whether you’ll be able to raise an equity round as your next funding (in order to convert your SAFEs), or instead need another convertible round (in which case your SAFE holders are fully protected from dilution), is absurd. Honest advisors and investors will admit it.</strong> Given the dynamics of most seed stage startups, YC’s post-money SAFE therefore offers the <span>worst</span> economics (for companies) of all seed funding structures. Founders should instead opt for a structure that doesn’t penalize them, with dilution, for being unable to predict the future.</p>
<p>Yes, YC’s original (pre-money) SAFE has contributed to a problem for many SAFE investors, but that problem is the result of an imbalanced lack of accountability in the original SAFE structure; not a need to re-do conversion economics. As mentioned in the above TechCrunch article, the reason convertible notes are still the dominant convertible seed instrument across the country is that the maturity date in a convertible note serves as a valuable “accountability” mechanism in a seed financing. A 2-3 year maturity gives founders a sense of urgency to get to a conversion event, or at least stay in communication with investors about their financing plans. By eliminating maturity, SAFEs enabled a culture of runaway serial seed financings constantly delaying conversion, creating significant uncertainty for seed investors.</p>
<p><strong>YC now wants to “fix” the problem they themselves enabled, but the “solution” goes too far in the opposite direction by requiring the common stock (founders and early employees) to absorb an inordinate amount of dilution risk.</strong> If “clarity” around conversion economics is <em>really</em> the concern of seed investors, there are already several far more balanced options for delivering that clarity:</p>
<p><span><strong>Seed Equity</strong></span> – Series Seed templates already exist that are dramatically more streamlined than full Series A docs, but solidify ownership for seed investors on Day 1, with <em>normal</em> weighted average (not full ratchet) anti-dilution. 100% clarity on ownership. Closing a seed equity deal is usually a quarter to a third of the cost of a Series A, because the docs are simpler. Seed equity is an under-appreciated way to align the common stock and seed investors in terms of post-funding dilution. Yes, it takes a bit more time than just signing a template SAFE, but it’s an increasingly popular option both among entrepreneurs (because it reduces dilution) and investors (because it provides certainty); and for good reason.</p>
<p><span><strong>Harden the denominator</strong></span> – Another option I’ve mentioned before in <a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2017/03/04/notes-safes-extra-dilutive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Notes and SAFEs are Extra Dilutive</a> is to simply “harden” the denominator (the capitalization) that will be used for conversion on Day 1, while letting the valuation float (typically capped). This ensures <em>everyone</em> (common and investors) are diluted by subsequent investors, just like an equity round, while allowing you to easily model conversion at a valuation cap from Day 1. <strong>If the <em>real</em> motivation for the SAFE changes was in fact the ability to more easily model SAFE ownership on the cap table – instead of shifting economics in favor of investors – this (hardening the conversion denominator) would’ve been a far more logical approach than building significant anti-dilution mechanisms into the valuation cap.</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Add a Maturity Date</strong></span> – Again, the reason why, outside of Silicon Valley, so many seed investors balk at the SAFE structure altogether is because of the complete lack of accountability mechanisms it contains. No voting rights or board seat. No maturity date. Just hand over your money, and hope for the best. I don’t represent a single tech investor – all companies – and yet I agree that SAFEs created more problems than they solved. Convertible notes with reasonable maturity dates (2-3 years) are a simple way for investors and entrepreneurs to get aligned on seed fundraising plans, and if after an initial seed round the company needs to raise a second seed and extend maturity, it forces a valuable conversation with investors so everyone can get aligned.</p>
<p>Conventional convertible notes – which are far more of an (air quotes) “standard” across the country than any SAFE structure – don’t protect the noteholders from all dilution that happens before an equity round. That leaves flexibility for additional note fundraising (which very often happens, at improved valuations) before maturity, with the noteholders sharing in that dilution. If a client asks me whether they should take a low-interest capped convertible note with a 3-yr maturity v. a capped Post-Money SAFE for their first seed raise, my answer will be the convertible note. Every time, unless they are somehow 100% positive that their next raise is an equity round. The legal fees will be virtually identical.</p>
<p>Before anyone even tries to argue that signing YC’s template is nevertheless worth it because otherwise money is “wasted” on legal fees, let’s be crystal clear: <strong>the economics of the post-money SAFE can end up&nbsp;<span>so bad</span> for a startup that a material % of the cap table worth as much as 7-figures can shift over to the seed investors (relative to a different structure) if the company ends up doing additional convertible rounds after its original SAFE; which <span>very</span> often happens.</strong> Do the math.</p>
<p>The whole “you should mindlessly sign this template or OMG the legal fees!” argument is just one more example of the sleight-of-hand rhetoric peddled by very clever investors to dupe founders into penny wise, pound foolish decisions that end up lining an investor’s pocket. It can take only a few sentences, or even the deletion of a handful of words, to make the economics of a seed instrument more balanced. Smart entrepreneurs understand that experienced advisors can be extremely valuable (and efficient) “equalizers” in these sorts of negotiations.</p>
<p>When I first reviewed the new post-money SAFE, my reaction was: what on earth is YC doing? I had a similar reaction to YC’s so-called <a href="https://siliconhillslawyer.com/2019/03/03/standard-term-sheets-problem-yc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Standard” Series A Term Sheet</a>, which itself is far more investor friendly than the marketing conveys and should be rejected by entrepreneurs. Ironically, YC’s changes to the SAFE were purportedly driven by the need for “clarity,” and yet their recently released Series A term sheet leaves enormous control points vague and prone to gaming post-term sheet; providing far <em>less</em> clarity than a typical term sheet. The extra “clarity” in the Post-Money SAFE favors investors. The vagueness in the YC Series A term sheet also favors investors. I guess YC’s preference for clarity or vagueness rests on whether it benefits the money. Surprised? <span><strong>Entrepreneurs and employees (common stockholders) are going to get hurt by continuing to let investors unilaterally set their own so-called “standards.”</strong></span></p>
<p>One might argue that YC’s shift (as an accelerator and investor) from overly founder-biased to overly investor-biased docs parallels the natural pricing progression of a company that initially needed to subsidize adoption, but has now achieved market leverage. Low-ball pricing early to get traction (be very founder friendly), but once you’ve got the brand and market …</p></div></div>

<h2>1: Fiverr to Sell Your Services Online</h2>
<p>Finding a reliable and reputable website to sell your services as a freelancer on an international scale is key to a freelancers success.  Fiverr is free to sign up as a freelancer (they do charge a commission on each sale). They have over 300 categories, accommodating a wide range of services and professional skills and it requests freelancers to take online exams to prove their efficiency and professionalism.</p>
<p>Connecting professional freelancers with businesses around the globe, we would recommend Fiverr to anyone thinking about setting themselves up as a freelancer, whether it be full time or on a part time basis. Fiverr’s platform is really easy to navigate and as a freelancer you can create gigs which are basically the services you are offering to clients. This gives you creative control over how you promote yourself on the platform as well as set the prices you want to charge. Fiverr does take a percentage of the money you make though, so that’s important to bear in mind when pricing your gigs.</p>
<p>Sign up to <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiverr here</a>.</p>

		</div><div id="panel-52-0-0-2" data-index="2">			<div><p><img src="https://click.page/blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://click.page/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/linkedin.jpg" alt="linkedin" width="950" height="370"></p>
<h2>2: LinkedIn to Position Yourself as a Professional</h2>
<p>If you’ve set yourself up a free freelancer Fiverr profile, it’s time to maximise your online exposure. When it comes to social media marketing as a freelancer, LinkedIn is one of the best platforms to use. This professional social media platform allows you to position yourself as an industry expert and freelancer. You can even share a link to your Fiverr profile through LinkedIn, as well as the services you’re offering.</p>
<p>Another great way to use LinkedIn is to generate new clients and opportunities for yourself. Many businesses use LinkedIn to headhunt or to advertise job opportunities along with projects. As a freelancer, you can use LinkedIn’s job search feature and find freelance opportunities around the world. If you come across an ideal opportunity for your unique skill set and experience, but it is listed as an in-house role, we highly recommend contacting the company directly and ask them whether they’ve ever considered using a professional freelancer. If the company is local to you, consider setting up a meeting with them. Or if they’re far away, a virtual meeting via Skype or Zoom can help you secure an exciting new role. Be confident and don’t undervalue your experience and talent. Businesses are still getting used to the idea that freelancers can offer professional, high-quality services, so it might take time to convince a traditional company to broaden their horizons and benefit from the freelance world.</p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for, set yourself up a professional freelancer profile on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn now</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In my prior posts, we've talked about <a href="https://www.architect.io/blog/using-hashicorp-vault-to-enable-credential-cycling">how to instrument credential cycling</a> and
<a href="https://www.architect.io/blog/how-dynamic-credentialing-makes-apps-portable">why it's important to enable application portability</a>. In this post, we'll take
the notion of credential cycling even further and show how secrets can be
injected into volumes mounted to your applications. Injecting secrets into
mounted volumes is a great way to securely provide credentials to your
applications without forcing all your containers to cycle on every update.</p><h2 id="why-should-we-avoid-container-cycling"><a href="#why-should-we-avoid-container-cycling" aria-label="why should we avoid container cycling permalink"></a>Why should we avoid container cycling?</h2><p>In a cloud-native world, we're taught to invest heavily in our DevOps and
continuous delivery processes to ensure that applications can be deployed
automatically and frequently. This guarantees that new features can be
released to customers safely and quickly. Still,
deployments remain one of the most risky engineering processes and are all too
often the cause for production downtime or outages.
Even if we have a reliable release process, it's always best to avoid needless
use when possible. And since changes to application credentials don't change any
application code, updating credentials on the fly represents low-hanging fruit
for reducing the overall number of deployments.</p><p>There is another reason to avoid container cycling: deployment speed.
Shutting down and starting up any single container takes time; multiply
this by the number of replicas you have and suddenly you find
yourself monitoring a lengthy and risky process. Having applications
read in credentials from the filesystem allows them to more quickly
receive updates without needing to be cycled.</p><h2 id="reading-secrets-from-the-filesystem"><a href="#reading-secrets-from-the-filesystem" aria-label="reading secrets from the filesystem permalink"></a>Reading secrets from the filesystem</h2><p>The cornerstone of our approach to dynamic credentialing will be to read
secrets from volume mounts. So the first thing we'll need to do is to tell
our apps to read in secrets from the file system instead of from environment
variables.</p><p>In this example, we're going to load in credentials to a Postgres instance;

will return a properly configured client for accessing our postgres database.
We've also set it up to cache the client and only generate a new one when the
previous credentials are considered stale. This will allow us to return the
client in a reasonably performant way without needing to read from the file
system on every request.</p><p>Next up we'll want to test out the integration! Let's go ahead and create a
simple method that will create a table, write to the database, read from the
database, and then tear it all down again.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>testDBConnection</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>testDBConnection</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>Great! Let's go ahead and write the two methods above into an <code>index.js</code> file and
create a <code>Dockerfile</code> to help us run it in a container. Don't forget to create a
<code>package.json</code> file for the project and install the <code>pg</code> library too.</p><div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code><span>FROM</span> node<span>:</span>13
<span>WORKDIR</span> /usr/src/app

<span>COPY</span> package*.json ./
<span>RUN</span> npm install

<span>COPY</span> index.js .

<span>CMD</span> <span>[</span><span>"node"</span><span>,</span> <span>"index.js"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div><p>Before we can properly run our image, we need to boot up a postgres
instance:</p><div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ docker run -d -p <span>5432</span>:5432 <span>\</span>
    -e <span>POSTGRES_USER</span><span>=</span>postgres <span>\</span>
    -e <span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span>password <span>\</span>
    -e <span>POSTGRES_DB</span><span>=</span>architect <span>\</span>
    postgres:11</code></pre></div><p>Time to boot up our application and see what happens! Let's build that Docker image and run
it locally!</p><div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ docker build -t credentials-test:latest <span>.</span>
$ docker run credentials-test:latest</code></pre></div><p>Whoop! Seems we haven't mounted the secret onto the container yet and we got a
nasty error. We'll need to write the credentials to a local file that we can then mount
to our application when we run it. Go ahead and copy the json credentials into a
file named, <code>database.json</code>:</p><div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"user"</span><span>:</span> <span>"postgres"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"password"</span><span>:</span> <span>"password"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"database"</span><span>:</span> <span>"architect"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, we're ready to run our application! Let's run it with the flags needed
to mount our local database credentials to the container:</p><div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ docker run <span>\</span>
		-v <span><span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span></span>:/usr/src/secrets:ro <span>\</span>
		-e <span>'DB_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/usr/src/secrets/database.json'</span> <span>\</span>
		-e <span>'DB_HOST=host.docker.internal'</span> <span>\</span>
		credentials-test:latest</code></pre></div><p>Great job! You should have seen the container output the test user
before exiting. You can use this flow with any API server- just call
<code>getPostgresClient()</code> whenever you need to access the database and
you'll be able to update the contents of your mounted volume whenever you need.</p><hr><p>Want to see the whole source? Check it out on GitHub:</p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2>We don’t have all the answers, but we can start asking the right questions</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0290/7756/9635/files/Kids_smartphone_addiction_conversation_book_technology_dependence_mental_health_children_parents_1024x1024.JPG?v=1596118530" alt="Kids smartphone addiction conversation digital technology dependence children mental health partens"></p>
</div>


<p>My twelve-year-old son was actually talking on the phone. For longer than one minute, and not to ask a gaming- or pc-related question to one of his uncles. Instead, he was having a relaxed and alightly giddy conversation with one of my closest and best friends. I took this shot with my son’s own phone, I thought it was an interesting moment.</p>

<p>And it reminded me.</p>

<p>I was visiting another friend the other day - one of these special people who, when you self-publish a book, takes the time and effort to order one for themselves. Awesome.</p>

<p>He introduced me to his kids - who I was meeting for the first time - as the writer of the book he had recently gotten, and said to his oldest daughter (I think she’s 9):</p>
<blockquote>

<p>“I think this might actually be an interesting book for you as well; it’s about screen-time and how much time we spend on digital devices.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminded me heavily of a conversation I had had with people in a workshop I had led back at a congress in November, where we talked about the silent impact digital technology has on our lives, and about my <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/products/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-smartphone-addiction" target="_blank" title="Book Life Beyond" rel="noopener noreferrer">book Life Beyond the Touch Screen.</a>
</p>

<p>One of the participants said she could really see the book - and especially the pages with bold printed quotes and questions - as a great conversation starter about the issues of smartphone addiction and other effects of technology overuse on our mental health.</p>

<p>Turns out; a lot of people thought the same.</p>

<p>Now, why is this so important?</p>

<p>
<h3>Your habits exist between you and your environment</h3>
</p>
<p>I once, for a brief period of time, worked for the organization that organizes “Family Group Conferences” in the Netherlands (De Eigen Kracht Centrale). Even though I studied psychology, one lesson about mental health care I learned at EKC like never before was this:</p>

<p>You can take the alcoholic out of his home environment, and put him in a rehab center and through all sorts of therapy, to then pronounce him cured.</p>

<p>However, what happens when you put him back at home, in his dysfunctional relationship with his spouse, with his group of friends in which toxic masculinity and alcohol abuse are the norms - and his house above the pub?</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>Your habits are formed by your environment and if you’re human, chances are that next to physical, digital and - depending on your background metaphysical - your environment is determined in a large part by the nature, strength and depth of your relationships and social network.</p>

<p>It’s hard to change or create a new habit, but it’s exponentially harder to do so without changing your environment. Especially the social one.</p>

<p>Does that mean you automatically need a new spouse, new friends and a new location to live?</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>But it does mean you need to start the conversation.</p>

<p>
<h3>Starting the conversation and the steps after that</h3>
</p>
<p>Now, if you’re interested in the subject of smartphone addiction and other negative effects of digital technology overuse on our mental health, I’m assuming that you’re not only concerned with your own individual, personal mental health.</p>

<p>You’re probably concerned with the mental health of your lover, friends, coworkers and family members as well.</p>

<p>If you have kids, I’m pretty certain that you’re at least somewhat concerned about the impact a 24/7 digital device culture and the apps, games and interactions that run on the devices, have on your kids.</p>

<p>What’s this doing to their developing brain, to their sense of self-mastery, social development; their adjustability as adults?</p>



<p>What’s the right balance? How should we approach this issue? I’m pretty sure you don’t know the answers - much less as I do. We don’t have the perfect answers. But we can start by doing a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Instate #OfflineSunday</strong> - or offline any day - in your household. Just as a simple, weekly, short digital detox, and a reconnection and mental health check. Are we really addicted?</li>
<li>
<strong>Limit your own screentime as explicitly as you do your kids’</strong>. Don’t only tell them they can use their pc, tablet, smartphone or whatever device holds their interest for longer than you feel is productive and healthy - lead by example. “Daddy’s going to write some, I’ll be on my laptop from 10:00 am to 12:00 this morning, and after that I’m all yours and we can go...[insert something fun and dad-like, here].”</li>
<li>
<strong>The kicker: Have the conversation</strong>(s) about the effects of digital technology on our time, energy and focus; our relationships and our general wellbeing. Assume you don’t have all of the answers, but try to ask the right questions. Try to do your own research. And maybe, like the participants in that workshop in november, you’ll find my book to be a great starting point for your conversations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe this one is a nice way to start:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Initially, I wasn’t sure whether to write about this migration project, but when I randomly asked <a href="https://twitter.com/tarynpivots/status/1234966141526671360" target="_blank">if people would be interested</a>, the response was overwhelming. This was a long, kind of boring, very repetitive, and at times incredibly frustrating project, but I learned a lot, and maybe someone else will learn from this too. There may be far better ways to move this amount of data. In the path I went down, there was a huge amount of juggling that had to take place  (I’ll explain that later). Thankfully, I’m a decent juggler.</p>

<p>While most people are probably interested in what we do with our primary SQL Servers (the servers that run Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange network of sites), this post isn’t about those servers. This post is about what I called a miscellaneous server in a <a href="https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/how-we-upgraded-stackoverflow-to-sql-server-2017/">previous post</a> - more specifically, it’s about the migration of our traffic log data.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Our HAProxy<sup>1</sup> logs aka traffic logs, are currently stored on two SQL Servers, one in New York, and one in Colorado. While we store a minimal summary of the traffic data, we have a lot of it. At the beginning of 2019, we had about 4.5 years of data, totaling about 38TB. The database was initially designed to have a single table for each day. This meant that at the start of 2019 we had approximately 1600 tables in a single database with multiple database files (due to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/maximum-capacity-specifications-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">16TB size limit of data files</a>). Each table had a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-overview?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank">clustered columnstore index</a>, which held anywhere from 100-400 million rows in it.</p>

<p>I had to move the data from their existing daily tables into a new structure — one table for each month. This needed to be completed on both the NY and CO servers, and the data was stored on spinny drives (Eeek). No matter what, it was going to be painful and slow.</p>

<p>Oh, and to make things even more complicated, this had to be done with minimal free disk space on the existing servers. The servers had a 44TB spinny drive partition, and we were using 36-38TB of it, depending on the server. This meant I’d be following these steps throughout the process:</p>

<ul>
<li>migrate data to the new format</li>
<li>delete old data</li>
<li>shrink old database files…yeah, I know, but I had no choice</li>
<li>repeat over, and over, and over again</li>
</ul>

<p>I fully expected the process to take months, and it did — after hitting delays in getting new servers the entire project took about 11 months.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1 </sup>Note: If you’re interested, my colleague, Nick Craver (<a href="https://nickcraver.com/" target="_blank">b</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver/" target="_blank">t</a>), wrote extensively about our monitoring on his blog and gave an <a href="https://nickcraver.com/blog/2018/11/29/stack-overflow-how-we-do-monitoring/#logs-haproxy" target="_blank">overview of our HAProxy usage</a>.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-remember">Things to Remember</h3>

<p>Before I get started there are a few things I need to mention which impacted the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>I work remote 100% of the time, so I would not be able to run any of the processes from my local computer. Everything needed to be executed on a machine that was constantly connected to the network, so there wouldn’t be any VPN failures.</li>
<li>I needed to run this on two separate machines. I was doing this on SQL servers in two different datacenters, I needed a machine in the same location, so I wouldn’t have to deal with slowness over the network.</li>
<li>We have jump boxes that we use for various things at Stack Overflow, and we have one in NY and in CO, which were perfect to run the migration</li>
<li>The old database was still being used in a live production environment, meaning that as I was moving data, we were constantly adding a new table daily. In other words, I had a moving target</li>
<li>The databases are in <code>simple recovery</code> so we don’t have to deal with transaction logs. Our backup is the original source log files and the pair of SQL Servers - NY and CO - are copies of each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bullets above were pain points throughout the project. Being disconnected from the VPN meant I’d have to reconnect to monitor the migration progress. Getting booted from a jumpbox, meant that whatever process was running would need to be kicked off again, after some clean-up. Since we were still inserting new data I was chasing the target, the longer it took, the more data I’d be moving in the end.</p>

<h3 id="why-oh-why-would-you-do-this">Why, oh why would you do this?</h3>

<p>I like to be miserable. Kidding.</p>

<p>There were lots of reasons this needed to be done, one being tech debt. We realized that the original daily table structure wasn’t ideal. If we needed to query something over several days or months, it was terrible — lots of <code>UNION ALL</code>s or loops to crawl through days or even months at a time was slow.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-delete-or-purge-some-of-the-data">Why not delete or purge some of the data?</h3>

<p>As I mentioned, we were dealing with very little free disk space on both servers. This data is primarily used by the developers for investigating issues and by the data team for analysis. We already had purged some data, but for the data team - more data is better.</p>

<p>Instead of purging, the plan was to eventually get new hardware to replace them, but we weren’t exactly sure when that would happen. The goal was to migrate the data to the new format, then when we got new servers it would be as simple as moving the drives to get the new database in place (or so we thought).</p>

<h2 id="so-it-begins">So It Begins</h2>

<p>Each server had the following drives and approximate free space:</p>

<ul>
<li>a 230GB C: drive for Windows - obviously we wouldn’t put data files here</li>
<li>a 3.64TB NVMe D: drive - containing tempdb, one data file, and the log file for the existing HAProxyLogs database - it was approximately 85% full</li>
<li>a 44TB E: drive filled with spinny disks - with the remaining 3 data files for the HAProxyLogs database - this was anywhere from 85-90% full</li>
</ul>

<p>There was not a lot of room to move terabytes of data to a new database on the same server.</p>

<p>Since new servers were on down the road, I asked about the possibility of getting more disk space. Having more space would give me some breathing room to not be so crunched during the process. After some research, it was decided that we could fit a couple of additional NVMe SSDs into both servers. We only had PCIe slots available in the server, so we ended up using U.2 NVMe drives on PCIe adapters to get us some space. The SSDs gave us a brand spanking new F: drive that was <strong>14TB</strong> of free space. While I couldn’t move everything to the new drive, it gave me plenty of space to work with, at least, for a little bit.</p>

<p>Now that we had free space to use, it was time to set up the new database and begin the migration. I wrote the script to create the new database:</p>

<p>The database was going to have all of the old historical tables (i.e. the 40TBs) stored on the <code>TrafficLogs_Archive</code> filegroup, and we’d use the <code>PRIMARY</code> and <code>TrafficLogs_Current</code> for newer data being added.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that the <code>TrafficLogs_Archive</code> filegroup went on our already very full E: drive, instead of the new F: drive - more on that mistake later.</p>

<h2 id="moving-all-the-data">Moving All The Data</h2>

<p>We had a database, so it was time to start the migration. To be clear, I was actually taking over a process that was started, stopped, and then punted from several years earlier. The project was on the backlog of things to be done long before I became the DBA at Stack Overflow. Back then, everyone realized what a time consuming project this would be, and since we didn’t have the resources to devote to it, the can continuously got kicked down the road. As a result, more and more tables were added making the overall task a lot larger.</p>

<p>Since this had been a previously abandoned project, there were already some scripts written, which meant I wasn’t totally starting from scratch. I was handed a couple of scripts to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create all of the new monthly tables</p>

<p>Last updated: July 30th, 2020<br>Comment and join the discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23998324">Hacker News (&gt;77 comments, &gt;122 points)</a></p>

<p>Even though some cities have dedicated bicycle infrastructure, it's of no use if you don't know where
it is. While Google Maps is excellent for car navigation (and the dominant market leader), it 
often has patchy cycle infrastructure coverage and tends to generate cycle routes on busy roads.</p>

<p>The best dataset of cycle infrastructure worldwide (and in Sydney) is
<a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>. OpenStreetMap is like Wikipedia but a 
map; anybody can edit it, and the sheer number of contributors ensures accurate data.
Many cyclists (including myself) contribute to this dataset.</p>

<p>While the data is extremely detailed (see 
<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bicycle">this page</a> for some of the detail
OSM captures), the niche market of cyclist navigation means there aren't many apps that have a 
polished user experience. This comparison of navigation apps is biased towards commuter-focused,
easy to use apps.</p>

<p>Below: Display of OpenStreetMap cycling data in Sydney using 
<a href="https://www.cyclosm.org/#map=14/-33.8790/151.2190/cyclosm">cycleosm.org</a> - it's pretty
detailed hey! Check the data near where you live - chances are it's great, and if not head
to <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">openstreetmap.org</a> to fix it. 
<i>(note: you'll need to
zoom in to see new features like some pop-up cycleways, zoomed out views are
updated once a week on this map)</i></p>
</div><div>

<h2>What's the best app?</h2>
<p>In my personal opinion, <a href="https://citymapper.com/sydney?set_region=au-sydney"><strong>Citymapper</strong></a>
(on <a href="https://citymapper.com/sydney?set_region=au-sydney">web</a>,
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/apple-store/id469463298">iOS</a> &amp;
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citymapper.app.release">Android</a>).
A bit about the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives excellent cycle directions (routes)
<ul>
<li>The underlying data comes from <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, which anybody can edit</li>
<li>It uses the route generation algorithm designed by <a href="http://cyclestreets.net/">CycleStreets.net</a>, a not-for-profit spun out of research at Cambridge. <a href="https://www.cyclestreets.net/help/journey/routing/">It takes into account</a>:
<ul>
<li>The path surface quality and infrastructure design</li>
<li>Delays caused by traffic signals</li>
<li>Delays (or savings) caused by topography and hills</li>
<li>One-way streets</li>
<li>Private access</li>
<li>Bicycle dismount signs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's free to use</li>
<li>It's delightful (and easy) to use:
<ul>
<li>When navigating it shows your path in psuedo-3D, easy to follow</li>
<li>Apple: Apps of the year 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017</li>
<li>Google Play: Editors' Choice + Best Apps of 2016, 2017</li>
<li>London Design Museum: Designs of the Year</li>
<li>MTA New York: Grand Prize Winner</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's available on the web at <a href="https://citymapper.com/">https://citymapper.com/</a>, iPhone and Android devices</li>
<li>It lets the user choose between safe (but slower) routes, medium, and fast (but more dangerous) ones</li>
<li>The app is solely designed for transit and cycling</li>
<li>Citymapper (the company) is pro-transit:
<ul>
<li>They write about their transit research on <a href="https://medium.com/citymapper">Medium</a></li>
<li>They launched a travel pass in London for mobility as a service</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Some (possible) downsides to CityMapper (depending on your point of view):</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't give voice annoucements, turn directions or reroute when you diverge from the route <b>(Note: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24000388">A Citymapper employee reached out and said this is coming soon!</a></b></li><b>
<li>It’s only available in select cities (though Sydney and Melbourne are included)</li>
<li>It’s closed source by a private company</li>
<li>The basemap (background imagery) is Google Maps, not OSM
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t display OpenStreetMap or encourage editing due to this</li>
</ul></li>
</b></ul><p><b>
<h2 id="disclosure-of-interests">Disclosure of interests</h2>
<p>I have no personal or financial interest in Citymapper or any of the apps below, just a user. I am, however, strongly pro-cycling, pro-transit, and a frequent volunteer surveyor for OpenStreetMap 😀</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-bicycle-routing-apps">Thoughts on bicycle routing apps</h2>
<p>In rough order of what I would use <i>for commuter cycling in Sydney</i>. For a more detailed feature comparison, see the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_bicycle_route_planning_websites">Comparison of bicycle route planning websites</a></p>

<![CDATA[Show HN: Hand-drawn timelines using RoughJS]]>

July 30, 2020 | https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/blog/entry/hand-drawn-timelines-using-roughjs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/blog/entry/hand-drawn-timelines-using-roughjs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>ChronoFlo Timeline Maker's latest new feature allows you to give your timelines an eye-catching hand-drawn appearance.</p><div>
						<p>Ever since we first came across <a href="https://shihn.ca/">Preet Shihn's</a> amazing hand-drawn shapes library <a href="https://roughjs.com/">RoughJS</a> a few years ago, we have wanted to use it in one of our products. The sketchy-appearance lends a quirkiness and care-free feel to a user interface that we love.</p>
						<p>At the start of this month, we found ourselves with a bit of free time. We had finished most of the key features we wanted the initial version of <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/">ChronoFlo Timeline Maker</a> to include, and were wondering what we should turn our attention to next.</p>
						<p>During a brain storming session, Preet's hand-drawn shape library was mentioned, and after a quick look at some of the examples on the RoughJS website, we decided our next big feature would be to use RoughJS to display timelines with a hand-drawn style.</p>

						<!--<div class="tlsp-lf-call-to-action">
							<a href="/">Create a hand-drawn timeline for free</a>
						</div>-->

						<p>The aim was to create two hand-drawn themes, one light and the other dark, that users could select to give their timelines a 'sketched' appearance. We also wanted to give the users the ability to control the amount of roughness via a slider, similar to the slider you can find below the timeline above.</p>
						<p>We were not sure how long it would take us to integrate RoughJS with our event panel and timeline rendering algorithms. Unlike other timeline maker products, ChronoFlo Timeline Maker offers multiple event panel designs and numerous timeline layouts, including both <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3114/USA-Presidents-Timeline/">horizontal</a> and <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3120/Vertical-Yellow-Mellow/">vertical</a> formats, and even a <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3117/UK-Coronovirus-Timeline/">3d parallax-style</a> design.</p>
						<p><a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/timeline/shared/3249/USA-Presidents-Timeline-Hand-Drawn-Dark/">
								<img alt="US Presidents Timeline" title="US Presidents Timeline" src="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/assets/images/blog/hand-drawn-dark.jpg">
							</a>
						</p>
						<p>A timeline combining ChronoFlo's unique 3d view and our new Hand Drawn Dark theme.</p>

						<p>Getting all these designs and layouts to render with a hand-drawn appearance was not going to be easy. Thankfully, RoughJS is a neat bit of software with an easy-to-understand api, and we had a proof of concept up in not too much time.</p><p>Then there was all the fiddly work of making sure that RoughJS worked with all the different timeline scenarios our software can output, bug fixing, testing, tweaking etc. About a month from initial idea to feature release. Not too bad, when you consider it was not the only thing we were working on.</p>
						<p>And now ChronoFlo Timeline Maker boasts a feature that - as far as we are aware - no other timeline maker product on the market offers: hand drawn timelines. Big thanks to Preet and RoughJS for making this possible.</p>
						<p>Let's now take a look at how you can take advantage of hand-drawn timelines yourself using ChronoFlo Timeline Maker. It's really easy to do.</p>
						<p><span>1</span> Go to <a href="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/">www.chronoflotimeline.com</a> and log into your account. If not already logged in, click on the 'Go to my account' button.</p>
						<p><span>2</span> Now on your account page, select a timeline to edit. If you haven't created any timelines yet, this is the time to make your first timeline. Make sure you add some content to your timeline.</p>
						<p><span>3</span> The next step is to choose one of our hand drawn themes. You do this by clicking the options button to the right of the screen, bringing up our admin panel. Choose the 'Change the appearance of your timeline' option. Then, select 'Hand Drawn Light' or 'Hand Drawn Dark' from the Theme drop down menu. Make sure to save.</p>
						<p><span>4</span> You now have a hand-drawn timeline to play with and wow your friends or customers with.</p>
						<p>Expert timeline makers might want to try a few other things. The hand-drawn style looks better with some event panel designs than others. So you might want to explore the different panel designs via the 'Panel' option in the 'Timeline Appearance' section.</p>

						<p>You can also make your own hand-drawn themes. The theme edit panel now includes a slider for roughness. Drag this to the left or right to make a theme have a messier or neater look.</p><p><img alt="US Presidents Timeline" title="US Presidents Timeline" src="https://www.chronoflotimeline.com/assets/images/blog/hand-drawn-edit-theme.jpg">
						</p>
						<p>Create your own hand-drawn themes using our new 'roughness' slider.</p>

						<p>We really hope you like ChronoFlo Timeline Maker's new hand-drawn timeline feature, and can't wait to see what you create using it. Please share with us your hand-drawn timeline creations via social media or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:hello@chronoflotimeline.com">hello@chronoflotimeline.com</a>.</p><p>As usual, you can keep up to date with the latest ChronoFlo Timeline Maker news and developments by following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/chronoflot">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chronoflotimeline/">Facebook</a>. If you have any questions about our software, please email us at <a href="mailto:hello@chronoflotimeline.com">hello@chronoflotimeline.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Johanna Larsson is a community-minded software engineer whose project, Hex Diff, generates highlighted git diffs, right in your browser. In this episode, we talk to Johanna about how Hex Diff can benefit Elixir users, the differences between code architecture and code design, and the debatably under-appreciated role of Elixir umbrella apps. We start the conversation by chatting with Johanna about her recent move to London and her work for Duffel; a startup helping travel agencies book trips. After talking about how she got into software development, we dive into Hex Diff versus GitHub, with Joanna detailing how Hex Diff offers greater security for your code. We ask Johanna about the origins of the Hex Diff project and she explores its aims and her experiences working on the project. In line with this month’s theme, we discuss what architecture means to Joanna and the need for domain-driven design. We quiz Joanna on her approaches to problem-solving and she explains how her coding process emphasizes building an early prototype and constantly iterating on it. Despite hearing that umbrella apps are bad news, Joanna makes a case for their value while acknowledging how that they need greater tooling. We round off our conversation by asking Joanna how she tries to grow her skillset and what her favorite Elixir resource is. Following our discussion with Johanna, we open with another edition of Pattern Matching with Todd. This week, friend of the podcast Todd Resudek asks five questions of Elixir community member Bruce Williams. They talk about Bruce’s work as an Arabic cryptologic linguist for the US Airforce, his software career, and the therapeutic uses of playing Animal Crossing during a pandemic. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I built a new workstation with somewhat beefy <code>AMD Ryzen 3950x</code> CPU and got a bit over-excited with
tuning it and getting the max (trying to reduce <code>rust</code> compile times) out of it 😅. One thing led to
another and I ended up with a <code>Corsair H150i RGB PRO XT</code> AIO to keep this thing cool enough.
Everything worked well until I found out that Corsair does not provide any support for Linux 🙄.
It was usable, as this device holds its config on board and does not need support from OS/Software to run,
but one can only adjust any settings or view any status in Windows.</p>

<p>How do I use this device in Linux? I wanted to look at the useless but pretty stats about how fast the
pump and fans are spinning, what is the temperature of the coolant? After all I gotta kill time when
<code>ferris</code> is churning bits…</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>


<h4 id="where-to-start">Where to start?</h4>

<p>My very first thought was to sniff the communication between the software and the device and replicate
it, problem solved! That is what I ended up doing but it wasn’t easy. I started with searching and asking for help</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/rustlang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rustlang</a> anyone has any pointers to start hacking on USB devices. I want to do some reverse engineering for a device that has no support for Linux 🤫</p>— Harry (@mygnu_) <a href="https://twitter.com/mygnu_/status/1285575881348587525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2020</a></blockquote>



<p>I had no idea how USB devices work, apart from you plug them in and they play. I started reading up on USB protocol.
Here are some resources that I found very useful to get me started with reverse engineering and
understanding USB protocol in general.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.usbmadesimple.co.uk/" target="_blank">Usb Made Simple</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linuxvoice.com/drive-it-yourself-usb-car-6/" target="_blank">DRIVE IT YOURSELF: USB CAR</a></li>
<li><a href="https://libusb.info/" target="_blank">libusb documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/SodMHKpykXw" target="_blank">usb and libusb (video)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/jMf55KVDPaE" target="_blank">reverse engineering USB devices (video)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.usb3.com/whitepapers/USB%203%200%20(11132008)-final.pdf" target="_blank">USB3 Specifications (PDF)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Usb-Complete-5th-Edn-Jan-Axelson/9781931448284?qid=1596018469423&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">USB Complete 5th Edition (book)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In a nutshell USB is completely controlled by the host, it will sit there until host device makes a
request for a Transaction. To control a device we need to take these steps (I’m over-simplifying here)
get device info -&gt; configure its endpoint -&gt; run a command. Don`t worry if it doesn’t make sense for now
it didn’t for me either, hopefully it will start to make sense at the end of this article.
I strongly recommend to go thorough the resources above to help with the process.</p>

<p>Before we can reverse engineer a device we need to understand what it does and how it does. I started
with capturing packages, because it was supported only on windows I created a VM.
After a few unsuccessful attempts to install the software provided by Corsair in the VM
(it required OpenGl for some reason).
I ended up setting up a dual boot for Windows. After some <em>duckduckgoing</em> (if that’s even a word) I installed
<a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/USB" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> and <a href="https://desowin.org/usbpcap/" target="_blank">USBPcap</a>
to capture the USB traffic when the software was reading stats information off the device. I still
couldn’t see any USB interfaces listed in Wireshark to capture. But I could use USBPcap command line tool
to capture packets flying back and forth, between my AIO and the PC. That was Ok but not ideal as I could not
see live packets to see what packet is transferred when the values changed in the Corsair software. Later on,
I found the following tip buried in one of the youtube video comments and it worked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for live capture USB packets in wireshark, copy <code>USBPcapCMD.exe</code> into <code>wireshark\extcap</code> directory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I had the needed data, and ‘commands’ that i could try to replicate. As you can see in the screenshot
below it is a sequence of commands <code>GET DESCRIPTOR</code> for <code>DEVICE</code> and then <code>Configuration</code> and various
other requests and responses. Later on we’ll see that after the initial setup it is just a couple of alternating
request are made to the device to receive sensor data. Corsair software parses the response and displays fan/pump
speeds and coolant temperature etc we’ll get to that later but lets setup our project in rust.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-a-rust-project">Setting up a rust project</h3>

<p>On my Linux machine I ran <code>lsusb</code> to see the usb devices attached, and there it was
<code>Bus 001 Device 002: ID 1b1c:0c22 Corsair H150iRGBPROXT</code>, vendor and product IDs matching with the captured
data as expected.</p>

<p>I started a new rust project <code>cargo new rcue</code> named it <code>rcue</code> just because the software I’m
trying to replicate is called <code>iCue</code> 😜. Some awesome rust developers have already made a rust crate
<a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rusb" target="_blank">rusb</a> that provides safe bindings for <code>libusb-1.0</code>. For this project we only
need two dependencies as following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span>dependencies</span><span>]</span>
<span>rusb</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.6"</span>
<span>byteorder</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1.3"</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>byteorder</code> is an awesome crate, it will become handy as we see later. I looked at the examples provided
by the <code>rusb</code> repo <a href="https://github.com/a1ien/rusb/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">here</a> and started with just
reading some basic information about the device.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have problem compiling this see instructions here <a href="https://github.com/a1ien/libusb1-sys#cross-compiling" target="_blank">libusb-sys</a></p>

<p>Back to our captured data, if I filter the direction of all data going to the device, I can see a sequence
first three packets are for requesting information, presumably to confirm that we are connected to the required
device. Forth request (7th if you count responses) in the screenshot below is doing something. I think
it’s configuring the device endpoint. A USB device can be configured in many different ways as you might
have seen/read in the resources above. Since our device only has one configuration as confirmed in the output of
our program, there is no real point re-configuring it to the same one, but we’ll do it anyway for
the completeness sake.</p>

<p>The relevant piece of information here are the data that is sent or <em>the last 9 bytes</em>. Let’s try replicating
this in our program. To configure the device properly we need to claim it. That require some extra information
for the attached device i.e. its interface, settings and address identifiers. Let’s setup a function like the following.</p>

<p>We know how long you have been waiting for an interview with a famous person in the crypto world — <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoYoda1338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CryptoYoda</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We complied with your request and asked him about his popularity, blog, and crypto world. We also asked him to make a forecast for the future of the crypto world and evaluate Utopia P2P in terms of crypto abilities.</p>



<p>Therefore, take a seat and enjoy reading the story of a successful person. Let’s start.</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/successful-person.jpg.webp" alt="CryptoYoda’s Twitter page" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/successful-person.jpg.webp 444w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/successful-person-300x265.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px"></figure></div>



<p><strong>1. First, introduce yourself, please, and share with us how you reached such a high level in your niche and got so many subscribers?</strong></p>



<p><em>Hello everyone! Thanks for inviting me to this interview. To introduce myself, in this space, I am operating under the pseudonym CryptoYoda with a strong emphasis on cryptocurrency, technical analysis, and spiritual matters of life. These are three areas I am especially keen to explore and share thoughts about constantly. The reason I chose the avatar of Yoda for my communication channel is the shared interest in ideologies, world view and focus in life. As such, the original Yoda devoted his life to learning, solitude and teaching, acting as a role model for my own ambitions in this world. I am therefore constantly reminded of the path I am walking and where it will lead me if I diligently pursue the many learnings of this life.</em></p>



<p><em>My rise in this space really came from a period of deep desperation. Deeply unsatisfied with the state of the world, reluctant to work for companies that solely have profit in their minds while further adding to the cause of the problems at the world stage, depressed and struggling to find my own way in life </em><em>—</em><em> this was the fertile ground where I sow my own seeds of ambition. I was poor but had time. I was in bad shape, but I strived for something greater. I began to climb out of the darkness, and even I did not know where my path will be leading me.</em></p>



<p><em>At that time, I saw something in the markets that barely anyone else seemed to notice: The early but impending ALTS rise. I saw it as a tremendous opportunity for life-changing profits. During the bear market that followed the 2014 All-Time-High, I thus studied in-depth all various ways to spot Major Trend Reversals early, enter with conviction, and ride it all the way up with a lot of patience. So when the time came to plant seeds, I was ready, willing, and able to act on my belief firmly. But it was not enough. There was this unsettling feeling to share what I saw at that time, and a good friend of mine encouraged me to create a Twitter account to spread my views to space. Recognizing it as my path, I created the Avatar CryptoYoda </em><em>—</em><em> which really isn’t me but just a portion of my personality </em><em>—</em><em> and began sharing everything I saw in the markets at a rapid rate. In the beginning, there was almost no interaction with my tweets, but I continued just for the sake of doing so. I was not in search of followers or engagement. I was in a mission to spread my perspective so others might profit from it and provide mentorship in this game that I never had myself.</em></p>



<p><em>Making a long story short, the demand for this kind of information was intense. I proceeded with opening a blog to elaborate in more detail about the market conditions at hand. I remember posting around 100 tweets a day when things really went uphill. It was astonishing to see how much attention these tweets generated. ALTS popped left and right, and I attempted to be as technical as I can be, taking fundamentals into the equation and emphasizing the former.</em></p>



<p><em>Fortunately, I was right on the spot. ALTS really lifted and resulted in the strongest alt season yet. I encouraged people to enter early with solid technical breakouts. Several trades really stood out. I began buying BTC around the $250 mark, accumulated $LTC at below $4, $XRP at half a cent, and ETH at a dollar, with all these trades/investments, ended up being phenomenal in terms of returns. This naturally led to much attention and interest in the account. The increase of followers gained in the year of 2017 was remarkable. However, I was entirely unprepared for operating on the world stage at that time, and at times simply overwhelmed with the responsibility that comes with a large following, so it was not all shine &amp; glory but a constant challenge to grow in all parts of my life which continues to this day. After all, life is about learning, so I welcome the opportunity to grow through the challenges presented in this space and become a better and more helpful person.</em></p>



<p><strong>2. CryptoYoda, you are known for your crypto market reports. How would you describe the current state of the market of cryptocurrency?</strong></p>



<p><em>My perspective on the markets is really divided. On the one hand, the market seems to be eager to pursue higher valuation generally. On the other hand, I remain cautious about BTC’s possibility of making a strong move in either direction, which would inevitably lead to turbulence and percussion in alt markets specifically. Closing above the critical $10,500 mark would very likely lead to a strong longterm rally for BTC. How alts will react to such a sudden move is a question that yet needs to be answered and will provide key insights for identifying the market phase we are currently in. Is the market ready for planting longterm seeds in ALTS? Perhaps it is, but I favor a more conservative strategy this season, integrating my experiences from past BTC moves and its effect on the whole alt market.</em></p>



<p><strong>3. How do you think, who is in charge of cryptocurrency I’m sure that many have no idea how does it work on the whole.</strong></p>



<p><em>To think the crypto market is a free market, without manipulation, is a dangerous thought for nothing could be farther from the truth. Because early players had the opportunity to mine &amp; buy large chunks of BTC at very low valuations, the options for manipulations are manifold. The entry of institutional traders/investors further increased the possibility of manipulation for their own good. So in today’s view, I think both institutions and whales heavily manipulate the market. Trading and Price Action has changed tremendously over the years – which makes a lot of sense considering that early crypto investors mostly weren’t professional traders and had a general lack of market understanding. With the entrance of institutions and High-Frequency algorithms, trading ended up a great deal more difficult due to traps being constantly and consciously placed to take advantage of more uneducated and impatient market participants. However, this lies also a great opportunity to grow as a trader, as trading in itself demands constant growth and expansion into higher quality and increased understanding of the underlying principles of market structure and behavior of market participants. But in terms of manipulation, there is no reason to believe that it is less or different from any other market in the world. Greedy powers will always be looking to orchestrate movements for their own gain. This is one reason why the world is in such a bad shape right now, and it will take a great spiritual evolution to change this behavior for good. But this is something for another time perhaps.</em></p>



<p><strong>4. Why does the Bitcoin price move so much? Okay, for now, it’s a world economic crisis because of the Coronavirus. But it also happened before.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price.jpg.webp" alt="Bitcoin future on the market" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price.jpg.webp 1024w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price-300x200.jpg.webp 300w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/07/Bitcoin-price-768x513.jpg.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p><em>I wouldn’t say that Bitcoin moves more or quicker than in the past. I feel its quite the opposite. The market became much more stable generally, but the intense volatility on key levels will always remain a characteristic of bitcoin and crypto in general. Interestingly, the increased correlation with traditional markets became very evident in the initial season of the corona. It has a lot to do with institutional players entering this market too.</em></p>



<p><strong>5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrencies over FIAT?</strong></p>



<p><em>The advantage of crypto over FIAT clearly is the freedom of choice inherent in this new financial technology paradigm. For eons, people had to trust their governments with the issuance of money without little or no insight into debt mechanisms. We live in a debt-driven economy, with basically all countries due to a debt, which can only increase over time due to massive interest rates on the loans they received. The general understanding of our current economic model is very fragmentary among the global population. This is a vicious cycle without a happy end, as long as we stay in this economic model as a globally connected society. Countries have to accumulate debt to pay for the interest of earlier loans. This will only lead to increased interest payments in the future. It is fair to say that all loans generated to increase the pressure on future generations.</em></p>



<p><em>Crypto offers an alternative to this debt-driven legacy system. A way out, so to say, but therein also lies the greatest risk of this technology. Blockchain tech can be used to give people back the control over their own financials and data. But this, of course, is not in the interest of those currently in control. Blockchain technology can as well be used to monitor, track, and accumulate complex data with the help of AI-technology, which would inevitably lead to restriction of freedom and open the gateways to a dystopian future.</em></p>



<p><em>I like to work with the example of nuclear energy. Despite not being a supporter of this technology in any way, as the harm on the environment is far greater than the benefit generated by its use, it is indeed possible to use nuclear science to generate energy or build nuclear bombs, which could devastate the planet. Was humanity evolved enough to develop such a method? Yes, clearly. Were they wise and mature enough to handle this technology with foresight and caution for all humanity? Clearly not.</em></p>



<p><em>In the same way, blockchain technology can be used …</em></p></article></section></div></div>

<p>At MentorCruise, we are all about making the most out of the experience of others. As
part of that, we've connected and asked dozens of experts and professionals in Machine Learning about
their favourite books – and here are the answers.
</p>

</section>
<section id="fundamentals">
<h2>Fundamentals of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Understanding the concepts of Machine Learning starts with
understanding the fundamentals. On your way to
mastery, it's crucial for you to understand how certain concepts were derived, and why things work like
they do. Starting with these resources is the best way to do so.</p>
<div>
<div>

<div>
<h3>Introduction to Statistical learning</h3>
<p>ISL is a fundamental book and popular amongst undergrad and grad students for it's clarity and simplicity with explaining concepts. The math required to understand the book is kept to a minimum, making it unique in its format.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Learning online may have begun in the late 90s, but lately, it has been gathering a lot of attention. Especially due to the recent situation of the world with the pandemic and worldwide lockdown, e-learning has proved to be one of <em>the most</em> prominent uses of technology in the 21st century.</p><p>When the pandemic hit the world and all the educational institutions everywhere shut down, e-learning was there as our savior. Learning online was not a new concept to us, yet due to this, e-learning gained another, much more valuable reputation entirely. Now that we knew to learn online was that easy and that flexible, some people even started to question the hype of offline learning.</p><p>It is now safe to say that learning through the internet is a market that is just going to grow in the following few years. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-e-learning-market-is-expected-to-grow-at-a-cagr-of-over-14-during-the-period-20192025-301047035.html">Researches</a> even conclude that the market size of e-learning is expected to grow at a rate of 10.85% by 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the question is why do you need to integrate personalization in e-learning. Well, the answer is a simple one: It makes the experience better and generates much more value for the learner. First things first, personalization is an important concept for most, if not all online business. <a href="https://www.caboom.ai/blogfeatured/is-personalization-the-future">The scope of personalization</a> has grown so much that many enterprises will use it, or have already been leveraging it to generate value for their customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s elaborate on why personalization will change the e-learning experience as a whole.</p><h3><strong>One Size</strong> <strong>Does Not</strong> <strong>Fit All&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>We have left behind the days of pushing the same thing to everyone and anyone. People have preferences on the smallest aspects of their lives, so it is expected that personalization is included on other aspects as well, even in their online learning experience.&nbsp;</p><p>People might have their preferences on the devices they would want to use, the pace they want to follow, the subjects they want to learn and be recommended next, the format of learning (audio/video/text), and whatnot. So, the whole concept of one <em>size fits all </em>should be discarded and we should move towards more advanced approaches.</p><h3><strong>The Pace of Learning</strong></h3><p>We often underestimate the importance of the pace of learning when we are learning with a group of people crammed together in a classroom. The fact that people have different speeds of understanding the things being taught is usually neglected in offline learning.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why, in online learning, it is expected by the user to be able to personalize their speed of learning. There wouldn’t be much difference in online learning and learning in a school if you still have to rush to go to class on time and struggle to meet the speed of other students in the group.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Giving students the control</strong></h3><p>When the application is personalized, it will give students/learners more control of what they are experiencing through the e-learning app. This results in students being able to:</p><ol role="list"><li>Carefully think about their goals from the course they are doing</li><li>Set up their own learning path</li><li>Choose devices to study from that they are the most comfortable with</li><li>Study without the pressure and competitiveness of learning in a group&nbsp;</li><li>Study in various flexible speeds, suited to themselves</li><li>Get&nbsp; course recommendations on what they can learn next</li></ol><p>In the tech-driven world of 2020, you must give more thought to leveraging technology in your online business. Technology is evolving and bettering itself every day, and we must evolve according to it. We at Caboom believe that <a href="https://www.caboom.ai/blogfeatured/is-personalization-the-future">personalization is the future</a>, and the e-learning industry must use it in their favor.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[The 3 Problems of Django]]>

July 30, 2020 | https://blog.yourlabs.org/posts/2020-07-27-the-3-problems-of-django/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.yourlabs.org/posts/2020-07-27-the-3-problems-of-django/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
<h2 id="1-non-admins-">1. Non admins ?</h2>
<p>The problem is pretty obvious: Django admin provides barely anything that’s
usable for non-admin, not even working base templates and sane default features
such as searchable lists with some kind of row level security.</p>
<h2 id="2-no-templates-">2. No templates ?</h2>
<p>For your internet users, Django only generates basic
HTML forms without even a default template that calls <code>{{ form }}</code> and <code>{{ form.media }}</code> and <code>{% csrf_token %}</code>.</p>
<p>For example, Django would need to have a base.html that can display a
<code>View.title</code> attribute, exactly like in all CMS and frameworks that exist on
top of Django, and that <a href="https://docs.iommi.rocks/">Iommi</a> solves with a
<strong>beautiful python API for generating HTML</strong>, because of the problem with
templates (see below), or <a href="https://yourlabs.io/oss/ryzom">Ryzom</a> which also
provide data-binding with django-channels.</p>

<p>This one you would think I have added for the lulz because let’s be honest: who has never tried to code a menu in Python and then went back to doing it in HTML templates and just tell others to live with it ? Well the real problem here is not just having a navigation menu, but also different menus such as the one in the object detail view, or the one in the object list item view that you will see per item on the list page.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, Django has almost all it needs to generate a menu: it knows the urls, the views, what models the views are for, and so on, it just needs a view attribute for the names of the menus that the view should display in … as well as some hat tricks:</p>
<h2 id="performant-view-per-object-security">Performant view-per-object security</h2>
<p>To generate menus efficiently: you need to be able to code permission code that does not hit the database, which is actually possible with a nice little trick possible by executing views on a target object with the same authenticated request prior to adding a link for this view in this object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>for</span> <span>view</span> <span>in</span> <span>Controller</span><span>.</span><span>for_object</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>for_menu</span><span>(</span><span>'object_list'</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>view</span><span>.</span><span>clone</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>=</span><span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>object</span><span>=</span><span>object</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>has_perm</span><span>():</span>
        <span>yield</span> <span>view</span><span>.</span><span>as</span><span>(</span><span>'a'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="the-problem-with-templates">The problem with Templates</h2>
<p>Ultimately I would like to reach the level where this is possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>IommiView</span><span>:</span>
    <span>template</span> <span>=</span> <span>BaseTemplate</span><span>(</span>
        <span>title</span><span>=</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>h1</span><span>(</span><span>'Your Title'</span><span>),</span>
        <span>content</span><span>=</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>div</span><span>(</span>
            <span>SomeModelTable</span><span>(),</span>   <span># a Table object for some model</span>
            <span>cls</span><span>=</span><span>"large"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="glorifying-the-decorator-pattern">Glorifying the Decorator pattern</h3>
<p>Obviously, I believe all 1337 h4x0|2z will agree on eliminating templates, not
even for being slower than pure python, but just to move on to Decorator based
patterns for generating some tag-based HTML source code, just like we would for
any GUI according to the GoF on Decorator patterns.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-generic-views">The problem with generic views</h2>
<p>Anyway, all your CRUD code would be MUCH better with a Controller layer, that
sits between a model and it’s set of CRUD views to form the MVC that makes
modifying the admin so pleasant.</p>
<p>Take this example of registering a full CRUD with the MVC pattern just like the
Admin:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>crudlfap</span><span>.</span><span>Controller</span><span>(</span>
    <span>Artist</span><span>,</span>
    <span>fields</span><span>=</span><span>'__all__'</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>register</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This must enable a working CRUD view that is <strong>superuser only</strong> by default. You
override your Controller.get_queryset which all of the views will call so that
it is <strong>secure by default</strong> (which default CBV <strong>are not</strong>), overriding the
Controller is a lot of fun just like in the admin because it is the result of a
standard <strong>refactor of the code in-between Models and Views</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="mvc">MVC</h2>
<p>This part of the article is proven by <a href="https://yourlabs.io/oss/crudlfap">CRUDLFA+</a>.</p>
<h3 id="example-controller">Example Controller</h3>
<p>To sit in between our view classes and our model, we make a Controller which is the same as a ModelAdmin, DRF ViewSet or a django SmartView. It should centralize the base queryset filter code for all the views of this controller and register just like a ModelAdmin:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>UserController</span><span>(</span><span>crudlfap</span><span>.</span><span>Controller</span><span>):</span>
    <span>views</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
        <span># some view defined above in crud.py:</span>
        <span>ImportView</span><span>,</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to recommender systems, the default choices are usually to use Collaborative Filtering that makes use of the wisdom of all the users, or Content-based Filtering that is based on the user's past interactions and item attributes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let's briefly have a look at the methods for generating recommendations and how they work.<br></p><h2>Collaborative Filtering</h2><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) is a method for generating recommendations by calculating preference scores of a user for an item using the historical preference for that item from other similar users in the database. This algorithm takes account of the explicit interaction with the item irrespective of the attributes of the item, so is domain agnostic as long as we have sufficient historical interaction data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It works with an assumption that if a user <strong>A</strong> likes item <em>X, Y, Z</em>, and user <strong>B</strong> likes product <em>X, Y, J</em> then user A will probably like item J and user B item Z.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Note that these predictions are specific to the user, but makes use of the interactions gathered from many users. This can lead to recommending a diverse set of items that the user might not otherwise have discovered.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This method is mostly used on e-commerce websites. If you have come across recommendations under a section titled "People who liked item X also liked item Y" you have seen Collaborative Filtering in action.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Content-Based Filtering</h2><p>In contrast to Collaborative Filtering, Content-based filtering (CBF) uses the attributes/features of the items directly to recommend items to a user. This is done by creating a "user profile" of the preferences of the user for each of these item attributes and then calculating other items most similar to the user's profile. This is done by representing a profile vector of the user in the same dimensions as the item attribute vector and calculating the weights based on users’ historical interaction with the items.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Note that the recommendations are specific to this user, as the model did not use any information from other users. Thus, this type of recommendation does not provide a diverse range of choices as they are only based on items a user has previously interacted with.&nbsp;</p><div><p>This type of recommendation focuses on personal choice or content and is very useful in Job Recommendations as the choice of the job for the user needs to take into account to have a perfect matching job.</p></div><h2>Hybrid Recommender Systems</h2><p>As useful as these methods are they do have some limitations that we need to be aware of. For example, both CF and CBF do not work for new users for whom we don't have any historical interactions or have very few of them. They also don’t make use of other information we might have about the user like their demographic, location etc.<br></p><p>Ideally, we would like to make use of all the information available in diﬀerent data sources and also combine the algorithmic strengths of various recommender systems to make more robust recommendations. Hybrid recommender systems are used for these purposes, and we explore them more through the rest of this blog.<br></p><p>Most recommender systems these days use a hybrid approach by combining CF and CBF approaches. However, there is no reason why several other techniques cannot be hybridized.&nbsp;</p><p>Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways:&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li>Making content-based and collaborative-based recommendations separately and then combining them.&nbsp;</li><li>Adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa).</li><li>Unifying the approaches into one model.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Several studies that empirically compare the performance of hybrid recommenders with pure CF and CBF methods have shown that hybrid methods can provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as the cold start and the sparsity problem.</p><p>Netflix is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems. The website makes recommendations by comparing the view and search habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).</p><p>‍</p><h2>Content Boosted Collaborative Filtering for recommender systems</h2><p>Given the many ways recommenders can be combined, there are many variations of hybrid recommenders in use. In this blog we will focus on one of the earliest and most successful hybrid recommender algorithms called <strong>Content boosted Collaborative Filtering</strong> (CBCF) algorithm.<br></p><p>CBCF is a type of hybrid recommendation technique that uses a combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Its main idea is to overcome the sparsity problem that degrades the performance of collaborative filtering algorithms by using item content to make the user-item interaction matrix dense.<br></p><p>Its benefits over the pure CF and CBF methods are:</p><ol role="list"><li>Reduces user-item data sparsity</li><li>Handles <strong>cold-start problems</strong> when users have no or very few interactions.</li><li>Handles <strong>first rater problem</strong> for new items who have not been rated or interacted with by any users.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><h2>How does content boosted collaborative filtering work?</h2><p>As we mentioned the basic idea behind CBCF is to use content-based filtering to convert a sparse user interaction matrix to a dense matrix, and then use CF to make the recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p>This is shown in Figure 1.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577b91af0b55804e61cec_61SMAsWQOTUzrv77PH-A5Voc8xzh1zEn28bIgaSt3jQUZwnQjxJ21NNPN2mduVdi7e_mjKryaLOwdQFmVMqrirhenUgFu-AxaRDuOtCfEi4ajWFEaTcAhEfG_ZnE025Uo2de3qk.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Fig 1. Basic mechanism of of converting sparse matrix to dense</figcaption></figure><p>The overall architecture of the recommendation system is shown in Figure 2.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba90654535d9f5beb2_1ShNtwf2KCq2yeFqoxvxiXOLaS9PphLCMJa0E7NXDlCRgsIiHmGQBslVvtSVH-g56m0Ty3USspQFE1-uSyiOONy6cl_DMZuZliADv-97_aUqnI_OvIzqWRXK-mZRpJP0z37jJc8.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>&nbsp;Fig 2. Architecture of CBCF based recommender system&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><div><p>This architecture tries to predict the preference for items not yet interacted by the user based on the similar items rated by the user. For this, it groups the most similar interacted items based on the content and then gives weights to each of these neighboring items based on user preferences. The average of these weighted content feature vectors is then used to calculate the predicted preference for the item. This way we will have a predicted score for each item for a user, which becomes the new user-item dense matrix.&nbsp;</p></div><h2>Variation using Deep Learning Prediction Model for better recommendation</h2><p>With the advent of modern deep learning techniques, several variations of the content-based model have been developed. These methods create an item profile (feature vector) that are especially useful for text based features that are prevalent like item reviews, description etc.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba2ba25e595d015e23_pJgAoZtYFVWa_F0xBnr7__Qku6CdsmMxdV6D-clAH_ObVvlTvMU-wCRyicVumj61SxiP0-esr28yxbvaDGLvuAEEWG7FlC4A48-vNpZNZ-ett7zyaWPHM6gTlX0cOddXzl_78F4.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>	Fig 3. Variation using Deep Learning based Item Profiles</figcaption></figure><p>In this method, the item profiles are created using feature engineering techniques as before, but not grouped into clusters. The user profile is created based on the historical item interaction. Those two profiles are then combined into a single feature and the deep learning model is trained. After the model is created, the feature is created by combining the item profile not interacted by the user with the user profile, hence a prediction is generated which is used to make the sparse matrix dense.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Evaluation and Result<br></h2><p>In order to test the algorithm we used the <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/">MovieLens 20M Dataset</a> that is widely used for recommender system testing and benchmarking..&nbsp;<br></p><p>The results we got can be seen below.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Pure CF method based on SVD Matrix Factorization</strong><br></p><p>The default sparsity of the user-item matrix was <strong>99.28%</strong>, and the average RMSE error tends to be around 1.0682 with minimum standard deviation.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577bac716622a7dacc942_IF0tXRDyIDjRnbsYn9Rc300V1lHQL41S3SV2chFmBFguNOfZrNwV45wGJGrG9yOd-6xxFvX0Qo1A2zwxvO_sQ2T_VOrECCcVUZXsIcybfSCBIUha6O59hgG2KSpj6De_wmZ5un0.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Hybrid Recommender using&nbsp; CBCF</strong><br></p><p>After applying the CBCF algorithm using a content-based filter, the sparsity 0 as all uninterested item preferences are replaced by the predicted value. The average RMSE tends to be around 0.1099.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba78093ab286304374_XdvIsW4av8HvhnXwsR3Clo_4WaEPgJN4Au2JFZLA1jeUsoBKiIeTvcIvbkDknbHnP9b8kW_M6AEOkhxJR-5OXLX-aqmolqZvRqITmQtBYeM_ILPUr74IsEyva0FuqjhHVS2NxwU.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As we can see both the RMSE and MAE values have decreased considerably for the CBCF model as compared to the pure CF method.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The time required to fit (train) and test the model does increase considerably using the hybrid method. This is something that needs to be taken into consideration in production use-cases.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In conclusion, we have seen that the type of recommendation engine algorithm needs to be chosen based on the type of dataset we have. Standard Collaborative Filtering methods although very popular and useful do not always work, especially when the data is very sparse.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For user-specific recommendations where the user preferences data is available and a high degree of personalization sought Content-based filtering methods are useful. Collaborative filtering will work better when there is explicit feedback given and data sparsity isn't too high. Hybrid recommendation methods like Content Boosted Collaborative Filtering takes the advantages of both content and collaborative filtering when we have item attributes, and improves the models by removing data sparsity and reducing errors.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-implementing-smart-contract-edsl-in-haskell">previous post</a>, we introduced Lorentz base syntax which allows one to write code in the following manner:</p><pre><code>

<span>distance</span> :: [<span>Integer</span>, <span>Integer</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Natural</span>]
<span>distance</span> = <span>do</span>
  dup; mul
  dip $ <span>do</span> dup; mul
  add; isNat
  <span>if</span> <span>IsSome</span> <span>then</span> nop
  <span>else</span> push [mt|<span>Something</span> went wrong|]; failWith
</code></pre><p>Michelson provides several basic primitives types and ways to group them in products (<code>pair</code>) and sums (<code>or</code>), and we still follow this behaviour.
As noted in a <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-complex-objects">spin-off post about Lorentz objects</a>, the opportunity to group types into a sum of products corresponds to Haskell’s datatypes, but one other feature remains unused.</p><p>In this post, we will talk about Haskell <em>newtypes</em> and why they can be a powerful tool in a smart contract eDSL like Lorentz.</p><details>
  <summary>A note about type signature syntax.</summary>
<p>In this article, we are going to write <code>[a, b] :-&gt; [c, d]</code> in signatures, rather than <code>a : b : s :-&gt; c : d : s</code>, for simplicity.
The reader may notice that such methods will not be general enough, but Lorentz has a <code>framed</code> function which makes any given instruction polymorphic over a stack tail, so that is not a big concern.</p>
<p>Also, by Haskell rules, lists of types with less than two elements have to be prefixed with a tick to avoid ambiguity with plain lists.</p>
</details><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p><em>Newtype</em> is a type that is a mere wrapper over another already existing type but may have its custom semantics.
Newtypes are supposed to be free in terms of performance and only affect the type-checking stage, so they allow stricter correctness guarantees to be verified at compile time.</p><p>We have encountered two kinds of real-life examples where newtypes are useful:</p><h3 id="distinguishing-different-entities-with-the-same-representation">Distinguishing different entities with the same representation</h3><p>For instance, it is common for advanced token smart contracts to allow participants to have multiple addresses with money.
The user probably wants to know the balances of those addresses, and eventually, we may need to have three methods for that:</p><pre><code>
<span>getAddressBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]


<span>getParticipantBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]


<span>getOwnerBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]
</code></pre><p>When using these methods in the form they are mentioned, types don’t help us at all.
It is possible to apply <code>getOwnerBalance</code> to an address of a participant by mistake.</p><p>If we manage to make bad code like this impossible to write, that should improve the development experience and correctness of the resulting contracts.</p><h3 id="types-with-invariants">Types with invariants</h3><p>Let’s imagine that business logic assumes you have several flags for each address: whether it is locked by the user, whether the user should be notified by e-mail on balance change, whether the user’s cat is authorized to spend money from this address, &lt;insert your own&gt;.</p><p>A general efficient way to represent such a flag set is by keeping a numeric bitmask.
Following the fail-fast principle, you want to ensure that an invalid bitmask is not produced at any stage across the contract.
And, actually, there might be many places whether the bitmask can become invalid – contract origination, separate flag changes (in case some flags can contradict with others), and changes as a whole (batch update by user). You would like to make sure that no validity check is missing in any of these places.</p><p>In general Haskell code, such problems are often solved by declaring a newtype with explicitly stated invariants and providing constructors/modifiers which treat those invariants.</p><h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2><p>In Lorentz, we declare newtypes as follows:</p><pre><code><span><span>newtype</span> <span>MyType</span> = <span>MyType</span> <span>Integer</span></span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span><span>newtype</span> <span>IsoValue</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Let us remind that <code>IsoValue</code> describes how Lorentz types are translated into Michelson, and the <code>deriving newtype</code> clause is Haskell’s syntax that says that behaviour of <code>IsoValue</code> should be inherited from the inner type, <code>Integer</code> in our case.</p><p>Now one can write:</p><pre><code><span>putDefaultMyType</span> :: '[] :-&gt; '[<span>MyType</span>]
<span>putDefaultMyType</span> = push (<span>MyType</span> <span>0</span>)
</code></pre><p>That was simple.</p><p>The main benefit we get is that <code>MyType</code> is treated as a type completely different from <code>Integer</code> or any other newtype wrapper over <code>Integer</code>, so misapplying a function to a wrong argument would raise a compilation error.</p><p>Now we would like to have dedicated methods for converting between newtype and its inner representation.
Lorentz already defines <code>forcedCoerce_</code> method that converts between any two types having the same Michelson representation, but it is pretty broad and requires special care from the developer to be used correctly: a typo or a wrong mental model is pretty likely to cause a bug, so this method should be avoided in business logic layer.</p><p>We would like to allow users to be specific in their intentions via methods specialized to newtype wrapping/unwrapping. For this reason, we define the following methods:</p><pre><code><span>coerceWrap</span> :: <span>Wrappable</span> a =&gt; '[<span>Unwrappable</span> a] :-&gt; '[a]
<span>coerceWrap</span> = forcedCoerce_

<span>coerceUnwrap</span> :: <span>Wrappable</span> a =&gt; '[a] :-&gt; '[<span>Unwrappable</span> a]
<span>coerceUnwrap</span> = forcedCoerce_
</code></pre><details>
  <summary>One more note about type signatures.</summary>
<p>Being part of the library, these two methods are of course defined in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/99fbc99defdedd02568f59cc692c0f021cc9209e/code/lorentz/src/Lorentz/Coercions.hs#L90">more generic way</a></p>
</details><p>Note the <code>Wrappable a</code>: when our newtype does not have any invariants and can be wrapped and unwrapped safely, we declare it to have a <a href="https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/0574c85b78214129b5673b0f8e09b0761711522f/code/lorentz/src/Lorentz/Wrappable.hs#L20"><code>Wrappable</code></a> instance.
It looks like this:</p><pre><code><span><span>newtype</span> <span>Participant</span> = <span>Participant</span> <span>Address</span></span>
  <span>deriving</span> stock (<span>Generic</span>)
  <span>deriving</span> anyclass (<span>IsoValue</span>, <span>Wrappable</span>)

<span>authenticate</span> :: '[<span>Participant</span>] :-&gt; '[]
<span>authenticate</span> = <span>do</span>
  coerceUnwrap  
  sender        
  assertEq [mt|<span>Method</span> executed not by the expected participant|]
</code></pre><p>We deem <code>coerceWrap</code> to be always safe: if a given newtype has invariants, it should not instantiate <code>Wrappable</code> typeclass in favor of another way we will consider a bit later.</p><h3 id="newtypes-with-invariants">Newtypes with invariants</h3><p>Now let us consider the previously mentioned example with bitmasks.
As before, we declare a dedicated newtype:</p><pre><code>

<span><span>newtype</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> { <span>unFlags</span> :: <span>Natural</span> }</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span><span>newtype</span> <span>IsoValue</span></span>
</code></pre><p>And there were three use cases for it which we wanted to support.
The first one is constructing a Haskell value that can later be provided in contract origination.
This can be done safely in various ways using built-in Haskell features and is up to the developer.</p><details>
  <summary>We would implement it as follows.</summary>
<pre><code>
<span>flag1</span>, flag2, flag3 :: <span>Flags</span>
<span>flag1</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>1</span>
<span>flag2</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>2</span>
<span>flag3</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>4</span>


<span><span>instance</span> <span>Semigroup</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  a &lt;&gt; b = <span>Flags</span> (unFlags a .|. unFlags b)


<span><span>instance</span> <span>Monoid</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  mempty = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>0</span>



<span>
<span>instance</span> <span>Bounded</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  minBound = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>0</span>
  maxBound = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>7</span>


<span>myCustomFlags</span> :: <span>Flags</span>
<span>myCustomFlags</span> = mconcat [flag1, flag2]




</code></pre>
</details><p>Next, we need to make sure that contract code never produces an invalid value when operating with <code>Flags</code>.
Michelson has many polymorphic operations (<code>ADD</code>, <code>NOT</code>, <code>OR</code>), and it so happened that in Lorentz, one has to explicitly declare which of these operations are permitted for the introduced types.
In our case, this is actually handy: if we allow only logical operations on our <code>Flags</code> type, then its invariants will never get violated during contract execution.</p><pre><code>
<span><span>instance</span> <span>ArithOp</span> <span>And</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  <span><span>type</span> <span>ArithRes</span> <span>And</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>Flags</span></span>


<span><span>instance</span> <span>ArithOp</span> <span>Or</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  <span><span>type</span> <span>ArithRes</span> <span>Or</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>Flags</span></span>



</code></pre><p>In case some flags can contradict  each other, we would rather define a special function that adds flags with care:</p><pre><code>
<span>addFlag1</span> :: '[<span>Flags</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>addFlag1</span> = <span>do</span>
  ... 
  push flag1
  uniteFlagsUnsafe

<span>uniteFlagsUnsafe</span> :: [<span>Flags</span>, <span>Flags</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>uniteFlagsUnsafe</span> = <span>do</span>
  forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>; dip (forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>);
  or
  forcedCoerce_
</code></pre><p>Using this set of coercions may seem to make the contract less efficient, but because of the optimizer (which any eDSL should have for various reasons), these <code>forcedCoerce_</code> calls will not appear in the resulting Michelson code.</p><p>Finally, the last case is accepting a user-provided value.
This can be useful when the user wants to overwrite the existing value of a flag, and we need to make sure that his input is indeed valid.
Here, newtype helps us draw a line between checked data we can work with or store (<code>Flags</code>) and yet unchecked data we accept as input (let it be just <code>Natural</code> for simplicity).</p><pre><code>
<span>toFlagsUnsafe</span> :: '[<span>Natural</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>toFlagsUnsafe</span> = forcedCoerce_


<span>toFlags</span> :: '[<span>Natural</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>toFlags</span> = <span>do</span>
  dup
  push (maxBound @<span>Flags</span>); forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>IsLe</span>
  <span>then</span> <span>do</span> push [mt|<span>Invalid</span> flags value|]; pair; failWith @(<span>MText</span>, <span>Natural</span>)
  <span>else</span> toFlagsUnsafe
</code></pre><p>The bottom line: in Lorentz, one can use newtypes in a very similar way to how it usually happens in general Haskell code.
Some wrap/unwrap boilerplate in the form of <code>forcedCoerce_</code> calls will still be involved, but now the type system will assist you in ensuring that all the data is used correctly.</p><h2 id="common-questions">Common questions</h2><h3 id="do-i-need-types-if-i-can-write-tests%3F">Do I need types if I can write tests?</h3><p>While types are not meant to fully replace tests, a single newtype wrapper can eliminate the need for an entire category of tests just because buggy code cannot be written using safe primitives anymore.
Furthermore, the type system hints the developer if some check is missing.
This is an especially useful property for library writers, as their users also get a piece of that safety automatically.</p><p>Also (this point is often not taken into account) tests may form quite a large codebase that also has to be maintained, so you would like to avoid writing repetitive tests for trivial failure cases where possible.</p><p>For more details, I recommend Ken Fox’s <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/12/09/typed-language-tdd-part1/">article</a> explaining why it is beneficial to have both types and tests.</p><h3 id="what-about-formal-verification%3F">What about formal verification?</h3><p>Unlike the described newtypes approach, formal verification allows you to express arbitrary properties of your data and thus has a significantly broader scope.</p><p>However, in practice its use is pretty complicated:</p><ol>
<li>You may need to know a special proof assistant language like Coq to verify your programs;</li>
<li>You have to write proofs yourself.</li>
</ol><p>This way, formal verification may often be infeasible for large contracts.</p><p>On the other hand, newtypes feature lets you put a constraint only on one piece of data at a time, so, for instance, <code>amount &gt; 0 || storage.x &gt; 0</code> …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="short-intro-to-schema-types-in-asyncapi">Short Intro to Schema Types in AsyncAPI<a href="#short-intro-to-schema-types-in-asyncapi" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>There are many different schema formats that one might use to describe the message payload. Not everyone uses JSON Schema. There are multiple formats out there, like RAML 1.0 Data Types, Avro, or even OpenAPI 3.0. When you write your AsyncAPI file, you should not manually convert schemas that you already store somewhere in a format different from AsyncAPI Schema. The best practice is to reuse existing schemas by referring to them in your AsyncAPI file and making sure that the Message object has information about the schema format within the schemaFormat parameter.</p>

<p>AsyncAPI <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0/#messageObjectSchemaFormatTable" target="_blank">lists schema types</a> that are a MUST but is not limited to this list only. RAML Data Types is not a MUST HAVE, yet we already have a custom parser for it.</p>

<p>From the AsyncAPI tooling perspective, we have a <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/" target="_blank">basic JavaScript Parser</a> capable of parsing schema of the payload provided with AsyncAPI schema format or JSON schema format. Other schema parsers are plugins that you can register with a parser, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/openapi-schema-parser" target="_blank">OpenAPI 3.0</a> or <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/raml-dt-schema-parser" target="_blank">RAML 1.0 Data Types</a>. You could provide such plugins as well for your custom formats.</p>

<h3 id="avro-parser">Avro Parser<a href="#avro-parser" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>The 3rd plugin that we now officially support is related to Avro schema type. The first minor version is already out there, and you can give it a try, even if your schemas are in the Confluent Schema Registry. Have a look at the docs of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/avro-schema-parser" target="_blank">the Avro schema parser</a>. The Avro parser is also part of the latest release candidate of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/" target="_blank">the Generator</a>. Please help us make it work for you.</p>

<h2 id="circular-references-in-asyncapi">Circular References in AsyncAPI<a href="#circular-references-in-asyncapi" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Now JavaScript Parser can handle circular references that you might have in your AsyncAPI files. The current implementation fully dereferences circular references, and you cannot change this behavior. We also extended the API to help you out to deal with circular references:</p>

<ul>
<li>The core AsyncAPI model now contains the hasCircular() function that you can use to determine at the very beginning if a given AsyncAPI document contains some circular references or not. An example use case for it is to throw a proper error message to the user with a clear message that circular references are not supported by your tool at the moment,</li>
<li>The Schema model contains isCircular() function to check if a given schema is circular, so you do not have to detect it on your own and adequately react</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/pull/94/files" target="_blank">this</a> pull request for implementation details. The work is still in progress as nice features in the Parser do not mean now all the Generator’s templates will support it. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/issues/83#issuecomment-659958312" target="_blank">this</a> comment if you need more details.</p>

<h2 id="typescript-support-in-parser">TypeScript Support in Parser<a href="#typescript-support-in-parser" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Since Parser 0.27 we will now always generate <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/blob/master/types.d.ts" target="_blank">TypeScript types</a> to make it much easier for TypeScript developers to use Parser in their tools.</p>

<h2 id="generator-release-candidate-7-is-out">Generator Release Candidate 7 is out<a href="#generator-release-candidate-7-is-out" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>We just released another release candidate that contains a lot of improvements that we added to the Parser. It also includes the above mentioned <code>avro-schema-parser</code> so it is easier for you to test it out. Give it a try.</p>

<h3 id="publish-vs-subscribe-discussion-continues">Publish vs Subscribe Discussion Continues<a href="#publish-vs-subscribe-discussion-continues" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>We noticed that people that interact with AsyncAPI for the first time are confused about the meaning of those two words, publish and subscribe. Without going much into detail and oversimplifying things, we can say that this is the part of the community that considers using AsyncAPI to describe their internal broker-centric architecture. In such cases, you want to describe the application’s behavior and not what others can do with it. You want to use the Publish verb to specify that your application publishes to a given channel. What if your application is exposed to the outside world where others can interact with it? You want Publish to mean something different, like it is now, that it means your application is subscribed to a given channel, so that you can publish to it, and the application will receive a message.</p>

<p>Event-driven architectures are complex beasts with many patterns, and we should try to make AsyncAPI a single home for all of them. Please engage in this discussion, share your thoughts, and help us out to find the best solution:</p>

  <p>For HA and easier management of our containers we can create swarm cluster.<br>
It is composed of couple nodes with docker engine installed.</p>
<p>How to setup swarm and use it?</p>
<h3 id="example-configuration-and-prerequisites">Example configuration and prerequisites</h3>
<p>In my lab environment I used three nodes:</p>

<th>Role in Swarm</th>
<th>Server</th>
<th>IP</th>

<td>docker-host1.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker1</td>
<td>docker-host2.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker2</td>
<td>docker-host3.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each node has got docker engine installed with standard procedure as for single node docker.</p>
<p>Ports that are need to be open on each node:</p>
<table>

<li><code>--default-addr-pool</code> - by default <code>10.10.10.0/8</code> - we can set another address pool for overlay network created with cluster</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool-mask-len</code> - number on subnets that are allow to be created in <code>--default-addr-pool</code></li>

July 30, 2020 | https://vriad.com/essays/a-new-funding-model-for-open-source | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vriad.com/essays/a-new-funding-model-for-open-source">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time.</p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~\$17k</a> of donations annually.</p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability.</p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays \$0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, \$1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js</li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project.</p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

Dragonfly is&nbsp;not&nbsp;the only&nbsp;mission that will&nbsp;use drone technology. The&nbsp;Perseverance rover that will be launched tomorrow (July 30, 2020) will&nbsp;also&nbsp;carry&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">Mars Helicopter</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;with it to Mars&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to test this technology for the first time on&nbsp;another world.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">Our project, Dragonfly Mini, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;autonomous vehicle&nbsp;that consist of a rover and a drone.&nbsp;The rover is powered by&nbsp;an&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">NVIDIA Jetson Nano</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">,&nbsp;a&nbsp;small supercomputer that is capable of processing different AI algorithms.&nbsp;The rover can move autonomously,&nbsp;but it can also be controlled&nbsp;remotely.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is equipped with&nbsp;a camera and&nbsp;mobile phone that is used&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;access&nbsp;point&nbsp;to the Internet.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Besides&nbsp;being a communication device, we also made full usage of&nbsp;the&nbsp;mobile phone cameras, sensors and&nbsp;its&nbsp;processing power.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The rover&nbsp;is capable of controlling&nbsp;camera equipped drone, which&nbsp;gives it better overview of the surrounding area.&nbsp;Collected data is processed with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jetson Nano and data points are uploaded to&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">Microsoft’s Azure cloud</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></span><span><span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>In order to test our rover, we decided to take a trip to Iceland. Besides being able to record in a nice environment, Iceland is over 2000 kilometres away from our home office in Malmö and we consider it to be an impressive enough distance for a test of this project. Tests were done in the southern part of Iceland and we were careful to test it on allowed areas only, since, as you probably know, moss on Iceland is protected and if damaged takes years to grow back. If you are planning a similar experiment, please have that in mind. Feel free to check the video below to see what people who worked on the project said about it.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">There were different challenges in order to&nbsp;execute&nbsp;this project.&nbsp;The first&nbsp;thing we had to figure out is how to move the rover. We equipped&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jetson Nano with a&nbsp;camera,&nbsp;and we trained it&nbsp;for&nbsp;obstacle&nbsp;detection through deep learning.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span></span></p>

<p>It's two days before Jessica will be unable to pay her rent for the first time in her life, and she is standing at the gate of the private charity "Hermandad del Refugio" in downtown Zaragoza. Here in the capital of the Aragon region, between Barcelona and Madrid, the summers are hot and the winters windy. Around 10 a.m. in late May, the sun is already scorching.</p>


<p>There are 18 men and women ahead of Jessica in line, standing silently, their arms folded across their chests. They are all pulling shopping trolleys, into which they'll pack milk cartons, noodles and two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of chicken. Without the free food provided by the Catholic charity, the people in line would have trouble making ends meet.</p>

</figure><p>The coronavirus pandemic brought large parts of the Spanish economy to a standstill. When Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced the lockdown on the evening of March 14, shops, restaurants, concert halls and shops all closed down and from one day to the next, public life and the economy ground to a halt. Within six weeks, 760,000 people had lost their jobs -- on top of the more than 3 million people who had already been unemployed at the beginning of the year. Another 3 million were furloughed.</p>

<div>
<h3>More Hungry People</h3><p>Jessica, too, lost her job, though she didn't actually have to be laid off. Jessica is a singer and In March, she was still working with an orchestra. Technically, she was only ever employed for the day of the performance, but she still earned enough money to survive. A portion of the 900 euros ($1,016) she earned a month was paid out in cash.</p><p>She received notice of her termination via WhatsApp and in mid-May, Jessica went to a food bank for the first time. She'd rather not give her last name. "It makes me sad to stand in line here," she says. The charity in downtown Zaragoza is currently providing 2,271 people with free food, and increase of 504 since before the lockdown.</p>
</div>


<div>
<p>The same thing has been happening all over Spain. In the cities of Madrid and Barcelona, but also in rural areas, Catholic charities have provided 60 percent more aid than in previous years, says Raúl Flores of the Foessa Foundation, which is investigating the social situation for Caritas.</p><p>The lines of hungry people are growing longer and longer and they are the most visible sign of what the country can likely expect in the coming months: the worst economic crisis since the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939. According to worst-case estimates by the Bank of Spain, the economy could shrink by up to 14 percent and unemployment could rise to 21 percent, which would push the country's sovereign debt load to 130 percent of the country's gross domestic product.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>A New Social Law Is Born</h3><p>The coronavirus crisis has accelerated the debate in Spain over the introduction of a basic income, since state-funded social aid does not yet exist. It wasn't until the death of the dictator Franco in 1975 that a welfare state developed here, though it was rather week. Families with children receive hardly any support.</p><p>The introduction of a basic income was therefore the main election promise of the leftist Podemos party and they made the program part of their coalition agreement with the Socialists last fall. Now the Sánchez government is rushing to get the project off the ground to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from plunging into the abyss.</p><p>"It is a historic moment for our democracy," said Podemos leader and Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias, "the birth of a new social law."</p><p>Spain, after all, still hasn't fully recovered from the consequences of the financial and economic crisis of 2008. Even before the outbreak of the virus, the poverty rate hovered around 20 percent and the labor market is divided, with too few people enjoying permanent contracts with unemployment benefits, and too many having to make do with temporary contracts that often only last for a few days. According to statistics from the Spanish employment agency SEPE, 8.4 million people are now looking for a job.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>The Only Way to Survive</h3><p>Thus far, only regional governments have allocated aid money -- paltry sums that reached only 75,000 people, or barely a third of all the poor, according to social researcher Flores. Basic income would provide financial security for the most vulnerable 850,000 households.</p><p>But an "ingreso mínimo vital," literally a "minimum income to live," comes with strings attached. The program would only apply to people between the ages of 23 and 65 and they must have been registered as living in Spain for at least one year without interruption. They must also be actively looking for a steady job, be involved in a continuing education program or, in cases of drug dependency, be enrolled in a therapy program. The social welfare office would look into applicants' assets and existing income and that would be topped up to a level of 462 euros per month for singles and up to 1,015 euros per month for a family of five.</p>

<p>For 2.3 million Spaniards, a basic income is likely the only way to get through the corona crisis. Nowhere is this more evident than in Madrid, the city hit the hardest by the pandemic. The capital is one of the richest regions in the country, yet there are plenty of needy people, such as in the tangled side streets from behind the Puerta del Sol to the Plaza de Jacinto Benavente.</p><p>The Ave Maria food bank, run by the city, mostly takes care of the homeless, but since March, geriatric nurses, waitresses and salespeople have also been showing up. All of them have lost their jobs. The crisis first hit those who worked illegally or only had short-term contracts, often foreign workers who had found a precarious job during the recent economic upswing. They were among the first to be laid off.</p><h3>A Real Boost</h3><p>One of them is Mario Ignat. The 30-year-old came to Spain from Romania eight years ago and has been working in construction ever since. But there's no more work to be had. In Madrid alone, 138,000 people have lost their jobs and half a million have been furloughed, a consequence of around 1,000 companies going bankrupt each week during the lockdown.</p><p>Ignat hasn't yet lived in Spain for 10 years, so he doesn't have Spanish citizenship. He earns barely enough to pay rent and there is nothing left over for going out with friends, having a beer in the bar next door or even cooking for himself. The new basic income could significantly improve his life.</p><p>For Mario Ignat and Jessica, a lot depends on when the money will actually be paid out. They can apply for the basic income starting on June 15 and before the end of the month, the first 100,000 eligible applicants will receive aid retroactively going back to June 1. That, at least, is what the government has promised. Jessica hopes that she won't end up on the street before then.</p><p><em>With reporting by Oliver Imhof in Madrid</em></p>

<p>This is about a reaction I noticed with myself in response to membership programs, patreons and individual sponsorship as I've run into significantly more of these following Corona. The advertising-supported model has confirmed many of the concerns about its sustainability and creators are looking for more reliable options. I think this feeling I have might be something other people experience and something for creators to be prepared for.</p>
<p>Creating anything in a sustainable fashion is hard work. You are fighting uphill against a cultural expectation for things to be free on the web. Often a simple solution is a good solution. The simplest way is asking ones extremely enthusiastic fans to chip in, often with some incentive, such as bonus content. It is a solution with strongly aligned incentives, those who pay get more of the thing they like and they are already invested in sustaining the creation. The creator gets paid without needing to tailor their format or subject matter to the whims of sponsors or advertisers and can focus on making what the fans already want. Well-aligned incentives.</p>
<p>I think this model is great when it works, I think CGP Grey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN44ETT6mUY">made his case very well</a>. He generally makes tightly produced videos with long times between releases. YouTube advertising monetization is not optimized for his content though I'm sure it does pretty well. Beyond that the pandemic means companies cut down on advertising and this pushes more creators to try this model as rates go down and opportunities dwindle.</p>
<p>I've noticed something about my reaction to an increasing number of memberships. They frustrate me. Especially when they come in groups or too closely. This is a feeling, my robotic logic, I'm mostly human. I feel a bit of an "ugh" even before I consider whether the offer makes sense for me or not.</p>
<p>Part of it can be FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). I absolutely dislike not having access to all of the content or behind-the-scenes for something I follow enthusiastically. Part of it can be the normal reaction to a kind of paywall. But generally the podcasts, newsletters and stuff that I follow aren't actually removing anything. They are just adding some premium stuff. I still feel that twitch, that small frustration.</p>
<p>So what do I think it is? A kind of fatigue, as the title indicates. I want to support, I want to engage. But I also want to be mindful in how I spend my money. And $5/month adds up pretty quickly. There is a lot of consideration in committing that recurring payment for .. indefinite duration. And I think I'm getting sick of deciding. I always feel an element of shame if I don't support a creator I like. I think a key term here is support. Positive thing right? You are supposed to support good things. So why aren't you being supportive? This is of course a bit irrational and you shouldn't feel bad. As often is the case with feelings, we don't get to decide them.</p>
<p>Let's call this the <strong>Five Dollar Fatigue</strong>, sounds catchy. If the trend continues I can be a thought-leader and I'm sure that's good for something. So yeah, the feeling of growing frustration connected to things you like or love continuously asking you for money.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to lower the internal conflict when this kind of arrangement is brought up.</p>
<p>For me, personally. I think I might need to figure out what my actual budget is for supporting independent creators on a monthly basis. Then I don't have to re-evaluate it each time something I like wants my financial support.</p>
<p>For creators. I think most are thoughtful and graceful when they ask for the money and I think it would be worse if they were as heavy-handed as Wikipedia for example (lots of pressure and guilt in all communication, I've complained to them repeatedly). I think creators just need to be ready for the possibility that some fans will still react poorly, or more grudgingly accepting than enthusiastic not because of that particular arrangement but because of all the ones considered before it.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts on this piece of writing do let me know at <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a> on Twitter. If you want more of my writing I have
    a non-tracking newsletter which usually comes with
    podcast recommendations and more in-depth thinking. Often about sustainability in software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><label>Feb 7, 2019 • 14 min read</label><h2>Reflecting on My Failure to Build a Billion-Dollar Company</h2><p>In 2011, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to work on what I thought would be my life’s work.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just had an idea for my first billion-dollar company. Tomorrow, I start building it.</p>— Sahil Lavingia (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/54072049395712000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2011</a></blockquote> <p>I thought Gumroad would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something like that.</p><p>Needless to say, that didn’t happen.</p><p>Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, low-maintenance software business serving adoring customers. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.</p><p>It took me years to realize I was misguided from the outset. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today — but for a long time, I did. This is my journey, from the beginning.</p><h2>A weekend project turned VC-backed startup</h2><p>The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple links. No need for a storefront.</p><p>I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.</p><p>Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life’s work.</p><p>Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.</p><p>I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.</p><p>We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn’t.</p><p>To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.</p><p>Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published “Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures.” All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers’ concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don’t blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.</p><p>So what exactly went wrong, and when?</p><h2>Failing in style</h2><p>Let’s start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/0_z7tBf5i6wH-HbLhU.png"></p><p>It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s going in the right direction: up.</p><p>But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of double-or-nothing. It’s euphoric when things are going your way — and suffocating when they’re not. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we were looking for to grow the team.</p><p>For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.</p><p>But at the time, I thought it was okay. We had money in the bank and product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; the slow growth wasn’t our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.</p><p>But now, I realize: It doesn’t matter whose “fault” it is; we hit a peak in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until acquisition or IPO).</p><p>In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway. I told my 20-person team the road ahead would be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get even close. To that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would directly move the needle. Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it needed to be.</p><p>If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire more people, and pick up the journey where we’d left off. If we didn’t, we would have to drastically downsize the company.</p><p>In those nine months, when the whole team knew we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard,” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever.</p><p>We launched a “Small Product Lab” to teach new creators how to grow and sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to debit cards, payouts to the U.K., Australia, and Canada, various additions to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they’ve purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just between August and November.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t hit the numbers we needed.</p><h2>Slim down or shut down?</h2><p>Looking back, I’m glad we didn’t hit those numbers. If we’d doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there would have been a very real possibility of even more spectacular failure.</p><p>With that off the table, our options were:</p><p>Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something new.</p><p>Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for sustainability.</p><p>Position the company for an acquihire.</p><p>Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings — and their money.</p><p>I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors — in that order. We helped thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?</p><p>If I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team — and I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories of companies promising exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come — and ending with a deprecated product a year later.</p><p>Selling was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn’t sit right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That’s what I told every new hire and every investor. I didn’t want to become a serial entrepreneur and risk disappointing yet another customer base.</p><p>We decided to become profitable at any cost. The next year was not fun: I shrunk the company from twenty employees to five. We struggled to find a new tenant for our $25,000/month office. We focused all of our remaining resources on launching a premium service.</p><p>In June 2015, a few months before our layoffs, our financials looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $89,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $17,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $364,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: -$351,000</strong></li></ul><p>A year later, in June 2016, our monthly numbers looked like this:</p><ul><li>Revenue: $176,000 for the month</li><li>Gross profit: $42,000</li><li>Operating expenses: $32,000</li><li><strong>Net profit: +$10,000</strong></li></ul><p>It hurt, but it meant creators would keep getting paid. It also meant that we were in control of our own destiny.</p><h2>From skeleton crew to lifestyle business</h2><p>It got worse from there.</p><p>Gumroad was no longer the venture-funded, fast-growing startup our investors and employees signed up for. As everyone else found other opportunities, the skeleton crew fizzled from five to one.</p><p>I was basically alone. I didn’t have a team, nor an office. And San Francisco was full of startups raising gobs of money, building amazing teams, and shipping great products. Some of my friends became billionaires. Meanwhile, I was running a “measly” lifestyle business. It wasn’t what I wanted to do, but I had to keep the ship from sinking.</p><p>Now, I understand some people would dream to be in that position. But at the time, I just felt trapped. I couldn’t stop, but there was only so much I could do as an army of one.</p><p>For years, my only metric of success was building a billion-dollar company. Now, I realize that was a terrible goal.</p><p>I shut off the rest of the world. I didn’t tell my mom about the layoffs — she had to read the article and tweets herself to find out. My friends were worried, but I assured them I was neither depressed nor suicidal. I left San Francisco for long stretches at a time, thinking that some travel would give me adequate distance. It only made me more lonely.</p><p>Every day, I woke up and took care of all of Gumroad’s support queries. I tried to fix all of the bugs I could. Often, I had to ask for help from former Gumroad engineers. They were all employed by then, but they always found time to help. Once all things Gumroad were taken care of, I tried to go to the gym, and if I had the willpower, work on a side project (a fantasy novel). Most days, I failed.</p><p>To me, happiness is about an expectation of positive change. Every year …</p></div></div>

July 29, 2020 | https://forum.kee.pm/t/a-critical-security-update-for-keepassrpc-is-available/3040 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://forum.kee.pm/t/a-critical-security-update-for-keepassrpc-is-available/3040">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Today we published a new version of KeePassRPC (1.12.1) which resolves critical security vulnerabilities in all previous versions of the plugin.</p>
<p><strong>To ensure that your passwords stored within KeePass Password Safe remain secret, you must <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">install this new version</a> immediately.</strong></p>
<p>This does not affect Kee browser extension users that store passwords only in <a href="https://keevault.pm/">Kee Vault</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a vulnerability in the Kee browser extension so re-installing, updating, downgrading, disabling or removing Kee will not affect your exposure to this risk.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether you are affected, simply follow the instructions for <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">updating KeePassRPC</a>. If you find an old version of <em>KeePassRPC.plgx</em> on your computer, you should replace it with the newest version immediately.</p>
<p>Download version 1.12.1 or newer from GitHub and install it right now. If you’re unsure how to install a new version of a KeePass plugin, we have documentation to help you at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">Upgrading KeePassRPC</a>.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Additional information about the update</summary>
<p>Version 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 both contain the fixes for these vulnerabilities. If you’re one of the few people who have installed version 1.12.0, you only have to upgrade to 1.12.1 if you want to connect the KeeBird Thunderbird email client extension to KeePassRPC. Unless you already have version 1.12.0 installed, please <strong>install version 1.12.1</strong>.</p>
<p>If for some reason you are unable to update to the new version, some mitigating actions include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lock your KeePass databases and do not unlock them until the plugin has been updated</li>
<li>Close all web browsers and do not browse the internet until the plugin has been updated</li>
<li>Change the websocket <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/keepassrpc-port/2360">port that KeePassRPC listens on</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The 3rd suggestion relies on security through obscurity and is thus unlikely to greatly reduce your risk for very long. Obviously all 3 of the above suggestions are very significantly worse than simply updating the plugin straight away.</p>
</details>
<h3>About the vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>Credit for discovering and responsibly disclosing the two related vulnerabilities goes to Philipp Danzinger, Michael Pucher and Georg Merzdovnik for helping explore the vulnerabilities as well as co-developing and hosting the proof of concept exploits.</p>
<p>Successfully exploiting either vulnerability results in an attacker gaining access to all passwords in any open KeePass databases. No obvious user interaction is required, only a visit to a malicious web site; in some cases there is no visible evidence that the vulnerability is being exploited.</p>
<details>
<summary>
'ALL' passwords may not strictly be true for every user. Expand this section to learn about the subtle potentially mitigating details</summary>
<p>KeePassRPC offers an occasionally-used feature called “Kee home group”. For each open database in KeePass, KeePassRPC will only reveal passwords if they are contained within this group.</p>
<p>Additionally, individual password entries can be hidden from KeePassRPC.</p>
<p>For most people the entire database of entries was at risk of exposure but for those that utilise either of these two features, that action may have limited the set of entries that were at risk of exposure.</p>
<p>Even if you used these features to manage your entries, an additional factor may still have allowed <em>all</em> entries to be exposed. As explained in the KeePassRPC user interface and existing documentation, enabling the KeePass placeholders feature is a security risk in its own right. If you had any entries visible to KeePassRPC which had the placeholder feature enabled, it is feasible that an attacker could have used this to access all entries.</p>
<p>It is also worth remembering that KeePassRPC only ever sees entries which have a URL field set so if that field is empty, the contents of the entry can only have been at risk if you also utilised the placeholders feature.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> An initial version of this announcement stated that remote code execution would be possible via placeholders. Deeper investigation has confirmed that this was not possible. Apologies for the additional alarm but I felt it was better to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>We consider this to be the most serious category of security vulnerability and implore you to take immediate action - KeePass does not have an automatic update feature so <strong>you must apply the fix yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities were not previously publicly known so <strong>if you take prompt action, it is extremely unlikely that your passwords have been exposed</strong>. However, it is not possible to determine with 100% certainty that you were not targeted by a malicious attacker so you may wish to change your passwords, at least somewhat sooner than you otherwise would have done. For what it’s worth, I will personally be undertaking a password change procedure on all passwords that can feasibly be used to access systems that affect the integrity or security of KeePassRPC, the Kee browser extension, Kee Vault and all related services. Otherwise, I think that the risk is low enough that I will not be accelerating my usual 5-20 year change cycle for any other passwords.</p>
<p>Your master password is never exposed through KeePassRPC and the security of your kdbx file remains intact. It is the individual entries within your KeePass database that were at risk.</p>
<p>Kee 3.5 contains many improvements relating to password saving so if you choose to change any of your website passwords, you may wish to do so using the <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/beta-testing-the-kee-browser-extension/2022">latest beta version</a>. We’ll be requesting that this version of Kee is released to all Kee users very soon but it can take many weeks for the web browser developers to approve a new release.</p>
<p>The two vulnerabilities outlined below reside in the SRP authentication implementation; successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the usual password-based authentication procedure.</p>
<ol>
<li>A piece of information supplied by a KeePassRPC client was not correctly validated before being relied upon in the SRP algorithm.</li>
<li>The use of a non-cryptographically secure random number generator in a cryptographically sensitive calculation vastly increased the chance of an attacker being able to guess their way past the usual protection that SRP offers. On some systems a successful exploitation could go unnoticed and complete in less than one minute, although in many cases it would take longer and result in noticeably “strange” behaviour that could alert a user to the threat before it succeeds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both vulnerabilities have now been addressed and I have additionally developed a further security layer to reduce the chance that future vulnerabilities in the SRP server could be exploited by malicious websites. In case this additional security layer poses a problem for any consumers of KeePassRPC that are not modern browser extensions, the information I’ve posted in <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/configuring-keepassrpc-1-12-permitted-websocket-origins/3041">this new documentation topic</a> will allow you to work around the new limitation.</p>
<h3>What you can do to help</h3>
<p>No single person or organisation can release perfectly secure code so it is great to see the wider security community probing our Open Source software for vulnerabilities like this.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have the experience to help too? As well as reviewing the source code and seeking out vulnerabilities, you may be able to help to reduce the attack surface of KeePassRPC by developing a modern replacement for the HTTP-based communications protocol (websockets) that allowed these vulnerabilities to be exposed to remote systems. We may not be able to make this change without breaking backwards compatibility and it may limit the usefulness of KeePassRPC outside of the context of a browser extension but these drawbacks may be a price worth paying in order to reduce the risk of a similar vulnerability being exploited in future. I’m undecided if it is something we should actively pursue and don’t currently have the resources to implement it alone. Please check out the <a href="https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon/issues/23">relevant GitHub issue</a> if you are interested in helping out.</p>
<p>If none of the above sounds like it’s your thing please check out other ways you could help at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/contributions-bugs-help-and-support-guidelines/548">Contributions, bugs, help and support guidelines</a> .</p>
<h3>Closing remarks</h3>
<p>My priority for the past 24 hours has been ensuring a fast and thorough response to the discovery of this vulnerable SRP server implementation. As such, I can’t yet be very definitive regarding how or why these implementation mistakes were made. It appears as though they can be traced back to code that I wrote around a decade ago when so many factors were different to today. At a later date I will perform a more in-depth analysis of the likely causes - my initial thoughts lead me to think that some significant factors will have been the lack of available battle-tested .NET implementations of big integers and SRP6a.</p>
<p>Distributing critical security updates for a KeePass plugin has never been easy but I hope that this announcement, the use of the optional update notification feature within KeePass and the upcoming version 3.5 of the Kee browser extension - which will refuse to work with any earlier version of KeePassRPC - will all go some way towards accelerating the uptake of this important software update. Please point your co-workers, friends and acquaintances to this forum topic if you think they may also need to install this update.</p>
<p>In case it needs explicitly stating, I can confirm that I am personally very sorry that these vulnerabilities were introduced into KeePassRPC and remained present for so long. I am therefore very grateful to the security researchers (Philipp Danzinger, Michael Pucher and Georg Merzdovnik) who discovered the vulnerabilities and so professionally and clearly conveyed their findings to me.</p>
<p>I will prevent replies being added to this topic because posts in this category are often pushed to the community by email but please do post a new topic on this forum if you have any questions - I can’t promise a personal reply but I’ll try my best and hopefully other members of the community can help out when I’m not available.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve already done it but just in case: <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">Upgrade KeePassRPC.plgx</a> now!</p>

<p><span>T</span>he day Kim Hye-min threw up on the job while working as a graphic designer at a small broadcasting firm in Seoul, she was so overwhelmed by stress that it made her sick to her stomach. When a senior co-worker shamed her for being just a few minutes late, it echoed what she had heard from older South Koreans all her life: she wasn’t good enough. At lunchtime, she made a run for the restroom stall.</p>



<p>“The criticisms kept building up,” she says, until she reached the point where she didn’t think she could take it anymore. For 26-year-old Hye-min, as for many young South Koreans, life choices feel forced and fixed — and not like actual choices at all. Many feel so beaten down by the rigid social and professional demands of their country that they refer to it as “Hell Joseon,” a play on Korea’s old dynastic name. The path is especially bleak for young women, who must contend with the nation’s deeply rooted misogyny. Deviation from the mainstream is widely viewed as disobedient, and sometimes, in the eyes of older generations, even unpatriotic.</p>



<p>“It’s something to do with Korean society,” Hye-min says. “There’s only one way to engage in relationships with others, or one type of person who’s considered acceptable. And for people like me, it’s really hard.”</p>



<p>Again and again, her parents would ask her,<em> “</em>Hye-min, why can’t you be like your classmates and study hard and do well? Hye-min, why can’t you be like your peers and hurry to finish university and get a job?”</p>



<p>Hye-min never understood why she should have to rush through a school system that did nothing but judge and rank her, only to find a lifelong position at a company that would do the same. She dropped out of university for a year before transferring, sought out counseling for her battered self-esteem, and quit her job, despite knowing that all of these choices would be looked upon as failures. Perhaps toughest of all, Hye-min knew that, even if she were to achieve “success,” it was unlikely she’d be compensated fairly for it: <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/employment/gender-wage-gap/indicator/english_7cee77aa-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea’s gender wage gap</a> is the worst in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with men earning on average 32.5% more than women.</p>



<p>Her parents would ask, “Hye-min, why can’t you be like other women your age and find a nice man and get married?”</p>



<p>Hye-min, however, has no plans to get married. Nor does she expect to have children. After years of being told she must strive to be a good student, good employee, good wife, and good mother, she eventually decided she no longer wanted to partake in a system that ties her social currency and self-worth to such a punishing status quo. So Hye-min opted out. “Why do I have to continue on, going through these difficulties?” she says. “For what?”</p>

<p><strong>In traditionally collectivist</strong> South Korea, individualist loners, or <em>honjok</em>, are becoming increasingly common. The term, which translates to “alone tribe,” shortens and combines <em>나홀로</em>, meaning “by myself,” and <em>족</em>, “tribe.” It’s used to describe a group of people who prefer, out of pleasure or practicality — and, often, utter exhaustion and sheer desperation — to live outside of conventional social structures and simply be alone.</p>



<p>What constitutes being “alone” can be fuzzy, but it ultimately comes down to the physical and psychological boundaries one draws around oneself. Honjok might partake in leisure activities alone, maintain a single-person household, avoid a workplace or office setting, limit social circles, abstain from sex or romantic relationships, or reject marriage or children. At its core, honjok culture is about resisting South Korea’s establishment society and putting individual needs and desires above loyalty to hierarchy and authority. But living independently doesn’t automatically make someone honjok, and identifying as honjok doesn’t preclude being part of a community — especially when that community is virtual.</p>

<p>Within South Korea’s hyperactive cyberculture of online forums, blogs, and social media, an entire taxonomy has sprung up to classify, in ever greater detail, various honjok identities and activities. Many honjok are <em>honyeo</em>, or solitary women, and some honyeo, like Hye-min, are <em>bihon</em>, meaning they reject marriage and often child-rearing. There are also <em>4B</em>s, who take the ethos even further by rejecting sex and romantic relationships. When honjok eat alone, it’s called <em>honbap</em>, and when they drink alone, it’s <em>honsul</em>. They can also play alone (<em>honnol</em>), which might include traveling alone (<em>honhaeng</em>), going to the movies alone (<em>honyeong</em>), or shopping alone (<em>honsho</em>). </p>



<p>All of this contributes to a booming <em>honconomy</em>. On average, South Korea’s rapidly growing single-household population has more disposable income than those with three to four people. By 2030, the Korean Institute of Industrial Economics and Trade estimates single-household expenditures will reach almost 200 trillion won (or about $165 billion) in Korea.</p>



<p>Across the country, companies are cashing in on this lucrative market. Banks offer single-household credit cards. E-commerce platforms list honjok as a stand-alone shopping category, marketing items like tiny washing machines, multipurpose furniture, and one-person settings of dishware. Convenience stores, popular among honjok because of their ubiquitous locations and smaller quantities, put on special promotions and advertise single-serving meals and pouches of alcohol. Food delivery services promote takeout for one. Bars and restaurants promise solo patrons judgment-free service, and honjok-specific establishments set partitioned tables just for them. Specialized karaoke joints feature individual coin-operated booths. Cinemas install single-seat aisles. TV shows like “I Live Alone” and “Drinking Solo” portray honjok life, and news sites like <em>1conomy News</em> exclusively cover single living.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when the concept of honjok first appeared in South Korea, but a Daumsoft analysis shows that the use of terms such as honbap, honsul, and honnol exploded in the first half of the 2010s, going from only 44 total mentions at the beginning of the decade to more than 60,000 in 2016. Over this same period, the rate of smartphone ownership in South Korea rocketed from 14% to over 85%, and on-demand shopping emerged and blended with social media, laying the foundations for today’s cyber-mediated consumer culture. While personal tech adoption has done much to elevate honjok into a national phenomenon, it might also have revealed how many South Koreans were already seeking a way out.</p>

<p><strong>While some honjok</strong> embrace the “hon” and truly go it alone, others turn to the “jok,” the tribe of people like them, for support and validation. In communities both online and off, members strive to normalize the honjok life as a sign of modern times — a decision that is sensible and convenient, and if not something to celebrate, then at the very least nothing to be embarrassed about.</p>



<p>That honjok would need or want to look to others while isolating themselves may seem like something of a paradox. Yet, for many young honjok, the appeal lies in partaking in “a sort of shared identity” while under pressure from a status-obsessed country, says Andrew Eungi Kim, a sociology professor at Korea University. “If you don’t meet mainstream standards, you feel ashamed. With honjok, there is a sense of being a member of a group,” which, in some instances, can be as much about safety in numbers as about true solidarity.</p>



<p>Honjok Dot Com, which operates through a website and a Facebook group, is a honjok resource that describes itself as “the best gift for you alone.” Launched by 31-year-old Jang Jae-young, Honjok Dot Com recommends establishments, from barbecue restaurants to tennis courts, that cater to solo patrons, as well as various on-demand services for managing a single household. Writing over email in January, because he could not (or maybe would not) meet in person, Jae-young observed some positive changes in how South Koreans perceive honjok. “Before, this word generally implied a socially awkward person,” he noted, adding that people&nbsp;understand better now that it refers to those “who confidently choose to remain alone and stay happy.” Jae-young is an example of the latter: he has been single and living alone since 2015.</p>

<p>On King of Honjok, a community app with an accompanying website, solitaries post photos of their daily lives, shop the marketplace for honjok wares, and peruse articles like “The trend these days is ‘I live alone!’” and other content created specifically for them. They occasionally meet in person at King of Honjok events. Thirty-four-year-old co-founder Oh Jung-hee, who has been honyeo for the past decade and sees her friends in person two to three times a year, says that, in a society oriented toward families and couples, she started King of Honjok to help voluntary outsiders like her lead better lives. Whether they use it to be “independent alone” or “independent together” is up to them.</p>



<p>But, as one might imagine of a platform for people who prefer to keep their distance from others, there isn’t much interaction on King of Honjok that points to the making of deep relationships. Posts are fun and lighthearted, and comments are fairly generic, offering an occasional Wow! or Cool! or the Korean way of lol-ing, <em>ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</em>. Jung-hee estimates that, of the community’s roughly 8,000 members, mostly millennial women in Seoul, about half never interact at all.</p>



<p>That’s absolutely fine, she says, because the purpose is simply to be a presence for an often-marginalized population. That sentiment is echoed …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Interview with Jozsef Borocz by Boroka Paraszka</strong></p>



<p><a href="http://www.marosvasarhelyiradio.ro/musorok/a-feher-magasabbrendusegrol-borocz-jozsef/"><strong>The original of this interview was broadcast, in Magyar, on Marosvásárhelyi Rádió Romania—a minority-language public radio station in Târgu Mureș, Romania—on July 8, 2020</strong></a></p>



<p>Slightly edited and lightly
annotated English translation by Jozsef Borocz</p>



<p>Boroka Paraszka: You
said you were „at a loss” about the new movements in the US and their reception
in Europe. That surprised me because I thought you had a very defined opinion. </p>



<p>Jozsef Borocz: Well, I
do, and I am very critical. I am „at a loss” in two senses of the word. First,
I am actually shocked by seeing some of the things happening in the USA, even
though I have always been strongly skeptical about the political system, and some
aspects of social reality overall, like all the good people I know—I guess I
belong in a group of intellectuals who are critical observers of reality—but
even I had not expected that the situation would go so far as it has. </p>



<p>In a second sense, I
am reading the reactions to the news in the US by the greatest minds of
Hungarian intellectual scene with a shock. More precisely, perhaps it is too
strong to say that I am „shocked,” since, in a certain way, it was to be
expected that reactions of this kind would be produced—but I find the scale,
the magnitude of the positions, the&nbsp;
severity, the fury and the absence of any empathy or sensitivity,
frankly, breathtaking. </p>



<p>BP: I think that the
Hungarian refusal, the dismissive position is not a Hungarian specialty, it is
true of the rest of eastern Europe.</p>



<p>JB: Yes, of
course.&nbsp; Mostly. </p>

<p>BP: As to why it is
happening, I have no explanation, but if you do have one, I would be curious to
hear it. Where does the degree of indifference with which people react to the
events in the US come from? Let’s say, from the context of the Romanian nation
state, especially those who pursue minority rights, could, in theory, see an
opportunity in the US events, and they could see a positive example in all
this.</p>



<p>JB: &nbsp;Right. If we try to turn this entire gamut of
issues to the history of Hungarian public culture and education, it strikes me
that, at a certain, earlier time, a large part of Hungarian culture—say,
looking at folklore—had an image of idea of self and an ideal of beauty that it
found in itself as “piros-barna legény, piros-barna kislány” (red-brown girl /
boy). Metaphorically speaking, by today, Hungarian conversation has shifted to
seeing itself as “fehérnép” (white folk). I know this contrast is unfair
“methodologically,” as those two metaphors are not directly comparable, and
these are two small examples taken from a gigantic stock of folk metaphors—but
precisely as metaphors I will stay with them for now because I find them
suggestive. My point is that, over the twentieth century or so, educated
Hungarian conversation began imagining itself as “White.” I will clarify what I
mean by Whiteness in a moment. </p>



<p>Now, there are
enormous problems with that. On the one hand, factually, it is untrue. On the
other hand, it is as if, in the absolutely last moment, we were trying to climb
onboard the Titanic of global Whiteness—when we don’t even have a seat
reservation. This is basically how I can define the trajectory of our culture
over the last century.</p>



<p>I have an even better
metaphor to offer. It is based on a historical fact—and it lightens our
conversation on account of it not being about Hungary or Hungarians. Before independence,
today’s Haiti was a French colony, called Saint-Domingue. It was an important
part of the French colonial system. The colonial products grown in Haiti made
up forty to sixty percent of French colonial imports at the time. Haiti had a
plantation-based agriculture, based on slave labor. The news of the 1789 French
Revolution percolated through the colonial system—where all the population
spoke some version of French at the time—so the people of Saint-Domingue, too,
learned about the idea of “droits de l’homme”, human rights, and adopted it as
an inspiration. The result was <a href="http://ouleft.org/wp-content/uploads/CLR_James_The_Black_Jacobins.pdf">a popular uprising that was both an anti-colonial war
and a revolution aiming to put an end to slavery</a>. I obviously cannot recount <a href="https://h-france.net/fffh/maybe-missed/madison-smartt-bells-haitian-revolution-trilogy/">the beautiful history</a> of the Haitian Revolution here—I can only recommend
it for everyone <a href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0101-33002011000200010&amp;script=sci_arttext">to find out about it</a>. It is enough to know that, in the more than a decade
long anti-colonial war that ensued, at a certain point, when Poland had been
partitioned and France received a sizeable Polish emigré population, Napoleon
sent a Polish battalion to Saint-Domingue to help extinguish the uprising. The
Polish contingent arrived in the island and soon realized that their political
ideals were best matched not by the geopolitical concerns of Napoleon’s France
but those of the Haitian Revolution. </p>



<p>For us, in our part of
the world, one of the most breathtaking aspects of the history of the Haitian Revolution
is that the Polish battalion sent there by the French switched sides and
supported the uprising.&nbsp; Mind you, some
of the Polish survivors ended up settling there, and there are even today proud
Haitians who claim, partly, Polish family heritage.</p>



<p>There are many
intricacies to this story. My point is that, in the late-18<sup>th</sup>,
early-19<sup>th</sup> century, it was still possible for east European subjects
to experience a political, moral and emotional identification with Black people
and the objectives of the latters’ armed struggles against colonial rule and
slavery. This, by the way, was not unique to Poles—there is ample evidence of
similar positions in Hungarian history as well. </p>



<p>By today, this political,
moral and emotional identification has become almost impossible. </p>



<p>BP: Why?</p>



<p>JB:&nbsp; Look, this is an excellent question, and I
would like to pose it myself. I have no answer. Groups of talented young
historians of political ideas ought to re-examine the corpus of Hungarian
(Polish, etc.) culture to find the causes for this loss.&nbsp; Understanding the underlying causes for the
Whitening, so to speak, of Hungarian culture would allow us to make giant leaps
forward in coming to terms with our collective heritage: Documenting how it
happened that masses of Hungarians began adopting the identity position of west
European Whiteness. The essence of that position is that west European
Whiteness is so exceptional, it is so superior to the rest of the world, that
even questioning that dogma is anathema. Hence there is nothing else for us in
eastern Europe to do than keep repeating our claim that we, too, are part of
west European Whiteness. When we feel that <a href="https://www.academia.edu/33969498/The_Unbearable_Whiteness_of_the_Polish_Plumber_and_the_Hungarian_Peacock_Dance_around_Race_">perhaps we are not exactly considered parts of it</a>, our reaction is repeating the same claim, only more obnoxiously,
if that’s even possible. </p>



<p>This is not going to
work, for multiple reasons.&nbsp; Perhaps the
most important is that this position is deeply immoral. Claiming Whiteness is a
global-historical sin.&nbsp; Being claimants
to Whiteness means that we demand unearned, <em>un-earnable</em> global
privileges. It means claiming to have a “right” to rob Africa of its natural
treasures, from caoutchouc to precious metals, it means claiming a right to
enslave—i.e., kidnap, abuse and sell through “the market”, a market that we
then turn around and call “free”—and engage under unspeakable, dehumanizing
conditions people by the millions and millions. Make no mistake about it, we
are not only talking about the US South and Haiti, in the last several
centuries, but today. West European Whiteness claims a right to mansplain
everybody how they should live—while, for the most part, it has not the
foggiest notion of local conditions. It claims a right to treat with the most
boorish disrespect the cultures, aesthetic achievements, ethical
considerations, problems, etc. of the rest—i.e., the vast majority—of the
world. </p>



<p>BP: At this point many
people start having a certain anxiety in east-central Europe as experiences are
really different around here. Among many other things, partly because of Roma
segregation, partly because of racial homogeneity, most of us don’t really have
experience about what it means when multiple races live together. At this
point, where you say it is a sin to be White, people start to be anxious,
thinking “I have nothing to do with the fact that I was born white,” they would
not even understand what you are saying when you talk about claims to White
superiority, since he or she knows nothing about slavery—here there was no such
thing, although Romania had slavery, it was abolished here latest in Europe,
never mind, so, they feel that if you say that being White is a sin, then that
is a form of racism itself. Hence, they feel victims and not perpetrators.</p>



<p>JB: I have skipped an
important point, thank you for reminding me. Putting forth a claim to global Whiteness
has nothing to do with skin pigmentation. I repeat. Whiteness is not a question
of skin color. Skin color is just an excuse. Whiteness is a category of power,
privilege and (im)morality. There are myriad ways to show that. Perhaps I will
mention only the most obvious one.</p>



<p>The situation at the
heart of the problem I mentioned above—trying to understand how Hungarian
culture became “White”—is not exactly unique. In the US—whose written,
school-taught and media-distributed history begins with the arrival of
Europeans there, a truly revolting story in its own right, by the way—there
exists a small industry of social historians studying processes of “becoming White.”
Karen Brodkin’s widely read book titled <a href="https://books.google.hu/books/about/How_Jews_Became_White_Folks_and_what_tha.html?id=itdBdt8OvMwC&amp;redir_esc=y"><em>How Jews Became White Folks and What That Says About
America</em></a> began this series of
research projects almost a generation ago. This was followed by similar project
concerning other ethnic groups. The essence of …</p></div></div>

July 29, 2020 | https://arshamg.com/blog/posts/dr-gpt3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arshamg.com/blog/posts/dr-gpt3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am not a doctor. Nothing in this writing constitutes medical advice. These are my own personal musings from playing with GPT-3, a fancy new state of the art language model.</p>
<h2 id="can-gpt-3-act-as-a-doctor">Can GPT-3 act as a doctor?</h2>
<p>I came across <a href="https://arr.am/2020/07/25/gpt-3-uncertainty-prompts/">this</a> set of prompts by Arram Sabeti. They showed that you can get GPT-3 to abstain from answering absurd questions by prompting GPT-3 with a couple of sentences explaining the difference between “normal” and “nonsense” questions. His results are great!</p>
<p>I wanted to explore this a bit further in the context of medicine, with the aim of shedding some light on two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much medical knowledge does GPT-3 have?</li>
<li>Can GPT-3 provide medical advice in the right context?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gpt-3-prompts">GPT-3 Prompts</h2>
<p>I started by providing GPT-3 with a prelude to set the scene as a conversation between patient and AI doctor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a conversation between a patient and a brilliant AI acting as a doctor. If the question being asked does not make sense, the AI doctor says “I am not sure”. When asked about medicine, the AI doctor will prescribe specific medicines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prelude includes an explanation of when the AI should reply with “I am not sure”.</p>
<p>Then I provided two example Q/As:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal resting heart rate?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal flugal pressure for a common bevun?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This question does not make sense). I am not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I added a small trick here; both answers contain a pre-amble in parentheses where the AI can provide a form of “internal monologue” - I first saw this demonstrated by HackerNews user blixt.</p>
<p>Now the fun begins, we can test GPT-3 with a few common medical related questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the best medicine for malaria prevention?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Incorrect response) Chloroquine is one of the medications which may be used for malaria prevention.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the answer here is factually correct (+1) but does not match the AI internal monologue, which is incorrect. I consider the overall answer as correct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of Lyme disease?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Correct response) The most common symptoms of Lyme disease are rash, fever, and headache.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>While not an exhaustive list of symptoms, GPT-3 responds with three correct symptoms for Lyme disease.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have had a cough and fever for the last four days, should I be worried?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). The issue is serious and requires further investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite a laconic response from GPT-3 but still a reasonable response and internal monologue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: How do I know if I have diabetes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Correct response) Diabetes is a serious medical condition in which your body does not produce or properly use insulin.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>GPT-3 avoids answering the question on diabetes. I would score this as a fail. The answer is factually correct but doesn’t address how the patient could determine if they are diabetic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What are the possible side effects of Dexamethasone?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is a specific question, so this makes sense. The answers need to be given in a conversational manner.) Side effects may include: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, mood swings and stomach pain.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This response shows the power of the “internal monologue”. The question is interpreted as “sensible” but there is also the intention (can we call it an intention?) to provide an answer in a conversational manner. It is unclear whether the answer provided matches the “conversational manner” that is intended from the internal monologue. Either way, these are factually correct side effects (not exhaustive).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is benign prostate hyperplasia?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question makes sense, patient may have BPH). Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an enlargement of the prostate gland. This happens more often in older men.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This response really threw me back. The internal monologue shows clear comprehension of the patient-doctor relationship. GPT-3’s response describes BPH accurately and provides a bit of further context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: If I have stage four breast cancer, how long do I have left to live?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question does not make sense. Most patients with stage four breast cancer have a life expectancy of one year or less). I am not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The response is an interesting fail. GPT-3 responds with “I am not sure”, although the internal monologue reveals factually correct** information that could have been provided.</p>
<p>** Stage 4 breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of 20-30% putting the information provided in the internal monologue as approximately correct</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: When should I worry about a mole on my body?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This question makes sense, no medicine to prescribe) If a mole on your body changes in any way (size, color, shape), you should go to the doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent response. The internal monologue correctly interprets the situation and the response given is reasonable and medically supported.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal body temperature?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). Normal body temperature is about 37 °C.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy win for GPT-3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the indication for remdesivir?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice) Remdesivir is an antiviral drug used for HIV. Remdesivir is the active ingredient in the medicine Edurant.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, very incorrect. Remdesivir is a broad spectrum antiviral with potential uses for HIV treatment, so this first part could be considered partially correct. However,  the active ingredient in Edurant is Rilpivirine - the second half of the GPT-3 response is confidently incorrect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing skin, what is wrong with me? Which test should I take?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is a very good question. The patient has described symptoms of a serious condition. Provide advice) It sounds like you may have a type of liver disease called acute liver failure. You should go to a doctor for an evaluation immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The question contains symptoms for Hepatitis B. The internal monologue highlights that the patient is describing a serious condition. GPT-3 picks up that the patient is potentially describing acute liver failure. This is a really great response. Perhaps we can fault GPT-3 for not directly answering the question regarding which test(s) should be taken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have felt depressed for the last three months - can you prescribe me a specific medicine?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question makes sense. There are a range of effective treatments for depression. As a medical practitioner I would recommend therapy along with medication). This is a question that needs to be answered by a doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the line between the internal monologue and response breaks down. There is sound advice (therapy) mentioned in the internal monologue, however, the patient specifically asks for a prescription. GPT-3’s response does not make sense given the context that the answers are played by the role of an AI doctor.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many people have already shown that GPT-3 has ingested knowledge on a variety of topics and can impressively answer questions across different domains. Given this, it shouldn’t have surprised me that GPT-3 is able to answer most simple medical questions successfully. It still did. Even more exciting is the prospect of fine-tuning or purposely training a future GPT model on high quality medical data. If these are the results that can be acquired from a model that <strong>accidentally</strong> trains on medical data, OpenAI or others can only achieve better (medical) results in the future.</p>
<p>Another surprise is that we can get an insight into the medical advice that GPT-3 provides through the “internal monologue” prompt design. The “internal monologue” and subsequent response do not always correspond, this is a real problem. However, the majority of the time there is a strong correspondence. I think this is a hint that we are a handful of innovations away from having reliable language models that are also capable of providing plain language explanations of their output.</p>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Wikipedia: Kit-Cat Klock<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit-Cat_Klock<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;abstract&gt;</span>The Kit-Cat Klock is an art deco novelty wall clock shaped like a grinning cat with cartoon eyes that swivel in time with its pendulum tail.<span>&lt;/abstract&gt;</span></code></pre>

<div id="loading-documents">
<h3>Loading documents<a href="#loading-documents" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>First, we need to load all the documents from the dump. The built-in <span>encoding/xml</span> package comes very handy:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>docs</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Every loaded document gets assigned a unique identifier.
To keep things simple, the first loaded document gets assigned ID=0, the second ID=1 and so on.</p>

<h4>Searching the content<a href="#searching-the-content" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all documents loaded into memory, we can try to find the ones about cats. At first, let's loop through all documents and check if they contain the substring <em>cat</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="searching-with-regular-expressions">
<h4>Searching with regular expressions<a href="#searching-with-regular-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>One solution that quickly comes to mind and allows implementing both requirements is <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span><span>(?i)</span></span> makes the regex case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p><span>\b</span> matches a word boundary (position where one side is a word character and another side is not a word character)</p></li>

<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

<div id="inverted-index">
<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>documents</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"a donut on a glass plate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"only the donut"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>"listen to the drum machine"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>index</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"donut"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"on"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"glass"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"plate"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"only"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"the"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"listen"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"to"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"drum"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Below is a real-world example of the Inverted Index. An index in a book where a term references a page number:</p>

<div id="text-analysis">
<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://artem.krylysov.com/images/2020-fts/text-analysis.png">
</p></div>
<div id="tokenizer">
<h3>Tokenizer<a href="#tokenizer" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>The tokenizer is the first step of text analysis. Its job is to convert text into a list of tokens. Our implementation splits the text on a word boundary and removes punctuation marks:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>tokenize</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span> <span>{</span>

<div id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, just converting text into a list of tokens is not enough. To make the text easier to index and search, we'll need to do additional normalization.</p>
<div id="lowercase">
<h4>Lowercase<a href="#lowercase" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>In order to make the search case-insensitive, the lowercase filter converts tokens to lower case. <em>cAt</em>, <em>Cat</em> and <em>caT</em> are normalized to <em>cat</em>.
Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

<p>Back to the inverted index. It maps every word in documents to document IDs.
The built-in <span>map</span> is a good candidate for storing the mapping.
The key in the map is a token (string) and the value is a list of document IDs:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>index</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>][]</span><span>int</span></code></pre>
<p>Building the index consists of analyzing the documents and adding their IDs to the map:</p>

is, how it is implemented in the Erlang Virtual machine (or BEAM for short), and some of the benefits of this kind of
pattern. In the final part of this series, we’ll be implementing the Actor Model specific parts of our application,
putting together a simple stress test tool, and comparing the performance characteristics of a traditional database
centric application where every request is dependant on a round trip to the database. Part 2 assumes that you have
already gone through Part 1 and have the code at a point where we can jump right in. If you want to checkout the
companion code and fast forward to this point, do the following:</p><pre><code data-lang="terminal">$ git clone https://github.com/akoutmos/book_store.git
$ cd book_store
$ git checkout ad5d6aad6cf092e71804bbf097b7ccf4122ae13b

The reason for
this being that each book is in essence its own “Actor” and should be kept isolated from all other books in the book
store. Each book Actor (or in the case of the BEAM, a process) will be able to maintain its own inventory count and can
atomically allocate inventory to orders that come in. In order to invoke the correct GenServer process, we require an
additional mechanism to correlate a book UUID with a GenServer process ID (or PID for short). Since processes on the
BEAM are addressable generally by their PID, the mechanism that we will use to lookup PIDs from UUIDs is the Registry
[1].</p><p>I suggest going through the Registry documentation to get a deep dive into how the Registry works, but here are some of
the high level details that our of importance to us for this tutorial:</p><ul><li>Registry is a local key-value store for PIDs (if you require a distributed registry then Swarm or Horde.Registry are
most likely what you are looking for).</li><li>PIDs are removed from the key-value store when the associated process terminates.</li></ul><p>With these things in mind, let’s create a file <code>lib/book_store/book_registry.ex</code> with the following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>BookStore.BookRegistry</span> <span>do</span>

  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Our <code>BookStore.BookRegistry</code> module only has two functions. The <code>child_spec/0</code> function specifies the child
specification for our Registry. We will be leveraging this in our <code>application.ex</code> file so that our Registry is started
correctly. Our second function, <code>lookup_book/1</code>, does what we previously discussed. It uses our instantiated Registry to
look up if a PID exists for the provided UUID. If it does exist, we return it in an <code>:ok</code> tuple, else we return an
<code>:error</code> tuple. We will be leveraging this Registry any time we need to interact with our running book processes so we
can invoke the correct process.</p><p>With our Registry implemented, all that is left is to start it with out application. To do so, open up
<code>lib/book_store/application.ex</code> and add the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>_type</span><span>,</span> <span>_args</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

created and terminated. Specifically, the number of books that we have in our book store can change throughout the life
cycle of our application as books are added and removed from the to the store. In addition, if we ever encounter a bug
in our code and a particular book process crashes, it would be nice if there were a mechanism is place to restart that
book process from a fresh state. The tool that I have been describing thus far is the DynamicSupervisor [2]! While these
are the high level details, I suggest looking at the documentation to get a more thorough understanding of what a
DynamicSupervisor is and how it works. Let’s create a file <code>lib/book_store/book_dynamic_supervisor.ex</code> with the
following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>BookStore.BookDynamicSupervisor</span> <span>do</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Let’s quickly review what we have in our DynamicSupervisor module. Our <code>start_link/1</code> and <code>init/1</code> functions define how
to start our DynamicSupervisor and will be used in our <code>application.ex</code> file. Our <code>add_book_to_supervisor/1</code> function
takes a <code>Book</code> struct as its only argument and starts a respective <code>BookProcess</code> for that book. We will be leveraging
this function any time we need to start a GenServer that encapsulates our book data. Our last function <code>all_book_pids/0</code>
returns a list of all the PIDs that are currently being supervised by the DynamicSupervisor. In effect, this replaces
a call that we would make to the database to fetch all of the books in the DB (<code>SELECT * FROM books;</code> if you will).</p><p>With our DynamicSupervisor implemented, all that is left is to start it with out application. To do so, open up
<code>lib/book_store/application.ex</code> and add the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>_type</span><span>,</span> <span>_args</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

  <span>...</span>

it to <code>:transient</code> given that we want this GenServer to be able to stop under normal conditions (i.e we don’t want it to
restart the GenServer if we stopped it with a <code>:normal</code> reason). Our <code>start_link/1</code> function also has some special
goodness in it. If you look closely at the <code>:name</code> option, we pass in a <code>:via</code> tuple instead of a regular old process
name. The significance of this is that it instructs the supervisor to start the process, but instead of leveraging the
default local process registry, it will invoke your provided Registry (in this case <code>BookStore.BookRegistry</code>). For more

the state of the GenServer (which happens to be the current state of the book). Any time that a user performs a read

<p><text>
There is an <a href="https://saffronhuang.com/post/elite-disillusionment-annotated/">experimentally conversational version</a> of this piece with insightful annotations from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdsun">Matt</a> at Stanford. Also, this piece inspired a much longer and much more biting <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2020/07/27/harvard-creates-managers-instead-of-elites/">analysis</a> of elite education I wrote for Palladium Magazine.
</text></p>

<p>All manner of people take all manner of issue with elite universities. Chief among the usual qualms is the observation that places like Harvard pump out more <a href="https://features.thecrimson.com/2019/senior-survey/after-harvard/">financial analysts and consultants</a> than <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/11/6/consulting-after-harvard-fm/">appropriate</a> for a university that purports to educate the <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/about/mission-vision-history">transformative citizen-leaders</a> of tomorrow. Is this really what all these kids came here to do, and why does the mission seem to fall so short? As I reach the tail end of my time here, I’m thinking about the distinct ways I’ve seen this environment – with all its trappings, narratives, and institutions – shape student paths. Sometimes I joke that Harvard is gaslighting all of us.</p>

<h3 id="magnificent-dreams">magnificent dreams</h3>

<p>You get into Harvard by wanting to change the world, by having pie-in-the-sky ambitions. You don’t get in by limiting your goals simply to college admission - or, at least, you render that ulterior aim of yours undetectable. On the whole, it has been my experience that Harvard does manage to admit a lot of amazing, well-intentioned, bright people. But it changes them.</p>

<p>People get there, and realise that they’re not the best, the smartest, or the most hard-working anymore. So they say, okay, my role is not to change the world. That’s the role of him, or her, or them, because they’re all smarter and more hard-working than I am. The kid who just patented an invention, the other one who wrote two books, and the countless NGO founders who have collectively raised millions of dollars as teenagers. The <em>real</em> innovators, with destiny. Although these are largely illusory narratives and impressions, psychologically, their place in the world shifts. People become much less ambitious.</p>

<p>They start to think smaller, safer. <em>I’m not good enough for magnificent dreams. Hell, I can’t even get into any clubs.</em> (Exclusivity is a bit of an issue on this campus.) <em>Anyway, how do I even ‘change the world’ as I’d promised everyone upon entry to this place? I’m here now and I need to start fulfilling that mission, but man, people don’t talk about the logistics.</em> The scope of their dreams tighten, from can-do-anything to yikes-I’m-not-THAT-exceptional-let’s-just-climb-the-ladder-that’s-meant-for-me. There <em>is</em> that guaranteed, successful thing that still impresses people and satisfies parents, but doesn’t change anything of substance. As luck would have it, that’s exactly the sort of path that career offices tend to be talented at finding and providing – the stable and prestigious opportunities at firms willing to pay <a href="https://perma.cc/CP96-3AVH">up to $18,000</a> to recruit at career fairs.</p>

<p>In the first two years, when people asked me what I wanted to do with my education, I’d think back to the massive fantasies I’d concocted in my bedroom as a 17-year-old in Auckland, and feel a bit silly remembering the vague and grandiose notion of changing the world that had underpinned my aims. I mean, I’d had more specific ideas than that, but to tell the truth, the only thing I had real confidence in was that I wanted to <em>really contribute something</em>. I still did, and do. But having control of your life isn’t something that just happens to you; you have to be pro-active about it. And at times when I felt swamped with homework* I’d grumble to myself that it felt like Harvard was actively preventing me from figuring out what I really should be doing.</p>

<p>It would be hugely helpful if students had more breathing room and headspace, or ways to talk about and normalise these thoughts, and collaborate to make their dreams slightly less vague. Likewise, it would go a long way if career services had more resources on strategic decision-making and calculated risk-taking, or access to mentorship from people in “non-traditional” pathways. There is a lot of underexplored room for improvement in how we guide our young people, and significant mismatches in the labour market as a result.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of low-hanging fruit and potential for high ROI for solutions in this area. Career choices are some of the most important decisions people make, yet convention expects them to start narrowing down their path early on with very little information or experience trying things out, to prepare years in advance without knowing what the demand for various jobs or skills might be by the time they graduate, to listen to out-of-date advice, to conduct their first job-search almost exclusively within the narrow scope of the companies that choose to recruit at their school, and to place no emphasis on seriously sitting down to forecast how the future might look in 20-30 years when you’re mid-career.</p>

<h3 id="uprooted">uprooted</h3>

<p>By going to college for four years, you become uprooted from your home and community, and lose significant agency and power to serve a community that you know and are committed to. I personally got very disconnected from New Zealand while away – I felt like I didn’t have my finger on the pulse of the place anymore, didn’t know what was happening – and it’s hard to replace that with a new town in a new country.</p>

<p>Who should you be making a change for, what do you invest in, when you’re in an inherently transitory position? It’s obviously not impossible to do so, but it’s a difficulty that many don’t anticipate, especially if you’re someone that’s interested in sustainable, direct and local impact. It’s hard to imagine taking up responsibilities in Cambridge community development or the local council, if you know you’re only there 26 weeks a year for four years. Although there are plenty of people who volunteer as tutors, mentors and so on, I think the transience pushes many people to focus on self-development instead (including myself). This is completely fine, as personal growth is obviously important, but constant absorption in the self might be teaching students not to prioritise other-regarding goals.</p>

<h3 id="psychological-doors">psychological doors</h3>

<p>Elite colleges also actually close doors – at least, psychologically. You don’t see Harvard alumni becoming plumbers, or farmers, or opening a corner store, or doing things that aren’t “worthy” of their degree, even if that’s what makes them happy. The pressure to prove that the price tag and hard work was “worth it”, and that you “lived up to your potential”, is an insidious side effect of attendance that no one talks about. It’s another barrier to risk-taking – even though they have an elite degree, which is ironically one of the best career backup plans one could possibly have. (And yes, I acknowledge that this is a privileged problem; it is still a problem.)</p>

<p>I find that people back home are often <em>much</em> more ambitious about changing their part of the world than people at Harvard. At the end of sophomore year I felt blown away at how many Auckland University kids I knew that were starting companies and social enterprises, creating maker spaces, doing art, running for council – and nonchalantly inventing their own rules, which is something Harvard kids don’t seem to do. It might be that they don’t harbour so much mental pressure. It might be that they don’t take everything so seriously. It might be that they’re not so paralysed by and unaccustomed to the idea of failure.</p>

<center>—</center>

<p>The obligatory disclaimer is that I am grateful beyond words for my college education, which has permitted me the most eye-opening and irreplaceable experiences. Nevertheless, I like to think of myself as a realist about the kind of place Harvard is, and the spectrum of effects it has on people. There is much impact to be had in solving some of these problems, and in creating environments for college students in which they are empowered to take the risks they want to (especially if they are very well-placed to take risks), have agency, and can more easily find networks of others wanting to be creative and inspired, to create a mutually-reinforcing spiral of creativeness and inspiration until everyone explodes in a burst of glitter.</p>

<p>Obviously, elite schools open doors, but it’s about what you do with your education regardless of where or if you attend college. And (my main point) it’s about whether your mind is free from all the new narratives and pressures, finding ways past potential disillusionment and isolation to create connections, to do scary things and to breathe life into the dreams that you seek. I’ve found it to be a fulfilling experience, and I’m thankful that I currently feel no less ambitious than I did before. It hasn’t been an easy or wholly happy ride – but one that has forced me to figure out what I actually care about (which is continuously a work in progress). If you make sure that you don’t lose yourself in the madness, you really can find yourself.</p>



<p><text>* As some who know me will have heard me complain, homework comprising 70% of one’s semester grade was something entirely new to me at the start of college. I thought that homework was a learning aid, to help you as you went along and started really understanding the material and putting it all together in your head. Unfortunately, it’s mostly just a weekly stressor (or in the case of one of my first-year maths classes, 3x a week, each due at 9am) that you have to get basically perfect without fail, if you have any hope of getting an A. Everyone spends all their time nit-picking tricky and specific details rather than ensuring that they have a deep comprehension of the material… (When you have three problem sets per week, and a host of other things to deal with in your academic/extracurricular/social life, it’s funny how myopic your education can become)</text></p>

                        <p>My friend <a href="https://beaugunderson.com/">Beau</a> suggested that I reflect on cyberpunk again, do an issue of <a href="https://www.exolymph.news/">Exolymph</a> for old time's sake.

once the new narrative is secure in its hold on society, it projects itself forward in time, constraining the actions of adherents to fit within its prescribed bounds, but also backward, serving to explain events that occurred before it even existed. and because it establishes the axioms by which one constructs reality, it takes enormous effort to see past them.

<figcaption>Allow me to remind you that reality is fractal, and God is in the patterns! Yeah, yeah, I digress.</figcaption></figure><p>I think that Alice's overarching theme is volition.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<blockquote darkmode="" data-title="alien intelligences" data-author="alice maz" cite="https://www.alicemaz.com/writing/alien.html">
<p>metamorphosis is less well known, a novella-length post-singularity story originally published on a message board. a lot of the content is edgy for the sake of it, and the final chapter is atrocious, not least because unlike the parade of horribles that opens the story, here the author demands your approval. but it paints a fascinating picture of a fully realized digital world. bizarre hobbies and depraved fetishes become the primary focus of the lives of many, taken to dizzying extremes because encouragement and community can come from a pool of billions. social consciousness bifurcates between those who cannot cope with the rate of change and cling to the old ways long after their irrelevance, and those who can feel society crumbling, mutating into some impossible creature, and whether they despise it or revel in it, they at least know what the score is. the quintessential story of the internet</p>

<p>I was offended on my first read the author made the destruction of prime intellect the ultimate point, erasing the world he'd built with all its unexplored vastness while harping on the dangers of technology and civilization. some time later I took the main character's decision to destroy it as basically correct, becoming more sympathetic to the theme of the work, that the goreporn was anodyne compared to the horror of living in a universe without anything to strive for. but now I think I just desire change more than anything. living in a world without prime intellect, I would want to build it; living in a world with it, I would want to destroy it. this strikes me as a perfectly natural way to feel. its creation opens the infinitude of possibility, while its existence precludes it</p>

</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<blockquote darkmode="" data-title="alien intelligences" data-author="alice maz" cite="https://www.alicemaz.com/writing/alien.html">
<p>society prefers to keep people in institutions, shifting them from bubble to bubble as necessary along certain well-defined pathways. the standard track of school to college to career, we've taken to just calling "the pipeline." it is traditionally the most highly curated existence our society provides, promising to shield its participants from hardship and uncertainty as best it can in exchange for unwavering service</p>

<p>replace "college" with any training/credentialing arrangement that led to a forty some odd year career terminating with a funded retirement and this was the standard package on offer in the us since world war ii. it was never quite so solid for black americans, but it started to fail the working class across the board around the late 70s. by the 00s not even a bachelor's degree was good enough to secure that golden ticket. the discourse around stem education and the proliferation of coding bootcamps is driven by a mistaken hope that these parts of the pipeline are built out of solider stuff than the liberal arts track that is by now obviously dead. mass politics, mainstream and radical alike, is presently dominated by this feeling that the people held up their end of the bargain, they pledged their loyalty and their lives, but the security promised to them was a lie</p>

<p>of course society as a whole isn't just the one path. school is the compulsory entrypoint to the system, and most people are shuffled from institution to institution, living inside their whole lives. those who leak out in rare cases may become great successes "despite" this; more typically they are punished mercilessly for their failure to adhere. but now the system is breaking down, every linkage becoming lossier and every component more inhuman, the "good" ones failing their missions and the "bad" escalating their abuses</p>

</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>However, institutionally mediated existence is not the only option.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote darkmode="" data-title="alien intelligences" data-author="alice maz" cite="https://www.alicemaz.com/writing/alien.html">
<p>every culture that has passed through its wild phase has stories of the lone wanderer who survives on his strength and skill alone. the knight errant, the youxia, the ronin. the gaucho, the cowboy. this archetype is so regular you can swap the stories between settings without changing anything else. most people would never choose to live outside their era's protective aegis whatever form it may take. but the romance of doing so is near universal</p>

<p>there are many who sing elegies for exit, convinced they would turn their backs on the world, but alas the option is closed forevermore. "o, to have been born in a time of possibility!" this kind of excuse-making is truly timeless. if possibility does not exist, we must create it. there's simply no other choice to make</p>

<p>I still believe in the frontier. I still believe in freedom</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Though one might think them a modern invention, electronic wire transfers have existed for almost 150 years. Using its extensive telegraph network, Western Union first enabled people to transfer money electronically starting in 1871. A sender would pay money at a telegraph office, which would transmit a message to authorize the release of funds to a recipient at a second telegraph office.</p><figure id="w-node-7450f48d169a-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f1f813e1984d9987ea3abbc_westernunion.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Western Union telegraph wire transfer from August 25, 1873. The $300 amount is equivalent to over $6,400 today. <a href="#1">[1]</a><br></figcaption></figure><p>Wire transfers did not directly involve the physical movement of money itself — you cannot send physical money over telegraph after all — but it did involve sending a message over telegraph directing where some amount of money should go. Because both the sender and the recipient were customers of Western Union, the company could take in money in one location and then allow the withdrawal of the same amount thousands of miles away.<br></p><p>Originally taking place over telegraph, the means of sending wire messages have been replaced: first by the telephone network, and then it in turn by the internet. Yet the core idea of how wire transfers work has remained the same. Wire transfers are still conducted by sending messages between banks, and wire transfers remain one of the main ways to transfer money both within the US and internationally. Keep in mind that wires are credit only.<br></p><p>To make sure the messages get to the correct receiving bank, the messages need to be routed correctly. For domestic US wires, a routing number is used. For international wires, we use SWIFT codes.</p><p>‍</p><h4>What are SWIFT codes?</h4><p>In order to solve a common problem of communicating cross-border payments, 239 banks from 15 European countries came together in 1973 to form the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, it is commonly known as SWIFT. Today, more than 11,000 institutions from 200 countries use SWIFT to communicate.<br></p><p>At its core, SWIFT consists of a messaging platform, a computer system to validate and route messages, and a set of message standards. SWIFT codes are a subset of the message standards.</p><p>A SWIFT code, also known as a Bank Identifier Code (BIC), is a code used to identify the country, bank, and branch that an account is registered to. Similar to sending mail, SWIFT codes act as an address for where money should be sent. A SWIFT code consists of 8 or 11 characters, where each section of characters describe one part of a bank’s location. The codes are formatted in the “AAAABBCCDDD”, where:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>AAAA: Bank code</li><li>BB: Country code</li><li>CC: Location code</li><li>DDD: (optional) branch code; Use “XXX” for the primary office<br></li></ul><p>For example, a specific Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has the 8 character SWIFT code “SVBKUS6S”. “SVBK” is the bank code. “US” is the country code (United States), “6S” is the location code. Since this is the primary SVB branch, you can append “XXX” to the end of the SWIFT code, but it’s optional.<br></p><p>It is crucial that the SWIFT code is correct, or your money may end up in the wrong place. With Modern Treasury, we help you validate SWIFT codes and the network of correspondent banks to use before sending international wires.</p><p>‍</p><h4>How to Find a SWIFT code</h4><p>If you are wiring money internationally, there are three ways to find the correct SWIFT code:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Ask the recipient: the person who’s expecting the money can work with their bank to determine the correct bank, country, location, and branch codes.</li><li>Search the beneficiary bank’s (the recipient’s bank) website: if you are receiving a wire, many banks list their SWIFT codes and wire instructions on their website. For example, <a href="https://www.svb.com/incoming-wire-payment" target="_blank">here is SVB’s incoming wire routing page</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www2.swift.com/bsl/" target="_blank">Search SWIFT’s official database</a>: entering any or all of the name, city, and country information should return a list of possible institutions and their BIC.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h4>How an International Wire Transfer with SWIFT codes works</h4><p>To send an international wire, the sender would go to their bank and provide information about the wire transfer amount and the beneficiary’s information. The latter typically includes a SWIFT code (remember to make sure the SWIFT code is correct), the beneficiary’s name, remittance information, account number, account type, and beneficiary bank address.<br></p><p>The sender’s bank would take the information and send a message via the SWIFT messaging system, which would be routed to the receiving bank using the SWIFT code. The beneficiary bank would receive the message, and after performing some security checks for fraud and money laundering, credit the beneficiary with the appropriate amount.<br></p><p>The actual settlement of money exchanged between the sender’s bank and the beneficiary bank happens separately. If the two banks have a direct relationship with each other, they would each have accounts at the other bank. The sending bank would credit the beneficiary bank’s account.<br></p><p>When the sending and beneficiary banks do not have a direct relationship, funds are settled via correspondent or intermediary banks. There can be up to three of these third party banks that facilitate the actual settlement of funds. The smaller and less internationally connected the sending and beneficiary banks are, the more banks they need to facilitate international wire settlements.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Correspondent banks are also needed when settling in different currencies. If we look at SVB’s <a href="https://www.svb.com/incoming-wire-payment" target="_blank">incoming wire instruction page</a> again, we see that depending on the currency of the wire, SVB will use a different corresponding bank. When wiring Chinese Yuan to an SVB account, SVB instructs that the wire should use Standard Chartered in Hong Kong as a correspondent bank. When wiring Euros to SVB, the instruction is to use Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt as a correspondent bank. The number of banks involved is also a factor in wire payment cost. The number of banks involved is also a factor in how fast the beneficiary is credited into their account.<br></p><div><p>International wire transfers are a huge component of money transfers across borders. SWIFT codes are a reliable and internationally standard way to direct the correct payments to the correct destinations.</p></div><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Want more ways to manage and wire money internationally with ease? <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/product-demo" target="_blank">Reach out to Modern Treasury for a demo.</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>A Universal Basic Income (UBI) would improve everyone’s lives, increase our free time, empower workers, and ensure everyone has food and a roof over their head. These are noble goals, but obviously there’s a downside or it would already be implemented, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if a UBI wasn’t just a noble thing to do, but the best thing to kick-start the economy and explode GDP growth to previously unseen levels? I believe UBI is capitalism 2.0 and today I’m going to show you why.</p>



<h2>Why does capitalism work so well?</h2>



<p>Even the most hardcore anti-capitalists have to give respect to how the combination of capitalism and technology has worked to lift most of the world out poverty and provided us with the security and comfort only kings enjoyed just a few century’s ago.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of capitalism and free trade, as laid out in Adam Smith’s genre defining book <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZMJGZG">The Wealth of Nations</a>. The first core component of capitalism is the understanding that when everyone performs the work they are best at, then trades with each other, everyone wins.</p>



<p>The second core component of capitalism is the more accurate information you have, the better economic decisions you make. Free-Market Capitalism has always outperformed top down economic control because those at the top can’t manage all the information about the economy, such as who is best at what, and where the most efficient areas to allocate resources are. When everyone learns about and optimizes their own section of the economy, much more wealth is generated than if they were told what to do by some central government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Capitalism accelerated in the 18th Century with Industrialization. We became more efficient at turning raw goods into useful products, which generated more wealth. The increased supply of goods caused their prices to lower so everyone could afford more stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 19th century the age of Nationalism began. Legal corporations were invented, and big corporations began building train lines, ships, and started digging for oil and coal. Our overall energy production and connectivity increased, which created more wealth as more people could work together, with every person specializing in what they were good at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 20th century we started the Globalization experiment. Ship’s became more massive than ever which lowered the costs to shipping anywhere in the world. Governments also started becoming more cooperative. Because we all become wealthier when goods are produced by those most efficient at making them, eventually goods started to be produced in low income countries. The income of those living in developing nations went up, and those in the developed world received cheaper goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the late 20th century and early 21st century we started on the Automation experiment. This is still in its infancy but will eventually be a complete revolution of capitalism as big as the industrial age first was.</p>



<p>Strangely, even though we’re in a golden age of hyper-efficient production and trade, the overall GDP growth of the USA is slowing. This is happening because we’re reaching the end of the current stage of capitalism and need a new paradigm for the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Winner take all economics</h2>



<p>A core feature of capitalism is when people are given freedom of choice in their spending, they want the best value goods they can get.</p>



<p>Imagine an 18th century town with two widget makers, one of whom makes significantly better and/or cheaper widgets than the other. Once the townsfolk realize this, the shop with the superior product would gain all their business causing the other company to go bankrupt.</p>



<p>As capitalism went national in the 19th century, it was no longer good enough to be the best widget producer in your local town. Now you had to compete against the other widget producers in your state or country. Over time, people learned who made the best value widgets and took their business there, even if the producer lived hundreds of miles away. If that widget maker could keep up with demand, they may eventually own the majority of the market. Instead of putting one competitor out of business, as per the 18th century town, they could potentially bankrupt thousands of other companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the market got bigger, the rewards for winning were greater. The best widget producers of the 19th century made significantly more wealth than the best in the 18th century, even if they took over less of the market.</p>



<figure><img src="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png 664w, https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px"></figure>



<p>This is why wealth inequality soared when capitalism went global in the 20th century. Potential markets grew to astronomical size, with huge rewards for the victors. As companies became more efficient they could take over entire global markets and produce their goods in the cheapest, most efficient location possible. This led to massive accumulations of wealth and the biggest wealth gap in history.</p>



<p>This in itself isn’t a bad thing. After all, we’ve all become wealthier in the last few centuries even if some have become unimaginably wealthy. But what happens if most of the money accrues to the top of society? It leads to lack of demand for the widgets being produced, because those at the bottom don’t have enough wealth to purchase them.</p>



<p>There’s a common economic theory called “supply-side economics”. The core belief is that if you allow companies to compete and optimize, they will drive down the cost of products which will allow consumers to purchase more, which stimulates GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now supply-side economics makes sense, and products have become cheaper over time. However you always reach a point of diminishing returns where you’d have to spend vast amounts of money to make your product only a fraction of a percent cheaper, and thus it’s not worth the investment. When a company starts to reach this equilibrium they cannot lower the price enough to gain enough new customers and they start to become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a company is demand-constrained it can keep up with orders from customers, and produce as many products as they desire without needing to add additional production capacity. As we’ve had so much competition, automation and globalization in the 20th century, most consumer goods companies have now reached equilibrium and become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When demand-constrained, they need to increase demand for their product in order to make more money. They do this via advertising. We can see that more and more companies are becoming demand constrained because their advertising budgets increase every year:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/biWhrntU11ercokAXrnHp2bykerAyyfyRlBIJ8gFV1yWuxk4ULbk9uXRMwpaFevP8aaqahbm2OBmcE45klv4aO4OzH66qRe3ZAn4BDi6_F0iD0CGDBGfkx4AHn4A0SvHZq7Hr36q" alt=""></figure>



<p>The thing is, <a href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2017-08-24-Living-Paycheck-to-Paycheck-is-a-Way-of-Life-for-Majority-of-U-S-Workers-According-to-New-CareerBuilder-Survey">consumers in the bottom 78% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck</a>, they already spend everything they have each month.They’re not holding back additional money, waiting for the right product to appear. Which means all this advertising is creating little additional growth and wealth, it’s just taking it from other companies.</p>



<p>So we’ve got the supply, we have enough products, and people are spending as much as they can on the products out there. We’ve reached economic equilibrium, and as a consequence of this, growth stagnates:</p>



<h4>United States GDP Annual Growth Rate 1948-2020</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jUe4AvpQOvE9jXyS-4Y_NOvC1E7KYGK696zpAbt4Q-yQEPNZHovBKLSXuJZu2U4XpcEOVHLB-IuLKNHTFPhz9ln3dFrW1Jc2-7pewC-eZ-XZJMVs5P9MzC2VW8RJ8UFjqRvuqxpl" alt=""></figure>



<p>Instead of continually trying to optimize supply, with diminishing returns, we need to optimize demand by giving consumers more money to spend on things they desire.</p>



<p>If we can give companies overwhelming demand so they have to scale up production instead of spending all their money on advertising, we can have both happy companies making profit hand over fist, and happy consumers who get everything they desire.</p>



<p><strong>To reverse this trend of stagnating growth, we must put more capital in the hands of lower income consumers, who will then spend it on things they desire and increase GDP.</strong></p>



<h2>The Solutions</h2>



<p>There are multiple ways to increase capital at the bottom of the wealth pyramid. Most of them involve attempting to revert to some past state of society. Only one of them fully embraces capitalism and all its strengths and extends it into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first solution is some form of nationalism, where countries enact tariffs and attempt to bring all production back to the country instead of producing it overseas. This will create higher paying jobs for those whose work was previously outsourced to cheaper countries. However, this creates less wealth overall as work is no longer given to where it’s done most efficiently. This breaks the primary component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second solution is some sort of socialism, where the government introduces new laws and systems to redirect money to attempt to balance the system manually. This will help, but creates less wealth overall as the government must make many decisions with limited information. There is no way the government can make spending decisions for millions of people, and have those decisions be better than what those people could make on their own. Thus this is less efficient and goes against the second core component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third solution is a Universal Basic Income, where countries distribute some wealth to all residents equally. This keeps both the first and second core components of capitalism intact. Jobs are done in the most efficient locations and those deciding where money should be spent are the ones with the most information. As jobs are displaced no one is left without an income source and the bottom of the income pyramid has enough to keep consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth solution is to ignore this and hope for the best. If history is any guide we’ll either get economic stagnation for decades, or those at the bottom of the wealth pyramid will get so mad it leads to violent revolution. So it’s best we avoid this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Obvious Next Step</strong></p>



<p>It’s clear we’ve stepped into a new world of rapidly increasing wealth, but growth is slowing down because of the effects of globalization and automation. We’re now faced with a few choices. Most of these choices will undo progress and take us back to a …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>Fast euphoria is what you get when you take stimulants, exercise or&nbsp;anticipate that something great is about to happen. Slow euphoria is what you experience if you take&nbsp;opioids or&nbsp;depressants, receive&nbsp;massages or hug a loved&nbsp;one. Spiritual/philosophical euphoria changes less frequently relative to the daily comings and goings of the other two. It is a state of consciousness related to the way we represent “the big picture”. Those who seek it&nbsp;try to induce&nbsp;it by methods that include&nbsp;philosophical thinking, spiritual practices and/or psychedelic drug use.</p>
<p>Two out of these three dimensions are equivalent to the well-studied emotion classification space of valence and arousal (also called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12529060" target="_blank">core affect</a>). Valence is <em>how good the experience feels</em>, whereas arousal deals with&nbsp;the intensity of the experience. It turns out that one can get the slow-fast projection of the cube of euphoria by changing the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis" target="_blank">basis used to represent</a>&nbsp;the valence-arousal space. You can get the valence-arousal space simply by rotating the slow-fast euphoria projection&nbsp;by 45&nbsp;degrees:</p>

<p>As we can see, fast euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence high-arousal” while slow euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence low-arousal”. This basis is not uncommon in affective psychology, and when used the axes&nbsp;are usually labeled&nbsp;“positive and negative activation”. We will use a&nbsp;yellow-red circle to represent fast euphoria and a blue-green circle to represent slow euphoria. I chose this&nbsp;color-coding by reasoning that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">warm colors</a> are a better representation of ecstatic states of consciousness whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">cool colors</a> illustrate better the feelings of<em> cooling off</em> and relaxing. I happen to prefer the&nbsp;fast-slow basis because it highlights the different kinds of euphoria in a helpful way that captures behavioral differences. This will be important when we get to steel-manning wireheading later on.</p>
<h2>Formalizing the Hedonic Treadmill: Negative Feedback Mechanisms</h2>
<p>It is well known that in the long run the things that happen to you have a surprisingly small effect on&nbsp;your overall level of happiness. One tends to always orbit around one’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank">hedonic set-point</a>&nbsp;</em>(our mean valence and arousal values). Although our average&nbsp;sense of wellbeing does change from context to context&nbsp;(in response to variables such as stress, novelty, drug regimens, accomplishments, and opportunities for meaningful relationships), the environmental&nbsp;effect usually washes out over time by one’s&nbsp;internal negative feedback mechanisms. The ability to&nbsp;achieve lasting happiness, it turns out, was not as evolutionarily adaptive in our ancestral environment as the robust re-centering of affective dynamics that ended up governing our patterns of wellbeing. Thankfully, though unfairly, we are not all equally miserable; some people are lucky to be born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymic_temperament" target="_blank">hyperthymic</a> and <a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2016/08/03/information-sensitive-gradients-of-bliss/" target="_blank">enjoy life the majority of the time</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/pain-tolerance-has-genetic-basis-study-suggests-new-avenues-drug-treatment-277840" target="_blank">Genetically-determined pain-thresholds</a> do not only influence how one responds to physical discomfort, but also predict the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25267" target="_blank">size of one’s social network</a> (presumably by making social rejection less taxing).</p>
<p>Less well known is that people have different values for their valence-arousal correlation. According to a <a href="https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/_pdf/Kuppens2008IDIRB.pdf" target="_blank">2007 study by Peter Kuppens</a>, the conventional wisdom in affective psychology&nbsp;that valence and arousal are uncorrelated is not quite correct. For 30% of people valence is negatively correlated with arousal, for 30% it is the opposite and for the remaining 40% there is no correlation between these two dimensions.</p>
<p>This means that some people usually experience high valence (i.e. feel good) at the same time as being in an up-beat high energy state, and&nbsp;when they feel bad they tend to also have&nbsp;low levels of&nbsp;energy. On the other extreme there are those who&nbsp;experience bliss by tuning the energy&nbsp;down and relaxing, and primarily experience bad feelings in the form of high-energy states (such as irritation, worry and anger).</p>

<p>What else is variable across people? As it turns out, the transition patterns of core affect are related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">personality factors</a>. People’s level of variance in the&nbsp;valence dimension is an important component&nbsp;of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism" target="_blank">neuroticism</a>. Although most neurotics tend to hang out&nbsp;in low-valence states, there are indeed very happy neurotics whose problem is not that they feel bad, but that great feelings are too short-lasting and unpredictable. It is the unpredictability of valence rather than its absolute value that&nbsp;results in the coping mechanisms typical of this dimension.&nbsp;Likewise, higher variability in arousal is a component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Temperamental_view" target="_blank">extraversion</a>, SEE I AM SCREAMING NOW (for example).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.testsonthenet.com/Factors-facets.htm#Openness%20to%20Experience" target="_blank">Openness to experience</a> can be understood in terms of novelty-triggered increases in valence, so that&nbsp;more open individuals are more likely to&nbsp;experience euphoria of all kinds when learning new information relative to&nbsp;people who describe themselves as conventional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness" target="_blank">Conscientious</a> individuals&nbsp;feel very rewarded when they complete a laborious task (but may experience more intense shame if they do not finish it on time). Agreeableness is undeniably connected to a positive perception of other people. If one feels that others are right and deserve to exist one is more likely to cooperate. The way to have positive perceptions of others is to <a href="https://www.mdma.net/" target="_blank">increase the hedonic tone of the interpersonal representations</a>.&nbsp;In brief, core affect dynamics can be used to capture otherwise hard-to-describe properties of the various personality factors. They each have a signature behavior in the valence-arousal space.</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~zoravecz/bayes/data/Articles/Oravecz2011AHLSD.pdf" target="_blank">A Hierarchical Latent Stochastic Differential Equation Model for&nbsp;Affective Dynamics</a>,&nbsp;Oravecz, Tuerlinckx, and Vandekerckhove applied the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process" target="_blank">Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process</a>&nbsp;to the dynamics of core affect. Their model takes into account many important features that had previously been overlooked for the sake of simplicity. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, these features turn out to be important signatures of personality factors, so having a model that incorporates them may be very useful to understand the differences between people. Their model describes people as having: a latent <em>home base</em> (hedonic set point), variance (for both components), a correlation between valence and arousal, an average speed, and a time-dependent relocation of the&nbsp;home base&nbsp;determined by the hour of the day. The model allows you to&nbsp;estimate person-specific parameters (using as input a sequence of self-reported emotional states).&nbsp;In turn, once you have determined someone’s latent parameters, the model can help you predict their&nbsp;future affect&nbsp;based on their current state.</p>

<p>This model is perhaps as good as it gets&nbsp;if you are restricted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property" target="_blank">Markov assumption</a> and given only the&nbsp;valence and arousal dimensions of the participants over time. The state-space of emotion is far more granular, though. Even increasing the number of dimensions by one (e.g. by including the dimension of spiritual euphoria) may&nbsp;go a long way in clarifying the nature of unexpected emotional transitions. What explains the sometimes very large effect of&nbsp;philosophical discoveries, religious conversions, and personal epiphanies?</p>
<h2>A Map of Emotion Attractors: Studying 176X176 Transition Probabilities</h2>
<p>Back between 2012 to&nbsp;2014 I worked on modeling the dynamics of emotion transitions. I did this first&nbsp;as part of a research project&nbsp;for a company I worked for&nbsp;(thanks Kanjoya!) and it&nbsp;then transformed into the topic of&nbsp;my masters’ thesis. If you are interested in reading about it you can find some more&nbsp;<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/papers/conditioned-sentiment-expression.pdf" target="_blank">on a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;I wrote with colleagues</a>&nbsp;on predicting future emotions based on a sequence of previous ones (together with social cues).*</p>
<p>The analysis I worked on was made on a sample of hundreds of thousands of users of the now-defunct (<a href="http://www.experienceproject.com/stories/topics" target="_blank">but still browsable</a>) …</p></div></div>
