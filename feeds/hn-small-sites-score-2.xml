<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I create an educational product and students occasionally ask for discounts. So-called "educational" discounts are very popular, but I don't give them.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't like them at all, but there is some nuance.</p> <p>Not all educational discounts bother me—primarily it's the discounts limited to students at degree-granting institutions and especially those tied to having a .edu email address.</p> <h2 id="why-might-edu-discounts-be-good"><a href="#why-might-edu-discounts-be-good">#</a> Why might .edu discounts be good?</h2> <p>Many of the arguments for student discounts are similar to those for region-based discounts, which I am a fan of. So let's look at some reasons to give discounts in general.</p> <h3 id="need"><a href="#need">#</a> Need</h3> <p>The idea behind student discounts, at least as it was first explained to me, sounds great. Students are often broke so it's only fair to give them a price break!</p> <p>I totally get that. As a student myself, I worked as a waiter, a calculus tutor, a bar tender and even started a house painting franchise in order not to get buried in debt. I went to a cheap state school, back when it was only about 70% of what it costs now, and I was <em>still</em> broke.</p> <p>I have a great deal of sympathy for anyone trying to pay their way through school in the US now. I have even more sympathy for anyone taking out debts they likely won't repay for many, many years.</p> <h3 id="price-discrimination"><a href="#price-discrimination">#</a> Price discrimination</h3> <p>In economics, <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/microessays/pd/price-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price discrimination</a> refers to the idea of charging some customers more than others in order to maximize revenue.</p> <p>In the extreme form, it would mean charging each customer the absolute maximum price they're willing to pay and completely eliminating <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/188/concepts/definition-of-consumer-surplus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer surplus</a>. This isn't practical or possible in most cases, but less extreme forms are very common.</p> <p>Sometimes customers are segmented by their actions, such as spending time clipping coupons or watching movies during typical work hours. Other times, customers are segmented simply by who they are. Senior discounts or higher prices for foreign tourists are both common examples.</p> <p>A less direct form of price discrimination is to create a slightly different product that would only appeal to customers with more money. In software, we see this often with features revolving around team management, accounting and compliance. This makes it possible to both sell to frugal hobbyist users and to charge large companies very high prices.</p> <h3 id="creating-habits"><a href="#creating-habits">#</a> Creating habits</h3> <p>For most, going to college is a time of major life transitions. Other than marriage, having children or serving in the military there are few times when people change as much.</p> <p>This is <strong>incredibly</strong> appealing to marketers.</p> <p>The opportunity to reach people when they're at a place where they're open to creating so many new habits that will stick with them for years or even decades is worth spending heavily on. One way to do it is through advertising. Another is by giving students a steep discount.</p> <h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">#</a> The problem</h2> <p>In a number of ways that matter to me, educational discounts <em>as they are typically implemented</em> are radically different from region or need-based discounts.</p> <h3 id="who-has-a-edu-email-address"><a href="#who-has-a-edu-email-address">#</a> Who has a .edu email address?</h3> <p>Who has a .edu email address? Generally it's only students, faculty and alumni of accredited US colleges. This roughly translates to "many of the most priviledged people in the world".</p> <p>The vast majority of adults in the US <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;g=0100000US&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;hidePreview=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do not have a 4-year degree</a>. There are probably a billion people in the world who would <em>love</em> to either enter a US college themselves or get their children into one.</p> <p>Competition for those slots is fierce. People spend small fortunes on English language education for a shot. I've seen it first-hand living in Asia for most my adult life.</p> <p>Obviously, not <em>everyone</em> with a .edu email address is or will be wealthy. However in aggregate, their parents are wealthier and they will be wealthier than any country in the world... by a large margin. At a minimum, getting a 4-year degree costs tens of thousands of dollars. Saving a few dollars a month on my <a href="https://alchemist.camp/episodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screencasts</a> is trivial in comparison.</p> <p>In contrast, the average person in Nigeria earns 2,000 USD/year. Even the average programmer isn't making much compared to their counterparts in other countries. Nigerians are also a double digit percentage of my audience! Indians are a large percentage as well.</p> <p>I have a <em>completely</em> different reaction when someone living in poor country asks for a discount than I do when someone spending more per year on tuition than I earned until my late 20s does.</p> <h3 id="who-is-a-student"><a href="#who-is-a-student">#</a> Who is a student?</h3> <p>An even more salient question is, who counts as a student. I've spent a great deal of time as a non-credentialed student at language schools, at a programming school and even completely on my own with a self-designed curriculum.</p> <p>During those times, I wasn't very successful in asking for educational discounts since nearly all are tied to credential-offering schools. I often thought about why and settled on two answers.</p> <ol><li>They probably worry about non-students claiming to be students to get the discount.</li> <li>Their educational discounts weren't really motivated by any sense of altruism or fairness to begin with.</li></ol> <h3 id="hypocrisy"><a href="#hypocrisy">#</a> Hypocrisy</h3> <p>Perhaps the thing that <em>most</em> bothers me about student discounts I see announced is the virtue signalling.</p> <p>If you're offering a discount to get your customers hooked early in their careers or to raise prices for business users, great. But you're not doing a noble thing if you're restricting a discount to people with .edu addresses.</p> <p>What that discount model actually does is exclude all of the students in poorer parts of the world as well as anyone who couldn't stomach going $100k in debt for a credential.</p> <h3 id="what-does-the-discount-subsidize"><a href="#what-does-the-discount-subsidize">#</a> What does the discount subsidize?</h3> <p>As economists love to point out, incentives matter. When you subsidize something, you get more of it. This isn't just true of governments, but it's also true of companies and other groups.</p> <p>That leads ato the question of what educational discounts subsidize. In effect, they subsidize going to very expensive universities. Is this something we want more of?</p> <p>In what's likely a minority opinion, I think too many people pursue formalized schooling for too long. Universities are necessary for some kinds of careers and for some kinds of research. Far more often, the price is just too high. The worst part of this cost isn't dollars either—it's four years of a person's life.</p> <p>Nearly anything universities teach can be learned outside of a university, and usually faster. I've experienced this first hand with mathematics, foreign languages and programming but it's certainly a wider phenomena.</p> <p>According to George Mason economist Bryan Caplan, <a href="https://amzn.to/2YLbmNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only about 10%-20% of the value in schooling is actually education</a>. The other 80%-90% is selection and signalling.</p> <h2 id="what-products-are-exceptions"><a href="#what-products-are-exceptions">#</a> What products are exceptions?</h2> <p>If I were selling very expensive tools for skilled professionals, like Adobe used to, then I'd offer student discounts. Even a person in relatively fortunate circumstances has fewer resources than a typical company.</p> <p>Dropping a few dollars a month doesn't move the needle compared to tuition, but spending thousands of dollars on a photo or video editor sure could.</p> <p>Another factor in Adobe's case was that by being <em>the</em> tool to use in the industry, students needed to learn it. Anyone trying to become a designer pretty much had to find a way, even if that meant "pirating" it. Giving students convenient affordable access to such a tool is also a great way to <em>become</em> a standard tool in the industry.</p> <p>Even Adobe didn't limit their discounts to US students, though. Doing so might have cost them billions.</p> <h2 id="the-bottom-line"><a href="#the-bottom-line">#</a> The bottom line</h2> <p>Having a .edu email address generally means being in the most expensive and desired university system in the world.</p> <br>  <br> <hr></div></div>]]>

						<p><span>Once, small firms centred on inventors were responsible for most of our innovation. Larger firms might buy or exploit these steps forwards, but they did not typically make them. And then for a brief period, this changed: many of the best new products, tools, and ideas came from research labs within large corporations. This brief period also happened to be the era when scientific, technological, and economic productivity sped forward at its fastest ever clip. Yet almost as soon as it arrived, the fruitful period was over and we returned to a situation where small companies and small-business-like teams at universities developed innovations outside of large companies and sold them in a market for ideas. Though we might enjoy the innovation created by small flexible firms, we should not dismiss the contributions made by large corporate labs. The corporate lab may be creeping back, but aggressively prosecuting antitrust against large firms growing organically through in-house research could easily snuff this spark out.</span></p>
<h3>The USA’s first system of innovation</h3>
<p><span>When the USA began to contribute to the progress of technology, in the early 19th century, it was largely practically-minded, not based on deep scientific understanding. Rather, it largely consisted of individual inventors commercialising their own inventions. Whereas nuclear power depended on decades or centuries of progress in physics, many late 19th century innovations were more like the cotton gin, which came together through practical-minded trial and error in the field. By the late 19th century, the system had morphed into one we would find strangely familiar today: inventors invented, venture capitalists invested, and companies commercialised. The system even had </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>patent lawyers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/khan_ip2_working_paper.pdf"><span>non-practising entities</span></a>, <span>which own patents purely </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/BHR870102.pdf"><span>to litigate on their behalf</span></a><span>. There were still startups commercialising an idea and scaling it up themselves, but many inventors found that the division of labour enabled by the market ideas allowed them to </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>focus on what they did best</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Large firms were consumers of ideas created by inventors, and were sceptical of the value of doing in-house science. They believed it was easier to buy new science off the shelf. In 1885 T. D. Lockwood, head of American Bell Telephone Company’s patent department, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I am fully convinced that it has never, is not now, and never will pay commercially, to keep an establishment of professional inventors, or of men whose chief business it is to invent”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Of course, Bell Labs itself later grew to be one of the marquees of commercial labs—in the late 1960s it employed 15,000 people including 1,200 PhDs, who between them made too many important inventions to list, from the transistor and the photovoltaic cell to the first digitally scrambled voice audio (in 1943) and the first complex number calculator (in 1939). Fourteen of its staff went on to win Nobel Prizes and five to win </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"><span>Turing Awards</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The 1920s stock market boom was in large part driven by a huge rise in the value that investors </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.98.4.1370"><span>accorded to intangible capital</span></a><span> and ideas held within companies. A similar thing happened in the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capitalism-Without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039"><span>1990s Dot-com Bubble</span></a><span>. Between 1921 and 1927 the number of scientists and engineers in industrial labs more than doubled. When the stock market crashed and the Great Depression hit it caused a </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d71a/90cfa2d0d0d72f13724d27dd326209431974.pdf"><span>massive and persistent decline</span></a><span> in independent inventing and the startup-like activity around it. But large labs continued to boom, increasing staffing and research spending throughout the lean 1930s, and earning more patents. By 1930, most patents were issued to large firms, rather than independent innovators, and this gap only widened into the 1950s. The industrial lab had become king.</span></p>
<h3>Why labs work well</h3>
<p><span>The question of why the industrial lab works is a microcosm of the question of why the firm works in general. Economist Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in 1991 (and who lived to be 102) bookended the most productive period of his career with two insights about transaction costs. The first, published in 1937 and entitled </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x"><span>“The Nature of the Firm”</span></a><span>, tells us why firms exist. In economics, situations are typically approached from the perspective of competitive behaviour in open markets. Most of the things we buy are from open, competitive markets like these. But when we sell our labour, we are usually bound to a single “buyer”—our employer—for an extended period of time for everything we have to offer. If market competition is so efficient, why do we not set up mini-firms for every instance of cooperative work and receive pay in line with our output? Why do we instead generally sell a promise to do whatever our boss says within limits for certain hours of the day for months or years in advance?</span></p>
<p><span>The other, </span><a href="https://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase-problem.pdf"><span>“The Problem of Social Cost”</span></a><span>, reads like a reflection of the first. Published in 1960, it spawned the so-called Coase Theorem, which holds that so long as transaction costs—the costs of interacting with other individuals or institutions, such as the costs of drawing up and enforcing a contract—are low, people will contract to deal with the problems emerging from positive and negative externalities, like the benefits of a new park to a neighbourhood or the costs of pollution. Where transaction costs are too high, institutions and policies are needed to deal with the externalities instead.</span></p>
<p><span>Coase answers the question of why businesses exist as he answers the question of why people simply don’t contract away all externalities: transaction costs. If there is a cost on both sides every time one person wants to pay another for a task, then some tasks will not be worth paying for, or worth doing at the going rate. Concretely: an employer who does not negotiate contracts for each and every individual work unit can afford to offer higher wages, and an employee who does not do so can afford to accept lower wages. Companies organized in this way thus outcompete pure market organization—in cases where transaction costs are large.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, this general story for why firms exist also explains why large firm R&amp;D labs were so successful. The transaction costs of collaboration are extremely large, and prevent all sorts of potentially-valuable crossovers: not just the financial costs of contracting with others, but the costs of finding people you work well with, of corresponding and collaborating with people far from you, and so on. University lecturers collaborate more with those in their department than in other departments, and more with those in their university or city than elsewhere, despite all the tools and technologies the internet has brought. Chance meetings are another driver of serendipitous discovery and unexpected but fruitful collaborations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, without great efforts in ‘translation’, many scientific ideas can be completely disconnected from practical applications. A research lab brings an array of scientific experts together from different disciplines, for collaboration and drawing on expertise at low cost. Fellow researchers bump into one another. And the firm context means the potential impact in terms of usable products is always taken into account.</span></p>
<h3>The DARPA Era</h3>
<p><span>The era of the R&amp;D lab has one particularly legendary story and paradigmatic example: PARC. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre—the location in Palo Alto, now the home of companies like Tesla, Palantir, and Google, is no coincidence—developed many of the foundational building blocks of today’s technology and economy. In the 1970s, PARC researchers built the first computer with a graphical user interface, the first laser printer, the first Ethernet cable, and the first user-friendly word processor. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979, aged 24, and incorporated many of the ideas into Apple products. Charles Simonyi, a key developer at PARC, moved to Microsoft, where he developed the Office suite. But Xerox itself, which is still largely known for making photocopiers, did not capitalise on these inventions.</span></p>
<p><span>PARC, in turn, had hired many of its workers from Augmentation Research Centre, a publicly-funded project which pioneered the computer mouse, hyperlinks, the earliest predecessor to the internet, and many smaller innovations we take for granted in today’s computer ecosystem. ARC was funded by ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, now DARPA. Though DARPA (then ARPA) is funded by the US Department of Defence, it shares many elements with golden era R&amp;D labs. They are organised around a mission and a goal—even the most basic research is done with an end in mind—but researchers are given a lot of freedom to make their own decisions.</span></p>
<h3>A return to the market for ideas</h3>
<p><span>The scale of the change since the 1970s is huge—big businesses have retreated from research. In the 1960s, DuPont, the chemicals giant, published more in the </span><i><span>Journals of the American Chemical Society</span></i><span> than both MIT and Caltech combined. R&amp;D magazine, which awards the R&amp;D 100 to the hundred innovations it judges most innovative in a given four year period, gave 41% of its awards to Fortune 500 companies in its 1971 iteration and 47% in 1975. By 2006, 6% of the awards were going to firms in the Fortune 500. The great majority of these awards are now being won by federal labs, university teams, and spin-offs from academia. The lone inventor is back.</span></p>
<p><span>This is reflected by declines in the shares of patents going to the biggest businesses, and in the shares of scientists working there. In 1971 just over seven per cent of scientists in industry tracked by the US National Science Foundation worked in firms with under 1,000 employees; by 2004 this was 32%. In 2003 around a quarter worked at firms with fewer than ten employees. Even pharmaceuticals, the one area where large internal research labs are still significant, has been affected—around half of the drugs approved so far in the 2010s were originally discovered by small biotech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, participation by large American firms in …</span></p></div></div></div>

<p>This URL is the link to the series that I am writing on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> where I am developing a full-featured Markdown editor from scratch. But, the URL is so long and difficult to read and share on platforms like twitter. </p>
<p>Instead, wouldn't it be nice to have a simple short URL like <code>pbt.im/markdown-series</code> which redirects to the above URL. It's short, crisp, readable, and also equally conveys what one can expect in that link.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-affiliate-links">Sharing affiliate links.</h3>
<p>Other places where URL shortening can be useful is when you want to share or brand an ugly affiliate link, or when the domain of the link that you want to share is very long.</p>

<p>Take a look at some of the shortened links that I frequently use. </p>

<p>Sharing the above links is so easy. You don't even have to copy them. You can just type them out yourself. They are short, consistent, readable and can easily be remembered.</p>
<h3 id="links-can-change">Links can change</h3>
<p>Another disadvantage of sharing normal links is that the links can potentially change in the future. </p>
<p>If they do change, you can't hunt down every post and every place where you posted or shared that link and then update it. And it might not always be feasible to redirect the old URL to a new URL. </p>
<p>Shortened links can come in very handy in this situation. The shortened link that you share need not change ever. Whereas the URL that the short link should redirect to can change as you wish.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h3>
<p>I even started using my URL shortener to create bookmarks. I added a short URL(<code>/bookmarks</code>) that redirects to a GitHub page which contains all my other short URLs. Then whenever I want to bookmark a very useful URL, instead of bookmarking it normally, I started shortening it, which will automatically add it to my list of short URLs (which means it will also be available at <code>/bookmarks</code>)</p>
<p>Now that we saw some of the reasons of how shortened URLs can help us, let's see how to create one yourself.</p>
<h2 id="creating-your-own-url-shortener">Creating Your Own URL Shortener</h2>

<p>This is the tweet that inspired me to explore and create a URL shortener for shortening my links. I finally ended up using the approach that Kent suggested. I will be explaining the same in this article.</p>
<h3 id="netlify-redirects">Netlify Redirects</h3>
<p>Before we jump into the actual content, let's see what Netlify redirects are. Netlify gives us an easy way to handle redirects for any site that is hosted on the platform. All you have to do is create a <code>_redirects</code> file and then add the redirect rules in that file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a <code>_redirects</code> file, each redirect rule must be listed on a separate line, with the original path followed by the new path or URL. Any line beginning with # will be ignored as a comment.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>/home              /</span>
/blog/my-post.php  /blog/my-post
/news              /blog
<span>/cuties            https:/</span>/www.petsofnetlify.com
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>This is the bare minimum that you need to create your own URL shortener. </p>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty project with a single file called <code>_redirects</code>.</li>
<li>Add your short and complete URLs there.</li>
<li>Deploy that project to Netlify. </li>
</ul>
<p>You now have your own simple URL shortener. </p>
<p>Every time you want to add a new URL, you can just add it in the <code>_redirects</code> file and then deploy it. If using this workflow is good enough for you, you can stop here and use it.</p>
<p>But Kent went a step further and created a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a> which simplifies the workflow of creating short URLs even further.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to start using <code>netlify-shortener</code> and set up your own URL shortener</p>
<h4 id="step-1-create-an-empty-project">Step 1: Create an empty project</h4>
<pre><code>mkdir url-shortener
<span>cd</span> url-shortener
</code></pre><h4 id="step-2-initialize-it-as-npm-project">Step 2: Initialize it as npm project</h4>
<pre><code>npm <span>init</span> -y
</code></pre><h4 id="step-3-create-a-redirects-file-and-add-the-following-content">Step 3: Create a <code>_redirects</code> file and add the following content.</h4>
<pre><code>
/*       https://your-website.com
</code></pre>
<p><code>your-website.com</code> will act as a fallback when the URL doesn't match any of the available short URLs. Replace it with whatever URL you want to have as a fallback.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-add-homepage-and-shorten-script-to-your-packagejson-add-your-own-short-domain-url-to-the-homepage">Step 4: Add homepage and shorten script to your package.json (Add your own short domain URL to the homepage)</h4>
<pre><code>{
  "<span>homepage</span>": <span>"https://pbt.im"</span>,
  "<span>scripts</span>": {
    "<span>shorten</span>": <span>"netlify-shortener"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can run the following commands.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>npm</span> run shorten 


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//</span>yahoo.com


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//gi</span>thub.com gh
</code></pre><p>The <code>npm run shorten</code> command</p>
<ul>
<li>Generates a shortcode automatically if it is not provided.</li>
<li>Validates your URL.</li>
<li>Automatically check for URL collisions and throws an error if there is a collision.</li>
<li>Adds the URL to the top of the <code>_redirects</code> file and reformats the file properly.</li>
<li>Pulls the changes from remote, adds the new shortened URL, commits the code, and then pushes the commit to the remote again.</li>
<li>Automatically copies the short URL to your clipboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't even have to provide <code>https://</code>, by default it assumes that the original link is <code>https://</code></p>
<p>You can even add it as a global command in your shell using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener#shell-function">these instructions</a></p>
<h3 id="my-workflow-for-shortening-a-url">My workflow for shortening a URL</h3>
<p>Open the terminal and simply write <code>shorten original-URL short-slug</code>. </p>
<p>For example, to shorten the link to my Github profile, I will run the following command </p>
<pre><code><span>shorten</span> github.com/pbteja1998 gh
</code></pre><h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

August 29, 2020 | https://theodormarcu.com/blog/2020-08-29-neuralink/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://theodormarcu.com/blog/2020-08-29-neuralink/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink1.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>Images courtesy of Neuralink.</sub></p><p>You probably heard about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/elon-musk-demonstrates-neuralinks-tech-live-using-pigs-with-surgically-implanted-brain-monitoring-devices/" target="_blank">the latest Neuralink demo</a>
by now. I’m referring to the one where Elon Musk showed pigs with brain implants walking around and making cute noises. But why should you care? Is this just another publicity stunt by a rich billionaire with eccentric pet projects, or does it actually matter?</p><iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVvmgjBL74w?start=947" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><sub>Click above to see the part of the presentation where the pig sniffs around and sounds play whenever the neurons associated with his snout fire. Trust me, it’s adorable. From now on, this is the sound I’ll play in my mind whenever I see animals sniffing around.</sub></p><p>The Neuralink demo is a big deal for several reasons. Most importantly, it shows a fully-working brain-machine interface product in a living being. I cannot emphasize how incredible this is. Creating a brain implant is a hard task. Not only do you have to figure out how to stick something in a brain without hurting it, but keeping that thing in place, building the software to interpret the signals coming from it, and then removing it with minimal damage is an endeavor that presents serious challenges at every step of the way. Making all of the above into a <em>product</em>, not a week-long surgery research project, is a truly Promethean achievement.</p><p>The fact that Neuralink is closer to delivering a product and not just research matters a lot. We’ve heard about advances in brain-machine interface research for decades now, but all the results have been highly experimental. Building a product and not an experiment means that all those results, from restoring speech to restoring movement, are closer to being used by those who actually need them. Furthermore, reducing the barriers to obtaining neural data from humans creates an unprecedented opportunity to better understand our own minds, not to mention traditionally elusive topics like consciousness.</p><p>One of the first things that stood out to me in the demo was how Neuralink inserts the brain-machine interface device into the brain. Insertion is something Neuralink has brought up in past presentations, but this time they showed a particularly good video of how it works. In order to insert sensors in a brain without damaging it, the Neuralink team has built electrodes in the shape of small wires that are 1/4 of the diameter of human hair. These electrodes are then inserted through a skull opening using a high-precision robot that scans the brain area <em>during</em> surgery, which allows it to avoid any blood vessels, no matter how small. This procedure reduces tissue damage and increases the probability that the implant won’t be outright rejected by the brain. To see how cool this is, just watch the demo below:</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>The robot misses the blood vessels every time! This takes place in an area where distances are measured in micrometers - 1/100000 of a meter. This procedure is not something that would work without major advances in robotics and computer vision. Having a human do it by hand is out of the question. I suggest you go back to the <a href="https://youtu.be/DVvmgjBL74w?t=646" target="_blank">original demo</a> and watch the high-definition video to see just how good the robot is at this job.</p><p>The fact that the robot can implant a <em>Link</em> (Neuralink’s name for the sensor) in under an hour is a great achievement too. Neuralink’s goal is to make getting a brain-machine interface as easy as getting Lasik eye surgery. This demo showed that they’re not joking about delivering on this promise.</p><p>Another thing that truly stood out to me is how secure and inconspicuous the <em>Link</em> interface looked on the pig’s head. I couldn’t even spot it! This is really important, since if you’re about to make something that living beings are supposed to wear every day, you might as well make sure it’s not awkward or annoying. Even better, the interface should feel like it’s part of your own body.</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink2.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>The new <em>Link</em> brain-machine interface.</sub></p><p>This is an area that did not receive a lot of attention before Neuralink. For example, when hospitals perform invasive brain-recordings using traditional methods like ECoG, wires come out of your head through skull openings. Since the brain is a squishy mass surrounded by liquid, keeping the liquid <em>in</em> and the area around the opening <em>clean</em> becomes an incredibly difficult task. Nurses have to hover around patients constantly to make sure that the wires are not coming loose and that the brain ooze is being cleaned so that no infections take place.</p><p>What makes the <em>Link</em> so revolutionary is that it’s a standalone device. By removing the need for charging or data transfer wires, this brain-machine interface is closer to an Apple Watch-level wearable than anything else that has been built so far. Seeing the charging puck (which seems to have copied the Apple Watch charging puck) offered perhaps the clearest glimpse of the future in the entire presentation (so did the 1-day battery life, which, while amazing for a device this size, will also lead to some really funny memes about how our brains will run out of battery and need to be charged).</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink3.jpg" alt="Neuralink Inductive Charging Mechanism">
<sub>Is this going to be worse than forgetting to charge your phone at night?.</sub></p><p>Having something that fits neatly in your skull and blocks liquid from coming out without the need for wires is a major achievement. I’m sure there is still a lot of work to be done, especially given Elon’s calls for help from sealing experts, but seeing something as good as what we’ve seen today shows a great degree of progress.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you’ve solved hard problems with phones / wearables (sealing, signal processing, inductive charging, power mgmt, etc), please consider working at engineering@neuralink.com</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1284306733720940544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Another noteworthy aspect of the <em>Link</em> interface is the signal processing. In this regard, the pig-sniffing-with-sounds demo was ok, since it didn’t really use any fancy techniques. What really stood out was predicting and interpreting brain signals using the information from the <em>Link</em> sensors.</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>These demos can get a bit hand-wavey and Neuralink did not provide a lot of information about the techniques used to produce this particular example. However, given the fact that deep learning has been shown to be really good at brain signal decoding and prediction, I wouldn’t be suprised if Neuralink and OpenAI partenered on advancing signal processing using deep learning once the hardware is ready. Given Elon’s obsession with the singularity, I wouldn’t be surprised if this happened sooner.</p><p>Overall, I’m really excited about the future of invasive brain-machine interfaces after seeing this demo. While the jump from animals to humans is a big one and I’m sure Elon errs on being overly-optimistic when it comes to the timeline, this is a historical moment similar to launching the first dog into space. The fact that this is possible today opens an endless array of opportunities for the future of humanity.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-obfuscated-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-36ec615c8f5d">two</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-round-2-60d78b67ebce">posts</a>
on medium.com explaining the workings of some obfuscated programs. After these posts other stuff took priority and I forgot about the world of obfuscation for a while. Now though, I find myself returning to it.
For reasons I’ll explain in a different post I find studying obfuscated code to be quite valuable. So, I thought to myself ‘Well, those last programs I examined were honestly pretty simple. What would it be like to research a truly obfuscated program?’</p>
<p>This post is the story of that journey. I will discuss the code, how I got such old and obscure code to run, as well as include snippets from my conversations with
one of the original authors (who was very helpful in figuring some of this out). If all that wasn’t enough I managed to obtain the original PDP and VAX source code, it will be hosted here with permission. I want to give a huge thank you to Sjoerd Mullender and Don Libes for their assistance and permission in reproducing some of this material.</p>

<p>Because older obfuscated programs tend to be easier to dissect I decided to stay in the early years of the IOCCC (International Obfuscated C Code Contest).
Among those early programs one sticks out as truly interesting - and that is the first IOCCC winner <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/mullender.c">mullender.c</a>, which I’ve also replicated below because it’s quite short.

<p>Where do you start with a program like this? Well, the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/hint.text">hint</a> provided by the IOCCC is always a good first step.
From this hint, we can learn a few things necessary to understanding how the program works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, this program will only run on a PDP-11 or VAX-11.</li>
<li>The C startup routine - provided by crt0.o - transfers control to a location named ‘main’ - usually intended to be a function, but in this case it’s an array of shorts</li>
<li>These shorts (represented in different formats to enhance obfuscation) form a meaningful set of PDP-11 and VAX-11 instructions</li>
<li>The first instruction is a branch to the PDP code, and due to the way VAX calls the main ‘function’ it skips the first word of the program (I’ll discuss this more later).</li>
<li>The program prints a string</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, the program is a bunch of machine code instructions encoded in various formats. It runs because this code predates ANSI C by a half decade and old compilers seem to have had significantly less qualms about
‘main’ being a function or not (I tried to define ‘main’ as an array of shorts with a modern compiler and it did not like that one bit).</p>

<p>I admit it, the PDP-11 was before my time. I grew up in the Windows 95/98/2000 era, and until recently I didn’t even know what a PDP-11 was.
This ignorance left me kind of stuck, and a brief look on eBay confirmed that I was not going to get a working PDP-11 any time soon. Fortunately though,
an emulator exists. Enter <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">SimH</a>, it’s more of a suite of emulators for a wide range of historical computers - of which the
PDP-11 is one, and lucky for us the VAX-11 is another.</p>
<p>After a few false starts and misadventures with 2.11BSD, I realized I had no idea what I was doing so I decided I needed some help.
The two original authors of this program are Robbert van Renesse and Sjoerd Mullender, why not try to contact them? So I did.
Robbert didn’t answer my e-mail, but luckily Sjoerd got back to me and was happy to discuss the program. He told me that the
PDP-11 OS they used was Unix v7, so I proceeded on that route.</p>
<p>I managed to <a href="http://a.papnet.eu/UNIX/v7/Installation">find a guide</a> on installing Unix v7 onto this emulator that worked;
and now with my emulator running, and OS installed, I could slap it into a file, compile, and run the thing. Below is what I got.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/running_on_pdp11.gif">
	
		<figcaption>Running the program on the PDP-11 using Unix v7</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>The animation is a little choppy, but even still you can hopefully see that it is printing “:-)” across the screen until it is forced to exit (there is no clean way to stop it).</p>
<p>In my discussions with Sjoerd, it was revealed that the string it prints is not exactly “:-)” but instead "  :-)\b\b\b\b”
(NOTE: there should be 2 space characters at the start but my templating engine is removing one for some reason).
It is exactly 9 bytes long. The first 2 characters are whitespace, followed by the :-), finally followed by four ‘\b’
characters. The ‘\b’ characters indicate a backspace. What does the backspace accomplish? Well, if you count 4 characters back from when they begin you’ll see we’re left with a single space - it is at this point
that the program loops and prints the string again. This happens quickly enough that to our eyes it looks like the “:-)” is scrolling across the screen - a clever effect.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the C code is not very useful to examine directly. As it also turns out, the assembly isn’t much better. Below is a small sample of what the assembly looks like (from the PDP-11’s perspective):</p>
<pre><code>    .text
    .globl  _main
    .data
    .even
_main:
    .word   0425 
    .word   04735
    .word   -010041
    .word   031
    .word   0
    .word   0735
    .word   01773
    .word   05757
</code></pre><p>So, what to do? Well, you can actually set up a cross compiler for the PDP-11 and if you go through that effort you can use the objdump program targeted at PDP-11 binaries.</p>
<p>Below is the relevant portion of the objdump - the whole thing is <a href="https://lainsystems.com/mull_objdump.txt">here</a>, but not all of it is useful. Sjoerd confirmed that the PDP code is
from _main+0x2c to _main+0x4a (inclusive). Of course, the first word is also a PDP-11 instruction. Everything I’ve ommitted is related to the VAX portion of
the program which we will get back to. (It’s also not proper VAX code since the disassembler thinks everything is PDP-11).</p>
<pre><code>   0:   0115            br  0x2c
  2c:   11c4            mov pc, r4
  2e:   0be4            tst -(r4)
  30:   e5c4 0009       sub $11, r4
  34:   1137 0006       mov r4, $0x3e
  38:   15c0 0001       mov $1, r0
  3c:   8904            sys 4
  3e:   0000            halt
  40:   0009            .word   11
  42:   15c2 0200       mov $1000, r2
  46:   892d            sys 55
  48:   7e82            sob r2, 0x46
  4a:   01f0            br  0x2c
</code></pre><p>Before going further there are 2 important things to know about PDP-11 assembly code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PDP-11 works primarily with octal. All the addresses and instructions are encoded in octal.</li>
<li>In an instruction like <code>mov pc, r4</code>, you are moving pc INTO r4, not r4 into pc. Personally, I got used to this pretty quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first number in the original program is 277, put that into a hex converter and you’ll get 115 like we see in the objdump. More interesting though is what you get translating it into octal - 425.
How does 0425 get you br 0x2c though? Well for that you need to grab some <em>manuals</em>. I got my hands on a lot of old manuals for these computers but the most useful one was the PDP-11/45 Handbook from 1973.
It would helpfully describe the instruction format, and exactly what it did. Below is an example of the page for the unconditional branch instruction.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/pdp11-branch.png">
	
		<figcaption>PDP-11/45 Handbook Describing the Branch instruction</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>As you can see, it sets the program counter to pc + 2x the offset - which is 25 (octal) in our case. Since the program counter at the start of our program is 2 (because it points to the next word to execute),
we get 2 + (25 x 2), or 2 + 52 = 54, which translating back into hex gives us 2c. Cool!</p>

<p>Now that we know how the branch works we can examine the main stuff - I won’t go into huge depth with the manuals for each little instruction but doing so is fun if you’re bored and enjoy that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The next relevant portion of code is this:</p>
<pre><code>  mov pc, r4
  tst -(r4)
  sub $11, r4
  mov r4, $0x3e
  mov $1, r0
  sys 4
  halt
  .word   11
</code></pre><p>We move the program counter into the r4 register and then use the ‘test’ (tst) instruction. This has the effect of clearing the some flags in the PSW (processor status word), and because
the register is using ‘Autodecrement mode’ it will subtract 2 from the value stored at r4. When using autoincrement / decrement, it will go by 1 in byte instructions or 2 in word instructions.
After this we subtract 11 from r4, but 11 is actually 9 (used to octal yet?). Then we store r4 into…0x3e? Well, if you look back at the objdump you’ll see that 0x3e is ‘halt’ or 0000. This
mov instruction overwrites that value with the contents of r4. We move 1 into r0 (1 indicating STDOUT), and call ‘sys 4’. The next line will be the value of r4 as just mentioned, and <code>.word 11</code>
simply inserts octal 11 directly into that spot. If you’re wondering what exactly is in r4 and why we’re doing all this stuff, be patient - we’re getting there.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with system calls, you probably know what’s going on. If not, all of this is to setup the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_(system_call)">write</a> system call. I
actually made a <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15590/trying-to-understand-some-assembly-syntax-in-the-unix-v7-write-system-call">post on the retro-computing stackexchange</a>
asking about the workings of this call internally - I recommend checking it out if you want further clarity on how this works.</p>
<p>After this we have the final 3 lines of PDP code which are:</p>
<pre><code>  mov $1000, r2
  sys 55
  sob r2, 0x46
</code></pre><p>We put 1000 into r2, and call system call 55. After this, we use the ‘sob’ instruction - which is ‘subtract one and branch’ and not an invitation to cry - to see if r2 is 0 yet. If it isn’t, we branch
to the previous line and call system call 55 again. loop until r2 is 0. Syscall 55 eh? Which …</p></div></div></div>

  <p>OpenMath is an emerging standard for representing mathematical objects with their semantics, allowing them to be exchanged between computer programs, stored in databases, or published on the worldwide web. While the original designers were mainly developers of computer algebra systems, it is now attracting interest from other areas of scientific computation and from many publishers of electronic documents with a significant mathematical content. There is a strong relationship to the MathML recommendation from the Worldwide Web Consortium, and a large overlap between the two developer communities. MathML deals principally with the presentation of mathematical objects, while OpenMath is solely concerned with their semantic meaning or content. While MathML does have some limited facilities for dealing with content, it also allows semantic information encoded in OpenMath to be embedded inside a MathML structure. Thus the two technologies may be seen as highly complementary.</p>

<p>Mathematical objects encoded in OpenMath can be</p>

<ul>
  <li>displayed in a browser</li>
  <li>exchanged between software systems</li>
  <li>cut and pasted for use in different contexts</li>
  <li>verified as being mathematically sound (or not!)</li>
  <li>used to make interactive documents really interactive.</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenMath is highly relevant for persons working with mathematics on computers, for those working with large documents (e.g. databases, manuals) containing mathematical expressions, and for technical and mathematical publishing.</p>

<p>The worldwide OpenMath activities are coordinated within the OpenMath Society, based in Helsinki, Finland. It is coordinated by an executive committee, elected by its members. It organizes regular workshops and hosts a number of electronic discussion lists. The Society brings together tool builders, software suppliers, publishers and authors.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had an hour-long conversation yesterday talking to a fellow entrepreneur who quit the adventure and took a job. He was curious to know what I had done differently to arrive at a positive outcome.</p><p>My first reaction was to tell him that this is not my first attempt. </p><p>I've tried building a company twice before and failed miserably. I even tried building a breakfast delivery business in 2015 (I had no idea what I was doing back then) and I made ₹85,000 in revenue before I shut it down.</p><p>SuperLemon is actually my fourth attempt. Sankalp and I did just enough things right this time (or avoided just enough mistakes) to make the business work. </p><p>The journey to reaching here was long, filled with doubt internally and from everyone around me, even frustrating and hopeless at times.</p><p>Out of all the things we talked during the call, the three things that stood out to me were:</p><h3><strong>1-</strong> I kept trying again and again</h3><p>If something didn't work, I would find a job to save up and try again as soon as I have a year's worth of runway and a strong enough conviction about the idea. </p><p>As of today, I don't see any other path in life but building businesses.</p><h3><strong>2-</strong> I knew when to quit</h3><p>When things weren't working out no matter our best effort, clearly there was something wrong. I spent 12 months on my second venture before realising there's no market demand. </p><p>But I quit my third venture (right before SuperLemon) in about 4 months when it was obvious to me that it wasn't going to work.</p><h3><strong>3-</strong> Introspect </h3><p>After every attempt or failure, I would spend between 1-3 months in intense introspection of what went wrong. </p><p>This wasn't an exercise to beat myself up over it, but rather to learn what I need to do differently the next time for things to work out more favourably.</p><h3>If you're a budding entrepreneur</h3><p>I don't recommend this path to anyone unless they are willing to take all the pain and failures, learn from them, and try again with the hope to eventually get it right.</p><p>Quit sooner than later when something isn't working, but only if you've understood why it won't work. </p><p>Ask always yourself if you're in it for the long haul. Otherwise you might as well quit right now.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2> What is the yield curve?</h2><p>The Yield Curve shows current yield rates, for US Treasuries, at varying maturities. That was a lot of jargon, so let's break it down.</p><canvas></canvas><p>US Treasuries represent bonds issued by the US Government. Think of a bond as any loan - the issuer of a bond has to pay interest each month, and the amount borrowed at maturity. Maturity refers to the period after which the bond is to be paid back. The US Government issues bonds for varying maturity rates, from 30 days to 30 years. And finally, the yield rate represents the effective interest rate for a bond, based on its current price.</p><h2>Why does it matter?</h2><p>The yield curve sets the basic, or lowest possible, interest rates. Any changes in the yield curve have a ripple effect across the entire economy.</p><p>Effectively, the yield curve represents current interest rates for the US Government. The US Government is considered the safest borrower in the economy. So, it gets to borrow money at the lowest possible interest rates. Everyone else has to pay more interest, to compensate for the added risk. </p><p>Let's take a concrete example. On September 4, 2019, Apple issued bonds worth $7bn. These bonds had maturities ranging from 3 years, to 30 years. The yield rate on these bonds was higher than the US Government bond yields on the same day.</p><canvas></canvas><p>Similarly, if you want to take out a 30 year mortgage, your interest rate will be some number plus the interest rate of the 30 year treasury.</p><p>So when the yield curve rises, that means interest rates for everyone go up. It becomes more expensive for Apple to borrow money, or for you to get a mortage. If it's more expensive to borrow money, it's more expensive to spend money; and in this way, higher interest rates make economic growth harder.</p><p>The yield curve also matters because it's considered a predictor for future recessions.</p><h3>How is the yield curve a recession indicator?</h3><p>The shape of the yield curve offers some clues. In normal times, the yield curve slopes upwards. Remember, the higher risk the, the higher the interest rate. Shorter periods are safer - it's easier to predict what will happen in the next 30 days, than in the next 30 years.</p><p>When the yield curve is <em>inverted</em>, something is wrong. It means that rates for long term-periods are lower than interest rates for short-term periods. This is rare, and breaks the relationship we described above. It's so abnormal, that it is a reliable predictor of economic recessions.</p><p>The chart below is an example of an inverted yield curve; specifically, the yield curve for August 11, 2006. Yield curves were inverted for much of 2006 and 2007. It proved prophetic. In late 2007 we entered the deepest economic recession since the 1930s.</p><canvas></canvas><p>The graph below shows the <em>spread</em> between the 10 year treasury and the 3 month treasury. The spread is just the difference between two interest rates; so anytime the spread drops below 0, it means the yield curve was inverted on that day.</p><canvas></canvas><h3>How does this matter as a personal investor?</h3><p>One way to use the yield curve is to check whether it is inverted. If the yield curve is inverted, postpone taking any loans if you can. An inverted yield curve is a sign that the rates might be lower in the future, so you'd want to wait for that to happen. It's also a sign that there might be economic trouble ahead; so ensure your savings are truly safe.</p><p>The yield curve can help you identify opportunities to refinance old mortgages or loans. If interest rates have dropped since the day you took the loan, you might have an opportunity to refinance it at a lower interest rate.</p><p>The yield curve doesn't change frequently; check it once per quarter.</p><h2>How does it change?</h2><h3>The Federal Reserve manages parts of the yield curve.</h3><p>The Fed's job is to manage inflation and maintain economic growth. They use a variety of tools to do so. For the moment, don't worry about how the Fed does it - just know that the Fed has lots of control over short term rates, but only some control over long term rates.</p><p>During a recession the Fed's goal is to get the economy growing again. In order to do so, it will cut interest rates. As explained above, high interest rates reduce spending, while low interest rates stimulate spending. When spending is stimulated, the economy grows, and things eventually return back to normal.</p><p>The Fed is good at its job, and is reliable, so the relationship described above works well. So well, that investors know the Fed will do so when a recession hits. If investors think a recession is coming 2 years from now, they'll start betting that interest rates will drop. This in fact causes <strong>yield rates</strong> to fall, resulting in an inverted yield curve. </p><p>But there are limits to what the Fed can actually do.</p><h3>What's happening during COVID-19?</h3><p>The yield curve is considered extremely flat today. The chart below shows the spread between 30 day and 30 year bonds. The lower the spread, the flatter the yield curve.</p><p>The Fed has committed to keeping interest rates as as close to 0 as possible. COVID-19 has hit the economy hard; low interest rates are needed to stimulate the economy as much as possible, but the Fed might be hitting its limits.</p><h3>What could the future look like?</h3><p>There's a notion of the <em>Zero Lower Bound</em>. Theoretically, interest rates can't drop below 0%. Negative interest rates are weird - that implies being paid to take out a loan. For a long time, it was assumed that the bound was a hard one. Meaning that once the Fed has cut interest rates to 0%, it can't do anything more to stimulate the economy.</p><p>Firstly, we've discovered that 0% might not be the lower bound. European central banks, such as the Swiss central bank, have run interest rates lower than 0% for some time now.</p><p>Secondly, the Fed has discovered new tools to stimulate the economy. A notable example is Quantitative Easing, first used in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed has started to do it again; but this time around, the effects have been very different. To be explained in a future post!</p><h2>What else do I need to know?</h2><p>The Fed is one of many interacting agents in the world of interest rates; we haven't discussed inflation or gone into details about the role that investors play.</p></div></div></div>]]>

      <article role="main">
        <p>This isn’t going to be a post about how adopting a several-thousand-year-old practice <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/healthy-living/mindfulness-sells-buddhist-meditation-teachings-neoliberalism-attention-economy-a8225676.html">can make you a better servant of capital</a>.
Instead, let’s talk about when I feel the lowest of the low.
It comes after spending any number of hours on my computer, maybe even a full day, endlessly circling around different websites in search of stimulation, the quick jolt that comes with learning an interesting fact or watching a funny short video or seeing someone get dunked on for having a bad political opinion.
I’ll eventually wake into a state that could be identified as conscious thought, look back on the many (genuinely exciting!) things I wanted to learn or do that day, and contrast it with what I actually did.
What did I actually do? I honestly don’t even know. I doubt I could list even three things I’d read or experienced the entire preceding eight hours.
At this moment I feel very bad. I know one of the ~30,000 days in my life is gone.
And I didn’t get anything out of it.
Actually, I’m worse off, because spending your time in this way just begets even more time spent in this way.</p>
<p>I don’t have any social media apps on my phone.
I deleted my twitter account.
I deleted my reddit account.
I don’t have an instagram account.
My facebook account exists only to be part of some groups.
I use LeechBlock.
I redirect websites to 0.0.0.0 in my hosts file.
Everyone I know does most of these things.
Everyone I know still has trouble spending their time how they actually want to spend it.
If I were to write down a list of the things I find most important in life, endlessly circling around a handful of websites would not even be in consideration.</p>
<p>If I get stuck in the loop for more than a week or so my brain starts to eat itself.
There’s a visceral knawing feeling.
My thoughts dwell on how to defeat this thing which is deleting hours from my life.</p>
<p>So far the only thing which has helped is mindfulness meditation.
After sitting for 10 or 20 minutes and focusing on my breath, my mind becomes quiet.
Traffic on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">default mode network</a> dies down a little bit.
I’m no longer instantly pulled into the online vortex upon encountering the slightest speedbump in my work.
Instead my mind just… stays quiet, and I keep the problem in my head.
This doesn’t last forever.
I could probably meditate for 10 minutes out of every hour and still have spent more time on the things I actually wanted to spend time on, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Deciding to meditate is hard.
The idea of spending ten minutes intentionally doing nothing runs against a lot of messaging I’ve internalized.
It’s also very difficult to keep my attention on my breath instead of running away to consider whatever figment wanders through my thoughts.
There’s an interesting metaphor I’ve heard.
Your mind is like a train station.
Thoughts think themselves - they are trains pulling into the station.
A train of thought will shortly pull out of the station, but you don’t have to be on it.
Or maybe you just boarded it without thinking, then don’t realize what you’ve done until you’re a mile down the track.
No worries; you can always return to the station.</p>
<p>I decided to try mindfulness meditation after listening to the audio version of Robert Wright’s book <a href="http://whybuddhismistrue.net/">Why Buddhism Is True</a> while on a cross-country drive.
It’s about how many beliefs in Buddhism - specifically Western Atheistic Buddhism - have support from modern psychology &amp; neuroscience.
I wasn’t motivated to start meditating by thinking it would help me in this struggle for my attention; the discovery was quite accidental.
I use the <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/">Waking Up</a> app.
Friends of mine also report good experiences with <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s troubling I have to go to such lengths to live my life the way I think I want to live it.
Maybe this struggle is uniquely modern, maybe it’s one for the ages.
I still have issues sometimes, especially before bed when my defenses are lower and I can get sucked into the loop instead of reading a good book or just going to sleep.
Still, for the first time in my life I’ve found an actually effective tool for resisting the attention economy.</p>

<p>Since “Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand” sounds stupid to New Zealanders (Auckland is pretty much a big city with a single job market and is not a state or similar) I clicked on the link and opened the application to stick with what I currently have</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="912" height="557" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png 912w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px"></figure>



<p>Except the problem is that the pulldown doesn’t offer many any other locations</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="546" height="316" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png 546w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"></figure>



<p>The only way to change the location is to click “use Current Location” and then allow Linkedin to access my device’s location.</p>



<div><p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/suggested/110568">the help page</a>:</p><p><em>By default, the location on your profile will be suggested based on the postal code you provided in the past, either when you set up your profile or last edited your location. However, you can manually update the location on your LinkedIn profile to display a different location.</em></p></div>



<p>but it appears the manual method is disabled. I am guessing they have a fixed list of locations in my postcode and this can’t be changed.</p>



<p>So it appears that my options are to accept Linkedin’s crappy name for my location (Other NZers have posted problems with their location naming) or to allow Linkedin to spy on my location and it’ll probably still assign the same dumb name.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="489" height="42" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png 489w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43-300x26.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"></figure>



<p>The basically appears to be a way for Linkedin to push user to enable location tracking. While at the same time they get to force their own ideas on how New Zealand locations work on users.</p>

<p>PHP has a Just In Time compiler (JIT) since its most recent major version, PHP 8.</p>
<p>Here's a demo of JIT's impact on PHP. The video was recorded by Zeev, a core
developer of the php engine, to demonstrate the performance difference between
php 7.0 and JIT when generating fractals.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dWH65pmnsrI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""><iframe style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dWH65pmnsrI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>It is fair to expect great performance improvements after watching this video,
especially if you remember the amazing boost when migrating from php 5 to 7.
But soon you'll notice that such gains aren't for most applications (unless
you do fractals for a living 🤷🏻‍♀️).</p>
<p>So before you get too hyped or too disappointed about JIT, let me explain what
this thing is and how you can get the most out of it.</p>
<h2>What is a Just In Time compiled language and why do we need it?</h2>
<p>Let me introduce you to compilation first, I believe we will need it.</p>
<p>CPUs can't read english, you already know that. They can kind of read a series
of bits and bytes which represent addresses, values, instructions... But guess
who can't code this? That's right, us! (At least I can't 👀 (I kind of can, but... no.))</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to translate something we, humans, can write into
something CPUs can execute. This translation can be called "compilation". So
<strong>compilation is a translation of human-readable code to machine code.</strong>
Simple, oder?</p>
<p>Translating human-readable code to machine code can happen in three different
ways: Ahead Of Time (AOT) compilation, Just In Time (JIT) compilation or, our
favorite, interpretation (or Implicit Compilation).</p>
<p><strong>Languages like C, C++ or Rust are AOT-compiled languages.</strong> You write the code,
you compile it and the output is a binary object that a CPU immediately understands
how to execute. It is called Ahead Of Time because you compile the binary object
BEFORE you run it.</p>
<p><strong>Languages like PHP, Java or JavaScript are interpreted.</strong> A code written in such
languages will be translated into an intermediate representation and another
program (a compiled one) will understand and execute such intermediate
representation. It is very common to call such programs "Virtual Machines" or
"Interpreters".</p>
<p><strong>Normally interpreted languages have less performance and freedom when compared
with AOT-compiled languages</strong> because things like memory management, CPU-targeted
instructions and funky low-level tricks are not available to the user space. So
another program (the interpreter) has to manage all of this plus be polyglot
enough to talk to different kinds of processors and operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>Languages like Java, LUA and now PHP are not only interpreted but also Just
In Time compiled!</strong> They still need a VM, but their VMs are capable of compiling
this intermediate representation of code into binary objects in runtime. These
JIT-capable VMs operate in a hybrid mode where code is partially compiled and interpreted.</p>
<p>When JIT kicks in, parts of your php code will be compiled into machine code so the
Zend VM (php's virtual machine) won't interpret these parts anymore. Your php
code will talk directly to the CPU.</p>
<p>So why can't we just compile everything, then? If the VM is a bottleneck, why
bother to run through it in the first place? We could just compile our php code
into machine code and be happy about it.</p>
<p>Well, we'd have to compile to specific CPU architectures, be prepared to talk to
different operating systems, be extremely clear about our variable types and
perform way more bare-metal operations than we should if we want to be productive.
There are decent abstractions for Golang and Rust, for example, but they aren't
very practical and require control over the environment they're deployed against.</p>
<p><strong>Interpreted languages, on the other hand, can be easily deployed to different
servers, allow rapid development and create room for dynamic typing systems.</strong></p>
<p>Just In Time compilation is potentially the best of the two worlds, combining
good speed and developer experience.</p>
<p>Dynamic typing, as you know, is one of the core features of PHP. It is very
complex and is tattooed into php's core in a way that removing the dynamic
typing is almost unthinkable.
<a href="https://thephp.website/en/issue/php-type-system/">Here’s a great summary on how php’s type system works.</a></p>
<p>And because of Dynamic Typing (and some other things you'll learn about below)
the Just In Time compiler present in PHP is not yielding big performance gains.
At least not yet.</p>
<p>Curious why? Keep reading!</p>
<h2>Let's see how PHP works with and without JIT</h2>
<p>In PHP there are three steps before executing your code: <strong>tokenizing</strong>,
<strong>parsing</strong> into an AST and <strong>compiling</strong> to an intermediate representation
known as <strong>Opcode</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tokenizing (or Lexing) is the process of reading php code and splitting
it into understandable units called tokens.</strong> <code>&lt;?php</code> becomes a _T_OPEN<em>TAG</em>,
<code>echo</code> becomes a _T<em>ECHO</em> and <code>"Hello, friend"</code> becomes T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING.
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/tokens.php">A complete list of PHP's tokens can be found here.</a></p>
<p>Parsing is the process of making sense out of such tokens. In PHP parsed tokens
are organized in a tree structure named AST (Abstract syntax tree).
The AST's job is to represent what operations should be. In <code>echo 1+1</code> the interpreter
should in fact understand <code>print the result of the expression 1+1</code>. Such tree would
look something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>operation =&gt; ECHO,
operand =&gt; expression (
    operation =&gt; ADD,
    operand1 =&gt; 1,
    operand2 =&gt; 1
)</code></pre>
<p>PHP is then able to <strong>compile this tree into an intermediate representation
called Opcode.</strong></p>
<p>The Opcode is what is actually executed by the virtual machine, so executing
is the final step. Here's a diagram illustrating how this process looks like.</p>

</a>
<figcaption>A simplified overview on PHP's interpreting flow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You probably realized that tokenizing, parsing and compiling code every single time
can be a big bottleneck. PHP engineers thought so too and that's why the
Opcache extension exists. Let's have a quick look at it.</p>
<h2>The Opcache extension</h2>
<p>The Opcache extension is shipped with PHP and generally there's no big reason to
deactivate it. If you use PHP, you should probably have Opcache switched on.</p>
<p>It adds an in-memory shared cache layer to store Opcodes. So tokenizing, parsing
and compiling will happen once for each file and will be shared with every request.</p>
<p>With Opcache extension enabled, the execution of PHP code looks like in the following
diagram:</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://thephp.website/assets/images/posts/10-php-8-jit/zendvm-opcache.png" target="_blank">
<img src="https://thephp.website/assets/images/posts/10-php-8-jit/zendvm-opcache.png" alt="The PHP's interpreting flow with Opcache">
</a>
<figcaption>The PHP's interpreting flow with Opcache. If a file was already parsed, php fetches the cached Opcodes for it instead of parsing all over again.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong> this is where <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/preload">PHP 7.4's preloading feature</a>
shines! It allows you to tell PHP FPM to parse your codebase, transform it into
Opcodes and cache them even before you execute anything.</p>
<h2>Enters the Just In Time compilation</h2>
<p>While the Opcache extension will prevent PHP from tokenizing, parsing and compiling
over and over again, the Just In Time compilation aims to skip the virtual machine's
Opcode interpretation and let it execute machine code directly.</p>
<p>PHP's JIT implementation uses a C library called
<a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM (Dynamic Assembler)</a>
which maps a set of CPU instructions in one specific format into assembly code for
many different CPU types. So the Just In Time compiler transforms Opcodes into an
architecture-specific machine code using DynASM.</p>
<p>The compilation happens between fetching Opcodes from cache and executing them.
Since compiling Opcode into machine code can be very expensive, PHP has to decide
which portions of your code might make sense to be compiled or not.</p>
<p><strong>PHP then profiles Opcodes being executed by the Zend VM and checks which ones
might make sense to compile. (based on your configuration)</strong></p>
<p>When an Opcode is compiled its execution doesn't happen through the Zend VM handlers,
they are directly executed by the CPU.</p>

</a>
<figcaption>The PHP's interpreting flow with JIT. If compiled, Opcodes don't execute through the Zend VM.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When an Opcode should be compiled is decided based on your INI configurations. You'll
get more details in the next section.</p>
<h2>JIT Configuration</h2>
<p>Configuring JIT in PHP is very simple, there are two INI directives we need to set:
<code>opcache.jit_buffer_size</code> and <code>opcache.jit</code>. The first indicates how much memory
we're willing to allocate for compiled code, while the later one dictates how JIT
should behave.</p>
<p>There's also an optional directive named <code>opcache.jit_debug</code> for debugging purposes.
I will not cover this one here.</p>
<p>For example, the snippet below indicates that we're willing to give up to 100 Megabytes
of compiled code, enabling AVX instruction generation, using a global linear-scan register
allocator, profiling each request and jitting hot functions, optimizing the compiled
code based on static type inference. (👀 WUT?)</p>
<pre><code>opcache.jit_buffer_size=100M
opcache.jit=1235</code></pre>
<p>To make your life easier, I’m bringing some presets that
<a href="https://beberlei.de/2020/07/05/what_to_look_out_for_when_testing_php_jit.html">Benjamin Eberlei kindly shared in his blog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1205</code> (JIT everything)</li>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1235</code> (JIT hot code based on relative usage)</li>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1255</code> (trace hot code for JITability, the best so far)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>opcache.jit</code> entry is a sequence of values named "CRTO", each character can have different
behavioural effect on your application. Below I explain what each of these letters can do:</p>

<p>
Has anyone else ever thought about why so many engineers are also
active amateur radio operators? My theory is that there's just so much
passion for the science and practical use of these complex electronic
systems! We enjoy the problems, challenges and solutions so much that
we want to find other ways outside of work to find those same
experiences. In this case, I've got a story that starts with some
amateur radio equipment but comes full-circle to address an extremely
common design issue.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
The Attempted QSO
</h2>
<p>
This all begins with a new radio. I recently installed the
FTM-3200DR<sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, a 2m-band, 65W transceiver with Yaesu's digital C4FM
modulation. One of the first things I wanted to try with this radio
was a direct, simplex QSO<sup><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> with a friend who is about 16 miles
away as the crow flies. Unfortunately for propagation, we've got a
decent amount of hilly terrain up here in the Skylands region of New
Jersey in addition to this being the summer season with significant
foliage.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After setting up the radio, I had one more crucial component before we
could attempt the exchange… the antenna! I considered making one
from scratch, but eventually settled on the Arrow OSJ (open-stub
J-pole)<sup><a id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup>. This antenna had excellent ratings and reviews for a
low cost. It's also sold as a dual band (2m and 70cm) if I ever
decided to take advantage of that capability. Originally, my plan was
to install the antenna in the attic (after performing all safety
calculations)<sup><a id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>. After thinking about it though, I noticed the old
satellite dish mounted on the roof which hadn't been touched since we
moved in and decided on that location instead. 
</p>
<p>
One motivation in selecting this antenna was its omni-directional
propagation<sup><a id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup>. Despite the idea of using this radio to communicate
with one friend, I still held high high the importance of an
omni-directional station. As I was installing the OSJ antenna, I
realized that it's not a perfectly symmetrical design - should I
orient the driven element in the direction of desired propagation, or
the opposite? I decided that it was time for an electromagnetic
analysis! Of course, I had these thoughts while on the roof, and
mounted the antenna with my best guess.
</p>

<h2 id="headline-2">
Open-Stub J-Pole Analysis
</h2>
<p>
Once down from the roof, I began my analysis. There are some free
simulators out there that use the NEC<sup><a id="footnote-reference-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> on one end of the
(electromagnetic?)  spectrum. At the other end are the
enterprise-level RF design tools such as Microwave Office<sup><a id="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup>,
ADS<sup><a id="footnote-reference-9" href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup>, and Ansys<sup><a id="footnote-reference-10" href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup>. Did you know that it doesn't take a full
RF design software license to get a good idea of antenna performance?
Even just an SI/PI analysis suite such as Cadence Sigrity can get us
what we need. The Sigrity 3DEM license along with 3D Workbench<sup><a id="footnote-reference-11" href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup>
provides a perfect environment to quickly model arbitrary 3-D geometry
and determine parameters such as resonant frequency, VSWR/S11, and
far-field radiation patterns. It may not automatically give detailed
results such as efficiency or directivity but it's plenty to give an
idea of behavior and allows the designer an opportunity to modify a
design to meet any project requirements. 
</p>

            <p><em>Figure 3. OSJ model, UHF connector detail.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The antenna was simulated as if mounted to a 100" insulated pole. The
range of 100 MHz to 500 MHz was selected in order to ascertain
behavior in both the 2m and 70cm bands. The UHF connector<sup><a id="footnote-reference-12" href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup> was
originally modeled, but I realized that I didn't have accurate
dimensions of the SO-239 stud or coupling nut, and I wouldn't want to
introduce reflections which are not representative of the antenna
structure itself.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-3">
Results
</h3>
<p>
The results confirmed exactly what some reviews have stated:
performance is slightly worse in the 70cm band. S11 (converted to
VSWR) does indicate this, with a best-case SWR of 1.2 in the 70cm
band, and 1.1 in the 2m band.
</p>

            <p><em>Figure 5. OSJ VSWR.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
One of the most interesting things about this analysis is that the
center frequency for both bands is quite a bit different from what is
reported. The Arrow SWR chart<sup><a id="footnote-reference-13" href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup> shows the 2m band coverage from
142-150 MHz and the 70cm from 430-453 MHz. Our analysis shows the 2m
band covering 136-142 MHz and the 70cm band covering 404-414 MHz -
both lower than expected. This should be confirmed with an antenna
analyzer, though one is not currently available to make the
measurement. Interesting to note - I'm not the first person to notice
these discrepancies when simulating against the instruction manual's
dimensions<sup><a id="footnote-reference-14" href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup>. I did make a point to measure the antenna and each
element was within 1/4" of the stated dimensions. That made me even
more eager to get an analyzer on it to test its actual response. At
that point, I tweaked the model to match measurements and ensure the
feed point is modeled correctly. For now though - the goal is simply
to determine propagation directionality which I'll analyze in the next
section.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-4">
Far Field Propagation
</h4>
<p>
Finally, we arrive at my ultimate goal - determining whether or not
propagation is truly omni-directional! The fastest way to check this
out is to look at the far field propagation plots. For reference,
Fig. 6 shows the orientation of the antenna in relation to the
axes. We are specifically looking for any directivity at all in the
antenna. All plots will indicate the frequency of interest, and every
plot was generated with a 1V source (13 dBm) and field strength is
simulated at a distance of 3m.
</p>
<figure>

            <p><em>Figure 6. Antenna orientation.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
First, I'll present an isometric view of the propagation pattern. It's
important to note that the units are given in mV/m for the 3D plots,
but dBuV/m for the 2D plots to follow. This makes the magnitude of
variation seem greater in the 3D plots, but we can probe for specific
values on the 2D plots. (Click any of the propagation plots for a
larger view).
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_139m_iso.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_139m_iso.png" alt="Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, isometric view." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, isometric view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The isometric view is the first indication that we aren't looking at
purely omni-directional propagation. As fun as the 3D views are to
look at, we can get the specific difference with a 2D plot.
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff2d_139m_z.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff2d_139m_z.png" alt="Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, top-down cut on the XY-plane (Z=0)." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, top-down cut on the XY-plane (Z=0).</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
As it turns out, there is a minor difference in propagation depending
on the angle ɸ. The maximum value at ɸ=180° is 114.4 dBuV/m,
and the minimum value at ɸ=0° is 112.4 dBuV/m. It would be nice
to represent this as a dBi difference. Using an online
calculator<sup><a id="footnote-reference-15" href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup> (they're always right of course!) we can determine
the gain of the antenna in dBi. In this case, we see a gain of 6.2 dBi
in the forward direction and 4.2 dBi in the backward direction for a 2
dB front-to-back ratio. Coincidentally, this was my guess while on the
roof and was the orientation I used while mounting the antenna. This
may not be extremely significant but it's worth knowing while mounting
the antenna.
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, there's even more directivity at 70cm, although that
won't matter for me and my 2m-only radio. 
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_410m_z.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_410m_z.png" alt="Figure 8. Far field, 410 MHz, top-down view." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 8. Far field, 410 MHz, top-down view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The bottom-line answer to my original question is that if you really
need to squeak out every last bit of gain in a certain direction, then
you'd be better off mounting the J-pole with the driven element closer
to that desired direction.
</p>
<p>
One last thing - if anyone is looking at more simulations or
measurements, here's the Touchstone<sup><a id="footnote-reference-16" href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup> file for this simulation which can
be downloaded and compared. Let me know if you use it!

<h4 id="headline-5">
What about that QSO?
</h4>
<p>
As of publication my friend and I have yet to close the link on a
successful exchange. This could be due to any number of factors, but I
was able to make contact with another ham via a repeater located 30
miles from my QTH<sup><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>, so the reasonable assumption is that the antenna
system on my roof is operating well.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-6">
PCB antenna
</h2>
<p>
While analysis of ham radio antennas is an interesting pursuit, it
caused me to stop and consider more practical applications of this
software. One thing that really struck me was the huge rise in IoT
devices using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, and many other wireless
communication protocols. How can a designer be assured their antenna
will work as required? Sure, copying dimensions from datasheets or
other resources might be adequate but for optimal performance on the
first fab run, a simulation would be very helpful. As an example, I've
chosen a common antenna design and show how quick and easy it is to simulate
and validate prior to fabrication.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-7">
Antenna Selection
</h3>
<p>
Cypress has an excellent document<sup><a id="footnote-reference-17" href="#footnote-17">17</a></sup> describing antenna and RF
design. Even better, they have links to PCB designs of a few antennas
which can be adapted to a designer's board. I chose to import and
simulate their MIFA (Meandered Inverted-F Antenna).
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/mifa_3d.png" alt="Figure 9. MIFA 3D view." width="400"> <figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 9. MIFA 3D view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
Prior to beginning the simulation we must determine the PCB stackup
and materials used. Fortunately the linked design files include a
fabrication drawing which indicates a finished PCB thickness of
62mils. The material is listed as generic FR-4, so we'll use one of
the most common FR-4 materials available: Isola 370HR<sup><a id="footnote-reference-18" href="#footnote-18">18</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
Next, the board design must be imported into the simulation tool of
choice. In this case, I'll bring the .brd file into PowerSI 3D-EM in
order to tweak the stackup. From there, we'll save it as a .spd and
bring that into 3D Workbench.
</p>

<h3 id="headline-8">
Initial Simulation
</h3>
<p>
The first simulation shows that this board must have been designed
specifically for manual adjustment given the resonant frequency is 2.1
GHz (see Fig. 11 below). …</p></div></div>

    <p>The aim of this guide is to make you more comfortable with git without having to read a whole book.
I will do this by giving you more of an “inside tour” of the inner workings of git.</p>

<p>If you are curious and want to become more comfortable with git, this guide aims to satisfy your curiosity more than “traditional” git guides.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll learn enough here to use git with more confidence, and will know better where to look when you are stuck.</p>

<p>Git is a computer program that creates snapshots – essentially backups – of folders on your computer.
In git, these snapshots are called “commits”.
A commit contains everything in that folder:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The folder structure</li>
  <li>names of files</li>
  <li>contents of files</li>
  <li>metadata of files</li>
</ul>

<p>Git’s strengths come from how it organizes the commits and from all the commands it provides for manipulating, labelling, and comparing them.
Handling commits is what makes git a “Version Control System”.</p>

<p>Git tries to make it <em>very</em> easy to take backups so that you can always find a useful place to return to if needed. Also, having a detailed commit history can help answer questions about the state of things at different points in the past, and about why changes were made. Each commit has info about when it was created, and by whom, as well as a “commit message” written by the committer, which ideally contains important information about why it exists.</p>

<p>Git also has commands for collaborating with others (e.g. push/pull/fetch).
The collaboration essentially means exchanging commits and “branches” (which in git are just labels for commits).
Usually collaboration means sending them to a server where others can retrieve them, but it’s also possible to share them directly with other collaborators.<sup id="fnref:distributed"><a href="#fn:distributed">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="first-steps">First steps</h3>

<p>Download git: <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/">https://git-scm.com/download/</a></p>

<p>Git is usually used from the command line, but there are also other ways to use it (<code>git gui</code>, SourceTree, TortoiseGit to name a few.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/">Here is a big list of graphical user interfaces for git</a>).</p>

<p>To download an existing repository (for example the one for this blog), run</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/oyvn/oyvn.github.io.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To create your own repository in an existing folder, run</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git init                      # Creates the repository
git add .                     # Prepares a commit of whatever was in
                              # the folder.
git commit -m"Initial commit" # Stores the commit with the message
                              # "Initial commit"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-repository">The repository</h2>

<p>A “repository” (repo) is a collection of commits.
When you use <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init"><code>git init</code></a> to create a repo inside a folder, git adds a hidden folder called “.git” inside it. The .git folder is where it puts all the commits.</p>

<p>The rest of your folder is now referred to as the “working directory”.</p>

<p>When you create a commit, git stores all the files and folders as “objects” in the .git folder.
Together, the stored objects contain all the information necessary to recreate the contents of the working directory.</p>

<p>When you retrieve a repo with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone"><code>git clone</code></a>, git essentially retrieves the .git folder and recreates – “checks out” – the working directory from the objects.</p>

<p>There are a few different types of git objects, let’s take a closer look.</p>

<h2 id="the-objects---commit-tree-and-blob">The objects - commit, tree and blob</h2>

<p>In git, everything is files.
All objects are stored as files in the .git repo.
Objects have different types depending on what data they contain.
An object’s file name is usually a string of gibberish that serves as a unique reference to that object.</p>

<p>When you call <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit"><code>git commit</code></a>, git creates a “commit” object, as well as “tree” objects for each folder, and “blob” objects for each file in the snapshot.
The blob is the simplest, it’s just a copy of the file, except for the name, which is a gibberish reference instead.</p>

<p>If you look in <code>.git/objects</code> you will find all commit, tree, and blob objects in your repo, all with gibberish names.</p>

<p>By not associating objects with file or folder names, the object can be reused even if the name or location of a file or folder changes, as long as the contents remain unchanged.</p>

<p>A tree object contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The name and a reference for every immediate sub-folder. The reference is to a tree object describing the sub-folder’s contents.</li>
  <li>The name and a reference for every file in the folder. The reference is to a blob object with the file contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>A commit object contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The committer and author (That’s you, if you made the commit – your name and email address as configured via <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config"><code>git config</code></a>).</li>
  <li>The current date and time.</li>
  <li>The commit message that you authored in the process of committing.</li>
  <li>A reference to the tree object for the working directory.</li>
  <li>One or more references to other commit objects (“parent commits”).</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I want you to notice a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each commit points to a parent.
This means the commit can be understood as building on something that came before it.</li>
  <li>Even though a commit is thought of as a <em>change</em>, or <em>difference</em> (also called a “delta”), it is stored by git as a standalone snapshot.
Any information about what change it represents is computed when needed, by comparing commits.</li>
  <li>Because objects are referred to by reference, any time an object already exists git just refers to the existing object.
So when your commit only changes one file, only one new blob object (and at least one tree object) needs to be created.</li>
  <li>Retrieving any object by its reference just means finding a file with a certain name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Objects are described in depth in the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">Git Internals</a> chapter of the free Pro Git Book.
I recommend it if you are curious, it’s where I learned this.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a closer look at the unique gibberish reference (“hash”).</p>

<h2 id="references-the-hash">References (the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hash</a>”)</h2>
<p>This section might be heavy, but keep going, it gets to the heart of many of git’s quirks.</p>

<p>In git, there are hashes everywhere, displayed as long strings of numbers and letters.
All objects have hashes, but you mostly see commit hashes, for example when you run <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log</code></a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://oyvn.github.io/assets/git-log.png" alt="git log" title="git log output."></p>
<p>git log output from this blog’s repo.</p>

<p>The hash is calculated from the contents of a given object, and is  completely unique to that object.
It’s often called the “sha” of the commit, because the hash is of the type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">sha1</a>.</p>

<p>A hash (or “digest”) is a big number which always a certain length.
For sha1, the length is 160 bits, or 20 bytes<sup id="fnref:sha1_finite"><a href="#fn:sha1_finite">3</a></sup>.
In git, these bytes are always displayed as a text string of 40 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> characters (0-9, a-f)<sup id="fnref:sha_length"><a href="#fn:sha_length">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The hash is created by taking the data (the input) and doing some convoluted math on it.
The input can be any data, of any length.
In git, objects serve as inputs.</p>

<p>The convoluted math is such that the hash follows some very strict rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The length of the hash is the same regardless of the length of the input.</li>
  <li>The hash is always the same every time if the input is the same.</li>
  <li>The hash is always <em>completely</em> different if the input is even <em>slightly</em> different, even if a single bit is changed, added or removed.</li>
  <li>Finding an input for a given hash (i.e. calculating the hash backwards) is impossible.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>sha1("a"):
    86f7e437faa5a7fce15d1ddcb9eaeaea377667b8
sha1("To die, to sleep - to sleep, perchance to dream - ay, there's the rub, for in this sleep of death what dreams may come"):
    0855319deffa58b0458c29edeaa8d6a120d44f35
sha1("to die, to sleep - to sleep, perchance to dream - ay, there's the rub, for in this sleep of death what dreams may come"):
    cab29b74b98c3ad638fe9c1abed72be40d69badc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some example SHA1 hashes.</p>

<p>From these rules, we can realize that if <em>any</em> data in an object changes, it is no longer the same object, because the reference will be completely different.
That includes if the time changes by just one second in a commit, or a file changes by just one byte, or if a folder name changes slightly.</p>

<p>It also means that the changes must propagate.
If a file changes, its reference changes, so the tree containing the reference changes, and the commit containing the tree changes.</p>

<p>Any commits descended from the commit must also change.
In fact, looking backwards in time, a commit hash uniquely identifies not just the commit, but also, through its parents and grandparents etc., the entire git history - every tree, blob, and commit - up until that commit. If any detail in any place in the history was different, the current commit would not be the same commit since its hash would be different.</p>

<p>Phew!</p>

<p>Ok. Time for a short story about something slightly different.</p>

<h2 id="intermission-index">Intermission: Index</h2>

<p>When creating a commit, you might want to limit the difference from the previous commit.
You’ll want to group changes in a logical way, to make the commit easier to describe, and to reason about later.</p>

<p>You might have done many changes, though, since the last commit.
Git helps in this situation by allowing you to “stage” changes before commiting them.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add"><code>git add</code></a> adds files to the “index” i.e. stages them, i.e. marks them as “to be committed”.</p>

<p>When you create the commit, only the staged files and folders receive new objects, the rest are stored as unchanged.</p>

<p>Git creates trees and blobs from the files as you stage them, so that <code>git commit</code> just needs to create a commit object which references the tree created for the index.</p>

<p>The index often confuses people, but at this point in the guide it might be interesting to realize the similarities between the index and a commit.</p>

<p>Now for the story.</p>

<p>I once mistakenly deleted a new file I had been working on, losing several hours of work since I hadn’t committed it (commit often, people!).
But I remembered that I had staged it at one point, so I knew a blob object was created.
I managed to search the files in my .git folder for a phrase present in the lost file, and I found the file.
The blob …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I got into a discussion about monads recently. On a search to find some resources to share, I realized that most essays explained them with type signatures and rules. A missing ingredient to grok them, I think, is to understand the intuition behind them. How could you end up <em>inventing</em> monads?</p><p>Okay, let’s try to build that intuition. We’ll avoid both types and category theory.</p><p>Say you have a few functions to get a user, a profile, and a display picture:</p><pre><code>function getUser(id) { 
  return USERS[id] 
}

function getProfile(user) { 
  return user.profile
}

function getDisplayPicture(profile) { 
  return profile.displayPicture
}</code></pre><p>Now, given an id, how would you get the profile picture?</p><p>You could write this: </p><pre><code>getDisplayPicture(getProfile(getUser(id)))</code></pre><p>Buut, this would throw an error: all these functions <em>could</em> return null. If <code>getUser</code> returned null for example, you would see: </p><pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'profile' of undefined</code></pre><p>To fix this, you may end up writing something like this:</p><pre><code>function getDisplayPictureFromId(id) { 
  const user = getUser(id)
  if (!user) return
  const profile = getProfile(user)
  if (!profile) return
  return getDisplayPicture(profile)
}</code></pre><p>But, this is getting pretty ugly. All these conditional returns distract from what you’re really trying to do. <strong>What if there was a way to get rid of these conditionals?</strong></p><p>So, that’s our challenge: let’s get rid of these conditionals. One way we can do this, is to make some kind of helper. This helper would let us chain these functions together: </p><pre><code>new Chainer(getUser(id))
  .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
  .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))</code></pre><p>This looks pretty good. Let’s implement it.</p><h2>whenExists</h2><p><code>.whenExists</code> would only run the callback if the value exists. Here’s how you could write this:</p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
}</code></pre><p>And voila, with just this, we can now write</p><pre><code>function getProfilePictureFromId(id) { 
  return new Chainer(getUser(id))
    .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
    .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))
}</code></pre><h2>More Problems</h2><p>Notice that <code>getDisplayPictureFromId</code> now returns a <code>Chainer</code>. </p><p>Imagine we had another function <code>resizeDisplayPicture</code>, that <em>also</em> returned a Chainer</p><pre><code>function resizeDisplayPicture(pic) { 
    return new Chainer(pic).whenExists(pic =&gt; ...
}</code></pre><p>What would happen, if we wrote:</p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id).whenExists(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))</code></pre><p>Let’s look at whenExists again:</p><pre><code>whenExists(f) { 
  if (!this.value) return this;
  return new Chainer(f(this.value))
}</code></pre><p>If <code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)</code> did exist, we would run </p><pre><code>new Chainer(f(this.value))</code></pre><p>which in this case is</p><pre><code>new Chainer(resizeDisplayPicture(this.value)) </code></pre><p>Which becomes </p><pre><code>new Chainer(new Chainer(this.value)...</code></pre><p><strong>Uh oh. We now have a Chainer inside of a Chainer.</strong> Ideally, we’d want a function that somehow “merged” these chainers together.</p><h2>whenExistsMerge</h2><p>So let’s do that. We can call it <code>whenExistsMerge</code></p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
  whenExistsMerge(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return f(this.value)
  }
}</code></pre><p>And with that, we can write </p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)
  .whenExistsMerge(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))
  .whenExists(resizedPic =&gt; ...)</code></pre><p><strong>Aand voila, you’ve just invented a specific type of monad.</strong> Kind of (1). Chainer is analogous to the <code>Maybe</code> monad. <code>whenExists</code> is analogous to its <code>fmap</code> operation, and <code>whenExistsMerge</code> is analogous to its <code>bind</code> operation. If you’re curious about the type-based technicalities now, <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank">see this essay</a>. </p><p>So, now we’ve found this cool <code>Chainer</code>. We can stop here, or think a bit further. What’s so special about it? </p><p>Well, it’s like a box that wraps around some information. We can interact with that box with  <code>whenExists</code> and <code>whenExistsMerge</code>.</p><p>How else can we use the idea of <code>box</code> and <code>whenExists?</code></p><p>Here’s one. Let’s say you were dealing with callback hell: </p><pre><code>fetchUser(id, (err, user) =&gt; {
  if (err) ... 
    fetchProfile(profile, (err, profile) =&gt; { 
      if (err) ...
        fetchDisplayPicture(...
    }
}</code></pre><p>What if we created something like an <code>Async Chainer</code>: it stores the result of some future computation. Then, you could use the <code>whenExists*</code> functions, which let you interact with the value <em>when</em> it is computed. We turn the callback hell into</p><pre><code> fetchUser(id).whenExistsMerge(fetchProfile).whenExistsMerge(fetchDisplayPicture)</code></pre><p>Well, replace <code>whenExistsMerge</code> with <code>then</code>, and you're on a road to discover <code>Promise</code>, which is also a monad. Kind of (2). </p><p>Now, it’s pretty cool to notice that both the nullable use case and the async use case have the same interface. The name <code>whenExists</code> may be a bit too specific. Really, what it does is give you an interface to <code>map</code> over the value. If you use the word <code>map</code>, <code>whenExistsMerge</code> really lets you <code>flatMap</code> over the value. </p><p>This begins to get us to the fundamental abstraction of a monad: a box, with an interface for <code>map</code>, and <code>flatMap</code>. As you look deeper, you’ll notice that this abstraction can handle a lot of other things. If you’re curious, research the <code>Result</code> monad for example.</p><p>And with that, you’ve invented monads : ) </p><h2>Aside: Do you <em>really</em> need this?</h2><p>As you went through this, you may have realized that there are other ways to solve the problems that monads solve. Instead of <code>Chainer</code>, your language could have a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#safe-calls" target="_blank">safe call</a> abstraction. Instead of <code>Promise</code>, your language could have an <code>async/await</code> abstraction. Sometimes those can be a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug" target="_blank">better choice</a>. Nevertheless, if your language doesn’t have those abstractions, you can use monads to solve them. And of course, like any powerful abstraction, you can invent new monads to simplify your business logic.</p><hr><p>(1) I cheated a bit with <code>Chainer</code>, by avoiding the subtypes <code>Just</code> and <code>Nothing</code>. This makes it so you can’t express something like <code>Just(null)</code>. Still, it gets at the essence : ) </p><p>(2) Likewise, <code>Promise</code> isn’t quite a monad, because it mixes both <code>flatMap</code> and <code>map</code> with <code>then</code>. This makes it so you can’t have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Res&gt;&gt;</code>. Again though, it gets at the essence</p><p><em>Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Safareli, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The term JAMStack is meant to define a technology stack that relies heavily on JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It also is meant to mean a whole lot more than that. In this article, we will explore how this concept is being expressed on the web.</p>
<p>
<span>J</span>avaScript<br>
<span>A</span>PIs<br>
<span>M</span>arkup<br>
<span>Stack</span><br>
</p><p>You may be thinking to yourself, JavaScript, microservices exposed via APIs, and of course markup make up most websites these days. How is JAMStack not just describing the web in 2020? When you google "JAMStack" you may see an ad for a <a href="https://jamstack.io/">portable electric apm</a>, but you will also see a result for <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack.org</a>. JAMStack.org is a nice resource that the folks over at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> have created in order to help codify a set of standards around an emerging trend in how websites can be built. Let's begin with the first definition listed on JAMStack.org</p>
<p>
        <span>“</span>
        Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.
    </p>

<p>This statement does not do a great job of picking apart the JAM in JAMStack but does do a good job of leading with some value propositions, techniques, and specific technologies that are hallmarks of JAMStack. Let's pick this apart 2005 style with a tag cloud.</p>
<p><span>Fast</span>
    <span>CDN</span>
    <span>Secure</span>
    <span>Pre-rendering</span>
    <span>No servers</span>
    <span>Sites</span>
    <span>Apps</span>
</p>

<p>I have given what I believe to be the proper weight to each of these key words that help make up JAMStack, but before we dig into them, let's start from the beginning of sorts. Here is <a href="https://simple-jamstack.netlify.app/">an exmaple of a JAMStack site</a>.</p>


<p>This site simply takes the last 5 movie picks from the <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview">NYTimes Movies API</a>, renders them and adds an ability to vote on which films seem interesting and uninteresting via the <a href="https://formcake.com/api">Formcake API</a>. You could build this project in any number of stacks, but what makes this a JAMStack site? You can follow along in more detail using the public <a href="https://github.com/Formcake/simple-jamstack">repo</a>. Below we will go into some of these key aspects around JAMStack in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="pre-rending">Pre-rending</h2>
<p>One of the most important and talked about aspects of JAMStack is that projects are depoyed as static builds. It is a bit of a debate within the community on whether something must be statically built and hosted to be JAMStack but most JAMStack specific tooling is built around the idea of static builds. For those who are unfamiliar with this term, a static build simply means that a site or app is entirely or partially generated as flat files for serving. Those flat files are then returned to the user upon request as opposed to a server rendering them. The project could also be decribed as "Pre-rendered" since some or all of the site has been build ahead of time. When a change occurs to the content of a JAMStack site, you must rebuild it and serve the new flat files. A slice of a review website's static file structure may look like the following.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Url</th>
<th>Static File</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>/</td>
<td>index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies</td>
<td>/movies/index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies/reviews</td>
<td>/movies/reviews/index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies/reviews/tenet</td>
<td>/movies/reviews/tenet/index.html</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<pre><code>
index.html
movies/
    index.html
    reviews/
        index.html
        tenet/
            index.html

</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Formcake/simple-jamstack">sample movie interest project</a> utilizes pre-rendering with the help of <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. Eleventy is a fantastic way to get started with static sites because it is extremely flexible and can grow with your project.</p>
<h2 id="no-servers">No Servers</h2>
<p>Like the term serverless, this is a bit of a misnomer. Of course JAMStack sites are served by a server. The preferred server stack however is one that is specifically designed to only deliver static files like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a>. There are many benefits to be gained from taking this approach. One of those is stability. When you choose a system like S3 to host your website, you are making many concessions. You have no control over the operating system, the software installed on the server, or even the choice of http server technology. The benefit however is that none of those are of any concern when you are doing something as simple as serving a static file. All of those decisions and layers of complexity are manged and run at enourmous levels at scale by AWS. This makes it very unlikely that your site will go down because those layers of complexity can be highly optimized when used for one purpose. The sample project does not use a custom server because it is hosted on Netlify. Netlify is designed around hosting static files and therefore is highly optimized for this purpose.</p>
<h2 id="cdn">CDN</h2>
<p>The next layer of hosting for a JAMStack site is the use of a CDN. A CDN, or content delivery network, is a way of storing snapshots of the pages of your website and distributing those around the world. When a user requests a page your CDN will deliver a cache or vesion of that page instead of your main server. The main benefit of a CDN is that it is the <strong>fastest</strong> way to deliver content and the most <strong>secure</strong> way as well. CDN's can obscure your main server from the world and help protect it from malicious traffic or activity. The sample project utilizes a CDN because it is hosted on Netlify and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/">Netlify uses a CDN</a> to deliver deployed content.</p>
<h2 id="apis">APIs</h2>
<p>You may think that most websites are run via APIs these days and so why point this out. For JAMStack the importance on APIs centers around the fact that by default a JAMStack project does not have a web server to ping for data since a static hosting server is the only implied server in the stack. Many sites and most apps however need a server of some kind to create interactivity and store / access data. In the JAMStack world, it is encouraged that you either find a service with an API that performs an aspect that a server would or create a microservice using lambdas to still be as "serverless" as possible. Hosting platforms like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> both support server like features using lambda functions. In the example application, I kept it simple and used Formcake's API to handle all server side features.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/nytimes-form.png" alt="Creating your token in Formcake"></p>
<p>Formcake allows a form submission through an ajax request and so it was easy to utilize this functionality to allow users to vote on movie picks.</p>
<pre><code>
axios.post('https://api.formcake.com/api/form/4e656bac-5c16-4d5d-be65-eb2928be0179/submission', {
    vote, 
    movieTitle
});

</code></pre>

<p>I could have gone to the trouble of creating a lambda based micro service for the voting mechanic but for simple projects it is far easier to use something off the shelf. This is also part of the JAMStack ethos in a way. It's all about what is possible when you fully decouple the front and backend.</p>
<h2 id="sites-and-apps">Sites and Apps?</h2>
<p>JAMStack.org mentions that JAMStack can be used for both websites and web applications. I agree with this sentiment but I also think that JAMStack is not perfectly suited for many types of applications. If you were to signup for <a href="https://formcake.com/pricing">Formcake's free plan</a> you would notice that most pages load like a server side rendered application. If you go to your /forms page, you will instantly be greeted with your forms. The same is true for an individual form detail page and your account page. This is because we utilize <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">server side rendering technology</a> in order to deliver our site. We feel this to be a requirement for a SaaS application in 2020 because we are beyond the days of having loading wheels for every component on a single page application. It is a bit of an argument in the JAMStack community on whether an SSR application is a JAMStack project. I don't necessarily care because we should all be choosing the best technology for our projects but I feel that it is worth pointing out. This distinction makes JAMStack better suited for static content or sites with light interactivity in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this explanation of JAMStack is helpful to those looking to explore it. It has never been easier to create a powerful website with the pricipals behind JAMStack thanks to hosting platforms like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and tools like <a href="https://formcake.com/">Formcake</a>. As always, if you feel that your project could benefit from JAMStack but does not quite meet the requirements, simply take from JAMStack what improves the project and leave behind what detracts from it. This is how we built Formcake and we are very pleased with the results.</p>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>You haven’t quite figured out HTTP2 yet that you’re already starting to get pissed off by people talking about HTTP3. But there’s a reason for that: HTTP3 is fast. I bet you in five minutes you’ll agree with me. </p>



<h3>Once upon a time</h3>



<p>I can’t tell you about the future without telling you about the present. <strong>Do you know about HTTP ?</strong> Defined in 1991, it’s the protocol that manages the web. It means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HyperText Transfer Protocol</a> and it allows you to fetch resources from a web page. </p>



<p>From a web server to your browser. It’s built on a lower level protocol –<strong>TCP: it’s going to be important-</strong> and it’s stateless. It means that each request is completely independent. Each GIF present on this page is a GIF proudly independent in its life on the internet. That’s good for him and his life as a GIF. But for us it’s a bit of a broken system.</p>



<p>Because the problem is that <strong>each request will only look for one file at a time</strong>. Each time an expensive TCP connection is created for the occasion. Imagine if you had 10,000 Internet tips on your page.</p>



<p> I know a lot of people absolutely loved my pattern making skills in the previous article. So, to explain the Internets to you properly, I’m doing it again.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iI0MrHF.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/iI0MrHF.jpg" alt="http"></figure></div>



<p>Despite the fact that a browser can make six different requests at the same time, HTTP is still slow and full of TCP connections. Plus, we developers, usualy don’t care about that. <strong>We like to put as much crap on our pages as possible. </strong>Big jQuery lib with 300 useless CSS stylesheets ending with a big transparent 8 mega PNG. </p>



<p>When Google saw all the crap we were doing everywhere <strong>they started talking about SPDY</strong> (it’s called speedy). The point? To speed up the Internets. </p>



<p>SPDY is a specification that proposes to use HTTP as is but with a change of rules. And by <strong>compressing headers, prioritizing requests and multiplexing</strong>, it will transform all TCP requests and connections into one! </p>



<p>Concretely, when your HTML is read, your browser looks at everything you’re going to ask in your page. Then, it’s getting everything all at once. <strong>This way you avoid doing it file by file.</strong> </p>



<p>The first draft of HTTP2 is SPDY based. Very quickly HTTP2 was adopted and life on the internet has become faster. <strong>Today <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-http2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">42.7% of the internet</a> use HTTP2.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2jePyHC.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/2jePyHC.jpg" alt="http2"></figure></div>



<h3>Great, what about HTTP3?</h3>



<p>If I piss you off with HTTP and HTTP2 when you explicitly clicked to see sexy HTTP3, there’s a good reason. HTTP2 was created by taking HTTP as a base and changing the rules.<strong> It’s the same thing with HTTP3. </strong>So by understanding the present it’s easier for me to explain the future to you.</p>



<p>Googlers are geeks, they never stop. After SPDY became HTTP2, they thought that it was still not fast enough. So they started talking about QUIC (it’s called Quick). <strong>This will be the second experimental technology developed by Google to become an official upgrade of the HTTP protocol</strong>. But what’s so special about this protocol?</p>



<p>The main big evolution of HTTP3 is the change of transport layer. No more of the heavy TCP connections I’ve been telling you about since the beginning. <strong>Now, it’s all about UDP. </strong></p>



<p>By the way QUIC means “Quick UDP Internet Connections”. This change of protocol will speed up connection establishment and data transfer times enormously. Howerver, <strong>UDP is certainly faster and simpler, but it doesn’t have the reliability and error handling of TCP.</strong></p>



<p>TCP has to make several round trips just to establish a connection in a square and stable way. <strong>Where UDP doesn’t give a damn and does it really fast without stability and risk of lost packets. </strong>However UDP can dramatically reduce latency in requests. Up to almost zero latency in repeated connections to the same server because no roundtrip is made to establish connections.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hDmNkpS.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/hDmNkpS.png" alt="http3"></figure>



<p>HTTP3 is the multiplexing and compression features of HTTP2 with a protocol change from TCP to UDP. The Google guys then added their layer in the protocol to guarantee stability, order in the reception of packets and of course security. </p>



<p><strong>So HTTP3 uses UDP for its high speed while keeping the stability of QUIC</strong>, without forgetting the security of TLS. Because yes, in QUIC you find TLS 1.3 which allows you to make your beautiful SSL. I’ve been talking about layers for a while, this is what it looks like under the hood.</p>

<p>In 2018, QUIC became HTTP3. The Internet Enginerring Task Force dudes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVf_yyMfIPQ&amp;t=4956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>dudes in shorts who decide on Internet protocols</strong></a>, have agreed. And that’s great news because the Internets will never be fast enough for us, impatient people.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>HTTP3 is the sexy future with a HTTP base that has been tuned to the maximum by google geeks. At the time of writing, <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-quic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 4.6% of the Internet uses HTTP3</a> but this figure is likely to grow in the coming years. We stayed on the surface today, but there are a lot of deep-dive articles everywhere that I invite you to consult if you’re more curious.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By Leib Litman, PhD, Zohn Rosen, PhD, Cheskie Rosenzweig, MS, Aaron Moss, PhD, Adam Dietrich, &amp; Jonathan Robinson, PhD</strong></p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Lately, there’s been considerable debate over the accuracy of presidential polls. While recent polls show Joe Biden ahead,&nbsp;a number of pundits speculate that some Donald Trump supporters may be hesitant to share their true opinions when polled by phone. That hypothesis is gaining traction, leading some to argue that Trump may be leading despite what the latest numbers show. It’s also being fueled by the belief that 2020 will be a repeat of the 2016 election, when Trump polled poorly in advance of the election, but still went on to win the Electoral College vote.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the current debate on whether there are segments of Trump (or Biden) backers reticent to express their true opinions in phone polls, there’s been little empirical investigation into if the phenomenon actually exists. Pundits on major broadcast and cable news networks, such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/does-a-shy-trump-voter-exist-arnon-mishkin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/09/politics/trump-voters-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>, continue to speculate on the potential impact of so-called “shy Trump voters” on the outcome of the November presidential election result.&nbsp; In a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/us/politics/trump-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> published in <em>The New York Times</em>, David Winston says the following:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“The idea that people lie, it’s an interesting theory, and it’s not like it’s completely off-the-wall. But it’s obviously a very complicated thing to try to prove because what do you do? Ask them, ‘Are you lying?’”</em></p><p>On its face, a poll that asks people whether they lie in phone polls may not make much&nbsp;sense. After all, why would a person who lies in a telephone poll tell the truth about that in a different online poll? We here at CloudResearch reasoned that the issue may be methodological.</p><p>To explore this issue, we structured our survey to overcome shortcomings of previous polls. Instead of simply asking voters whom they will vote for — and then ask whether they just lied — we centered our research around a general question: “Are you comfortable in truthfully disclosing the presidential candidate you intend to vote for in a telephone poll?” Our rationale for this approach was that there’s a major difference between admitting you just lied and admitting to being genuinely concerned about disclosing your preferred candidate.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, we expected to find very few “shy voters.” After all, telephone surveys are supposed to be anonymous, so why would people be reluctant to share their opinions? However, to the extent people said that they were reluctant to express their voting preferences on a telephone poll, we were interested in their rationale for their reluctance. As a result, we included open-ended follow-up questions to better understand the factors that drive voters to fudge their responses.</p><hr><h2><strong>What CloudResearch Found</strong></h2><ul><li>11.7% of Republicans say they would not report their true opinions about their preferred presidential candidate on telephone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>In contrast, just 5.4% of Democrats say they’d be reluctant to share their true voting intentions — roughly half the number of Republicans reluctant to tell the truth on phone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>10.5% of Independents fell into the “shy voter” category, just a percentage point lower than how Republicans react to phone polls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>After asking about people expressing their true opinions on telephone calls, we then inquired about their preferred candidate. This ordering was important as we did not want to fall into the same trap as other pollsters who tend to lead with preference declarations. When we broke the responses down based on current Trump vs Biden supporters, we found the following:</p><ul><li>10.1% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys — double the number of Biden supporters (5.1%) reticent to share their true intentions.</li></ul><p>When respondents indicated that they were untruthful during polls, we followed up to confirm those responses, and then inquired as to why “shy voters” are concerned about sharing their voting intentions. Some example responses are below. These are just a representational sampling of viewpoints that we collected — sentiments not easy to gauge by responses to mere yes/no questions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I don’t believe the information would be confidential and I think it’s dangerous to express an opinion outside of the current liberal viewpoint.”</em></p><p><em>“Well I probably wouldn’t give my opinion period, but if pushed, I would not give my real opinion for fear of reprisal if someone found out.”</em></p><p><em>“Because most polls released to the public are slanted and aren’t scientifically based. So, they are messing with the results of the survey from the beginning by knocking down one party or the other. I’m just trying to right the ship.”</em></p><p><em>“I am hounded day and evening by phone solicitors.&nbsp; They interrupt me all the time; sometimes my irritation takes over, and I don’t answer correctly.”</em></p><p><em>“My answers could be recorded so I don’t really trust such phone conversations.”</em></p><p><em>“I do not discuss politics — let alone with a total stranger on the telephone.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t always trust phone call surveys. I wouldn’t want to be bombarded with phone calls and political mail.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t want my opinion associated with my phone number.”</em></p><p><em>“I am less anonymous, and somewhat ashamed of my opinion as it is frowned upon.”</em></p><hr><h2>In General, “Shy Voters” Cited Six Concerns:&nbsp;</h2><p>1. A lack of trust in phone polls as truly being anonymous.&nbsp;</p><p>2. An apprehension to associate their phone numbers with recorded responses.</p><p>3. Fear that their responses will become public in some manner.</p><p>4. Fear of reprisal and related detrimental impact to their financial, social, and family lives should their political opinions become publicly known.&nbsp;</p><p>5. A general dislike of phone polls.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Malicious intent to mislead polls due to general distrust of media and political pundits (though a sentiment expressed only by a few “shy voters”).&nbsp;</p><p>Such concerns were more often than not expressed by Republicans and Independents, and also by those who said they would vote for Donald Trump. Democrats and Biden supporters lagged both groups in terms of being concerned that their voting intentions would be shared with others.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our survey findings — that show a greater reluctance on the part of Republicans, Independents and Trump voters to disclose their opinions — should not be interpreted as outright lying. Rather, such reluctance seems to stem from a&nbsp; lack of trust in the anonymity of polls and a fear of the consequences if their opinions were to become public.&nbsp;</p><p>The results could have implications in terms of the true accuracy of phone polls; if Republicans, Independents and supporters of Donald Trump (regardless of party affiliation) are less likely to participate in polls or accurately disclose the candidate they support, that inherently generates biased poll outcomes.</p><p>Given razor thin-margins in the swing states, such bias may have important consequences, although more research is required to fully understand the potential magnitude of this effect. We intend to examine the magnitude of “shy-voter bias” in specific states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>The results of our survey also illustrate the primary concerns that pollsters may need to address to allay voters about the level of anonymity and privacy of phone polling. We’ll also examine these issues and potential remedies in future research.</p><hr><h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2><h3><strong>Sample&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Interviews were collected from two national online sample waves of 1,000 registered voters (2000 respondents in total), matched to U.S. Census data on gender, age, race, and region. Data were collected August 19 – 27, 2020&nbsp;using&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudresearch.com%2Fproducts%2Fprime-panels%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener">CloudResearch’s Prime Panels</a>, a platform that incorporates data quality checks in sample recruitment and sources participants from an aggregate of market research panels (<a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.3758%2Fs13428-019-01273-7" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chandler et al., 2019</a>). The two waves differed from each other in terms of how quotas were set. In the first sample, the full sample was matched to the U.S. Census and the sample was equally split between Republicans, Democrats and Independents. In the second wave, rather than matching the entire sample to the U.S. Census, each political party was matched to the demographic quotas appropriate for that party. The results presented above are for the first wave of participants, although the overall findings were similar across both waves. Specifically, in Wave 2, 10.5% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys compared to 4.6% of Biden supporters.</p><h3><strong>Survey Design&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Prior to entering the survey, all respondents were screened for attentiveness and English language comprehension. Following the screening process a <em>responsive verification protocol</em> was used, consisting of multiple interactive interview steps. Step 1 – Respondents were first asked one of two randomly assigned questions: Q1 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked in an automated telephone poll (also called “Interactive Voice Response” or “IVR”), would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. Q2 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked by a telephone interviewer, would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. We also wanted to compare how comfortable respondents are in responding to telephone polls, compared to online and in-person polls. We therefore also asked the same question about phone interviews, online surveys, and in-person polls, presented next to each other in the same grid. The response options to all questions were: 1. “I would definitely express my true opinion”, 2. “I would probably express my true opinion”, 3. “I would probably not express my true opinion” and 4. “I would definitely not express my true opinion”.</p><p>Step 2 – For those who indicated that they would not provide their true opinion on either question from Step 1 (i.e. responded with options 3 or 4), a follow-up question was asked: “On a previous question, you indicated that you …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Whenever someone sees my editor, this is always the first thing they ask
about.</p>

<p>Vim (and Emacs) have features that let you conceal text with other text.
The actual source text is not modified. If you put your cursor on the
concealed line, the conceal goes away.</p>

<p>This is best illustrated by example. Here’s what the Python code
normally looks like:</p>

<pre><code>identity = lambda x: x
</code></pre>

<p>But here’s what I see:</p>

<pre><code>identity = λ x: x
</code></pre>

<p>It’s really easy to abuse since no one has to view it but you, unlike
code formatting. I ended up creating an entire mini-language, consistent
across multiple programming languages.</p>

<p>The running examples throughout this blog post will be Python and Rust,
because I’ve used those recently. Haskell is another language that
benefits a lot from this.</p>

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets
it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect
increases the mental power of the race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we start by unifying the building blocks of every language with
prettier Unicode versions.</p>

<pre><code>==          | ≝
!=          | ≠
&lt;=          | ≤
&gt;=          | ≥

and, &amp;&amp;     | ∧
or, ||      | ∨
not, !      | ¬

None        | ∅
true, false | ⊤, ⊥ (top and bottom from logic)

for         | ∀
in          | ∈
not in      | ∉

=           | ← (to remind me that equality is really assignment)
-&gt;          | → (that's an arrow replaced by a better arrow)

assert      | ‼
</code></pre>

<p>Types are concealed with their math symbols</p>

<pre><code>bool        | 𝔹
char        | ∁
string, str | 𝐒

unsigned    | ℕ
int         | ℤ
float       | ℝ
complex     | ℂ

vector      | V
tensor      | 𝕋
</code></pre>

<p>This is nice because it makes reading code uniform across languages.
Basic constructs like <code>for .. in ..</code> read like math.</p>

<h2 id="idiosyncratic">Idiosyncratic</h2>

<p>Most of this category is for making ugly syntax bearable.</p>

<p>I read a lot of scientific code and Greek letters as variable names
abound.</p>

<p>So I concealed the entire Greek alphabet, lower and uppercase.</p>

<p>I also don’t like looking at <code>::</code> in C++ and Rust. Conceptually, it’s
like a dot operator for the purposes of reading code, so I conceal it
with <code>.</code>.</p>

<p>I also don’t like looking at semicolons, and my linter will tell me if I
missed them, so they get concealed with <code>𐤟</code> (which is apparently a
Phoenician word separator. It should look like a very faint dot, but may
not render correctly in the browser. You can see I’ve scoured a lot of
glyphs for this).</p>

<p>I hate the use of <code>self</code> in Python, so I concealed it with <code>♀</code>, the
female sign emoji. It looks like a little person (a little <em>self</em>), and
is a single character.</p>

<p>If I’m going to see a word a lot in a lot of contexts, it’s probably
going to end up concealed.</p>

<h3 id="grammar-of-control-flow">Grammar of control flow</h3>

<p>I have a system for conditionals and looping.</p>

<pre><code>loop              | ∞ (`loop` is just `while True`)
while             | ⥁
continue          | ↻

match, if         | ▸
elif              | ▹
else              | ▪

break             | ◁
return            | ◀


def, fn, function | ※ (Japanese typography reference marker)
class             | §
</code></pre>

<p>The infinity and ouroboros symbols for <code>loop</code> and <code>while</code> feel
intuitive.</p>

<p>The rest, not so much. I worked up this system late at night.</p>

<p><code>continue</code> is a loop because it doesn’t break out of the loop (that’s
why it loops clockwise since I always imagine looping going clockwise).
It’s a broken ouroboros because it cuts off the current iteration.</p>

<p>The conditionals always start with an <code>if</code>, which is filled in, and just
gets a pointer to indicate, “hey look at this condition”. Conditions
have to end with an <code>if</code> or an <code>else</code>, but not an <code>elif</code>, so <code>elif</code> gets
an empty pointer. <code>else</code> is indicated by the mathematical “end of proof”
symbol, since the <code>else</code> ends the conditional. In this way, a
conditional is only valid if it begins and ends with solid markers.</p>

<p><code>return</code> takes you out of a function’s scope, and I think of going in
scope as going rightwards, so <code>return</code> points left. Plus the right
pointer was taken by <code>if</code>. <code>break</code> is similar but may not take you out
of <em>all</em> scopes, just the innermost loop enclosing it.</p>

<p>I think the <code>function</code> conceal is pretty clear. The <code>class</code> conceal is
because I think of classes like I think of sections in an essay, so they
get a section marker.</p>

<h2 id="really-idiosyncratic">Really Idiosyncratic</h2>

<p>AKA mathy.</p>

<pre><code>range  | ι
unsafe | ☡

struct | ∏
enum   | ∐
</code></pre>

<p>The iota is because that’s the one bit of APL I know.</p>

<p><code>unsafe</code> comes from the “dangerous bend” symbol that Bourbaki used to
indicate a tricky section in their books. That concession to
user-friendliness ironically concealed a dangerous bend. Which was the
fact that Bourbaki books don’t care about anyone being able to read
them.</p>

<p><code>struct</code> and <code>enum</code> are product and sum (AKA coproduct) types, so they
get the corresponding symbols from category theory.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>It lets me <em>feel</em> my code rather than read it. It makes seeing the
<em>shape</em> of code easier at first pass, and I can see the forest for the
trees somewhat better. But then I have to hunker down and edit it.</p>

<h2 id="important">Important</h2>

<pre><code>function! ToggleConcealLevel()
    if &amp;conceallevel == 0
        setlocal conceallevel=2
    else
        setlocal conceallevel=0
    endif
endfunction

nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;C-c&gt;&lt;C-y&gt; :call ToggleConcealLevel()&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That toggles the conceal. Now other people can read over your shoulder.
It’ll also spare you explanations of how you got the <code>for</code> to look like
it does in math.</p>

<h2 id="screenshot">Screenshot</h2>

<p>(Since so many of you asked)</p>

<p>In April 2012, three college juniors — Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla — waited anxiously on the campus of Prince Sultan University in Riyadh. For the previous six months, their lives had been consumed by the pursuit of a single, radical idea: frustrated that women, year after year, were barred from the annual Gamers’ Day convention, <a href="http://gamersday.com/en/about-us.php#:~:text=Gamers'%20Day%20is%20a%20gaming,numbers%20of%20visitors%20and%20exhibitors">the largest annual gaming convention in Saudi Arabia</a>, they had decided to launch the first-ever gamers’ convention for women in the kingdom. As the organizers hurried around counting consoles and hanging posters near stalls, they wondered whether anyone would show up.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia’s gaming scene has dramatically evolved, especially for women. In the early 2000s, the country had strict moral regulations on entertainment, and games were mostly sold in a gray market or through unofficial channels. Areej, a 23-year-old university graduate, picked up her interest in gaming from her father, who once frequented the informal neighborhood stores that sold pirated copies of popular games for 10 riyals ($2). “He played Japanese and English games, even though he didn’t even understand English back then,” she recalled. “He would keep dictionaries around while playing. That’s actually how he learned the language.” Areej hopes to become a “localizer,” a job that entails translating English-language games into Arabic. A decade ago, this wouldn’t have been possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Sony’s 2007 release of the PlayStation 3 in the kingdom, the gaming industry began to take shape in Saudi Arabia. The first <a href="https://www.gamersday.com/en/">Gamers’ Day</a> took place in 2008, and it now draws upward of 60,000 male visitors over the course of four days. The convention presents video game companies with a lucrative opportunity to demo their latest equipment and products; devoted players, in turn, get to try out highly anticipated games that have not yet been released. In 2012, as the three girls were setting up Girls Con (or GCON as it would come to be known), the industry was estimated to have a global revenue stream of $70 billion.</p>



<p>In the months prior to GCON, Tasnim, the only one in the group with work experience, took the lead pitching sponsorship proposals to the all-male staffs at Nintendo and PlayStation Arabia. Without any real data on female gamers in the Middle East, and with barely any on girl gamers in North America, she had pitched on the assumption that the <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/male-and-female-gamers-how-their-similarities-and-differences-shape-the-games-market/">gender ratio for gamers in Saudi Arabia</a> was likely the same as in the United States: 47%. But there was no way to prove this. Until then, the world of female gaming in Saudi Arabia was a private one, usually set in the intimacy of people’s bedrooms.</p>



<p>“You could find girls who played video games, just for fun or on their mobile phone, but I had no idea how many girls were into hardcore gaming,” Felwa said. While mobile games like Angry Birds and Candy Crush were popular — the Kingdom boasts a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/xe/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/GMCS-whitepaper.pdf">90% cell phone penetration rate</a> — Felwa was curious to see how many girls had grown up like her playing Tomb Raider, Tekken, and League of Legends.</p>



<p>When the hall flooded with nearly 3,000 women, some as young as 13 and others in their 50s, it was a shock. “I definitely did not expect moms to come,” Felwa said. Back then, it was mandatory for women to wear the traditional black abaya, and often a headscarf, while in public. It was only when the women walked through the doors into the all-female space that their abayas slipped off to reveal an array of cosplay costumes.</p>



<p>Inside the hallway, girls who were expected to behave discreetly at all times rushed around trying to play as many PlayStation- and Nintendo-sponsored games as they could. On one side of the hall, first-time cosplayers shared a rare opportunity to express their fandom. On the other, 150 people stood in a rowdy line waiting their turn in a Call of Duty tournament.</p>

<p><strong>While the Middle</strong> <strong>East</strong> represents only a small portion of the international gaming industry, it is a rapidly expanding market. In 2017, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council accounted for around $693 million of gaming revenue, most related to esports. By 2021, that number is expected to exceed <a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/m1/en/press-releases/2020/gcc-gaming-market.html">$821 million</a>, boosted in part by the pandemic-induced lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia expects to be at the forefront<strong> </strong>of that expansion. In a country where roughly 50% of the population is under 30, gaming has become an emblem for a generation of young Saudis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, Prince Faisal bin Bandar, a young member of the royal family raised on Atari consoles, set out to make Saudi Arabia the Middle East’s hub for the $160 billion gaming industry. Under his leadership, the<strong> </strong><a href="https://safeis.sa/">Saudi Arabian Federation for Electronic and Intellectual Sports (SAFEIS)</a> aims for esports revenue to amount to 1% of the country’s GDP (approximately $22 billion) by 2030.</p>



<p>While Saudi Arabia was a late arrival to esports, its male players have already made their mark. Since 2017, Prince Faisal and the federation have been scouting, coaching, and sending professional esports players to competitions across the world. Mossad Al-Dossary, then 18, made headlines in 2018 after <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/news/msdossary-triumphs-fifa-eworld-cup-grand-final-london">winning first place</a> at the FIFA eWorld Cup in London, taking home a $250,000 cash prize.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Female gamers, however, are still finding their way. Women in Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla’s generation grew up under the watch of religious police, in a time when public spaces were segregated by gender. While women still do not have the same rights as men, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman<strong> </strong>has relaxed male-guardianship rules and mandatory dress codes and legalized certain forms of entertainment for women. “I still struggle to convey what Saudi Arabia was like at that time to those that haven’t had that experience,” Tess said. There were no theaters, and sports facilities for girls were limited, “So, mostly, we had to stay inside and make do with what we had — and games were all that we had.”</p>



<p>Raghad, 23, currently works for a mining company, but she dreams of becoming a voice actor for video games. Although she’s never lived anywhere but Saudi Arabia, she has a distinctly squeaky American accent — a curious trait she picked up from a fifth-grade teacher who had lived in the U.S. and a torrent of YouTube videos. She is considering taking voice-acting classes online, assuming she can find any, because she’s not allowed to travel abroad alone to study until after she’s married. It’s still common to meet women who come to gaming as a result of these kinds of restrictions, as Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla did years ago. This is why going to GCON can be such a powerful experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In 2018, Felwa,</strong> Tasnim, and Najla handed GCON over to Ghada Al-Moqbel, who attended her first GCON in 2013 at the age of 18. Now she leads Saudi Arabia’s women’s gaming community. This occurred right after bin Salman took control and began dismantling the country’s gender segregation. For Ghada and the wider community of female gamers, these changes forced them to decide whether they wanted to stay on the fringes of the gaming community or take a more central role. In 2018, GCON organizers met regularly to discuss whether there was still value in creating an exclusively female space for gaming.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We had to stay inside and make do with what we had — and games were all that we had.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>For Ghada, the answer was yes. While attitudes toward female gamers have improved, parts of Saudi society remain uncomfortable with this burgeoning culture. When GCON first launched, participants were criticized for indulging in supposedly immoral behavior, and social media accounts of female gamers were routinely hacked. Likewise, after the first Comic Con in Jeddah, in 2017, a<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86_%D8%AD%D9%81%D9%84_%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%A8%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%87?src=hashtag_click"> hashtag</a> accusing participants of being Satan worshippers flooded social media along with pictures of women who had dressed up for cosplay. Thanks in part to the continuing fear of societal backlash, many Saudi women still advocate for all-female events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But like the kingdom, GCON is also evolving. “We’re not just entertainment anymore,” Ghada said. “It’s about empowering and enabling women to be serious in the gaming and esports industry.” In mid-August, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, the largest women-only university in the world, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1718151/saudi-arabia">announced</a> that it would be creating a degree program for animation.</p>



<p>Since Ghada took over, the organization has expanded, hosting regular skill-development workshops as well as the annual convention. While she has maintained GCON’s focus on female gamers, she has been open to collaborating with their male peers. In 2017, organizers from Gamer’s Day worked with GCON to arrange their first mixed-gender gaming event. While 2020 was supposed to be a big year for Ghada and GCON, Covid-19 disrupted their plans. Nonetheless, it’s unlikely that GCON — a force that arose in far more challenging terrain — will be going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with central banks’ ability to create money out of thin air. A central bank has access to physical printing presses which can produce physical banknotes, and it has the corresponding ability to create electronic money. However, central banks are not the only entities which create money. Money is also created by regular banks, such as retail banks and commercial banks, in the process of making loans.</p>
<p>Many people believe that regular banks’ ability to create money is similar to central banks’ ability to create money. It is not. This misconception has been perpetuated by a powerful cast of characters which includes <a href="https://www.hs.fi/tiede/art-2000002869261.html" target="_blank">mainstream news outlets</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070" target="_blank">some economists</a>.</p>
<p>This article will demystify money creation by illustrating the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bank deposit is merely an IOU.</li>
<li>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs.</li>
<li>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air.</li>
<li>When a customer redeems an IOU at a bank, the bank typically needs to hand over another form of money — the kind that it cannot create out of thin air.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bank deposits are merely IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 in cash. You decide to deposit it at your local bank. Now you no longer have $100 in cash. Instead, you have a <em>promise</em> from the bank that you can withdraw $100 in cash at any time. The bank has $100 in cash and you have a promise. Let’s imagine this promise as a physical document acknowledging debt, an IOU (”I owe you”). The bank owes you $100 and promises that you can exchange this IOU to $100 cash at any time.</p>

<p>Is this IOU ”money”? We’ll get to that later, but the short answer is yes, that IOU is money. There are different types of money, and checking account deposits are usually considered to be a type of money.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this bank deposit as an exchange:</p>

<p>Assets are things the bank <em>owns</em>, liabilities are things the bank <em>owes</em>. In this simplified example, the only asset that the bank has is the $100 in cash that you deposited — now considered to be the <em>bank’s</em> asset — and the only liability is the $100 debt that the bank owes to you. These accounting entries were created at the same time: when the bank incremented your checking account by $100 (the deposit liability in bank’s accounting), there was a corresponding $100 cash deposit (the cash asset in bank’s accounting).</p>
<p><strong>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Let’s continue with the example where you deposited $100 to a bank. Suppose I will go into that bank and ask for a $10 loan. Now that the bank owns $100, it can easily afford to loan me $10. I promise to pay back $11 at a later point in time, so the bank is eager to offer me a loan and make that dollar.</p>
<p>The bank deposits this $10 loan to my checking account. Remember, checking account deposits are IOUs, so the bank just gave me a $10 IOU. I promised to pay back $11, so I also created an IOU. In other words, this loan is an exchange of 2 IOUs: the bank promises to give me $10 in cash whenever I want, and I promise to give the bank $11 at a later point in time. Let’s imagine these IOUs as physical documents:</p>

<p>The bank still has that $100 cash in assets, and it still has that $100 liability to John. But now the bank also has a $10 liability to me: I could withdraw my $10 from the bank in cash at any time. Corresponding to this liability, the bank has recorded a new asset: my promise to pay back $11 later.</p>
<p>Notice how the bank now has $110 of deposits, but only $100 of cash in the vault. Welcome to fractional reserve banking! If I decided to withdraw my $10 from the bank today, and you decided to withdraw your $100 from the bank tomorrow, the bank would say ”oops, we no longer have your money”. In practice this rarely happens due to a myriad of reasons (banks can trade assets between each other when they have too little/too much cash, banks have internal risk controls which limit lending and other risky endeavours, lawmakers impose restrictions which are monitored by regulators, the existence of deposit insurance reduces likelihood of bank runs, etc.).</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s get to the interesting bit. Before taking out the loan there was $100 on checking account balances and afterwards there was $110 on checking account balances. Clearly, money was created in the process of taking out the loan. Where did this money come from? Was it created out of thin air? The short answer is yes, kind of, but let’s step back a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>What is money, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the cash deposit example. You deposit $100 into a bank and the bank records it as an asset. The bank records a corresponding liability: a $100 deposit to your checking account. Did the bank create money in this scenario?</p>
<p>Before the deposit there was $100 of cash money, but after the deposit there was $100 of cash money + $100 of electronic money = $200 worth of money in total. But of course we don’t want to ”double count” your money just because you deposited it in a bank, right? That’s why economists developed this convention that cash money in a bank’s vault is considered to be ”out of circulation”, and thus, is not typically counted when we count how much money exists.</p>

<p>The Eurozone M1 definition for money is <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money_credit_banking/monetary_aggregates/html/hist_content.en.html" target="_blank">basically</a> equal to this notion of ”currency in circulation”. The concept of money is ambiguous, so there are many different definitions, varying by both economic area and by use case. Nevertheless, checking account balances are included in most commonly used definitions (though not in all, for instance the UK M0 definition for money <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m0-data" target="_blank">does not</a> include checking account balances).</p>
<p>In abstract terms we might think that the $100 cash you deposited into a bank was transformed into a $100 checking account balance. Except it wasn’t. That $100 of cash money still exists. It was not transformed into anything. The bank took $100 of cash and put it in a vault. Then the bank created an IOU out of thin air and gave it to you. (We can say that the IOU was created out of thin air, because the corresponding $100 cash in the vault is not earmarked to this IOU — the bank may run out of cash before you try to redeem that IOU.) Then economists decided that the IOU counts as money, and the cash in the vault does not count as money. Thus, the act of depositing cash in a bank does not result in (net) creation of money. $100 of electronic money is added to circulation while $100 of cash money is removed from circulation, for a net difference of $0.</p>
<p>When you deposit cash in a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. Similarly, when you take a loan out of a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. However, due to accounting conventions, the latter action results in net money creation, while the former action does not. (Although these conventions are weird, they make sense: currency in circulation is a good measure with real implications for economic activity, and currency in circulation is genuinely increased when banks loan money.)</p>
<p><strong>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air</strong></p>
<p>If there’s only one thing you take away from this article, let it be this. IOUs are promises. Anyone can make promises out of thin air. For example, I could be handing out IOUs like this, furbished with my signature for authenticity:</p>

<p>You might think these would be worthless, but that’s not exactly the case. People who know me would think ”Atte is good for $10”. These would not be worth exactly $10, because you would still rather take $10 in cash than a coupon that’s exchangeable for $10 in cash. And it’s unlikely that these IOUs would be used to facilitate real economic activity, so these IOUs should not be considered ”money”. Although there are clear differences in how these IOUs <em>would be used</em>, compared to the IOUs created by banks, is there any <em>fundamental</em> difference between the IOUs themselves?</p>
<p>Let’s take another example and get one step closer to creating money. This one is real, not hypothetical, example of IOUs created by a non-bank corporation.</p>
<p>We have to go all the way back to 2011. Poker is booming and Full Tilt Poker is one of 2 giants dominating the scene (the other being PokerStars). The way that poker sites work is you deposit money (like you would in a bank) and then as you play poker and you win and lose money from other players, the poker site keeps track of how much money everyone has (like a bank would keep track of transfers between customers of the same bank).</p>
<p>In other words, a poker site issues IOUs to players. These IOUs are supposedly redeemable at any time (like the IOUs created by a bank). The IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were largely treated as money by players of the site, to the point where they were used to facilitate real economic activity. For example, it was typical for players to settle small debts (like $10 for a movie ticket) by sending a player-to-player transfer on Full Tilt Poker instead of sending a bank transfer (because transfers on poker sites were typically faster and easier to make than bank transfers).</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were money. They simply were not counted as money due to accounting conventions. Now, some of you might be thinking <em>”Wait a minute… Doesn’t the poker site have all player funds in the bank? If all player funds have corresponding bank deposits, then those bank deposits would already be counted as money, and we wouldn’t want to double count that money.”</em> Yeah, I also thought that Full Tilt Poker had player funds in the bank (can you guess where this is going?).</p>
<p>On April 15, 2011, known in the poker world as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg" target="_blank">Black Friday</a>, the FBI raided offices of Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars as part of a larger crackdown on online gambling. This law enforcement action triggered an instant bank run by players: everyone …</p></div></div></div>

        <p>It’s common to talk about the way we build software in terms of the individual tools we compose together, like command-line utilities and deployment pipelines and containers and services, and most obviously, <em>programming languages</em>. Programming languages seem to get the highest level of scrutiny out of everything that comprises the way we write software. And in the last decade, I think we’ve seen a healthy rejuvenation of innovation in programming languages, driven by languages like Rust, Go, OCaml, Zig, and Swift that bring new ideas to the industrial programming world in practical packages.</p>
<p>But while programming languages are academically interesting, I think <strong>we more desperately need innovation in programming <em>environments</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The programming <em>environment</em> isn’t a single component of our workflow, but the total sum enabled by the tools working together harmoniously. The environment contains the programming language, but also includes the debugging experience, dependency management, how we communicate with other developers (both within source code and without), how we trace and observe code in production, and everything else in the process of designing APIs to recovering from failure.</p>
<p>The story of programming language evolution is also a story of rising ideas in what capabilities good programming <em>environments</em> should grant developers. Many languages came to popularity not necessarily based on their merits as great languages, but because they were paired with some new and powerful capability to understand software and write better implementations of it.</p>
<p>C brought practical portability to (what was at the time) high level programs. C literally elevated the programming environment out of processor-specific assembly code into a common vernacular. The legacy is so strong that most languages we use in production today are either direct descendants of C, or inherit much of their syntax, like curly brace-delineated blocks and structures, semicolon statement-terminators, and parenthesized function calls.</p>
<p>JavaScript is popular outside of the browser almost entirely on the merit of its ecosystem, its tooling, and the trivial debugging experience enabled by the repl. JavaScript’s programming environment is entirely interactive, visual, and real-time, without the need for clunky debugging apparatuses. The impact of that interactivity is obvious in the fact that many of my developer friends started programming on the Web, explicitly because it was the easiest way to write programs that produced output we could see and share.</p>
<p>One of Go’s claims to fame and primary design goals is compilation speed. Compared to its predecessor C++, Go compiles fast. And when you make something fast, people start to use it differently.</p>
<p>Erlang, with its <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">advanced, concurrent, message-passing runtime</a>, offers a better way to build high availability, highly reliable systems. It was born in the telecom industry, but has found home in many other critical services industries.</p>
<p>Thoughtfully crafted programming environments are the hidden treasures of the software industry. When we choose a language because of the “tooling” or because of the “IDE experience” or because of “the workflow,” what we are really doing is making a judgement about the programming <em>environment</em> we want to live in and grow around our work.</p>
<p>Between investments being made into new languages and the community’s willingness to experiment, there’s a lot of creative energy being poured into inventing better languages. I think it would serve us well if we invested just as deeply into rethinking the context in which we write those programs. We should be asking questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>While professional photo editors and video games can run in the browser, why are we still using a repl that prints lines in the terminal?</li>
<li>Does the compile-time / run-time distinction make sense to have? Can we give better control to developers about when their code is executed during the software development and deployment process?</li>
<li>What does an operating system kernel designed for debugging experience look like?</li>
<li>What does a memory model or memory allocator designed for debugging experience look like?</li>
<li>Are the tools we have today good enough foundations for massive open-source communities like NPM? How can we improve the programming environment and our tools to make the most of package repositories with hundreds of millions of libraries and billions of lines of code?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some people trying to create better programming environments. <a href="https://repl.it/">Repl.it</a> brings general purpose development to the browser. Experiments like <a href="http://lighttable.com/">Light Table</a> more closely integrate source code with its output. Jupyter notebooks are a unique way of writing and sharing code that focus on the process of iteration.</p>
<p>But these are also workflows and tools built around languages that were never designed for such interactive experiences. I think if we build a culture of thinking about programming environments as a place ripe for creative innovation, we’ll see a new class of software development tools emerge that make the most of today’s machines and networks and allow us to write new kinds of software we couldn’t before.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>May 03, 2020</p></header><p>Modern applications don’t crash; they hang. One of the main reasons for it is the assumption that the network is reliable. It isn’t. </p><p>When you make a network call without setting a timeout, you are telling your code that you are 100% confident that the call is going to succeed. Would you really take that bet?</p><p>If you are a making synchronous network call that never returns, then to very least your thread hogs forever. Whoops. Asynchronous network calls that don’t return are not free either. Sure, you are not hogging threads, but you are leaking sockets. Any HTTP client library worth its salt uses socket pools to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection">avoid recreating connections</a>. And those pools have a limited capacity. Like any other resource leak, it’s only a matter of time until there are no sockets left. When that happens, your application is going to get stuck waiting for a connection to free up.</p><p>If the network is not reliable, why do we keep creating APIs that have infinity as the default timeout? Some APIs don’t even have a way to set a timeout in the first place! A good API should be easy to use the right way and hard to use the wrong way. When the default timeout is infinity, it’s all too easy for a client to shoot itself in the foot. </p><p>If you remember one thing from this post, then let it be this: <strong>never use “infinity” as a default timeout</strong>.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some concrete examples.</p><p>Javascript’s XMLHttpRequest is THE web API to retrieve data from a server asynchronously. Its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/timeout">default timeout is zero</a>, which means there is no timeout!</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>var</span> xhr <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>XMLHttpRequest</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

xhr<span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Client-side timeouts are as crucial as server-side ones. There is a <a href="https://hpbn.co/primer-on-browser-networking/#connection-management-and-optimization">maximum number of sockets your browser</a> can open for a particular host. If you make network requests that never returns, you are going to exhaust the socket pool. When the pool is exhausted, you are no longer able to connect to the host. </p><p>The fetch web API is a modern replacement for the XMLHttpRequest API, which uses Promises. When the API was initially introduced, there was <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/951">no way to set a timeout at all</a>! Browsers have recently added experimental support for the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController">Abort API</a> to support timeouts, though.</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> controller <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AbortController</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

For example, .Net Core’s HttpClient has a default timeout of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient.timeout?view=netcore-3.1#remarks">100 seconds</a>. It’s lax but much better than no timeout at all. That comes as no surprise since those languages are used to build large scale distributed systems that need to be robust against network failures.

</header><p>
((tl;dr See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dljNabciEGg">my video presentation/demonstration</a> of this essay))
</p>

<p>
Maintaining servers falls into two phases:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Bang head until server works</li>
<li>Capture effort into some automation tool like Puppet or Chef.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Recently, I’ve been playing around with making the first phase closer
to the second.  For lack of a better word, I’m calling it <i>literate
devops</i>.
</p>

<p>
I’ve talked about using <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/LP/introduction.html">org-mode’s <i>literate programming</i> model</a> to
investigate new ideas and crystallize thoughts, and this approach
appears to work well for me since I lack those esoteric sysadmin
skills.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbcbce75">
<h2 id="orgbcbce75">Tell us a Story</h2>
<div id="text-orgbcbce75">
<p>
Once upon a time, I was tasked with patching an RPM, which is not in
my comfort zone, so my initial plan of attack was:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Use Vagrant to create a disposable CentOS system</li>
<li>SSH into this virtual machine to download needed tools</li>
<li>Run various unknown commands</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat this step until successful</li>
</ol>

<p>
Of course, once I figure out the solution, I need to document it for
others on my team, and maybe create a <i>repeatedable</i> script.
</p>

<p>
First step is well documented elsewhere, but today I learned (TIL)
you can <code>ssh</code> directly to your Vagrant-based virtual machine with
this little magic (<b>Note:</b> <i>client</i> is the name of my virtual
machine I specified in the <code>Vagrantfile</code>):
</p>

<div>
<pre>vagrant ssh-config --host clientvm &gt;&gt; $<span>HOME</span>/.ssh/config
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This command appends some lovely host-connection magic so you can
issue: <code>ssh clientvm</code>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8dff3db">
<h2 id="org8dff3db">Literate Devops</h2>
<div id="text-org8dff3db">
<p>
Instead of opening up a terminal to my virtual machine, I pop into
Emacs and load this sprint’s <i>note file</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, create a new header,
and enter the shell and ruby commands in this text file.
</p>

<p>
What good is this? Unlike a traditional terminal, this allows me to
<i>log</i>, <i>document</i> and <i>execute</i> each command.
</p>

<p>
For instance, here is a screen-shot of a section of my Emacs buffer:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.png" alt="literate-devops.png">

</figure>

<p>
As an old bear with very little brains, my prose can explain the
background and purpose of each command.  Clicking the hyperlink
refreshes my memory of previous discoveries. A keychord <i>executes</i>
the code block…
</p>

<p>
Yes. I execute the commands from within Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Hitting <code>C-c C-c</code> (Control-C twice) runs the code (based on the
language).  This example runs in the shell. The results are placed
back into the file, which can be used by other code blocks (and <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/results.html#results">many
other options</a>).
</p>

<p>
For instance, here is the first half of a section for downloading
the GPG Keys from a repository (the URL is placed in a <i>property</i>
that is shared among all code blocks in his section):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-14.png" alt="literate-devops-14.png">

</figure>

<p>
The Shell script block (in the center of the screen-shot) uses
<code>wget</code> to download the HTML index file and parse and extract the key
file URLs.  We’ll have a Ruby script do that parsing, and since the
script may be a bit hairy, we’ll define it in another code block.
</p>

<p>
One technique from <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/LP/introduction.html">literate programming</a> is the idea that one code
block can be inserted into another block (the reference is a name
within double angle brackets, <code>&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>). Donald Knuth called this
feature WEB. Since it can accidentally conflict with some languages
(like Ruby), I have it off by default, but turn it on for this block
with the <code>noweb</code> parameter.
</p>

<p>
Here is the Ruby script. Having it in a separate Ruby-specific code
block allows me to turn on all the Ruby magic that Emacs can muster.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-15.png" alt="literate-devops-15.png">

</figure>

<p>
The last step is to take the URLs produced by the first script and
feed them to another Shell script that will call <code>wget</code> to download
each:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-16.png" alt="literate-devops-16.png">

</figure>

<p>
The <code>key-list</code> was the name of our original code block, as well as
the name of its results. We assign that list of results to a
variable, <code>LIST</code> that the shell script would access as <code>$LIST</code>.
</p>

<p>
This example demonstrated how literate programming can weave code
and data through different languages.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5d7bdd1">
<h2 id="org5d7bdd1">What about the Virtual Machine?</h2>
<p>
Normally, specifying <code>sh</code> as the code block’s <i>language</i>, tells
Emacs to run the code in my local system’s shell, but in this case,
I want it ran on my virtual machine (or on my development server in
my lab). I’ll describe two options for doing this, using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/TrampMode">Tramp</a> and
Babel Sessions.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org2251b72">
<h3 id="org2251b72">Tramp to the Rescue</h3>
<div id="text-org2251b72">
<p>
Tramp is an Emacs feature that allows one to edit a file on a
remote machine using <code>ssh</code> and other protocols. For instance,
running the <code>find-file</code> function (bound to <code>C-x C-f</code>) lets you type
something like:
</p>

<pre>/ssh:howard.abrams@goblin.howardism.org:web/files/robot.txt
</pre>

<p>
If you put the following in your <code>.emacs</code> initialization file:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>setq</span> tramp-default-method <span>"ssh"</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And update your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file to know what user account goes
with the host name, the file reference above can be shorten to:
</p>

<pre>/goblin.howardism.org:web/files/robot.txt
</pre>

<p>
Emacs looks for the <code>:</code> character to determine if Tramp should be
invoked.  Tramp uses SSH keys if available, or will prompt you for
a password if needed.
</p>


<p>
Each org-mode code block can specify a <code>:dir</code> option that specifies
where the code snippet should run, for instance, the following
blocks are equivalent:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-9.png" alt="literate-devops-9.png">

</figure>

<p>
The <code>:dir</code> option allows full Tramp functionality, allowing me to
run a block on a different machine. Remember how I added my
<code>client</code> Vagrant virtual machine to my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file?
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-10.png" alt="literate-devops-10.png">

</figure>

<p>
<i>But I need access to my machine behind a firewall!?</i>
</p>

<p>
My job deals with virtual machines running in a highly protected
data center, where I need to first log into jump boxes and bastion
machines. Tramp handles these sorts of hops. For instance:
</p>

<pre>/ssh:10.98.18.229|ssh:10.0.1.122|sudo:/etc/network/interfaces
</pre>

<p>
Uses my account name to log into the bastion machine, and
then uses my account name to <code>ssh</code> into a virtual machine running
in a private cloud. And then uses the <code>sudo</code> command to let me edit
a file owned by <code>root</code>.
</p>

<p>
Tramp pipe references works with the <code>:dir</code> option for <code>org-mode</code>
source blocks:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-11.png" alt="literate-devops-11.png">

</figure>

<p>
Few tricks to keep in mind:
</p>

<ul>
<li>All but the last hop uses a pipe character, |, instead of the
colon character, :</li>
<li>If you use the pipe character, you need to specify all
protocols, like <code>ssh</code>, even if it is the default.</li>
<li>If your local machine’s operating system is different than the
machine you are connecting to, you need to fix a bug in
<code>org-mode</code>, which I can show you how to fix<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0d027af">
<h3 id="org0d027af">Using org-mode Sessions</h3>
<div id="text-org0d027af">
<p>
Another approach is to create a <i>session</i> that connects different
code blocks together. Each screen shot below, each code block below
has the same <code>session</code> value, <code>client</code> (which is conveniently the
same my virtual machine’s hostname, <code>client</code>):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-2b.png" alt="literate-devops-2b.png">

</figure>

<p>
If I execute the first block, a <i>shell</i> is started in the
background, and it ssh’s into the machine. Note, to get this
working, you need to enable <i>password-less access</i> by placing your
SSH’s public key into the remote system’s <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
file, or using the <code>ssh</code> Emacs package.<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
From this point on, each code block I execute with the <code>client</code>
session value, uses this connection, and the code is executed on the
remote machine (a virtual machine in this case, but that doesn’t
matter).
</p>

<p>
Either of these approaches works well, but the second approach,
allows me to set variables to create a particular state that other
blocks may expect.  However, this requires execution of each block in
order.
</p>

<p>
I have a third, more interactive, approach<sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> using <code>screen</code>, but
it doesn’t allow passing variables to the code, and as you’ll see
below, this is pretty important to me.
</p>


<p>
Regardless, I continue learning how to accomplish my goal, all the
while documenting and <i>validating</i> my steps. The end result can be
exported to web or wiki page.

<div id="outline-container-org39ccdca">
<h2 id="org39ccdca">What about Verbose Commands?</h2>
<div id="text-org39ccdca">
<p>
Yes, executing some commands can be quite time-consuming and
verbose, but often I need to search the results, and having the
results placed in an Emacs buffer allows better searching.
</p>

<p>
Often I use a collapsible “drawer” (which is just a way to identify
the beginning and end of the output):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-3.png" alt="literate-devops-3.png">

</figure>

<p>
Place the cursor on this drawer and hit the <code>Tab</code> key to hide or
show the output:

<div id="outline-container-org3721d6c">
<h2 id="org3721d6c">Can you Use the Output?</h2>
<div id="text-org3721d6c">
<p>
The results of some commands are often needed for the next command,
and I’m sure you just love using your mouse to copy and paste part
of the output, but I have a better way.
</p>

<p>
For instance, I needed a list of an RPM’s dependencies:

<p>This is the first part of a blog series where I examine programming concepts from a scientific perspective. In this part I dig up every study relating to function length I could find, fill in some gaps with original research, and examine what we can learn.</p>



<p>Highlights:</p>



<ul id="block-f6ddbfdc-f37f-48df-8d67-6990d4b79de3"><li>We find that in older studies (pre-2000) short functions correlate with higher defect density</li><li>There seem to be no post-2000 studies exclusively focusing on function length, but through original research we find that modern code bases exhibit similar behavior</li><li>We also find that in empirical experiments short functions make code slower to debug, with some weaker evidence suggesting they also make it slower for adding new features but faster to modify</li></ul>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>In programming lore it’s hard to find sources glorifying long functions. This is codified, for example, in the widely quoted book ‘Clean Code’ which states:</p>



<blockquote><p>The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that. Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long</p></blockquote>



<p>Favoring short functions isn’t by any means a new practise – a 1986 study “An Empirical Study of Software Design Practices” states “keeping modules small” as a good design practise. They also quote a book from 1974, stating “many programming standards limit module size to one page (or 50-60 source lines of code)”.</p>



<p><strong>What is a small function?</strong></p>



<p>What was meant by shorts functions in the 80s is different from small functions of today. In a study from 1991 ([1]) the line between small and large functions is drawn at 142 lines, staggeringly long by modern standards. In the same vein, a study from 1984 groups functions into buckets by increments of 50 lines ([2]).</p>



<p>However, nowadays the vast majority of functions are under 50 lines. A quick analysis of Eclipse, a popular open source IDE, reveals it averages about 8.6 lines per method in its source code. Above mentioned book “Clean Code”, published in 2008, states that functions should rarely be more than 20 lines, and the author has stated in other contexts he often prefers to use single-line functions, and that about half of the functions written by the author in Ruby are single-liners.</p>



<p>This shift in function sizes is perhaps partially due to changes in programming languages. In the 80s a Fortran “module” was commonly considered a function and some variables&nbsp; (see eg. <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fortran/fortran_modules.htm">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fortran/fortran_modules.htm</a>) and function was the basic building block of software, whereas nowadays most Java or C++ programmers would define “module” as a class consisting of multiple functions.</p>



<p>Many studies focus on analyzing module sizes without specifying what a module is, so I’ve only included studies which specifically state they analyze functions. This, combined with the change in what we consider a basic building block of software, combined with the historical shift in function sizes, makes it hard to properly analyze and aggregate the studies, but we can certainly try.</p>



<p><strong>Function length and defect density – pre-2000</strong></p>



<p>The first studies concerning the length of functions I could find were from the early 80s. Nowadays most studies examine the code on a class and package level, whereas in the 80s object oriented programming was still quite rare and functions were the main building blocks of software, so it made a lot of sense to examine functions and their error proneness.</p>



<p>The early research on function length and defect density found that very small functions tended to have higher defect densities. This has been cited in “Code Complete”, where Steve McConnell says: “The routine should be allowed to grow organically up to 100-200 lines, decades of evidence say that routines of such length no more error prone then shorter routines.” Further, he gives a reference to a study that says routines 65 lines or longer are cheaper to develop. (see appendix for a more extensive take on the studies used in Code Complete)</p>



<p>To dive further, a study from 1984 ([2]) grouped function to buckets with increments of 50 lines and measured the error density for each bucket. They found that smaller functions contained, on average, more defects per line:</p>

<p>A follow-up study ([3]) examined five Fortran projects, and states that “no significant relationship was found between module size and fault rate“ even though, in the same paragraph, the authors also state that “nevertheless, [small modules] exhibited the highest average fault rate because a small module with even a single fault will show a very high fault rate“. It’s not clear why the authors state that module size and fault rate has no significant relationship and then state that average fault rate is highest for small modules. Another conclusion from [3] is that larger functions are cheaper to develop.</p>



<p>A third empirical study ([1]) analyzed 450 routines and found that “small” routines (those with fewer than 143 source statements, including comments) had 23 percent more errors per line of code than larger routines but were 2.4 times less expensive to fix than larger routines. This is interesting since it contrasts with some other experimental results we’ll see later.</p>



<p>So far it appears short functions are correlated with higher defect density, but due to the large sizes of the examined functions you’d be forgiven for doubting the relevance of these studies to modern software engineering.</p>



<p><strong>Modern defect prediction literature</strong></p>



<p>Modern defect prediction approaches are characterized by large data sets and machine learning methods applied on them. They mainly concentrate on correlating features such as “average method length” and “lines of code” with defects in an attempt to create defect prediction models.</p>



<p>Several such studies have found a correlation between size of methods and defects. For example [4] found that the size of the longest method in a class correlates positively with post-relase defects. Does this mean we should refactor our long methods into short ones to avoid defects?</p>

<p>Turns out the answer is no. In those same studies, the number of methods also correlates with defects:</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=640%2C61&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="61" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1024%2C98&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=300%2C29&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=768%2C73&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1536%2C146&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=2048%2C195&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1568%2C149&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The number of functions in a class also correlates with defects. [4]</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To put it plainly, if we have a long function and split it into smaller ones, we’re not removing a source of defects, but we would simply be switching from one to another.</p>



<p>The same effect can be seen in other defect prediction studies. For example in [5] we see that both “Weighted Methods per Class” and “Average Method Complexity” correlate with defects, where former is defined as “number of methods in the class” and latter as “the average method size for each class“.</p>



<p>In both studies both metrics have a statistically significant correlation with defects, and this appears to be the trend across many other studies in defect prediction literature.</p>



<p>The literature doesn’t provide a straightforward way to measure which feature (length or number of methods) is more significant when predicting defects. It’s quite possible that, for example, measures such as “average method complexity” and “number of methods in a class” simply act as 2nd order estimators for number of lines, in which case we’d simply be comparing which measure correlates better with the underlying metric.</p>



<p>In addition, we’re interested in examining the length of the functions on a more granular level. Finding out that the number of methods and the length of methods both correlate with defects doesn’t give us anything tangible, and doing this sort of class or module level correlation analysis doesn’t get us very far.</p>



<p>However, the datasets used in many of these studies are open and we can download them to try to examine the relationship between functions length and defects ourselves.</p>



<p><strong>Data set analysis</strong></p>



<p>Time to scare the wikipedia editors among you and do some original research. All the code and data can be found at <a href="https://github.com/softwarebyscience/function-length/">https://github.com/softwarebyscience/function-length/</a>.</p>



<p>I took two datasets which contained the features we are interested in, such as the number of methods and lines of code per class. The first dataset I worked with is simply called “Eclipse Bug Database” and it contained data from three major Eclipse releases ([7]).</p>



<p>In addition, I used the “Bug Prediction Dataset” from <a href="http://bug.inf.usi.ch/download.php">http://bug.inf.usi.ch/download.php</a> as it seemed larger than the Eclipse Bug Database. The data is collected between 2005 and 2009 from 5 different Java projects – for a more detailed explanation see [6].</p>



<p>The results from the first dataset are quite straightforward:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=511%2C375&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="511" height="375" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=1024%2C752&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=768%2C564&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?w=1174&amp;ssl=1 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Here smaller methods clearly have a higher defect density, with the minimum defect density roughly found in classes where the methods average around 10-15 lines. What’s perhaps hard to see from the chart is that defect density starts very slightly increasing towards the right.</p>



<p>The results from the second dataset are a bit more interesting (moving average in red):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=502%2C367&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="502" height="367" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=1024%2C750&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=768%2C563&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?w=1168&amp;ssl=1 1168w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Perhaps most surprisingly, the distribution is quite different compared to the first dataset, even though I would’ve expected the distributions to look very similar. I have no good theories as to why this might be the case (apart from a bug in my code, although I did check it several times).</p>



<p>There are a few other interesting details here. The average error density in the second dataset is higher, and this is likely because we consider all bugs over the ~4 year period, whereas the first dataset only considers the last 6 months and specific type of bugs (see [6] and [7] for details). In addition there are some zero-length functions. These are likely methods of abstract classes, meant to be overwritten. When analyzing post-release defects we see a roughly similar picture, if noisier (graph can be found in …</p></div></div>

<p>When 27-year-old Lebanese teacher Sara Mazbouh heard news of the Covid-19 stay-at-home order, her mind went straight to her students. Mazbouh, who has been teaching for nine years at a school in the suburbs of Beirut, wondered how they would cope. After the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-protests/protesters-block-roads-in-beirut-other-parts-of-lebanon-idUSKBN1XE0H7">nationwide protests</a> and shutdowns across Lebanon in October of last year, the day-to-day lives of her students would again be paralyzed by circumstances out of their control.</p>



<p>In the early weeks of the shutdown, Mazbouh and her colleagues photocopied their lessons, leaving them for parents to pick up at school. Then, <a href="https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse">like countless others around the world</a>, Mazbouh’s campus announced it would be closing for the rest of the year. Most of her students are firmly middle-class; she knew many parents wouldn’t be able to afford online learning — steady internet and a computer at home <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/lebanon-telecommunication-in-government-hands/a-48634796#:~:text=But%20this%20progress%20does%20not,that%20is%20on%20the%20rise.">aren’t a given</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exasperated, Mazbouh messaged her fellow teachers on WhatsApp. A distance-learning solution, they soon realized, was right in front of them.</p>



<p>In Lebanon, where schools have been closed for over five months, WhatsApp has become an informal distance-learning app for students and teachers. The app allows educators to share their lessons using voice notes, videos, and photos in group chats that mimic a classroom structure.&nbsp;</p>

In the wake of the massive explosion that rocked the country’s capital in early August, more than 300,000 Beirutis, up to <a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/unicef-says-beirut-children-will-need-special-care-after-blast">one-third of them school-age children</a>, have been displaced from their homes. In spite of the odds, teachers and parents are embracing creative ways to keep their “WhatsApp schools” in session.</p>



<p>For Mazbouh and her fellow teachers, shifting classes to WhatsApp was a matter of necessity. “The school administration didn’t even ask us to pursue WhatsApp teaching as a solution,” she says. “But the kids shouldn’t have to waste their year.” The teachers at Mazbouh’s school had such success with their ad hoc WhatsApp classroom that the administrators organized similar group chats for their elementary school counterparts.</p>



<p>As teachers across the country bring their classrooms to WhatsApp, they have realized there are new students in their classrooms: parents. For younger students, the adults play videos, record their kids completing assignments, and send the footage to teachers, who monitor their progress. Kindergarten teacher Noura Chehayeb shares snippets of her students’ reading progress on Facebook along with encouraging messages for their parents, whom she tags in different posts. The clips offer glimpses into each household’s unique effort to maintain normalcy during the pandemic. In one, a mom films her child singing a nursery song in their backyard. In another, a girl practices her French spelling, while her father talks at a TV playing the nightly news in the background.</p>



<p>Even though it was never intended to be an educational tool, there are unique benefits to WhatsApp distance learning. Some of the higher-end platforms used for distance learning require technical skills and hardware, such as laptops, that not all families possess. WhatsApp requires only a smartphone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The app’s “read receipts” function as an unofficial monitoring tool for teachers tracking their students’ participation. Once a student opens a group chat, all texts and photos appear as “seen” from the teacher’s perspective. Antoine Gebian, a 41-year-old private-school teacher, realized WhatsApp treated audio messages a little differently: his students must open each clip to indicate a “played” receipt; he could check if they hadn’t listened to his voice notes. Gebian used the function as a sort of attendance tally for his WhatsApp classroom. While Lebanon’s school curricula are offered in French and English, many parents speak only Arabic fluently. WhatsApp’s voice notes allow Lebanese teachers to switch between the three with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But distance learning, even when held exclusively on WhatsApp, may be out of reach for Lebanon’s students this fall.</p>



<p>The effects of this month’s blast are far-reaching: the nearly 2,700-ton explosion obliterated Beirut’s port, Lebanon’s biggest and its main source for imports that sustain the country. The economic impact will go beyond the city itself. “Many parents are saying they can’t enroll their kids for economic and Covid reasons,” says Mazbouh, who was laid off from her job of nearly a decade in July. “The percentage of parents who are actually enrolling their kids is very low, and if they are, they’re not paying their fees.” Mazbouh’s school closed the same week she lost her job, its principal dismissed along with all the other teachers. Mazbouh says she doesn’t blame the school for the closure. “Our economic situation is very hard,” she says. “They have every right to shut down.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“It’s much easier for children to grasp things if they live in a physical space that portrays it.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>That was before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion-damage.html">the August 4 blast</a>. Initial reports indicate that more than <a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/unicef-says-beirut-children-will-need-special-care-after-blast">120 schools were damaged by the explosion</a>, leaving some 55,000 students without physical classrooms. Lebanese authorities say they plan to host displaced families in those that haven’t been damaged. Together with the pandemic, it makes a return to the classroom this fall unlikely<strong> </strong>for many students in Lebanon. For those schools that do try to stay in session, WhatsApp may be a solution to the myriad challenges they face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carla Najem, a psychologist at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, says prolonged time out of the classroom may have serious repercussions for Lebanese students. “Our basic needs are not being met right now,” says Najem. “[Students] are going through a lot mentally and emotionally.”</p>



<p>Even as conditions in an ailing Lebanon deteriorate, Najem says that certain aspects of distance learning, like sharing photos and videos, can ameliorate some of the long-term negative effects. “It’s much easier for children to grasp things if they live in a physical space that portrays it,” Najem says. “Maybe we need to use those things as an opportunity to help children connect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Najem says we have a lot to learn from students, even as they face a daunting new school year. “Children are very resilient,” she explains. “They adapt much quicker than adults.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main">
      <p>This blog post explains the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> and the corresponding new PyTorch <a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="main-contributions">Main contributions</h2>
<p>We introduce a new energy function and a corresponding new update rule which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the energy function.</p>

<p>The new energy function is a generalization (discrete states \(\Rightarrow\) continuous states) of <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> aka <strong>Dense Associative Memories</strong> introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01929">Demircigil et al.</a>
The new modern Hopfield Network with continuous states keeps the characteristics of its discrete counterparts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exponential storage capacity</li>
  <li>extremely fast convergence</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprisingly, the new update rule is the attention mechanism of transformer networks introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>.
We use these new insights to analyze transformer models in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-blog-post-is-about">What this blog post is about</h2>

<p>This blog post is split into three parts. First, we make the transition from traditional Hopfield Networks towards <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> and their generalization to continuous states through our <strong>new energy function</strong>. Second, the properties of our new energy function and the connection to the self-attention mechanism of transformer networks is shown. Finally, we introduce and explain a new PyTorch layer (<a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>), which is built on the insights of our work. We show several practical use cases, i.e. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13505">Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire Classification</a>, Hopfield pooling, and associations of two sets.</p>

<h2 id="from-classical-hopfield-networks-to-self-attention">From classical Hopfield Networks to self-attention</h2>

<p><strong>Associative memories</strong> are one of the earliest artificial neural models dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Best known are <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">Hopfield Networks</a>, presented by John Hopfield in 1982.
As the name suggests, the main purpose of associative memory networks is to associate an input with its most similar pattern. In other words, the purpose is to store and retrieve patterns.
We start with a review of classical Hopfield Networks.</p>

<h3 id="hopfield-networks">Hopfield Networks</h3>

<p>The simplest associative memory is just a <strong>sum of outer products</strong> of the \(N\) patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) that we want to store (Hebbian learning rule). In classical Hopfield Networks these patterns are polar (binary), i.e. \(\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1 \}^d\), where \(d\) is the length of the patterns. The corresponding weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_i^N \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ . \tag{1}
\end{equation}\]

<p>The weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) stores the patterns, which can be retrieved starting with a <strong>state pattern</strong> \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Nomenclature</strong></p>

<p>From now on we denote the \(N\) <strong>stored patterns</strong> as \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) and any <strong>state pattern</strong> or <strong>state</strong> as \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>

<p>The basic <strong>synchronuous update rule</strong> is to repeatedly multiply the state pattern \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\), subtract the bias and take the sign:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} =  \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\xi}^t - \boldsymbol{b}) \ , \tag{2}
\label{eq:restorage}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is a bias vector, which can be interpreted as threshold for every component.
The <strong>asynchronous update rule</strong> performs this update only for one component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) and then selects the next component for update.
Convergence is reached if \(\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} = \boldsymbol{\xi^{t}}\).</p>

<p>The asynchronous version of the update rule of Eq. \eqref{eq:restorage} minimizes the <strong>energy function</strong> \(\text{E}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\text{E} = -\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\xi}^T \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^T\boldsymbol{b} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^d\sum_{j=1}^d w_{ij}\xi_i\xi_j + \sum_{i=1}^d b_i\xi_i \ . \tag{3}
\label{eq:energy_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>As derived in the papers of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=58341">Bruck</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X85900290">Goles-Chacc et al.</a> and <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">the original Hopfield paper</a>, the convergence properties are dependent on the structure of the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) and the method by which the nodes are updated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For asynchronous updates with \(w_{ii} \geq 0\) and \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state.</li>
  <li>For synchronous updates with \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state or a limit cycle of length 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the asynchronous update rule and symmetric weights, \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) \leq \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) holds. When \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) = \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) for the update of every component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^t\), a local minimum in \(\text{E}\) is reached.
All stored patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) should be fixed points of the Hopfield Network, i.e.</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x}_i = \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{b}) \ . \tag{4}
\end{equation}\]

<p>They should even be local minima of \(\text{E}\).</p>

<p>In the following example, no bias vector is used. This means that taking the inverse image, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</p>

<p>We start with an <strong>illustrative example</strong> of a Hopfield Network. <strong>One input image</strong> should first be stored and then be retrieved.
The input image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_original.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>Since an associative memory has <strong>polar states and patterns</strong> (or binary states and patterns), we convert the input image to a black and white image:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>The <strong>weight matrix</strong> \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is the outer product of this black and white image \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ , \tag{5}
\label{eq:weight_matrix}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where for this example \(d = 64 \times 64\).</p>

<p>Can the original image be restored if half of the pixels are masked out? The masked image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>which is our inital state \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\). This inital state is updated via multiplication with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\).
It takes one update until the original image is restored.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked_retrieved.png" alt="not found" width="600px"></p>

<p>What happens if we store <strong>more than one pattern</strong>? The weight matrix is then built from the sum of outer products of <strong>three stored patterns</strong> (three input images):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ . \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_6.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_12.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>In this figure, the left hand side shows the three stored patterns, and the right hand side shows masked state patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) together with the retrieved patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{\text{new}}\).</p>

<p>Looking at the upper row of images might suggest that the retrieval process is no longer perfect. But there are two interesting facts to take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Masking the original images introduces many pixel values of \(-1\). We therefore have the odd behavior that the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Bart}}\rangle\) is larger than the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\rangle\).</li>
  <li>As stated above, if no bias vector is used, the inverse of the pattern, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the retrieval of the upper image looks incorrect, it is de facto correct. However, for the lower row example, the retrieval is no longer correct.
The weights of \(2 \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Marge}}\) have simply overwritten the weights of \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\).
For both examples, only the retrieval after the first update step is shown, but the results do not change when performing further update steps.
The next figure shows the Hopfield Network retrieval for 6 patterns.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_115.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>Clearly, retrieving the patterns is imperfect. One might suspect that the limited storage capacities of Hopfield Networks, see <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.3548&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Amit et al.</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.061910">Torres et al</a>, is the problem.
However, we show now that the storage capacity is not directly responsible for the imperfect retrieval.
The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns free of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong \frac{d}{2\log(d)} \ , \tag{7}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(d\) is the dimension of the input.</p>

<p>The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong 0.14 d\ . \tag{8}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield2}
\end{equation}\]

<p>In the example, the storage capacity is \(C \cong 0.14 d = 0.14 \cdot 64 \cdot 64 \sim 570\).
Thus, insufficient storage capacity is not directly responsible for the retrieval errors.
Instead, the example patterns are correlated, therefore the retrieval has errors.</p>

<p>Consequently, we need a model which <strong>allows pulling apart close patterns</strong>, such that (strongly) <strong>correlated patterns can be distinguished</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>On storage capacity</strong></p>

<p>The storage capacities stated in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield} and in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield2} are derived for \(w_{ii}=0\).
Recently, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> analyzed the storage capacity for Hopfield Networks with \(w_{ii}\geq 0\). Also for \(w_{ii}\geq 0\), a storage capacity of \(C \cong 0.14 d\)
for retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors was observed. The ratio \(C/d\) is often called <strong>load parameter</strong> and denoted by \(\alpha\). <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> showed that there is a second regime with very large \(\alpha\), where the storage capacity is much higher, i.e. more fixed points exist. However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07741">Rocci et al.</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/8/726/htm">Gosti et al.</a> reported that these fixed points for very large \(\alpha\) are unstable and do not have an attraction basin.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="modern-hopfield-networks-aka-dense-associative-memories">Modern Hopfield Networks (aka Dense Associative Memories)</h3>

<p>The storage capacity is a crucial characteristic of Hopfield Networks. <strong>Modern Hopfield Networks</strong> (aka Dense Associative Memories) introduce a new energy function instead of the energy in Eq. \eqref{eq:energy_hopfield} to create a higher storage capacity. <strong>Discrete</strong> modern Hopfield Networks have been introduced first by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>In my previous posts on loss aversion (<a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/09/10/kahneman-and-tverskys-debatable-loss-aversion-assumption/">here</a>, <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/11/06/what-can-we-infer-about-someone-who-rejects-a-5050-bet-to-win-110-or-lose-100-the-rabin-paradox-explored/">here</a> and <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/12/05/the-case-against-loss-aversion/">here</a>), I foreshadowed a post on how “ergodicity economics” might shed some light on whether we need loss aversion to explain people’s choices under uncertainty. This was to be that post, but the background material that I drafted is long enough to be a stand alone piece. I’ll turn to the application of ergodicity economics to loss aversion in a future post.</p>
<p>The below is largely drawn from presentations and papers by <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/">Ole Peters</a> and <a href="http://lml.org.uk/research/economics/">friends</a>, with my own evolutionary take at the end. For a deeper dive, see the <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/lecture-notes/">lecture notes by Peters and Alexander Adamou</a>, or a recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0732-0">Perspective by Peters in Nature Physics</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The choice</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 and are offered a gamble involving a series of coin flips. For each flip, heads will increase your wealth by 50%. Tails will decrease it by 40%. Flip 100 times.</p>
<p><strong>The expected payoff</strong></p>
<p>What will happen? For that first flip, you have a 50% chance of a $50 gain, and a 50% chance of a $40 loss. Your expected gain (each outcome weighted by its probability, 0.5*$50 + 0.5*-$40) is $5 or 5% of your wealth. The absolute size of the stake for future flips will depend on past flips, but for every flip you have the same expected gain of 5% of your wealth.</p>
<p>Should you take the bet?</p>
<p>I simulated 10,000 people who each started with $100 and flipped the coin 100 times each. This line in Figure 1 represents the mean wealth of the 10,000 people. It looks good, increasing roughly in accordance with the expected gain, despite some volatility, and finishing at a mean wealth of over $16,000.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1: Average wealth of population</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_1.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 1"></p>
<p>Yet people regularly decline gambles of this nature. Are they making a mistake?</p>
<p>One explanation for declining this gamble is risk aversion. A risk averse person will value the expected outcome of a gamble lower than the same sum with certainty.</p>
<p>Risk aversion can be represented through the concept of utility, where each level of wealth gives subjective value (utility) for the gambler. If people maximise utility instead of the value of a gamble, it is possible that a person would reject the bet.</p>
<p>For example, one common utility function to represent a risk averse individual is to take the logarithm of each level of wealth. If we apply the log utility function to the gamble above, the gambler will reject the offer of the coin flip. [The maths here is simply that the expected utility of the gamble is 0.5*<em>ln</em>(150) + 0.5*<em>ln</em>(60)=4.55, which is less than the utility of the sure $100, <em>ln</em>(100)=4.61.]</p>
<p><strong>The time average growth rate</strong></p>
<p>For a different perspective, below is the plot for the first 20 of these 10,000 people. Interestingly, only two people do better than break even (represented by the black line at $100). The richest has less than $1,000 at period 100.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Path of first 20 people</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_2.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 2"></p>
<p>What is happening here? The first plot shows that the average wealth across all 10,000 people is increasing. When we look at the first 20 individuals, their wealth generally declines. Even those that make money make less than the gain in aggregate wealth would suggest.</p>
<p>To show this more starkly, here is a plot of the first 20 people on a log scale, together with the average wealth for the full population. They are all below average in final wealth.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3: Plot of first 20 people against average wealth (log scale)</em><br>

<p>If we examine the full population of 10,000, we see an interesting pattern. The mean wealth is over $16,000, but the median wealth after 100 periods is 51 cents, a loss of over 99% of the initial wealth. 54% of the population ends up with less than $1. 86% finishes with less than the initial wealth of $100. Yet 171 people end up with more than $10,000. The wealthiest person finishes with $117 million, which is over 70% of the total wealth of the population.</p>
<p>For most people, the series of bets is a disaster. It looks good only on average, propped up by the extreme good luck and massive wealth of a few people. The expected payoff does not match the experience of most people.</p>
<p><strong><em>Four possible outcomes</em></strong></p>
<p>One way to think about what is happening is to consider the four possible outcomes over the first two periods.</p>
<p>The first person gets two heads. They finish with $225. The second and third person get a heads and a tails (in different orders), and finish with $90. The fourth person ends up with $36.</p>
<p>The average across the four is $110.25, reflecting the compound 5% growth. That’s our positive picture. But three of the four lost money. As the number of flips increases, the proportion who lose money increases, with a rarer but more extraordinarily rich cohort propping up the average.</p>
<p><strong><em>Almost surely</em></strong></p>
<p>Over the very long-term, an individual will tend to get around half heads and half tails. As the number of flips goes to infinite, the number of heads and tails is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">almost surely</a>” equal.</p>
<p>This means that each person will tend to get a 50% increase half the time (or 1.5 times the initial wealth), and a 40% decrease half the time (60% of the initial wealth). A bit of maths and the time average growth in wealth for an individual is (1.5*0.6)<sup>0.5</sup> ~ 0.95, or approximately a 5% decline in wealth each period. Every individual’s wealth will tend to decay at that rate.</p>
<p>To get an intuition for this, a long run of equal numbers of heads and tails is equivalent to flipping a head and a tail every two periods. Suppose that is exactly what you did – flipped a heads and then flipped a tail. Your wealth would increase to $150 in the first round ($100*1.5), and then decline to $90 in the second ($150*0.6). You get the same result if you change the order. Effectively, you are losing 10% (or getting only 1.5*0.6=0.9) of your money every two periods.</p>
<p>A system where the time average converges to the ensemble average (our population mean) is known as an ergodic system. The system of gambles above is non-ergodic as the time average and the ensemble average diverge. And given we cannot individually experience the ensemble average, we should not be misled by it. The focus on ensemble averages, as is typically done in economics, can be misleading if the system is non-ergodic.</p>
<p><strong><em>The longer term</em></strong></p>
<p>How can we reconcile this expectation of loss when looking at the time average growth with the continued growth of the wealth of some people after 100 periods? It does not seem that everyone is “almost surely” on the path to ruin.</p>
<p>But they are. If we plot the simulation for, say, 1,000 periods rather than 100, there are few winners. Here’s a plot of the average wealth of the population for 1000 periods (the first 100 being as previously shown), plus a log plot of that same growth (Figures 4 and 5).</p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_4.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 4"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods (log plot)</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_5.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 5"></p>
<p>We can see that despite a large peak in wealth around period 400, wealth ultimately plummets. Average wealth at period 1000 is $24, below the starting average of $100, with a median wealth of 1×10<sup>-21</sup> (rounding to the nearest cent, that is zero). The wealthiest person has $242 thousand dollars, with that being 98.5% of the total wealth. If we followed that wealthy person for another 1000 generations, I would expect them to be wiped out too. [I tested that – at 2000 periods the wealthiest person had $4×10<sup>-7</sup>.] Despite the positive expected value, the wealth of the entire population is wiped out.</p>
<p><strong>Losing wealth on a positive value bet</strong></p>
<p>The first 100 periods of bets forces us to hold a counterintuitive idea in our minds. While the population as an aggregate experiences outcomes reflecting the positive expected value of the bet, the typical person does not. The increase in wealth across the aggregate population is only due to the extreme wealth of a few lucky people.</p>
<p>However, the picture over 1000 periods appears even more confusing. The positive expected value of the bet is nowhere to be seen. How could this be the case?</p>
<p>The answer to this lies in the distribution of bets. After 100 periods, one person had 70% of the wealth. We no longer have 10,000 equally weighted independent bets as we did in the first round. Instead, the path of the wealth of the population is largely subject to the outcome of the bets by this wealthy individual. As we have already shown, the wealth path for an individual almost surely leads to a compound 5% loss of wealth. That individual’s wealth is on borrowed time. The only way for someone to maintain their wealth would be to bet a smaller portion of their wealth, or to diversify their wealth across multiple bets.</p>
<p><strong>The Kelly criterion</strong></p>
<p>On the first of these options, the portion of a person’s wealth they should enter as stakes for a positive expected value bet such as this is given by the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>. The Kelly criterion gives the bet size that would maximise the geometric growth rate in wealth.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion formula for a simple bet is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3D%5Cfrac%7Bbp-q%7D%7Bb%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7Bp%28b%2B1%29-1%7D%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" alt="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}" title="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}"></p>
<p>where</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <em>f</em> is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager</p>
<p>  <em>b</em> is the net odds received on the wager (i.e. you receive $b back on top of the $1 wagered for the bet)</p>
<p>  <em>p</em> is the probability of winning</p>
<p>  <em>q</em> is the probability of losing (1-p)
</p></blockquote>
<p>For the bet above, we have <em>p</em>=0.5 and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D%5Cfrac%7B0.5%7D%7B0.4%7D%3D1.25&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25" title="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25">. As offered, we are effectively required to bet <em>f</em>=0.4, or 40% of our wealth, for that chance to win a 50% increase.</p>
<p>However, if we apply the above formula given <em>p</em> and <em>b</em>, a person should bet <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%280.5%2A%281.25%2B1%29-1%29%7D%7B1.25%7D%3D0.1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1" title="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1">, or 10%, of their wealth each round to maximise the geometric growth rate.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion is effectively maximising the expected log utility of the bet through setting the size of the bet. The Kelly criterion will result in someone wanting to take a share of any bet with positive expected value.</p>
<p>The Kelly bet “almost surely”” leads to higher wealth than any other strategy in the long run.</p>
<p>If we simulate the above scenarios, but risking only 10% of wealth each round rather than 40% (i.e. heads wealth will increase by 12.5%, tails it will decrease by 10%), what happens? The expected value of the Kelly bet is 0.5*0.125+0.5*-0.1=0.0125 …</p></div></div>

        <p><span>“So what does a game designer do? Are you an artist? Do you design characters and write the story? Or no, wait, you’re a programmer?”</span></p>
<p>Game design is one of those nebulous terms to people outside the game industry that’s about as clear as the “astrophysicist” job title is to me. It’s also my job, so I find myself explaining what game design means to a lot of people from different backgrounds, some of whom don’t know anything about games.</p>
<h2>The Door Problem</h2>
<p>I like to describe my job in terms of “The Door Problem”.</p>
<p>Premise: You are making a game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there doors in your game?</li>
<li>Can the player open them?</li>
<li>Can the player open every door in the game?</li>
<li>Or are some doors for decoration?</li>
<li>How does the player know the difference?</li>
<li>Are doors you can open green and ones you can’t red? Is there trash piled up in front of doors you can’t use? Did you just remove the doorknobs and call it a day?</li>
<li>Can doors be locked and unlocked?</li>
<li>What tells a player a door is locked and will open, as opposed to a door that they will never open?</li>
<li>Does a player know how to unlock a door? Do they need a key? To hack a console? To solve a puzzle? To wait until a story moment passes?</li>
<li>Are there doors that can open but the player can never enter them?</li>
<li>Where do enemies come from? Do they run in from doors? Do those doors lock afterwards?</li>
<li>How does the player open a door? Do they just walk up to it and it slides open? Does it swing open? Does the player have to press a button to open it?</li>
<li>Do doors lock behind the player?</li>
<li>What happens if there are two players? Does it only lock after both players pass through the door?</li>
<li>What if the level is REALLY BIG and can’t all exist at the same time? If one player stays behind, the floor might disappear from under them. What do you do?</li>
<li>Do you stop one player from progressing any further until both are together in the same room?</li>
<li>Do you teleport the player that stayed behind?</li>
<li>What size is a door?</li>
<li>Does it have to be big enough for a player to get through?</li>
<li>What about co-op players? What if player 1 is standing in the doorway – does that block player 2?</li>
<li>What about allies following you? How many of them need to get through the door without getting stuck?</li>
<li>What about enemies? Do mini-bosses that are larger than a person also need to fit through the door?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a pretty classic design problem. SOMEONE has to solve The Door Problem, and that someone is a designer.</p>
<h2>The Other Door Problems</h2>
<p>To help people understand the role breakdowns at a big company, I sometimes go into how other people deal with doors.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Creative Director</span>: “Yes, we definitely need doors in this game.”</li>
<li><strong>Project Manager</strong>: “I’ll put time on the schedule for people to make doors.”</li>
<li><span>Designer</span>: “I wrote a doc explaining what we need doors to do.”</li>
<li><span>Concept Artist</span>: “I made some gorgeous paintings of doors.”</li>
<li><span>Art Director</span>: “This third painting is exactly the style of doors we need.”</li>
<li><span>Environment Artist</span>: “I took this painting of a door and made it into an object in the game.”</li>
<li><span>Animator</span>: “I made the door open and close.”</li>
<li><strong>Sound Designer</strong>: “I made the sounds the door creates when it opens and closes.”</li>
<li><strong>Audio Engineer</strong>: “The sound of the door opening and closing will change based on where the player is and what direction they are facing.”</li>
<li><strong>Composer</strong>: “I created a theme song for the&nbsp;door.”</li>
<li><span>FX Artist</span>: “I added some cool sparks to the door when it opens.”</li>
<li><strong>Writer</strong>: “When the door opens, the player will say, ‘Hey look! The door opened!’ “</li>
<li><span>Lighter</span>: “There is a bright red light over the door when it’s locked, and a green one when it’s opened.”</li>
<li><span>Legal</span>: “The environment artist put a Starbucks logo on the door. You need to remove that if you don’t want to be sued.”</li>
<li><strong>Character Artist</strong>: “I don’t really care about this door until it can start wearing hats.”</li>
<li><span>Gameplay Programmer</span>: “This door asset now opens and closes based on proximity to the player. It can also be locked and unlocked through script.”</li>
<li><strong>AI Programmer:</strong> “Enemies and allies now know if a door is there and whether they can go through it.”</li>
<li><strong>Network&nbsp;Programmer:</strong> “Do all the players need to see the door open at the same time?”</li>
<li><strong>Release Engineer</strong>: “You need to get your doors in by 3pm if you want them on the disk.”</li>
<li><strong>Core Engine Programmer:&nbsp;</strong>“I have optimized the code to allow up to 1024 doors in the game.”</li>
<li><strong>Tools Programmer:</strong> “I made it even easier for you to place doors.”</li>
<li><span>Level Designer</span>: “I put the door in my level and locked it. After an event, I unlocked it.”</li>
<li><strong>UI Designer</strong>: “There’s now an objective marker on the door, and it has its own icon on the map.”</li>
<li><strong>Combat Designer</strong>: “Enemies will spawn behind doors, and lay cover fire as their allies enter the room. Unless the player is looking inside the door in which case they will spawn behind a different door.”</li>
<li><strong>Systems&nbsp;Designer</strong>: “A&nbsp;level 4 player&nbsp;earns 148xp for opening this door at the cost of 3 gold.”</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Designer</strong>: “We could charge the player $.99 to open the door now, or wait 24 hours for it to open automatically.”</li>
<li><span>QA Tester</span>: “I walked to the door. I ran to the door. I jumped at the door. I stood in the doorway until it closed. I saved and reloaded and walked to the door. I died and reloaded then walked to&nbsp;the door. I threw grenades at the door.”</li>
<li><strong>UX / Usability Researcher</strong>: “I found some people on Craigslist to go through the door so we could see what problems crop&nbsp;up.”</li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Localization</strong>: “Door. Puerta. Porta. Porte.&nbsp;Tür. Dør. Deur. Drzwi. Drws.&nbsp;문”</li>
<li><strong>Producer</strong>: “Do we need to give everyone those&nbsp;doors or can we save them for a pre-order bonus?”</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong>: “Those doors&nbsp;are really going to help this game stand out during the fall line-up.”</li>
<li><strong>CEO:</strong> “I want you all to know how much I appreciate the time and effort put into making those doors.”</li>
<li><strong>PR</strong>: “To all our fans, you’re going to go&nbsp;crazy over our next reveal #gamedev #doors #nextgen #retweet”</li>
<li><strong>Community Manager</strong>: “I let the fans know that their concerns about doors will be addressed in the upcoming&nbsp;patch.”</li>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong>: “A player contacted us,&nbsp;confused about doors. I gave them detailed instructions on how to use them.”</li>
<li><span>Player</span>: “I totally didn’t even notice a door there.”</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons I like this example is because it’s so mundane. There’s an impression that game design is flashy and cool and about crazy ideas and fun all the time. But when I start off with, “Let me tell you about doors…” it cuts straight to the everyday practical considerations.</p>
<p><em>Recent edits:&nbsp;Added&nbsp;localization, character artist, system designer, combat designer, composer, audio engineer, monetization designer, and I think that’ll be it for now.</em></p>

            <p>Do you work with Postgres on a daily basis? Write application code that talks
to Postgres? Then check out the bite-sized SQL snippets below that can help
you work faster!</p>

<h3 id="insert-multiple-rows-in-one-statement">Insert Multiple Rows In One Statement</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement can insert more than one row in a single statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>planets</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>gravity</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'earth'</span><span>,</span>    <span>9</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'mars'</span><span>,</span>     <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>7</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'jupiter'</span><span>,</span> <span>23</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-a-row-and-return-automatically-assigned-values">Insert a Row and Return Automatically-assigned Values</h3>

<p>Values auto-generated with DEFAULT/serial/IDENTITY constructs can be returned
by the INSERT statement using the RETURNING clause. From the application
code perspective, such an INSERT is executed like a SELECT that returns a
recordset.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- table with 2 column values auto-generated on INSERT</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>slno</span>       <span>serial</span>      <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span>       <span>text</span>        <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>created_at</span> <span>timestamptz</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>slno</span><span>,</span> <span>created_at</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--      name     | slno |          created_at</span>
<span>-- --------------+------+-------------------------------</span>
<span>--  wooden axe   |    1 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  loom         |    2 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  eye of ender |    3 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="autogenerated-uuid-primary-keys">Autogenerated UUID Primary Keys</h3>

<p>UUIDs are sometimes used instead of primary keys for various reasons. Here is
how you can use an UUID instead of a serial or IDENTITY:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span>    <span>uuid</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>name</span>  <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>;</span>
  
<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--                   id                  |     name</span>
<span>-- --------------------------------------+--------------</span>
<span>--  1cfaae8c-61ff-4e82-a656-99263b7dd0ae | wooden axe</span>
<span>--  be043a89-a51b-4d8b-8378-699847113d46 | loom</span>
<span>--  927d52eb-c175-4a97-a0b2-7b7e81d9bc8e | eye of ender</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-if-not-existing-update-otherwise">Insert If Not Existing, Update Otherwise</h3>

<p>In Postgres 9.5 and later, you can <em>upsert</em> directly using the ON CONFLICT
construct:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>key</span>   <span>TEXT</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>-- when "key" causes a constraint violation, update the "value"</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> 
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'port'</span><span>,</span> <span>'5432'</span><span>)</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>CONFLICT</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>DO</span>
            <span>UPDATE</span> <span>SET</span> <span>value</span><span>=</span><span>EXCLUDED</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="copy-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Copy Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement has a form where the values can be supplied by a SELECT
statement. Use this to copy rows from one table into another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy between tables with similar columns </span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>pending_quests</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>progress</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- supply some values from another table, some directly</span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>archived_quests</span>
       <span>SELECT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>AS</span> <span>archival_date</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span>
         <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>completed</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’re looking to bulk-load tables, also check out the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html">COPY command</a>,
which can be used to insert rows from a text or CSV file.</p>

<h3 id="delete-and-return-deleted-information">Delete and Return Deleted Information</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>RETURNING</code> clause to return values from the rows that were
deleted using a bulk-delete statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- return the list of customers whose licenses were deleted after expiry</span>
<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>licenses</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>expiry_date</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>customer_name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="move-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Move Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>You can move rows from one table to another in a single statement, by using CTEs
with <em>DELETE .. RETURNING</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- move yet-to-start todo items from 2020 to 2021</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>ah_well</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>todos_2020</span>
          <span>WHERE</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>started</span>
      <span>RETURNING</span> <span>*</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>todos_2021</span>
            <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>ah_well</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="update-rows-and-return-updated-values">Update Rows and Return Updated Values</h3>

<p>The RETURNING clause can be used in UPDATEs too. Note that only the new
values of the updated columns can be returned this way.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- grant random amounts of coins to eligible players</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>coins</span> <span>=</span> <span>coins</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>random</span><span>())::</span><span>integer</span>
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>eligible</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>coins</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you need the original value of the updated columns: it is possible through a
self-join, but there is no guarantee of atomicity. Try using a <code>SELECT .. FOR
UPDATE</code> instead.</p>

<h3 id="update-a-few-random-rows-and-return-the-updated-ones">Update a Few Random Rows and Return The Updated Ones</h3>

<p>Here’s how you can choose a few random rows from a table, update them and
return the updated ones, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>WITH</span> <span>lucky_few</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span>
      <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span>
  <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>random</span><span>()</span>
     <span>LIMIT</span> <span>5</span>
<span>)</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>=</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> 
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>lucky_few</span><span>)</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-a-table-just-like-another-table">Create a Table Just Like Another Table</h3>

<p>Use the CREATE TABLE .. LIKE construct to create a table with the same columns
as another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By default this does not create similar indexes, constraints, defaults etc. To
do that, ask Postgres explicitly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span> <span>INCLUDING</span> <span>ALL</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See the full syntax <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="extract-a-random-set-of-rows-into-another-table">Extract a Random Set of Rows Into Another Table</h3>

<p>Since Postgres 9.5, the TABLESAMPLE feature is available to extract a sample of
rows from a table. There are two sampling methods currently, and <em>bernoulli</em> is
usually the one you want:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy 10% of today's purchases into another table</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>to_be_audited</span>
     <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
       <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
<span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <em>system</em> tablesampling method is faster, but does not return a uniform
distribution. See the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM">docs</a>
for more info.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-table-from-a-select-query">Create a Table From a Select Query</h3>

<p>You can use the CREATE TABLE .. AS construct to create the table and populate
it from a SELECT query, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>AS</span>
      <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
        <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
 <span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
       <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The resultant table is like a materialized view without a query associated with
it. Read more about <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">CREATE TABLE .. AS here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="create-unlogged-tables">Create Unlogged Tables</h3>

<p><em>Unlogged</em> tables are not backed by WAL records. This means that updates and
deletes to such tables are faster, but they are not crash-tolerant and cannot
be replicated.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>report_20200817</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-temporary-tables">Create Temporary Tables</h3>

<p><em>Temporary</em> tables are implicitly unlogged tables, with a shorter lifetime. They
automatically self-destruct at the end of a session (default), or at the end
of the transaction.</p>

<p>Data within temporary tables cannot be shared across sessions. Multiple sessions
can create temporary tables with the same name.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- temp table for duration of the session</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- temp table that will self-destruct after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                      <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                      <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DROP</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- temp table that will TRUNCATE itself after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>ROWS</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>



<p>Comments can be added to any object in the database. Many tools, including
pg_dump, understand these. A useful comment might just avoid a ton of trouble
during cleanup!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>idx_report_last_updated</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'needed for the nightly report app running in dc-03'</span><span>;</span>

<span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>TRIGGER</span> <span>tgr_fix_column_foo</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'mitigates the effect of bug #4857'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="advisory-locks">Advisory Locks</h3>

<p>Advisory locks can be used to co-ordinate actions between two apps connected to
the <em>same</em> database. You can use this feature to implement a global, distributed
mutex for a certain operation, for example. Read all about it <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS">here in the
docs</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- client 1: acquire a lock </span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- ... do work ...</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_unlock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- client 2: tries to do the same thing, but mutually exclusive</span>
<span>-- with client 1</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span> <span>-- blocks if anyone else has held lock with id 130</span>

<span>-- can also do it without blocking:</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_try_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- returns false if lock is being held by another client</span>
<span>-- otherwise acquires the lock then returns true</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregate-into-arrays-json-arrays-or-strings">Aggregate Into Arrays, JSON Arrays or Strings</h3>

<p>Postgres provides aggregate functions that concatenate values in a <em>GROUP</em> to
yield arrays, JSON arrays or strings:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- get names of each guild, with an array of ids of players that</span>
<span>-- belong to that guild</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- same but the player list is a CSV string</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but the player list is a JSONB array</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>jsonb_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but returns a nice JSONB object like so:</span>
<span>-- { guild1: [ playerid1, playerid2, .. ], .. }</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>jsonb_object_agg</span><span>(</span><span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>players</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>q</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregates-with-order">Aggregates With Order</h3>

<p>While we’re on the topic, here’s how to set the order of values that are passed
to the aggregate function, <em>within each group</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- each state with a list of counties sorted alphabetically</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>states</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>counties</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>state_name</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Yes, there is a trailing ORDER BY clause inside the function call paranthesis.
Yes, the syntax is weird.</p>

<h3 id="array-and-unnest">Array and Unnest</h3>

<p>Use the ARRAY constructor to convert a set of rows, each with one column, into
an array.  The database driver (like JDBC) should be able to map Postgres arrays
into native arrays and might be easier to work with.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- convert rows (with 1 column each) into a 1-dimensional array</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>lifetime_spen…</span></code></pre></figure></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>With QFlow.ai coming out of beta, I wanted to share a bit about what QFlow.ai is and does, but also try to answer the question: why build QFlow.ai?</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the problem. Both I and my co-founder have spent years in executive
positions (CFO, VP Finance, VP Operations, VP Marketing, etc.) at B2B companies. At each company, between sales,
marketing, customer success, and finance, <strong>we had a lot of tools generating a lot of data</strong>. But our organizations were by and large
stuck with outdated tools and skills to analyze that data.</p>

<li><a href="#what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s next?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/DataSources.gif" alt="Lots of data, not much information"></p>
<h2 id="deceivingly-simple-but-important-questions-are-notoriously-difficult-to-answer-for-b2b-sales--marketing-professionals">Deceivingly simple but important questions are notoriously difficult to answer for B2B sales &amp; marketing professionals</h2>
<p>Often the simplest of questions that we ask of our data are difficult to answer reliably,
accurately, and efficiently. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the customer acquisition journey look like, from marketing, to sales, to customer success?</li>
<li>What programs, marketing campaigns, and sales tools are yielding the best outcomes? What about relative to cost?</li>
<li>How much time is it taking for our sales reps to follow up on an inbound lead?</li>
<li>What happened to the opportunities that made up the $XX million dollars in last month’s sales forecast?</li>
<li>What types of outbound sales activities are yielding productive vs. unproductive outcomes? Which sales behaviors can we model our playbook around?</li>
<li>How can we more accurately predict conversions? How can we more accurately forecast renewals?</li>
<li>Can we fix lead scoring and build trust between sales and marketing?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-properly-analyze-a-b2b-business-a-data-warehouse-is-required-but-alone-is-insufficient">To properly analyze a B2B business, a data warehouse is required but alone is insufficient</h2>
<p>Addressing these questions with intellectual honesty turned out to be a slippery slope.
If we got engineering to stand up a data warehouse, we would then require a data engineering resource. If we got a data engineering resource, we
would then have to compete for her/his time and attention with more interesting projects.</p>
<p>And, even if we successfully had convinced a capable data engineer to help us maintain the data warehouse, that was just the
beginning. <strong>We would <em>still</em> need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy lifting in terms of data transformation, far beyond the capabilities of SQL</li>
<li>to overcome disagreements / the lack of belief in marketing attribution models</li>
<li>to get stakeholders onboard across sales, marketing, finance, customer success, etc.</li>
<li>analysts to partner with data engineers, <strong>so we could derive <em>useful information</em> from the data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we had data, but found that too often it resulted in little useful information. Managing our business meant we needed to <strong>discard
“intuition” and embrace complex data</strong>, which in turn meant upgrading our organization’s tool set and skill set.
This simply wasn’t feasible most of the time.</p>
<p>So we built QFlow.ai. Because B2B customer-facing teams deserve to use a modern data toolset and its benefits.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-qflow-ai">What is QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>QFlow.ai is a platform that enables B2B businesses to adopt machine learning, embrace complexity, and quickly answer the
questions that matter most. It works not by generating more data, but by using the <strong>data that you already have from</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salesforce.com (standard objects)</li>
<li>Your marketing automation platform (Marketo, Hubspot, Pardot, etc.)</li>
<li>Commonly used marketing platforms (e.g., Google Ads)</li>
<li>Optionally, any custom data that would be relevant to a machine learning model (more on that later)</li>
</ul>
<p>We built QFlow.ai specifically to capture the data needed to engineer a time series based dataset, with
an abstraction layer that sits on top and addresses idiosyncratic implementations of Salesforce.com.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with idiosyncratic business systems implementation, you might understandably have raised an eyebrow just now.</p>
<p>With the understanding each company is different, we built an account setup process that addresses differences in and
builds on  similarities in implementations. It works so well
that we’ve patented it.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/qflow-ai-setup-wizard.png" alt="Simple setup abstracts away complexity"></p>
<p>Rather than spending days, weeks, or months setting up marketing attribution, our beta customers start getting value out of
QFlow.ai over the course of an early afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-qflowai-work">How does QFlow.ai work?</h2>
<p>Let’s address how QFlow.ai works at a high level.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, QFlow.ai creates a secure data warehouse for you and you alone — into which it pulls your corporate data</li>
<li>It uses existing data in your CRM and marketing platform to generate data visualizations and power machine learning recipes (more on that later)</li>
<li>It then re-assembles standard and, optionally, custom data to a format amenable to machine learning</li>
<li>And it works out of the box, requiring mere minutes of configuration — not days or months of setup / professional services
<img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/QFlow-Platform-Overview-Aug-2020.png" alt="QFlow Platform Basics"></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-qflow-ai-do">What are the capabilities of QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>As of August 2020, the Standard Plan QFlow.ai includes the following major features:</p>
<table>

<h2 id="different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates QFlow.ai Standard from QFlow Pro? (Machine Learning Recipes)</h2>
<p>Originally, we planned on much more differentiation. But at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made a decision to shove as much functionality as
possible into the QFlow.ai standard plan at a very low-friction price  ($699/mo paid annually, $899/mo paid monthly).</p>
<p>The primary difference between the two plans today is that <a href="https://qflow.ai/products/machine-learning">Machine Learning Recipes</a>
are available in Pro. This is not “machine learning” in a box. Instead, we’ve developed templates for machine learning
models that address common use cases in B2B. These templates are building blocks that, when deployed, are trained
and tuned machine learning models. <strong>We call these pre-built templates Machine Learning (ML) Recipes.</strong></p>
<p>Our two most popular Machine Learning recipes address <strong>lead scoring</strong> and <strong>opportunity scoring</strong>.</p>
<p>A typical Machine Learning recipe relies on standard information gleaned from your Salesforce.com and marketing platform integration,
but all recipes in our library can ingest <strong>custom data</strong> (e.g., product usage data, # API calls, seat utilization).</p>
<p>The inferred results from your ML jobs are available both on the QFlow.ai platform
and in your Salesforce.com instance. This way, your employees are able to orient their workday more intelligently without disruption.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s on the roadmap for QFlow.ai</h2>
<p>We have built a lot in 9 short months, but there remains a lot to build. If you are a capable data scientist, devops
engineer, marketing or sales professional, or have a skill set that offers a unique contribution to our journey, we’re
interested talking with you about a fulfilling job.</p>
<p><strong>It’s been humbling to see our earliest customers use QFlow.ai transform the way that they approach generating and retaining B2B revenue
in a cost-effective way.</strong> During our limited private beta, QFlow.ai generated insights for customers that saved hundreds of thousands
of dollars in ineffective spend, increased forecastable pipeline for sales team by 2.4x, and measurably
worked to get marketing, sales, and finance teams on the same page.</p>
<p>So, what’s next? More building, more listening. An occasional blog post to try to let you know what we’re up to.
And a couple dedicated features for Customer Success teams to complement our ML recipe that predicts and helps mitigate churn.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to join us on this journey, let us know by <a href="https://qflow.ai/contact-us">scheduling a time for a demo</a>.
Until then, we’ll be hard at work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to sort a list in Python, by following the below three steps:</p> <ol><li>Options to sort a list in Python<ul><li>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</li><li>An example of using “sort”</li><li>An example of using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>How to Sort a List in Reverse<ul><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sort”</li><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>Sort with a Custom Function using Key</li></ol> <h2>1. Options to sort a list in Python</h2> <p>There exist two main options, those are <code>sort()</code> and <code>sorted()</code>, let’s explore them below.</p> <h3>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</h3> <p><code>list.sort()</code> changes the list in place and returns <code>None</code>.</p> <p><code>sorted()</code> takes an iterable and returns a new list, sorted.</p> <h3>An example of using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort()

# print the new list
print(new_list)
# result: None

print(our_list)
# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how it changes the list itself, but does not return a value to be placed into a new variable.</p> <h3>An example of using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how the changes are saved to the new list/variable.</p> <h2>2. How to Sort a List in Reverse</h2> <p>Using the above functions, it’s simple to sort a list in reverse. Just specify the <code>reverse</code> argument and set it to <code>True</code>.</p> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort(reverse=True)

print(our_list)
# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list, reverse=True)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h2>3. Sort with a Custom Function using Key</h2> <p>It is also possible to implement your own sorting method. This is done by adding a <code>key</code> parameter and setting it to a method.</p>  <p>For example:</p> <pre title=""># create a list of different length items
our_list = ["fasd", "asstt", "cqasf", "zqfwsef", "ba"]

# sort the list, by `len`
new_list = sorted(our_list, key=len)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['ba', 'fasd', 'asstt', 'cqasf', 'zqfwsef']
</pre> <p>Just as we used <code>sorted</code> here, you could also have used <code>list.sort</code> as follows:</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len)
</pre> <p>As before, you can also combine the <code>reverse=True</code> argument should you want the reverse order.</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len, reverse=True)

# or

sorted(our_list, key=len, reverse=True)
</pre> <p>You could also swap out the use of the <code>len</code> method as the custom <code>key</code> with your own function, or lambda, to sort by some custom choice.</p> <p>For example:</p>  <pre title="">student_tuples = [('john', 'A', 15),('jane', 'B', 12),('dave', 'B', 10),]
sorted(student_tuples, key=lambda student: student[2]) 

# result: [('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
</pre> <p>Or in another example:</p> <pre title="">lst = [('candy','30','100'), ('apple','10','200'), ('baby','20','300')]
lst.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
print(lst)

# result: [('apple', '10', '200'), ('baby', '20', '300'), ('candy', '30', '100')]
</pre>  </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent"><p><img alt="Pull doughnuts" src="https://www.grouparoo.com/_next/static/images/doughnuts-90d02f03fc3e2d5704ed88886a47f9df.jpg"></p><p>There’s an underlying pattern prevalent today in many digital marketing tools that is causing problems. Wasted time, overpaying, slow velocity, and privacy issues for your customers are some of the results of this pattern. The problem is the over-reliance on Events. Specifically, the problem is that many marketing tools live in a world where they expect to be “pushed” data, when it would be so much better if they were “pulling” data when they needed it.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll explore the problems with event-based “Push” marketing &amp; analytics tools, and how we can fix them by switching to a “Pull” based solution, like the one that <a href="https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo">Grouparoo</a> is building.</p><h2>The Problems with “Push” and Events</h2><p>We have conducted interviews with over 70 marketing teams of all sizes throughout the world. What follows is a synthesis of some of the common problems they face with their current marketing tools.</p><h3>Overpaying</h3><p>One of the most telling critiques of event-based SaaS marketing tools is the fact that marketing teams are /actively/ pruning the events they are sending to control costs. Tools like Segment work best when you can build a robust profile of your customers' activity, but Segment charges you more when you store more data! Segment essentially holds their functionality hostage as you gain more users who in turn produce more events. Countless marketers lamented pain of having to decide which events to keep tracking versus which to stop tracking. Inevitably, a new campaign idea would hit them a few months later that would need the event that they stopped tracking. These teams and marketers just didn’t have the money to keep sending every event. This takes us to the Stale Data problem.</p><h3>Stale Data</h3><p>When using only events to model your customers, there’s a huge lag time between when you start capturing that data and when you can use it. For example, say you want to run a campaign targeting customers who haven’t purchased in 6 months. If you start sending <code>purchase</code> events in June, the soonest you can start your campaign is December. Not only is that a long time to wait, but you’ve also sacrificed your team’s agility to modify those events or the campaign while you wait, <a href="https://www.grouparoo.com/blog/the-shots-you-get-to-take">minimizing the shots you get to take</a>.</p><h3>Lost History</h3><p>In addition to the slow ramp up time for a new campaign based on events, there’s the problem of lost events. With poor mobile connections, errors on your web pages &amp; apps, slow vendors, and increasingly prevalent ad-blocking tools, it’s very easy to lose an event. Every marketer we talked to had their own less-than-scientific process they used to explain discrepancies between events and product data. Everyone had a different process and no one really trusted an event-based data source. If events are the only way you model your customers, it can be devastating if you miss a <code>changed-email-address</code> event - you might never be able to reach your customers at all!</p><p>Coupling this issue with the Stale Data problem, there’s no way to fully model customers you had before you started sending events. There’s no way to compare the profile you’ve built in Segment against your product database, where the customer’s data is actually stored with confidence.</p><h3>Privacy Nightmare</h3><p>Finally, there’s a challenging privacy story regarding events. You have a relationship with your customers and part of that relationship is based on trust. How sure are you that Segment or Mixpanel is storing your customers' data safely? How many other services do your events pass though on the way to them? Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager? AdMob? Facebook or Twitter Pixels? The list goes on and on. Any one of these vendors is a potential vector for attack, event theft, or event manipulation.</p><p>With regulations like GDPR and CCPA and many more on the way, you have a clear legal responsibility to keep your customers' data safe. Part of that responsibility is ensuring that the companies you share data with will update, delete, and anonymize data when <em>you</em> ask them too. What’s your process for doing that for all of your past events?</p><h2>The future is "Pull"</h2><p>How would you build things if you were starting today? We would focus on pulling in data from our existing sources, of course!</p><p>Now, imagine you were starting to build a new marketing tool from scratch, like <a href="https://www.grouparoo.com/">Grouparoo</a> is. You aren’t burdened by the poor legacy choices of Segment, Mixpanel, and the rest. How would you build things if you were starting today? We would focus on pulling in data from our existing data sources. With Grouparoo, events are a way to augment your customer profiles, not the main source of critical data.</p><p>Grouparoo’s goal is to make it easy for non-technical members of your team to build robust customer profiles and groups. Then, they can synchronize that data in a safe way to communication and advertising partners. A highly-functioning digital marketing team can quickly add new profile properties, augment them with data from your product and data warehouse(s), and start running a new campaign in minutes, rather than weeks.</p><h3>Within your Firewall</h3><p>To be in the best position to pull in data, the Grouparoo application should be located within your company firewall. This means that Grouparoo should run on <em>your</em> servers and have (read) access to your databases. In this way, no data ever leaves your company’s control, and you can always inspect, audit, and change it. You don’t need to send your customer data over the open internet to a third party just to build a new cohort.</p><h3>Safe and Secure</h3><p>Since your customer data lives where it belongs on your servers, you can make changes and deletions as needed, and you can prove it. You can build a transparent GDPR/CCPA process at your company with Grouparoo. Grouparoo has robust access controls and logs to ensure that every profile and group is managed the way it should be.</p><h3>Cost Controls</h3><p>Since Grouparoo is running on your servers, there’s no additional cost to import more data. If you want to add more properties to your customer profiles to build more fine-grained groups and cohorts, then do it! Have you imported a facet you no longer need? Delete it! Grouparoo doesn't charge per event, or any other measure of data quantity, so you are free to experiment at will.</p><h3>Always up-to-date</h3><p>The “Pull” pattern has a wonderful property; Grouparoo can check up on the data whenever we are about to use it! This means that rather than waiting for an event to (possibly) be sent to Grouparoo to update a customer’s preferences or LTV, we can ask the primary source. Grouparoo will always re-import the properties of every profile before sending a communication to the customer, or syncing with a third party. This means that you can be sure that you’ll always be working with the latest customer preferences, purchase, email address, names, etc. when communicating with them. No lost events will prevent you from communicating effectively.</p><h3>Ready for ad-blocking technology by respecting consumer choices</h3><p>Finally, the pattern of tracking and sending <strong>so many</strong> events from our sites and applications is leading to more and more consumers blocking tools like Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Google Analytics from getting any events at all. In fact, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking">major browsers are now shipping with defaults to prevent third-party tracking and cookies</a>. Rather than fight the modern privacy-conscious consumer because your marketing stack relies on events, embrace the choices they are making. Utilize your source-of-truth of their behavior and preferences you already have, your product database.</p><h2>Grouparoo’s Open-Source Promise</h2><p>There’s still a place for events in your marketing stack, but they shouldn’t be the primary source of any piece of customer data. Grouparoo’s goal is to embrace the “Pull” data model as much as we can, and this means making it as easy as possible for you to install and run it within your cloud. To that end, Grouparoo’s core product is <strong>available for free</strong>, under the <a href="https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">Mozilla 2.0 Open Source License</a>.

    <p>You might already be using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for logins to your AWS account.
This will cause AWS to prompt you for your MFA token when you log in via the web console.
However, if you use AWS via command-line tools (e.g., <code>terraform</code> or <code>aws s3</code>), you might have issued yourself access keys.
Those are single-factor, and if they leak, anyone on the internet can use them to do horrible things to your account.</p>

<p>We can make your admin AWS accounts safer by requiring MFA, even for API requests.
First, put your account, and the account of all other admins in your AWS account, in a group like <code>AdminMFA</code>.
This group should have a policy that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
    </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
        </span><span>"*"</span><span>
      </span><span>],</span><span>
      </span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"*"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"Bool"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"true"</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="direnv-config">Direnv Config</h2>

<p>Now, you’ll need a mechanism to put authenticate via your MFA token, get a session token, and put that session token into your environment.
I do this using <a href="https://direnv.net/"><code>direnv</code></a>.
I’ve only recently learned about <code>direnv</code>, and I’m already using it, in combination with <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm"><code>asdf</code></a>, to replace <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv"><code>rbenv</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv"><code>pyenv</code></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv"><code>nodenv</code></a>.
<code>direnv</code> and <code>asdf</code> setup is beyond the scope of this post, but you can check out <a href="https://github.com/igor47/dotfiles">my dotfiles repo</a> to get an idea of how I have it configured.</p>

<p>Here’s my configuration in a <code>.envrc</code> file of a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">terraform</a> repo for a project hosted on AWS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>use asdf

export MASTER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA&lt;redacted&gt;
export MASTER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;redacted&gt;
export AWS_MFA_ARN=arn:aws:iam::&lt;redacted&gt;:mfa/igor
export AWS_SESSION_FILE="${HOME}/.config/aws/session-${MASTER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"

watch_file $AWS_SESSION_FILE
direnv_load ~/bin/aws_load_session
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This file causes 4 environment variables to be exported into my environment whenever I <code>cd</code> into this repo’s directory.
The <code>MASTER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> and <code>MASTER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> are just the access key ID and key that I created for my account via IAM.
I’ve prefixed their usual environment variable names with <code>MASTER</code> to distinguish them from the session-specific keys created by authenticating with MFA.
The <code>AWS_MFA_ARN</code> variable contains the ID of my MFA token.
You can get this from <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials">your security credentials page</a>, under the <code>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</code> section.
Finally, the <code>AWS_SESSION_FILE</code> variable will keep track of where my MFA session is stored in my filesystem.</p>

<p>The next two lines handle reloading the MFA session.
I’ve told <code>direnv</code> to reload my local environment whenever the contents of the file at <code>$AWS_SESSION_FILE</code> change.
Next, we use <code>direnv_load</code> (from the <a href="https://direnv.net/man/direnv-stdlib.1.html">direnv stdlib</a>) to load the environment exported by my <code>aws_load_session</code> script.</p>

<h2 id="session-management-scripts">Session-management Scripts</h2>

<p>I have two custom scripts to manage the MFA session.
The first is <code>aws_get_session</code>, and it’s responsible for prompting me for my MFA token, creating an MFA session, and storing it into the <code>AWS_SESSION_FILE</code>.
I run this script whenever my MFA session expires.
Here’s the script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>TOKEN</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span>
<span>shift

</span><span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>-z</span> <span>$TOKEN</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Usage: aws_get_session &lt;mfa token value&gt;"</span>
    <span>exit </span>1
<span>fi

</span><span>set</span> <span>-u</span>

<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> <span>`</span><span>dirname</span> <span>${</span><span>AWS_SESSION_FILE</span><span>}</span><span>`</span>
<span>unset </span>AWS_SESSION_TOKEN

<span>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>MASTER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span>}</span> <span>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>MASTER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span>}</span> aws sts get-session-token <span>--serial-number</span> <span>$AWS_MFA_ARN</span> <span>--token-code</span> <span>${</span><span>TOKEN</span><span>}</span> <span>&gt;</span> ~/.config/aws/session-<span>${</span><span>MASTER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span>}</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>${</span><span>AWS_SESSION_FILE</span><span>}</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"saved session info to </span><span>${</span><span>AWS_SESSION_FILE</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other script, <code>aws_load_session</code>, loads the MFA session into my environment.
It’s run by <code>direnv</code>, whenever the <code>AWS_SESSION_FILE</code> changes.
Here’s the script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>set</span> <span>-u</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>!</span> <span>-f</span> <span>${</span><span>AWS_SESSION_FILE</span><span>}</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
  </span><span>echo</span> <span>"No session found; did you run </span><span>`</span>aws_get_session &lt;mfa token&gt;<span>`</span><span> ?"</span>
<span>fi

</span><span>export </span><span>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span>=</span><span>`</span><span>cat</span> <span>${</span><span>AWS_SESSION_FILE</span><span>}</span> | jq <span>--raw-output</span> .Credentials.AccessKeyId<span>`</span>
<span>export </span><span>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>`</span><span>cat</span> <span>${</span><span>AWS_SESSION_FILE</span><span>}</span> | jq <span>--raw-output</span> .Credentials.SecretAccessKey<span>`</span>
<span>export </span><span>AWS_SESSION_TOKEN</span><span>=</span><span>`</span><span>cat</span> <span>${</span><span>AWS_SESSION_FILE</span><span>}</span> | jq <span>--raw-output</span> .Credentials.SessionToken<span>`</span>
direnv dump
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both of these scripts depend on having <code>aws</code> and <code>jq</code> installed and in your <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<h2 id="example-session">Example Session</h2>

<p>Here’s how this looks in real use, with a terraform repo that stores it’s state in AWS S3.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>igor47@fortress:~/repos/terraform/roots/prod {master} $ terraform plan

Error: error using credentials to get account ID: error calling sts:GetCallerIdentity: ExpiredToken: The security token included in the request is expired

igor47@fortress:~/repos/terraform/roots/prod {master} $ terraform plan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, <code>terraform plan</code> fails because my MFA session has expired.
I re-run <code>aws_get_session</code> to update my <code>AWS_SESSION_FILE</code>.
<code>direnv</code> notices that the file has been updated, and reloads the environment.
I can then continue using <code>terraform</code> as normal.
As a bonus, in any other shell, the session will also be re-loaded automatically whenever I get a new prompt.</p>

Often, these algorithms are solutions that have stumbled upon some good problems to solve. Unfortunately, the problems are evolving. And I don’t think these solutions are going to remain relevant much longer. Let’s start with defining the problems they solve:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Distributed Durability:</strong> In case of node failures, your data is guaranteed to be elsewhere.</li><li><strong>Availability:</strong> The ability for the system to continue serving if some nodes have become unavailable.</li><li><strong>Automation:</strong> If there is a failure, the system knows how to remedy itself without human intervention.</li></ul><figure id="w-node-d4ab4f4234b1-ca993012"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ef5a4d4da0d67ccda9b5588/5f497703db3131567e9cf57c_consensus-02.png" loading="lazy" alt="Consensus Algorithms at Scale"></p><figcaption> </figcaption></figure><p>Strictly speaking, one could argue that Automation is a different theoretical problem because it requires failure detection. But the reality is that today’s systems expect consensus systems to satisfy the above properties.<br></p><p>Let us now turn this around: If we had started out with these requirements, would we have ended up with something like Paxos or Raft as the best solution? Before we can answer this question, we need a better understanding of the requirements.<br></p><p>More importantly, cloud providers are coming up with complex topologies like zones and regions. They have pricing structures that encourage specific configurations. It is important that the systems we build are capable of adapting to these nuances. It is only a matter of time before these rigid algorithms start to run out of flexibility.<br></p><p>The spoiler here is that we are building this type of flexibility in Vitess: You specify what is important to you, and what (reasonable) trade-offs you are willing to make. And Vitess will have the knobs to exactly match these parameters without compromising on anything else.<br></p><p>However, we need to satisfy the skeptic’s concern: can you build such a system using vanilla MySQL? The short answer is yes.<br>‍<br></p><h4><strong>The Approach</strong></h4><p>In this series of blog posts, I’ll take you through a journey where we will dissect consensus algorithms. We’ll break them up into smaller concerns, and we’ll build a new set of rules and principles using a variety of more flexible algorithms which can be built. We will conclude with how to achieve these objectives in Vitess.<br></p><p>As a disclaimer, this is an engineering approach. So, if you are expecting proof, you’ll likely be disappointed. I will instead be using and sharing intuitions developed from running storage systems at massive scale. Consequently, we will make two changes to how we approach this problem:</p><ol role="list"><li>Use engineering terminology. This is more for my own sake, because it is hard to reason about how an academic concept maps to real-world scenarios.</li><li>Use an approach based on objectives to be achieved: approaching the problem top-down, identifying the concerns, and keeping them separate.<br></li></ol><p>The second aspect is significant because most consensus algorithms perform orchestrated actions that achieve multiple objectives at the same time. It is hard to know why a decision was made a certain way and what the trade-offs are if a different approach was used.<br></p><p>With a better understanding of&nbsp; the concerns, we can make better trade-offs without being stuck with rigid implementations.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p id="6cad">Let’s take a closer look at the technical aspects of this technology (Global Positioning Systems), starting with the satellites and working our way down to the receivers on the ground.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*rBAMjm_JHGi1SBqs8vgu5g.png?resize=586%2C350&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="586" height="350" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*rBAMjm_JHGi1SBqs8vgu5g.png?resize=586%2C350&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>NavStar GPS satellite</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="2fbd">Background Info</h2>



<p id="2901">The&nbsp;<strong>Global Positioning System (GPS)</strong>, originally known as&nbsp;<strong>NavStar</strong>, was created by the US military back in 1995. NavStar was originally a collection of over two dozen GPS satellites in geosynchronous orbit.</p>



<p id="b621">Nowadays, NavStar has grown to a network of over 30 satellites orbiting the Earth approximately 13,000 miles above the surface. These satellites make two passes over the same spot every day as they move in their west to east orbit.</p>



<p id="a1d9">While other countries are developing their own GPS satellite networks, the US NavStar system is still the standard.</p>



<p id="ab50">Only 24 satellites are needed to provide line of sight coverage to 95% of Earth’s surface. The remaining function primarily as backup and are queried only when more accuracy is needed.</p>



<h2 id="b2ef">Satellites</h2>



<p id="491c">The most critical component on board these satellites is the&nbsp;<strong>atomic clock</strong>. As you’ll soon see, reliable timekeeping is the single most important function of these satellites.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Atomic clocks are designed to measure the precise length of a second, the base unit of modern timekeeping. The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the time it takes a caesium-133 atom in a precisely defined state to oscillate exactly: 9 billion, 192 million, 631 thousand, 770 times.”</p><p>— Live Science</p></blockquote>



<p id="fb6e"><strong>GPS Payload</strong></p>



<p id="2528">GPS is inherently a passive system. The GPS satellites do not receive any information.</p>



<p id="ed4f">Instead, each satellite reports at regular intervals:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Pseudo Random Code</strong>&nbsp;— an identification value for the satellite (used by the receiver to decode the signal)</li><li><strong>Almanac Data&nbsp;</strong>— the position of the satellite at any given moment in time and orbital information about all other active satellites (this informs the receiver about which satellites should be available and at what time -helping the receiver to more quickly acquire a GPS fix)</li><li><strong>Ephemeris Data</strong>&nbsp;— more specific information about the satellite: it’s current date, time, health, and location. This data is broadcasted approximately every 30 seconds by NavStar satellites. Ephemeris data is usually updated every 2 hours and is valid for 4 hours.</li></ol>



<h2 id="51d9">From A Cold Start</h2>



<p id="66be">Despite the frequency of the broadcast, the almanac alone is generally not accurate enough for a GPS receiver to get a location fix — especially if the GPS receiver is launching from a cold start.</p>



<p id="aec2">More often that not, the cached almanac information of the GPS receiver will be out of date, so some receivers — especially older ones — may have to wait upwards of 10 minutes to receive a full almanac and ephemeris data broadcast from each satellite before they can provide a GPS fix.</p>



<p id="064f">Additionally, ephemeris data has a natural expiry as it can’t be cached for too long due to clock drift. Waiting for the broadcast and reception of updated ephemeris data is the main cause for the long start time of GPS receivers.</p>



<h4 id="3be9"><strong>A-GPS</strong></h4>



<p id="1491">Luckily most modern devices, like today’s smartphones, are able to minimize this wait time. Most modern mobile devices use a variant of traditional GPS technology called A-GPS ( Assisted Global Positioning System) that helps them acquire a GPS fix quickly.</p>



<p id="07cf">A-GPS works by leveraging the phone’s data connection to contact an assistance server. The server will provide the almanac and ephemeris data directly, so the phone no longer needs to wait for the transmission from the satellite. However, once you are out of cell coverage, the phone would then revert back to the onboard GPS unit and will need several minutes to acquire the ephemeris and almanac data in the traditional manner.</p>



<h4 id="a00a"><strong>GPS Signal</strong></h4>



<p id="aa56">Most GPS transmissions are in the UHF portion of the frequency spectrum. Most civilian GPS communication is done on&nbsp;<strong>1575.42&nbsp;<em>MHz</em>&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;<em>1227.60 MHz</em></strong>.</p>



<p id="1531">Additionally, GPS signal uses CDMA spread-spectrum techniques in order to allow all satellites to transmit on the same frequency without interfering with one another.</p>



<h4 id="aae1"><strong>GPS Transmission</strong></h4>



<p id="52c8">According to RadioElectronics, standard GPS transmission is roughly 15000 bits in length and is transmitted at a rate of 50 bits / second — taking about 30 seconds to complete the transmission.</p>



<p id="9c18">The frame is split up into 5 sub-frames each 300 bits in length with a transmission time of 6 seconds.</p>



<p id="b0d2">The frames help the receiver identify the start and end of the transmission so they can easily synchronize with the incoming signals and decode the transmission.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Sub-Frame 1:&nbsp;</strong>Clock, GPS Time, Health of Satellite, Satellite ID</p><p><strong>Sub-Frame 2–3:</strong>&nbsp;Ephemeris Data</p><p><strong>Sub-Frame 4–5:</strong>&nbsp;Almanac Data</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="c16d">Receiver</h2>



<h4 id="950a">Trilateration</h4>



<p id="9d46">GPS, on the receiver side, works by using an approach called&nbsp;<strong>trilateration</strong>.</p>



<p id="2646">Imagine I told you I was 150 miles from Los Angeles, 200 miles from Las Vegas, and 75 miles from your Fresno.</p>



<p id="83f1">With just those 3 distance values, you would be able to determine a region that matches these constraints and would be able to estimate my current location within that region. The more distance measurements you have, the more accurate your estimate of my location becomes.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/526/1*PZaGjJw3W-TQl3DmkpahjA.png?resize=578%2C558&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="578" height="558" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/526/1*PZaGjJw3W-TQl3DmkpahjA.png?resize=578%2C558&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Trilateration Example</figcaption></figure></div>



<p id="c6d2">GPS requires at minimum distances to 3 satellite in order to get a fix on your location. As we already known, GPS signals include the location of the satellite and the time according to the satellite’s internal clock. If we measure the time that we receive the message and compare the difference in time to the time the message was sent from the satellite, we can figure out how long the message was in transit. Additionally, knowing that all of these signals are sent at the speed of light, we can multiply these two values together to compute your straight line distance to a particular satellite.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/proxy/0*HY7l7PcoJBE_eqXK.jpg?resize=582%2C422&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="582" height="422" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/proxy/0*HY7l7PcoJBE_eqXK.jpg?resize=582%2C422&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="b6c2">Satellites use expensive atomic clocks for this very reason. The more accurate the time value transmitted, the more accurate the receiver can be about it’s distance to the satellite.</p>



<p id="7cc7">Though we can figure out a user’s 2D location using just 3 satellites, using a 4th satellite allows us to compute an altitude value. While a 2D location fix might work for some cases as GPS would assume you’re near sea level, if you were on a mountain, a 2D fix could have an error of several hundred meters.</p>



<p id="5d42">Furthermore, because receivers — like a mobile phone — often have cheaper less accurate clocks — we need to account for the timing error introduced by the cheaper hardware and other environmental factors (decreases in the signal’s speed caused by the ionosphere and the troposphere). Using a 4th satellite will not only provide an altitude value, but it will allow us to solve a system of equations that let’s us identify the clock error and compute a more accurate position.</p>



<p id="30e2">Most modern GPS receivers will use this additional information to try and synchronize their internal clock with the satellite’s atomic clock.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*VV60PICUN4Xnwt6tphqNDQ.png?resize=579%2C297&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" width="579" height="297" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*VV60PICUN4Xnwt6tphqNDQ.png?resize=579%2C297&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="44af">That’s why most modern GPS receivers will typically track all available line of sight satellites, but only use some subset for the actual calculation.</p>



<p id="4221">Now that the GPS receiver’s antenna can pick up at least 4 satellites, it can accurately calculate it’s position and time in 3 dimensions (latitude, longitude, and altitude).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
		
<p>If you’re like me, you’ve wondered how sites like Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram are able to tell you whether a username has been taken so quickly. It seemed like these services were able to search through hundreds of millions of user records to verify the uniqueness of a prospective username in no time at all.</p>



<p>After some research, I came across the data structure that is responsible for this speed – a probabilistic data structure called the bloom filter.</p>



<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>Bloom filters share some similarities with traditional sets. Generally speaking, a set will tell you with certainty whether it contains a particular element or not. Bloom filters, however, make a slightly different promise. </p>



<p>They are probabilistic data structures which means they’ll tell you with certainty whether an element is <em><strong>not</strong></em> in the set and they’ll tell you if it is <em><strong>probably</strong></em> in the set. In other words, there’s a chance that bloom filters will return a false positive. That is, they’ll incorrectly claim that the set contains an element that was never added.</p>



<p>Maybe you’re wondering why a data structure that can only probably tell you if it contains an element is useful? Well, bloom filters are extremely fast and memory-efficient as we’ll soon see. Sometimes the speed and scalability of a solution are more important than the occasional false positives. In practice, if you know what your acceptable false positive rate is, you can calculate an initial size for the bloom filter to guarantee that rate.</p>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>Bloom filters are simply a bit array of <em><code>m</code> </em>bits all initially set to 0. We’ll also need <em><code>k</code></em> different hash functions. These functions will be run over whatever item we are trying to add to the set and will return the indices in the bloom filter to turn from a 0 to a 1.</p>



<p>It’s important that whatever hash functions we choose create a uniform random distribution for best results. There are many industry standard options to pick from: HashMix, murmur, and the fnv series – just to name a few. </p>



<p>Generally, the number of hash functions needed would be a small constant derived from whatever false positive rate is acceptable for your use case. </p>



<h2>Initialization</h2>



<p>Let’s take an empty bloom filter and add an element to it.</p>



<p><code>let size = 10</code></p>



<p><code>let bloomFilter = Array(repeating: false, count: size)&nbsp;</code></p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Adding an element</h2>



<p>To add an element, we’ll take the element we want to add and pass it to all <code><em>k</em></code> hash functions to get <code><em>k</em></code> array indices. We’ll set the value at those indices to 1.</p>



<blockquote><p>In practice, these would not be 3 distinct hashing algorithms. Instead, it’d likely be the same algorithm just seeded with a different value (i.e. <em>1 … k</em>) which will generate <em>k</em> distinct hash functions.</p></blockquote>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm1(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm2(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm3(“digital”) % size] = true</code></p>







<p>Now, it might look something like this:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>And after adding a few more entries to the set:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Querying</h2>



<p>If we wanted to query for an element, we’d do the same operations to get the k array indices. Then, if any of the bits at those indices are 0, we know definitively that the value is not in the set. Instead, if all of the indices values are 1, we know that the value is probably<em> </em>in the set – remember it could still be a false positive.&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>bloomFilter.search(“digital”)</code> which in turn calls:</p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm1(“digital”) % size] // 2</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm2(“digital”) % size] // 6</code></p>



<p><code>bloomFilter[hashAlgorithm3(“digital”) % size] // 7</code></p>



<p>So, to check if the element is in the set, we just need to check indices 2,6, and 7 and verify they are set to 1.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center"><span><strong>1</strong></span></td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center"><strong>1</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>1</strong></td><td data-align="center">0</td><td data-align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>So, now we know that “digital” is probably in the set.</p>



<h2>Limitations</h2>



<p>It’s important to understand that elements can only be added to bloom filters and never removed. We can’t reset particular bits back to 0 because we don’t know if there’s some other element in the set that also maps to those indices. For example, after passing through the hash functions, “dog” and “cat” might share the exact same indices. </p>



<p>Remember the filter isn’t storing the data anywhere unlike traditional sets, arrays, etc, it’s just turning on certain indices.&nbsp;So, there’s no way of checking what word a particular set of indices relates to. </p>



<h2>Big O</h2>



<p>Implementing bloom filters requires us to specify the size upfront, so we can’t enlarge the data structure later. As a result, the more elements we add to the filter, the higher the error rate rises. So, it’s important to choose an initial size for the bloom filter that can scale with your data and allows you to keep a maintainable error rate.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>add(): O(k)<code>&nbsp;</code></p><p>contains(): O(k)</p><p>where k is the number of hash functions. </p></blockquote>



<p>One of the key advantages of bloom filters is that the time to add or check for inclusion in the set is constant; it’s completely independent of the number of items in the set.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>Bloom filters are used everywhere. Chances are in just getting to this site you’ve encountered one. Chrome uses a local Bloom filter to store malicious URLs. Before navigating to a site, the browser will check if the site exists in the set of malicious URLs and if it does it’ll perform a full check on Google’s servers.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="fa89">This week’s edition — edge detection in images. More specifically we’ll be taking a closer look at the Sobel Edge Detection algorithm.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1270/1*3hDhkzqJStXTp37lS_M5aA.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1270/1*3hDhkzqJStXTp37lS_M5aA.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="3f05">Let’s start from the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="77be">Grayscale Images</h2>



<p id="7b79">The Sobel algorithm works by measuring the varying pixel intensity in an image. Naturally, this is easiest to accomplish when the image is a standardized grayscale image.</p>



<p id="f1c5">There are several algorithms to generate grayscale images — the simplest being an average of the R,G, and B values in a pixel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/109/1*A-ZtS4G-IVhhDb4qboYYWQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/109/1*A-ZtS4G-IVhhDb4qboYYWQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="53f5">Then, we re-assign these new intensity values to the R,G, and B fields of the original pixel. Any situation where all the R,G, and B values are the same will give you a shade of gray (remember&nbsp;<em>#00000</em>&nbsp;is black and #<em>FFFFFF</em>&nbsp;is white).</p>



<p id="105e">However, though this often gives good results, the following grayscale function uses a weighted average that is better aligned with how the human eye interprets different colors and the transition between them.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/227/1*llWVqAtpyl65W0V7lqQjUA.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/227/1*llWVqAtpyl65W0V7lqQjUA.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="bd35">Regardless of which formula we use, we now have a grayscale image that we can apply the Sobel Edge Detection algorithm too.</p>



<h2 id="ae13">Sobel Detection Algorithm</h2>



<p id="d390">The Sobel algorithm was developed by Irwin Sobel and Gary Feldman at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) in 1968.</p>



<p id="b93f">In the simplest terms, their algorithm works by running a 3×3 matrix&nbsp;<em>(</em>known as the&nbsp;<em>kernel)&nbsp;</em>over all the pixels in the image. At every iteration, we measure the change in the gradient of the pixels that fall within this 3×3 kernel. The greater the change in pixel intensity, the more significant the edge there is.</p>



<h2 id="b7e3">Convolution</h2>



<p id="43f6">The algorithm relies heavily on a mathematical operation called convolution.</p>



<p id="a297">Convolution is simply the process of multiplying and adding corresponding indices of two matrices together (the kernel and the image matrix) after flipping both the rows and the columns of the kernel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1704/1*h3mCQcE71ayqzhphzindrQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/1704/1*h3mCQcE71ayqzhphzindrQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>The kernel on the left has its rows and columns flipped and then multiplied by the corresponding indices in the image matrix.</p>



<p id="7d73">The standard implementation of the algorithm uses the following 3×3 matrices for the&nbsp;<em>x&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;axis, respectively.</p>

<p>Pre-Convoluted Kernel (A is a matrix containing the image data)</p>

<p>Convoluted version of the kernel above</p>



<p id="a71c">Now, we have completed all of the pre-processing and have the convoluted matrices in hand.</p>



<p id="d5af">We can iterate through all pixels in the original image and apply the image convolution kernels Gx and Gy at every step of the way. This convolution operation will return a single integer for each kernel.</p>



<p id="ea00">Here’s an example of what applying the Gx kernel on a specific pixel (in red) would look like:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*K6WODRbRy-jXSjrxkO2OUg.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/468/1*K6WODRbRy-jXSjrxkO2OUg.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>On the left is the original image with the 3×3 pixel group colored</p>



<p id="0fa7">The penultimate step is to create a new image of the same dimensions as the original image and store for the pixel data, the magnitude of the two gradient values:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/584/1*dY_BnICdMcnm9eyu9p7zwQ.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image for post" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/584/1*dY_BnICdMcnm9eyu9p7zwQ.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p id="66aa">A recommended next step would be to normalize all of the data in the new image by dividing all the pixel values by the greatest gradient magnitude observed.</p>



<p id="414d">Now, you have a new grayscale image whose pixel intensities reflects how close they are to an edge in the original image. Naturally, the higher the gradient value for the pixel, the brighter the edge in the resultant image will appear.</p>

    <p>In June, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://pine64.org/">PINE64</a> reached out to see if elementary would be interested in experimenting with elementary OS on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/">Pinebook Pro</a>. We’d been loosely following PINE64 and the progress of Pinebook Pro, but hadn’t gotten our hands on one—so we expressed our interest. PINE64 was gracious enough to send a few devices out to members of our team, and our work began.</p>

</figure>

<p>First, a bit of a disclaimer: Pinebook Pro support is still considered an experiment for elementary OS, and it’s not something we have committed to officially support indefinitely. That said, the experience so far has been a lot of fun, and we’re happy with the current state. Second, this post isn’t going to get into a lot of details about the hardware itself; for that, see <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cassidyjames.com/blog/pinebook-pro/">Cassidy’s recent personal blog post</a>. Lastly, our work on bringing elementary OS to Pinebook Pro has been made possible by PINE64 generously providing the hardware as well as by funding from our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://builds.elementary.io/">Early Access</a> sponsors. If you’d like to see more projects like this, consider backing us on <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-elementary-os-to-pinebook-pro">Bringing elementary OS to Pinebook Pro</h2>

<p>The process of producing both functional and high-quality builds of elementary OS for Pinebook Pro has been long, but was made substantially easier thanks to help from PINE64 and the work of other projects.</p>

<h3 id="kernel--bootloader">Kernel &amp; Bootloader</h3>

<p>Thanks to the great work that the Manjaro ARM team have done in this field, getting a working kernel for the Pinebook Pro was relatively painless. We’ve simply taken a mainline kernel straight from <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>, applied a few patches copied from the Manjaro repository and used a configuration set similar to the Manjaro one. It needed tweaking slightly to be compatible with the way Ubuntu/elementary works. For example, we’ve had to disable kernel module compression in the kernel configuration as this isn’t compatible with the Ubuntu <code>update-initramfs</code> scripts yet.</p>

<p>As of this post, Ubuntu hasn’t released any kernels that are new enough or contain the necessary tweaks, options, and patches to run on the Pinebook Pro. So this is one major area where the Pinebook Pro builds differ from the regular Intel/AMD builds. We were initially using kernel 5.7, but have since upgraded to 5.8, which allowed dropping some more patches that have been mainlined.</p>

<p>elementary normally relies heavily on the fantastic work done by Canonical in testing and maintaining kernel releases. So maintaining our own kernel configuration and patchset is a bit of a departure from that. Ubuntu already releases <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/linux-raspi">specific kernels for the Raspberry Pi</a>, perhaps we’ll see a ready made Pinebook Pro one in the future. In the short term however, we may consider packaging the Pinebook Pro kernel into a .deb and hosting it on a PPA, so we can push updates in future if necessary. For now, though, the kernel is just built into the image at build time and so <strong>does not currently receive updates</strong>.</p>

<p>The bootloader is a similar story. We needed a version that was new enough to support the Pinebook Pro and a few patches, so this has come directly from mainline u-boot and not yet packaged as an upgradable .deb.</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Despite elementary OS being a relatively performant distribution, the experience still isn’t as good as you might hope given the capability of the hardware. This is down to GTK3 largely not using GPU acceleration, especially when running on Xorg. There are a number of tweaks we’ve applied to improve the experience somewhat, though there won’t be any big leaps in performance until we can move the stack to Wayland and to a greater extent GTK4.</p>

<p>One interesting point is that you can clearly notice the difference between the GPU accelerated animations (done by the Compositor) and those done largely on the CPU by GTK. For example, the <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd> animation feels pretty smooth compared to the animation used when opening the applications menu. So the potential of the hardware is there, the software stack just isn’t quite ready to take advantage of it yet.</p>

<p>The first performance tweak we applied was disabling the <code>ondemand</code> CPU governor which is forced on by default as a systemd unit on Ubuntu. This allows the kernel to use the <code>schedutil</code> governor which has been enabled and set as the default in our kernel configuration. The <code>schedutil</code> governor is a much newer governor with an awareness of the different performance/power utilization levels of the big.LITTLE cores in the ARM CPU. Switching to this gave an immediate noticeable gain in performance.</p>

<p>Both <code>ondemand</code> and <code>schedutil</code> scale the frequency of the processor cores in response to load. However, if they aren’t doing this efficiently or if the CPU has delays or slowdowns while it’s switching frequency, you notice a bit of latency while the frequency picks up, then things feel a bit more speedy for a few seconds and then they slow down again.</p>

<p>We’ve opted to increase the minimum frequencies of both the CPU and GPU to reduce some of this sluggishness. This has the downside of reducing the battery life slightly. But given the already excellent battery life, we felt it was a reasonable trade-off.</p>

<p>If you wish to disable these frequency tweaks and have longer battery life but worse performance instead, you can comment out the lines in <code>/etc/tmpfiles.d/cpufreq.conf</code> and reboot.</p>

<h3 id="keyboard-and-trackpad-tweaks">Keyboard and Trackpad Tweaks</h3>

<p>We’ve applied three different configuration tweaks to get the keyboard and trackpad functioning better under elementary OS.</p>

<p>The first is some UDev configuration originated from Manjaro to correctly map the sleep (<kbd>Fn</kbd><kbd>Esc</kbd>) and brightness (<kbd>Fn</kbd><kbd>F1</kbd>/<kbd>F2</kbd>) keys on the keyboard. Some similar configuration tweaks could be used to essentially invert the <kbd>Fn</kbd> key (i.e. pressing the <kbd>F1</kbd> key would turn the brightness down and <kbd>Fn</kbd><kbd>F1</kbd> would function as F1), but we’re not sure if we will ship that by default.</p>

<p>The second tweak is some LibInput configuration at <code>/etc/libinput/local-overrides.quirks</code>. This file tells LibInput that the Pinebook keyboard is “internal”, as it automatically assumes USB keyboards (the Pinebook Pro keyboard is on the USB bus) are external unless it is told otherwise. This has the effect of allowing LibInput to “pair” the keyboard with the trackpad, meaning that when the “disable while typing” setting is enabled for the trackpad, it functions correctly. External keyboards do not disable the trackpad.</p>

<p>The final tweak at the bottom of <code>/etc/udev/hwdb.d/10-usb-kbd.hwdb</code> disables a device that the keyboard firmware reports as a “keyboard mouse”. We assume that the keyboard firmware has some provision for a Trackpoint-style pointer that doesn’t physically exist on the keyboard, but the firmware still reports it. Having this device enabled resulted in the trackpad being disabled if you enabled the “disable when external mouse connected” option. The phantom “keyboard mouse” device was again assumed to be external, meaning LibInput assumed you had an additional external mouse connected and that you didn’t want the trackpad anymore.</p>

<p>It’s possible that some/all of these tweaks are not necessary/useful on distributions that use the Synaptics driver instead of LibInput for the trackpad, but elementary OS uses LibInput by default.</p>

<h3 id="power-management">Power Management</h3>

<p>The biggest and most time consuming issue we came across while porting elementary OS to the Pinebook Pro was a sporadic issue with shutdown not powering off the device. Sometimes the power light would go off, but the device was still secretly on, draining battery and you had to hard reset by holding the power button and then powering on again. Other times the power light would flash red (indicating a kernel panic), and on occasion, it would shut down properly/normally.</p>

<p>Using a UART cable for debugging resulted in some kernel warnings about the i2c code for handling the shutdown call to the PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit) not being “atomic”. This turned out to be an important hint, but it is a relatively normal message that you’ll also see on other distributions using a similar kernel.</p>

<p>After much digging, it turned out that something in our stack pulls in a package called <code>irqbalance</code> by default. This distributes the hardware interrupts among the CPU cores to try and get better performance. The fact that the i2c code in the Rockchip driver is not atomic means that it relies on interrupts to function.</p>

<p>During shutdown, the kernel disables interrupts on all but the first CPU core. The fact that <code>irqbalance</code> has potentially told a different core to handle the interrupts for the PMIC is the problem here. It also explains the random/sporadic behavior. Removing the package was enough to fix the issue as the kernel has its own interrupt distribution code and is smart enough to ensure the interrupts are handled on the first core during shutdown.</p>

<p>A lot of ARM platforms handle power management functions like shutdown and suspend in a low level firmware interface called PSCI (Power State Coordination Interface). Instead of communicating directly with the PMIC chip like the current kernel in the Pinebook Pro image does, the kernel can communicate with the standardized PSCI API.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these shutdown and suspend interfaces are not yet implemented in the open-source ARM TF-A (Trusted Firmware-A) meaning these functions have been implemented in the kernel in a non-standard way. This is understandable given the amount of work required to implement these functions in the low level firmware. Hopefully, when these features are implemented in the firmware, it should be possible to drop these non-standard patches and hopefully have improved suspend power draw levels.</p>

<p>A lot of manufacturers of ARM platforms offer a BSP (Board Support Package), which can include closed source firmware and a custom kernel (which is now a relatively out of date version). Rockchip offers a BSP firmware image and kernel where the suspend performance is improved, but we’ve opted for up to date and more easily auditable versions of these components.</p>

Few of them specified when they would resume shutoffs. Many of them have quietly resumed shutting off the power on their customers in the months since. While others plan to resume shutoffs in mid-September. One of the country’s biggest utilities, Southern Company — a Georgia-based utility with 9 million customers — never had an internal shutoff moratorium in the first place.</p><p>Carbon Switch gathered data on the number of customers at the 10 largest utilities and their shut off policies. We found that the top 10 utilities control 62% of the investor-owned utility market and serve 63 million customers. (It’s important to note that a customer is a household, not an individual. Considering the average household in America has 2.5 people, their policies likely affect about 157.5 million Americans).</p><p>Here’s a summary of these utilities shutoff policies during the pandemic:</p><ul><li>1 utility (Southern Company) never stopped shutting off their customers’ power.</li><li>3 utilities (Exelon, Xcel, and Florida Power and Light) quietly resumed shutoffs in May and July.</li><li>4 utilities (Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, First Energy, and AEP) plan to resume shut offs in September.</li><li>2 utilities (PG&amp;E and SCE) are barred by California’s moratorium from shutting off their customers’ power until at least next year.</li></ul><p>It’s worth emphasizing that the only utilities that have extended their moratoriums past September 15th are the two utilities based in California, a state with the nation’s longest spanning moratorium. The others plan to resume shut offs despite recent reports that as many as a third of customers are behind on payments in some states.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="b958695" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="1240" height="974" src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1240/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1240/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2.png 1240w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-300x236.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-1024x804.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://carbonswitch.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/table-2-768x603.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="bbfb297" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="fb983df" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="e7cba1b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h3>Shutoffs and injustice</h3><p>In 2018 a 72-year-old woman living in Sun City West, Arizona died during a heat wave in which temperatures reached 100 degrees.

		<p>by David L. Duffy.</p>
<p>Personally, I have found some chess analogies, metaphors and thought experiments from philosophers a little unimpressive, speaking as someone who was once a middling club player. Some philosophers have been what I think of as serious players – at least one has been an International Master — but I don’t see their thoughts as widely cited as, for example, Dennett in the case of “Chmess”, or even Sellars’ “Texas Chess”. Serious chess players know there is a technical literature of many thousands of books, and databases containing ~15 million games played since people started recording them. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> They know playing chess is intensely pleasurable and addictive, that winning well is a joy, but even losing is not so bad. Abuhamdeh and Csikzentmihalyi found that maximum pleasure in their study was felt when one’s opponent was 260 Elo points <em>stronger</em> (that is, one’s chance of winning was only 20%). <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Csikzentmihalyi calls chess as played by humans <em>autotelic;</em>&nbsp;that is, intrinsically motivating. Chess players know that chess-thought combines a mixture of “intuitive” pattern recognition and brute force mental visualisation of the future chess positions that will follow particular sequences of moves (“calculation”). They know and enjoy a family of variant forms of chess – I used to play a lot of “Transfer” (known as “Bughouse” in the US), which involves players passing captured pieces to their teammates, who may place them on their board, a la Shogi, but all under a time limit, as well as Kriegspiel where you and your opponent are unaware of each others’ moves, but are informed about captures and checks. <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Chess has been of great interest to the computer science community as what was seen as a hard problem for “machines do[ing] the things that would require intelligence if done by men” (Minsky 1968). Now <em>AlphaZero </em>has reached the highest levels in just 24 hours of self-play, it is seen as a trivial mechanical task, much easier than walking without falling over, or working out that the truck in front of your car is not the sky. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> When I played through the originally published <em>AlphaZero</em> chess games, I found them hilarious. They actually have a very human feel, as opposed to those played by conventional chess engines which search through the set of all possible moves a certain number of plies into the future of the current position. (Partly this was because neither program was using standard opening books.) <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> &nbsp;<em>AlphaZero</em>’s open source successor <em>lz0</em> (<em>Leela</em>) has a putative Elo rating of ~3400, about the same as <em>Stockfish</em>, while the best human is ~2800 (so the human might beat the program perhaps one game in a hundred). <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> &nbsp;Computer programs don’t enjoy chess, and don’t have an aesthetic response to beautiful combinations of moves. But the pleasures of the chess player are “merely” the subjective experience of successfully meeting a meta-cognitive goal, one that drives all playfulness, and the related goals of the aesthetics of thought. We get a dopamine rush from our comprehension of elegance, simplicity and complexity, and of surprise (some may remember Koestler’s <em>Ha!</em> and <em>Aha!</em>).</p>
<p>The rest of this essay will be a few comments about how various philosophers have interacted with the game of chess and the playing of chess, but before that I will present a little thought experiment of my own. Many comparisons have been made between the acts of playing chess and carrying out mathematical calculations or solving mathematical problems. If one is some kind of Chess Platonist, one has the image of a Universe of approximately 10<sup>40</sup> possible sequences of moves sitting out there. <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> The Dancing Pixies argument of Putnam, Searle, Bishop, and others is that, with the right interpretation, the interactions between atoms in a rock are computations and thus, for us computationalists, thought. <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; They could also be interpreted as all those chess games. So I now have a concretized Platonic Chess Universe sitting in my garden. One merely needs to <em>construct</em> the apparatus to extract the games from the rock, and if one wished to use these to beat your human opponent, construct a further method of filtering out all the winning games arising from the current position. There are a couple of stories in Stanislaw Lem’s <em>Cyberiad</em> that are relevant, but Mrs Beeton’s recipe for Stewed Rabbit may also apply. <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>(1) If I were asked to answer, in one sentence, the question “What was Wittgenstein’s biggest contribution?”, I should answer “His asking of the question ‘Can one play chess without the queen?’” (Wisdom 1952) <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Well, people spot weaker players a queen all the time, and don’t think anything of it. After all, you can lose your queen during a game anyway, and the resulting play is a subtype of standard play (usually endgame), rather than a new game. If one is playing the Old Indian Opening, for example, the players can choose to enter a Queen-less game in 5 moves. You might refine Wittgenstein and ask whether introducing a new set of rules specifying starting from a particular position (that is, setup of pieces on the board), or playing under the standard rules to get there is the same. Like, there are 10<sup>40</sup> different games lurking in there that people had never noticed before. In the Old Indian example, the players collaborate to reach a Queen-less board, but they may collaborate in all kinds of ways, such as repeatedly playing a particular chess opening variant they are both interested in (or in a grandmaster draw, as a strategy for winning a chess tournament).</p>
<p>(2) From Dummett’s explication of Frege on chess:</p>
<p><span>Proposition 1</span>: <em>Neither chess moves nor positions on the chessboard express anything; in particular they do not express thoughts that can be evaluated as true or false.</em> Proposition 2: <em>The theory of chess consists of meaningful propositions about chess moves and chess positions, capable of demonstration in the same way as mathematical theorems. </em><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>These seem plausible, but the way I think of chess soon led me to:</p>
<p><span>Analogical Proposition 1</span>: Neither bead moves nor positions on the abacus express anything; in particular they do not express thoughts that can be evaluated as true or false.</p>
<p><span>Analogical Proposition 2</span>: The theory of abacus use consists of meaningful propositions about bead moves and positions, capable of demonstration in the same way as mathematical theorems.</p>
<p>I think it obvious that AP1 and AP2 are incorrect. My preferred interpretation for the abacus: Bead movements and positions concretely express the evolution and states of abstract entities in a virtual time and space, whose properties are chosen to simulate those of other concrete objects.</p>
<p>My preferred interpretation for chess: Chess moves and positions on the chessboard concretely express the evolution and states of abstract entities in a virtual time and space, whose properties are chosen to simulate the concrete objects, actions and decisions of soldiers.</p>
<p>A: chess is a war game.</p>
<p>B: The warfare modeled by the rules of chess is ancient Indian warfare, with peasant infantry, elephants, aristocratic cavalry and chariots.</p>
<p>C: Winning such a battle required the capture or death of the opposition king.</p>
<p>D: Winning usually requires the general to sacrifice many of his own soldiers in order to win, unless the opponent has made an error.</p>
<p>E: A general fights against another general, and usually will plan as if his opponent will make the best response to any given attack, although he will set up traps with the hope they will succumb.</p>
<p>F: Each wields a Theory of Mind that is domain specific, and must incorporate both low-level and high-level properties of the game or the organisation of fighting. For example, chess players and generals both divide up the elements of planning into strategy and tactics.</p>
<p>My preferred conclusion: Although the game is greatly abstracted, there are many high-level analogies to warfare.</p>
<p>As it happens, Deleuze and Guattari make much of these isomorphisms in <em>A Thousand Plateaus&nbsp;</em>, as in the State of chess versus the Nomads of Go/Wei Chi – “chess pieces entertain biunivocal relations with one another, and with the adversary’s pieces: their functioning is structural, while Go pieces… have extrinsic relations with nebulae or constellations”, and so on. <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>My mental model of chess as simulation is therefore similar to a scientific model. There is the reality, the model that abstracts certain features of reality, and the theory that applies to the model. In a game, the pleasures arise in implementing and running the model, but are related to some of those of the reality (this is far more obvious in modern computer games). <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>G: Chess is rational imaginative play.</p>
<p>H. The physical acts of moving the game tokens around are <em>iconic</em> – horses jump, pawns bump into one another so that they can’t move forward, children and adults both use their piece to knock over the opponent’s piece they are capturing, the latter without sound effects. Blitz players pick up the captured piece and use it to tap the clock.</p>
<p>I’ll point to a related line of thought that is not particularly unique to chess. For children, the pastime of chess is supposed to produce transferable, that is, generalized, principles of learning and thinking, that apply more widely than just to warfare. <a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15] </a>One great goal of the AI community is to produce meta-reinforcement learners that can generalize (transfer) lessons from one domain to another domain.</p>
<p>I. Recall that Wittgenstein introduces Sprachspiel initially “as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language”.</p>
<p>J. By 2 years of age, children logically reason about outcomes of a counterfactual premise e.g. what should I do if this banana is a telephone, or which cup was emptied of imaginary tea by being knocked over.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>K. At a later stage of neurological development, children can imagine these little horses fight and jump following the rules of chess.</p>
<p>L. In children’s games, friction arises when someone …</p></div></div>

<p>At the moment, the Epic Games page in the App Store is not available – journalist John Voorhees was one of the first to notice this. The store gives an error whenever you try to go to the page of the company itself or one of its applications using a direct link, but you cannot find it in the search.</p>




<p>Users also noted that downloading apps from Epic, including Fortnite, will not work, even if they are already assigned to a user account.</p>



<figure><img src="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple.jpg 289w, https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/apple-195x300.jpg 195w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px"></figure>



<p>Apple released an official statement on this matter – the company noted that they were “very sorry” to take such measures, but Epic left no choice.</p>



<blockquote><p>The court recommended that Epic follow the App Store’s guidelines and policies while the case is in progress – the rules they followed over the past ten years until they created the current situation themselves. Epic refused.</p><p><br> Instead, the company has repeatedly submitted Fortnite updates that violate store rules. This is unfair to all other developers in the App Store and makes users suffer from conflict.</p><p><br> We hope to be able to cooperate again in the future, but at the moment this is unfortunately not possible.</p><p><br> from Apple statement</p></blockquote>



<p>The corporation has warned that it is going to delete Epic Games accounts back on August 17th. Apparently, another account of the company, Epic International, is still available in the App Store – it was previously banned from blocking in court. Therefore, the situation should not touch upon the support of the Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>On the day Epic’s profiles were deleted, the App Store began to actively promote Fortnite’s direct competitor, PUBG Mobile. The online shooter appeared on the main page of the “Games” section, and the promo was published on the store’s official twitter.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The tweet was also noticed by the head of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney.</p>

<p>While you wait for Fortnite to return to iOS and Mac, here’s another great Battle Royale powered by the Unreal Engine!</p>

   <p>I recently refereed Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares's <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/">"Functional Decision
Theory"</a> for a philosophy journal. My recommendation was to accept
resubmission with major revisions, but since the article had already
undergone a previous round of revisions and still had serious
problems, the editors (understandably) decided to reject it. I normally don't publish
my referee reports, but this time I'll make an exception because the
authors are well-known figures from outside academia, and I want to
explain why their account has a hard time gaining traction in academic
philosophy. I also want to explain why I think their account is wrong,
which is a separate point.</p>

<p>I actually don't know Nate Soares, but Eliezer Yudkowsky is a
celebrity in the "rationalist" community. Many of his posts on the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality">Less Wrong blog</a> are
gems. I also enjoyed his latest book, <a href="https://equilibriabook.com/"><i>Inadequate Equilibria</i></a>.
Yudkowsky seems to be interested in almost everything, but he regards
decision theory as his main area of research. I also work in decision
theory, but I've always struggled with Yudkowsky's writings on this
topic.</p>

<p>Before I explain what I found wrong with the paper, let me review the
main idea and motivation behind the theory it defends.</p>

<p>Standard lore in decision theory is that there are situations in
which it would be better to be irrational. Three examples.</p>

<blockquote> <b>Blackmail.</b> Donald has committed an indiscretion.
Stormy has found out and considers blackmailing Donald. If Donald
refuses and blows Stormy's gaff, she is revealed as a blackmailer and
his indiscretion becomes public; both suffer. It is better for Donald
to pay hush money to Stormy. Knowing this, it is in Stormy's interest
to blackmail Donald. If Donald were irrational, he would blow Stormy's
gaff even though that would hurt him more than paying the hush money;
knowing this, Stormy would not blackmail Donald. So Donald would be
better off if here were (known to be) irrational.</blockquote>

<blockquote> <b>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin.</b> Twinky and her
clone have been arrested. If they both confess, each gets a 5 years
prison sentence. If both remain silent, they can't be convicted and
only get a 1 year sentence for obstructing justice. If one confesses
and the other remains silent, the one who confesses is set free and
the other gets a 10 year sentence. Neither cares about what happens to
the other. Here, confessing is the dominant act and the unique Nash
equilibrium. So if Twinky and her clone are rational, they'll each
spend 5 years in prison. If they were irrational and remained silent,
they would get away with 1 year.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes.</b> A demon
invites people to an experiment. Participants are placed in front of
two transparent boxes. The box on the left contains a thousand
dollars. The box on the right contains either a million or nothing.
The participants can choose between taking both boxes (two-boxing) and
taking just the box on the right (one-boxing). If the demon has
predicted that a participant one-boxes, she put a million dollars into
the box on the right. If she has predicted that a participant
two-boxes, she put nothing into the box. The demon is very good at
predicting, and the participants know this. Each participant is only
interested in getting as much money as possible. Here, the rational
choice is to take both boxes, because you are then guaranteed to get
$1000 more than if you one-box. But almost all of those who
irrationally take just one box end up with a million dollars, while
most of those who rationally take both boxes leave with
$1000.</blockquote>

<p>The driving intuition behind Yudkowsky and Soares's paper is that
decision theorists have been wrong about these (and other) cases: in
each case, the supposedly irrational choice is actually rational.
Whether a pattern of behaviour is rational, they argue, should be
measured by how good it is for the agent. In <i>Newcomb's Problem with
Transparent Boxes</i>, one-boxers fare better than two-boxers. So we
should regard one-boxing as rational. Similarly for the other
examples. Standard decision theories therefore get these cases wrong.
We need a new theory.</p>

<p>Functional Decision Theory (FDT) is meant to be that theory. FDT
recommends blowing the gaff in <i>Blackmail</i>, remaining silent in
<i>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin</i>, and one-boxing in <i>Newcomb's
Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>.</p>

<p>Here's how FDT works, and how it differs from the most popular form
of decision theory, Causal Decision Theory (CDT). Suppose an agent
faces a choice between two options A and B. According CDT, the agent
should evaluate these options in terms of their possible consequences
(broadly understood). That is, the agent should consider what might
happen if she were to choose A or B, and weigh the possible outcomes
by their probability. In FDT, the agent should not consider what would
happen if she were to choose A or B. Instead, she ought to consider
what would happen if <i>the right choice according to FDT were A or
B</i>.</p>

<p>Take <i>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>. Without loss
of generality, suppose you see $1000 in the left box and a million in
the right box. If you were to take both boxes, you would get a million
and a thousand. If you were to take just the right box, you would get
a million. So Causal Decision Theory says you should take box boxes.
But let's suppose you follow FDT, and you are certain that you do. You
should then consider what would be the case if FDT recommended
one-boxing or two-boxing. These hypotheses are not hypotheses just
about your present choice. If FDT recommended two-boxing, then any FDT
agent throughout history would two-box. And, crucially, the demon
would (probably) have foreseen that you would two-box, so she would
have put nothing into the box on the right. As a result, if FDT
recommended two-boxing, you would probably end up with $1000. To be
sure, you know that there's a million in the box on the right. You can
see it. But according to FDT, this is irrelevant. What matters is what
<i>would</i> be in the box relative to different assumptions about
what FDT recommends.</p>

<p>To spell out the details, one would now need to specify how to
compute the probability of various outcomes under the subjunctive
supposition that FDT recommended a certain action. Yudkowsky and
Soares are explicit that the supposition is to be understood as
counterpossible: we need to suppose that a certain mathematical
function, which in fact outputs A for input X, instead were to output
B. They do not explain how to compute the probability of outcomes
under such a counterpossible supposition. So we don't get any details
spelled out. This is flagged as the main open question for FDT.</p>

<p>It is not obvious to me why Yudkowsky and Soares choose to model
the relevant supposition as a mathematical falsehood. For example, why
not let the supposition be: <i>I am the kind of agent who chooses A in
the present decision problem</i>? That is an ordinary contingent
(centred) propositions, since there are possible agents who do choose
option A in the relevant problem. These agents may not
follow FDT, but I don't see why that would matter. For some reason, Yudkowsky and
Soares assume that an FDT agent is certain that she follows FDT, and
this knowledge is held fixed under all counterfactual suppositions. I
guess there is a reason for this assumption, but they don't tell
us.</p>

<p>Anyway. That's the theory. What's not to like about it?</p>

<p>For a start, I'd say the theory gives insane recommendations in
cases like <i>Blackmail</i>, <i>Prisoner's Dilemma with a Twin</i>,
and <i>Newcomb's Problem with Transparent Boxes</i>. Take
<i>Blackmail</i>. Suppose you have committed an indiscretion that
would ruin you if it should become public. You can escape the ruin by
paying $1 once to a blackmailer. Of course you should pay! FDT says
you should not pay because, if you were the kind of person who doesn't
pay, you likely wouldn't have been blackmailed. How is that even
relevant? You <i>are</i> being blackmailed. Not being blackmailed
isn't on the table. It's not something you can choose.</p>

<p>Admittedly, that's not much of an objection. I say you'd be insane
not to pay the $1, Yudkowsky and Soares say you'd be irrational to
pay. Neither of us can prove that their judgement is right from
neutral premises.</p>

<p>What about the fact that FDT agents do better than (say) CDT
agents? I admit that if this were a fact, it would be somewhat
interesting. But it's not clear if it is true.</p>

<p>First, it depends on how success is measured. If you face the
choice between submitting to blackmail and refusing to submit (in the
kind of case we've discussed), you fare dramatically better if you
follow CDT than if you follow FDT. If you are in <i>Newcomb's Problem
with Transparent Boxes</i> and see a million in the right-hand box,
you again fare better if you follow CDT. Likewise if you see nothing
in the right-hand box.</p>

<p>So there's an obvious sense in which CDT agents fare better than
FDT agents in the cases we've considered. But there's also a sense in
which FDT agents fare better. Here we don't just compare the utilities
scored in particular decision problems, but also the fact that FDT
agents might face other kinds of decision problems than CDT agents.
For example, FDT agents who are known as FDT agents have a lower
chance of getting blackmailed and thus of facing a choice between
submitting and not submitting. I agree that it makes sense to take
these effects into account, at least as long as they are consequences
of the agent's own decision-making dispositions. In effect, we would
then ask what decision rule should be chosen by an engineer who wants
to build an agent scoring the most utility across its lifetime. Even
then, however, there is no guarantee that FDT would come out better.
What if someone is set to punish agents who use FDT, giving them
choices between bad and worse options, while CDTers are given great
options? In such an environment, the engineer would be wise not build
an FDT agent.</p>

<p>Moreover, FDT does not in fact consider only consequences of the
agent's own …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By Leib Litman, PhD, Zohn Rosen, PhD, Cheskie Rosenzweig, MS, Aaron Moss, PhD, Adam Dietrich, &amp; Jonathan Robinson, PhD</strong></p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Lately, there’s been considerable debate over the accuracy of presidential polls. While recent polls show Joe Biden ahead,&nbsp;a number of pundits speculate that some Donald Trump supporters may be hesitant to share their true opinions when polled by phone. That hypothesis is gaining traction, leading some to argue that Trump may be leading despite what the latest numbers show. It’s also being fueled by the belief that 2020 will be a repeat of the 2016 election, when Trump polled poorly in advance of the election, but still went on to win the Electoral College vote.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the current debate on whether there are segments of Trump (or Biden) backers reticent to express their true opinions in phone polls, there’s been little empirical investigation into if the phenomenon actually exists. Pundits on major broadcast and cable news networks, such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/does-a-shy-trump-voter-exist-arnon-mishkin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/09/politics/trump-voters-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>, continue to speculate on the potential impact of so-called “shy Trump voters” on the outcome of the November presidential election result.&nbsp; In a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/us/politics/trump-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> published in <em>The New York Times</em>, David Winston says the following:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“The idea that people lie, it’s an interesting theory, and it’s not like it’s completely off-the-wall. But it’s obviously a very complicated thing to try to prove because what do you do? Ask them, ‘Are you lying?’”</em></p><p>On its face, a poll that asks people whether they lie in phone polls may not make much&nbsp;sense. After all, why would a person who lies in a telephone poll tell the truth about that in a different online poll? We here at CloudResearch reasoned that the issue may be methodological.</p><p>To explore this issue, we structured our survey to overcome shortcomings of previous polls. Instead of simply asking voters whom they will vote for — and then ask whether they just lied — we centered our research around a general question: “Are you comfortable in truthfully disclosing the presidential candidate you intend to vote for in a telephone poll?” Our rationale for this approach was that there’s a major difference between admitting you just lied and admitting to being genuinely concerned about disclosing your preferred candidate.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, we expected to find very few “shy voters.” After all, telephone surveys are supposed to be anonymous, so why would people be reluctant to share their opinions? However, to the extent people said that they were reluctant to express their voting preferences on a telephone poll, we were interested in their rationale for their reluctance. As a result, we included open-ended follow-up questions to better understand the factors that drive voters to fudge their responses.</p><hr><h2><strong>What CloudResearch Found</strong></h2><ul><li>11.7% of Republicans say they would not report their true opinions about their preferred presidential candidate on telephone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>In contrast, just 5.4% of Democrats say they’d be reluctant to share their true voting intentions — roughly half the number of Republicans reluctant to tell the truth on phone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>10.5% of Independents fell into the “shy voter” category, just a percentage point lower than how Republicans react to phone polls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>After asking about people expressing their true opinions on telephone calls, we then inquired about their preferred candidate. This ordering was important as we did not want to fall into the same trap as other pollsters who tend to lead with preference declarations. When we broke the responses down based on current Trump vs Biden supporters, we found the following:</p><ul><li>10.1% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys — double the number of Biden supporters (5.1%) reticent to share their true intentions.</li></ul><p>When respondents indicated that they were untruthful during polls, we followed up to confirm those responses, and then inquired as to why “shy voters” are concerned about sharing their voting intentions. Some example responses are below. These are just a representational sampling of viewpoints that we collected — sentiments not easy to gauge by responses to mere yes/no questions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I don’t believe the information would be confidential and I think it’s dangerous to express an opinion outside of the current liberal viewpoint.”</em></p><p><em>“Well I probably wouldn’t give my opinion period, but if pushed, I would not give my real opinion for fear of reprisal if someone found out.”</em></p><p><em>“Because most polls released to the public are slanted and aren’t scientifically based. So, they are messing with the results of the survey from the beginning by knocking down one party or the other. I’m just trying to right the ship.”</em></p><p><em>“I am hounded day and evening by phone solicitors.&nbsp; They interrupt me all the time; sometimes my irritation takes over, and I don’t answer correctly.”</em></p><p><em>“My answers could be recorded so I don’t really trust such phone conversations.”</em></p><p><em>“I do not discuss politics — let alone with a total stranger on the telephone.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t always trust phone call surveys. I wouldn’t want to be bombarded with phone calls and political mail.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t want my opinion associated with my phone number.”</em></p><p><em>“I am less anonymous, and somewhat ashamed of my opinion as it is frowned upon.”</em></p><hr><h2>In General, “Shy Voters” Cited Six Concerns:&nbsp;</h2><p>1. A lack of trust in phone polls as truly being anonymous.&nbsp;</p><p>2. An apprehension to associate their phone numbers with recorded responses.</p><p>3. Fear that their responses will become public in some manner.</p><p>4. Fear of reprisal and related detrimental impact to their financial, social, and family lives should their political opinions become publicly known.&nbsp;</p><p>5. A general dislike of phone polls.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Malicious intent to mislead polls due to general distrust of media and political pundits (though a sentiment expressed only by a few “shy voters”).&nbsp;</p><p>Such concerns were more often than not expressed by Republicans and Independents, and also by those who said they would vote for Donald Trump. Democrats and Biden supporters lagged both groups in terms of being concerned that their voting intentions would be shared with others.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our survey findings — that show a greater reluctance on the part of Republicans, Independents and Trump voters to disclose their opinions — should not be interpreted as outright lying. Rather, such reluctance seems to stem from a&nbsp; lack of trust in the anonymity of polls and a fear of the consequences if their opinions were to become public.&nbsp;</p><p>The results could have implications in terms of the true accuracy of phone polls; if Republicans, Independents and supporters of Donald Trump (regardless of party affiliation) are less likely to participate in polls or accurately disclose the candidate they support, that inherently generates biased poll outcomes.</p><p>Given razor thin-margins in the swing states, such bias may have important consequences, although more research is required to fully understand the potential magnitude of this effect. We intend to examine the magnitude of “shy-voter bias” in specific states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>The results of our survey also illustrate the primary concerns that pollsters may need to address to allay voters about the level of anonymity and privacy of phone polling. We’ll also examine these issues and potential remedies in future research.</p><hr><h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2><h3><strong>Sample&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Interviews were collected from two national online sample waves of 1,000 registered voters (2000 respondents in total), matched to U.S. Census data on gender, age, race, and region. Data were collected August 19 – 27, 2020&nbsp;using&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudresearch.com%2Fproducts%2Fprime-panels%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener">CloudResearch’s Prime Panels</a>, a platform that incorporates data quality checks in sample recruitment and sources participants from an aggregate of market research panels (<a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.3758%2Fs13428-019-01273-7" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chandler et al., 2019</a>). The two waves differed from each other in terms of how quotas were set. In the first sample, the full sample was matched to the U.S. Census and the sample was equally split between Republicans, Democrats and Independents. In the second wave, rather than matching the entire sample to the U.S. Census, each political party was matched to the demographic quotas appropriate for that party. The results presented above are for the first wave of participants, although the overall findings were similar across both waves. Specifically, in Wave 2, 10.5% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys compared to 4.6% of Biden supporters.</p><h3><strong>Survey Design&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Prior to entering the survey, all respondents were screened for attentiveness and English language comprehension. Following the screening process a <em>responsive verification protocol</em> was used, consisting of multiple interactive interview steps. Step 1 – Respondents were first asked one of two randomly assigned questions: Q1 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked in an automated telephone poll (also called “Interactive Voice Response” or “IVR”), would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. Q2 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked by a telephone interviewer, would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. We also wanted to compare how comfortable respondents are in responding to telephone polls, compared to online and in-person polls. We therefore also asked the same question about phone interviews, online surveys, and in-person polls, presented next to each other in the same grid. The response options to all questions were: 1. “I would definitely express my true opinion”, 2. “I would probably express my true opinion”, 3. “I would probably not express my true opinion” and 4. “I would definitely not express my true opinion”.</p><p>Step 2 – For those who indicated that they would not provide their true opinion on either question from Step 1 (i.e. responded with options 3 or 4), a follow-up question was asked: “On a previous question, you indicated that you …</p></div></div>

					<div>
						<p>Why do psychiatric conditions exist?</p>
<p>This question is both unsatisfyingly unanswered and incredibly important. Here we will consider some features of the over-century-long failure of psychiatry to explain mental disorders, before reviewing a theoretical framework which promises to explain these conditions in a way which is not only scientifically sound, but emancipating. The framework in question is evolutionary psychiatry, and its principle thinking is simple: if we use evolutionary theory to explain biology, then we should be using evolutionary theory to explain psychiatric disorder. If evolution was given proper attention and integrated into mainstream psychiatry, we would usher in a new era of understanding and treatment of psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>Psychiatry is a practice with more than a chequered past, perpetrating horrors even in living memory: Sprees of lobotomising adults and children; purposefully inducing comas in schizophrenics, producing thrashing, spasming and salivating so bad that one psychiatrist reported the scene on a ward as alike to artist Gustave Dore’s depictions of hell; and the widespread demonisation of homosexuality justifying the electrocution and injection of homosexuals with nauseating drugs during slideshows of sexually attractive individuals of the same sex, hoping to train them into being sick at their own sexuality.</p>
<p>Advances in treatment over the decades have come more from the dismissal of old and harmful practices than the inception of new ones. As electrocution and nauseation were slowly recognised as both immoral and ineffective, we are now left with psychotherapies and pharmaceuticals of unreliable and underwhelming efficacy. Tens of billions of dollars and several decades of research have led to few new discoveries. Many drug developers have now left psychiatry for more easily understood and chemically pliable conditions of the body rather than the mind. Leaders in national mental health research have expressed dismay that so little progress has been made. Some research suggests that the burden of psychiatric illness might even be <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acps.13083">worsening</a>, not lessening.</p>
<p>Psychiatric therapies have never been atheoretical – psychiatrists have always justified their treatments with some school of thought: Freudian psychodynamic theories placed blame on early childhood and subconscious urges; behaviourism justified the application of pain to try and train people out of wrongthink; and more recently, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315533279_Challenging_the_Narrative_of_Chemical_Imbalance_A_Look_at_the_Evidence">chemical imbalance theories</a> were used to advertise pharmaceuticals, despite the narrative of simple dopamine and serotonin dysfunctions having been <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again">long dismissed</a> in academic circles. Recent advances in genetics and neuroscience have provided more evidence and complexity, but no promising new theories. Psychiatry today can be considered <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mind-Fixers-Psychiatrys-Troubled-Biology/dp/0393071227">a discipline in crisis</a>, surviving only because psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are effective for some people, some of the time, and so we still need them. The way is open for a new paradigm in psychiatric theorising.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the conclusion of his first edition of <i>Origin of Species</i> in 1859, Charles Darwin prophesied: “In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”</p>
<p>Darwin’s prophecy manifested itself in psychology around 100 years after his writing. Now, evolutionary psychology has become a common reference point for public discussion and academic research. Evolutionary psychiatry is a late follower, arising in the last years of the twentieth century alongside evolutionary medicine, its foundational work owing to Randolph Nesse, George Williams, John Price, and others.</p>
<p>Evolution by natural selection is the metatheory of biology, linking all species and all biological forms. The process of constant biological variation, reproduction and selection between forms leads to evolution of populations, explaining the form of our bodies and minds. Therefore, the logic of evolutionary medicine and psychiatry goes, evolutionary theory should also be referred to in explaining why our bodies and minds are vulnerable to disorder and disease. All biology is evolutionary, and psychiatry is biological, hence psychiatry should be understood in evolutionary terms. The lack of progress in understanding psychiatric disorders makes sense in this light, because mainstream psychiatry has been ignoring the key theory in biology.</p>
<p>Whilst the fundamental principles of evolutionary psychiatry have been defined, and important works <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Reasons-Bad-Feelings-Evolutionary-ebook/dp/B078VXFZCX">published</a>, there does not yet exist a dedicated evolutionary psychiatry university department or journal. In 2016, the first noteworthy institutional group dedicated to evolutionary psychiatry <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5046779/">was formed</a>, in the Evolutionary Psychiatry Special Interest Group (EPSIG) at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This slow start and long build up does not dissuade evolutionary psychiatrists from believing that, in the ever-less-distant future, this theoretical paradigm will be recognised as the way to truly start explaining mental disorder.</p>
<p>A unique advantage of evolutionary psychiatry is its ability to define disease and disorder upon an evolutionary concept of dysfunction. The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), the handbook of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), defines mental disorder as dysfunction, but then fails to specify what that means. This allows transparently unscientific activities. Most famously, in 1973, after gay rights protestors had stormed an APA meeting, psychiatrists had donned anonymising hoods and professed their personal homosexuality to a group of their fellows, and national progressive values became a little too loud to ignore, the APA called a vote to reconsider homosexuality’s status as a mental disorder. By a 58% majority, it was struck off.</p>
<p>Voting to decide whether a condition is a disease is not the sign of a mature science, yet to this day consensus alone is the deciding factor of whether a mind is deemed disorderly. Commonly prescribed disorder labels in use today, such as Borderline Personality Disorder, included in the DSM-III because of the vote of a dozen or so psychiatrists, have criteria <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650639/">based primarily upon</a> single review papers with poor empirical evidence from the 1970’s – even the authors of that paper expected it to be backed up with further evidence before becoming part of canon. In the most recent edition, the DSM-5, ‘internet gaming disorder’ was suggested, justified by comparing online (but specifically excluding offline) gaming to drug and gambling addictions. An international consortium has since <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.12457">voted</a> clarifying its features. Evolutionary psychiatry can thankfully supersede this ambiguous line between order and disorder.</p>
<p>Unlike physics and chemistry, which describe things simply as they are, biological processes can be meaningfully considered to function or dysfunction. Biological traits evolved to increase reproductive success – that is their function. Eyes evolved to see, so eyes which cannot see are dysfunctional. Psychological and physical traits functioned to provide reproductive success to our ancestors, and where that function fails or is interrupted, there is dysfunction. Mental disorders can then be defined as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119125563.evpsych242">harmful dysfunctions</a> of the mind.</p>
<p>This analysis of function is inevitably historical (it concerns ancestral evolutionary function, not modern functioning) and so is difficult to ascertain in many cases, especially in psychology, and is complicated by the possibility of random processes of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genetic-drift/">genetic drift</a>. Nevertheless, this reference to evolutionary function is the <i>only</i> way to define function by an objective biological process rather than relying solely on subjective norms and cultural values – or indeed a vote.</p>
<p>This unique theoretical strength has been followed up by work in evolutionary medicine and psychiatry identifying <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Articles/Nesse%20-%202015%20-%20Evolutionary%20Psychology%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf">six reasons</a> why conditions we define as disorder or disease (of body or mind) persist in evolved creatures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constraints on biological design, because evolution can only make alterations within a certain range.</li>
<li>Pathogens evolve, so we cannot evolve perfect immunity against them.</li>
<li>Design trade-offs and byproducts make perfection impossible.</li>
<li>Evolved defenses against disease and danger often induce harmful symptoms.</li>
<li>Selection is for reproductive success, not health, so we can evolve in ways which are debilitating if they allow us to reproduce more successfully.</li>
<li>Mismatch between evolved systems and modern environments lead to novel, harmful, reactions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these six reasons, it’s important to note that the last four are the modern result of functioning rather than dysfunctioning processes. The idea that natural selection would only encourage perfect health is mistaken. It’s entirely possible for evolution to lead our bodies and minds into states which we now diagnose and treat as disorders or diseases.</p>
<p>Work in evolutionary psychiatry has considered <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29051086/">depression</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2019/1/1/5229271">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/hunters-in-a-farmers-world-adhd-and-hunter-gatherers-2332-0915-1000150.pdf">ADHD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16005572/">OCD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9875960/">eating disorders</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">substance use disorders</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674370304800107">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603205_In_cold_blood_The_evolution_of_psychopathy">psychopathy</a>, and many more disorders through the evolutionary framework. Several can be explained as mental tendencies related to adaptations which were advantageous for our hunter-gatherer ancestors.</p>
<p>For instance, some are mismatched psychological systems which are exposed to over-stimulation in the modern environment, becoming the biggest causes of abuse, ruination and early death in developed countries. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">Alcoholism and drug abuse</a> manipulate natural chemical pathways which exist for evolutionarily advantageous reasons; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25749980/">obesity</a> by overeating is caused by natural desires for sweet and fatty foods; and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15577272/">gambling addiction</a> is likely linked to a history of continuously searching for scarce high-calorie food and other risky but rewarding endeavours.</p>

<p>Yep, thatâ€™s Rust code with embedded Objective-C syntax, and it works. Why would you do such a thing? Maybe you want tighter interop between the Rust and Objective-C parts of your iOS app. Maybe you want to write your iOS app <em>entirely</em> in Rust. Or maybe you just wanted to see if it was possible after your <a href="https://twitter.com/porglezomp">colleague</a>â€™s offhand remark.</p>

<p>(For me, it was the last one, absolutely.)</p>

<p>This post is going to walk through what it took to make this possible, so hereâ€™s a table of contents:</p>

<p>Sections 3-5 might actually be useful to other people looking to write Rust macros, so even though this project is a toy, you may still get something out of reading the post. However, if youâ€™re looking to use Objective-C from Rust in production, you should not be using my unsafe toy here. Instead, use Steven Sheldonâ€™s <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a>. Sheldon also has a blog post from near the start of the project that talks about <a href="https://sasheldon.com/blog/2014/11/28/interoperating-between-objective-c-and-rust/">his design process beyond the bare message-send implementation</a>.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to see the full source of my little monstrosity, you can <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/rust-inline-objc/">check out the repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-objective-c">Background on Objective-C</h2>

<p>My normal audience these days is probably Swift developers, but I expect this one to make rounds with at least some Rust people as well. Itâ€™d be easy for both groups to not have much direct experience with Objective-C, the primary language used by Apple for both macOS<sup id="fnref:osx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:osx">1</a></sup> and iOS since their releases in 2001 and 2007. So, hereâ€™s the quick summary: itâ€™s â€œjustâ€� C, except when you start working with â€œobjectâ€� types. And nearly everything you do with those objects is based on a dynamic dispatch model implemented in the <em>runtime.</em> Because of the two parts of that sentence (â€œdynamic dispatchâ€� and â€œimplemented in the runtimeâ€�), people have come up with a lot of clever and powerful techniques to make programs simpler, more expressive, or more extensible, though sometimes at the cost of security, secrecy, and stability.</p>

<p>More relevant to us, however, is that a language whose features are (nearly) all available in a runtime library is a language thatâ€™s easy to bridge to dynamically, as long as you donâ€™t have really tight performance constraints. So hereâ€™s the deal: nearly everything you do in Objective-C is calling methods by <em>sending messages,</em> and the way this works is that methods are regular C functions stored in a dispatch table keyed by a uniqued string called a <dfn>selector</dfn>. It is likely that the most heavily-optimized piece of code in Appleâ€™s libraries is <code>objc_msgSend</code>, which takes a <dfn>receiver</dfn>, a selector, and the arguments to the method, does a (cached) lookup of the selector in the receiverâ€™s classâ€™s dispatch table(s), and then jumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the method.</p>

<p>There are more things the Objective-C runtime exposes, but messages are absolutely the most important.</p>

<p>â€¦Oh, one more thing. Because Objective-C is an extension to C, it has to use syntax that doesnâ€™t conflict with C syntax. That means keywords with <code>@</code> signs in front of themâ€”one of the few symbols on the US keyboard that doesnâ€™t already have a meaning in Câ€”and a unique bracket-based â€œmessage sendâ€� syntax that takes a while to get used to:</p>

<pre><code>// Objective-C
NSString *fileStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:fileContents encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

// Pseudo-Swift
let fileStr: NSString = NSString.alloc().initWithData(fileContents, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Actual Swift
let fileStr = NSString(data: fileContents, encoding: .utf8)

// Pseudo-Rust
let fileStr: *const NSString = NSString::alloc().initWithData(fileContents, NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Idiomatic-ish Rust
let file_str = NSString::from_data(file_contents, NSStringEncoding::UTF8)
</code></pre>

<p>People almost universally think Objective-C syntax is ugly when they first see it, almost universally find it completely normal after a few years, and largely (though <em>not</em> almost universally) find idiomatic Swift easier to read even if theyâ€™re used to Objective-C.</p>

<h2 id="objective-c-from-rust-manually">Objective-C from Rust, manually</h2>

<p>From this point on youâ€™ll be expected to read Rust syntax without step-by-step explanations. Iâ€™ll try to explain whatâ€™s going on for my Swift and other non-Rust readersâ€”I myself am still a relative newcomer to Rustâ€”but itâ€™ll be pretty fast. This is <em>not</em> intended to be an introduction to Rust or Rust macros!</p>

<p>Given that the Objective-C runtime exposes a public API, we should be able to pretty much just call that from Rust, and indeed we can:</p>

<p>Now, this code should make most Rust users pretty horrified. It starts out okay, declaring some types and then declaring the Rust versions of the C API from libobjc. Then itâ€™s got a funny empty extern block to link the Foundation framework, but sure, thatâ€™s fine. And itâ€™s got explicitly-null-terminated strings because thatâ€™s what C-based APIs generally use. (Rust doesnâ€™t guarantee null termination by default, which makes slicing a Rust string easier.)</p>

<p>But then thereâ€™s a monstrosity of a line involving <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html"><code>std::mem::transmute</code></a>, Rustâ€™s equivalent of Swiftâ€™s <code>unsafeBitCast(_:)</code> or C++â€™s <code>reinterpret_cast</code> (and now <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast"><code>bit_cast</code></a>) or Câ€™sâ€¦well, okay, C doesnâ€™t have a direct equivalent, but a plain old cast when youâ€™re talking about function pointers like this. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html">docs for <code>transmute</code></a> even tell you to go use other things if possible.</p>

<p>So, what are we doing? Well, remember what I said about Objective-C and <code>objc_msgSend</code>: methods are regular C functions, and <code>objc_msgSend</code> â€œjumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the methodâ€�. That means that the correct way to call <code>objc_msgSend</code> is to <em>pretend it has the right type for the method youâ€™re calling.</em></p>

<p>In C (and Swift, for that matter), that conversion would require explicitly specifying the type of all arguments and return values. But Rust has really powerful type inference within a function body, and that extends to specifying only <em>some</em> generic parameters, and leaving others out.<sup id="fnref:swift-inference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:swift-inference">2</a></sup> In this case I need to specify that weâ€™re casting to a C function pointer with two arguments and a non-void return, but not anything more than that. The remaining information will be filled in based on how the function pointer is used.</p>

<p>With that, you should understand the (cursed) code above. Go ahead. Try it on your own machine (if your machine is a Mac).</p>

<h2 id="recursive-rust-macros">Recursive Rust macros</h2>

<p>Rust has a pretty robust macro system, so it wouldnâ€™t be impossible or even too hard to make a macro for â€œmessage sendâ€�. Thatâ€™s the route that the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a> takes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>url_class</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>NSURL</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>description_obj</span>: <span>*</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>url_class</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>description</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>description_obj</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>UTF8String</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>CStr</span>::<span>from_ptr</span><span>(</span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span>).</span><span>to_string_lossy</span><span>());</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But while thatâ€™s clearly the right choice for serious Rust work, I wanted something more ambitious. More integrated. Moreâ€¦ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wait a minute. this is just objective-c <a href="https://t.co/dVQMYKKVTI">pic.twitter.com/dVQMYKKVTI</a></p>— Harlan Haskins (@harlanhaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/1133210047952015360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>What I wanted was for Objective-Câ€™s messaging syntax, or something like it, to be valid anywhere in Rust code. It didnâ€™t have to be exactly Objective-C, but I quickly realized the <em>advantage</em> of Objective-Câ€™s syntax: itâ€™s delimited, i.e. itâ€™s a self-contained expression that can be dropped into something larger without changing how that larger thing parses. (Thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s bracketed in C as well.) Within the brackets, thereâ€™s basically two forms:</p>

<pre><code>[receiver-expr no-arg-selector]
[receiver-expr selector-piece:arg-expr selector-piece:second-arg-expr...]
</code></pre>

<p>If I were <em>just</em> matching that, I could use Rustâ€™s original <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">pattern-matching macros</a>. But to take a whole block of code, and replace everything that looks like a message lock <em>in</em> that blockâ€¦well, it might be possible with pattern-matching and quite a bit of recursion, but itâ€™s going to be a lot easier to use <em><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/21/Procedural-Macros-in-Rust-2018.html">procedural macros</a>,</em> a Rust macro interface written in Rust and used as a compiler plugin. (Swift folks, basically what <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax">SwiftSyntax</a> allows you to do, but invoked on-demand during compilation.)</p>

<p><a href="https://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> has been JavaScript’s unofficial standard functional programming library for a decade (together with its major fork, <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>). Its most recent significant development is the move to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">ECMAScript 6 modules</a> (ESM). Underscore 1.11 is the first version to be fully modular.</p>
<p>With the new modularity, you can now create a custom build of Underscore with an even smaller footprint. At the same time, we still provide the standard UMD build, which is perfect if you want to get started quickly. The UMD bundle is easy to work with and it has great cache retention if you load it from a CDN.</p>
<p>Underscore was originally created by <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas">Jeremy Ashkenas</a> and he is still helping with the releases. Besides Underscore, he created several other awesome JavaScript libraries and tools, notably <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> and <a href="https://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>. If you haven’t heard about them yet, you should check them out.</p>
<p><a href="https://juliangonggrijp.com/">I</a> am not Jeremy Ashkenas, but I modularized Underscore. In this article, I will discuss the ins and outs of modular Underscore, and I will try to answer all questions you may have. The article is written Q&amp;A style, so you can read it once, then come back later and use it as a reference.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-_">What is _?</h3>
<p>Besides a bunch of essential functions, Underscore exports an object named <code>_</code>, which is central to its functionality. Hence the name “Underscore”. <code>_</code> is all of the following at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>A namespace handle through which you can access the <code>VERSION</code> string as well as all the functions: <code>_.each</code>, <code>_.VERSION</code>.</li>
<li>The entry point for customizing the behavior of Underscore functions, currently through <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#iteratee"><code>_.iteratee</code></a> and <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#template"><code>_.templateSettings</code></a>.</li>
<li>The default placeholder for <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#partial"><code>_.partial</code></a>.</li>
<li>A special value wrapping function that enables <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#oop">OO style</a> and <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#chaining">chaining</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The role of namespace handle is probably the most well known. Before the advent of ES6 modules, having such a namespace handle was a necessity. There are many other libraries from this era that exploit the namespace handle to be a useful function as well. jQuery’s <code>$</code> is a famous example of this. While there is no longer a strong incentive to have a multi-purpose namespace handle, it continues to be useful, so we keep it around in Underscore. In ES6 module context, it is still the <code>default</code> export.</p>
<p>Arguably, the role of special value wrapping function is much more interesting. Thanks to this function, you can do <code>_.map(x, f)</code>, <code>_(x).map(f)</code> or <code>_.chain(x).map(f).value()</code>. These expressions are equivalent, and they share a single underlying implementation of the <code>map</code> function. The same applies to all other Underscore functions. This is made possible by having a standalone definition of each function, and then adding all functions to <code>_</code> with a single call to <a href="https://underscorejs.org/#mixin"><code>_.mixin</code></a>. It is a very elegant design; please take a peek at (the bottom of) the <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore-esm.html">annotated source</a> if you’d like to admire the details.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-monolithic-interface">What is the monolithic interface?</h3>
<p>The <code>_</code> object with its magical bells and whistles is made out of all the parts of the Underscore library. As such, <code>_</code> represents the whole library at once; this is what I mean by the monolithic interface. Historically, this used to be the <em>only</em> interface to the library.</p>
<p>Any module that provides <code>_</code> depends on all of Underscore. If your project imports something from such a module, even if you do not import <code>_</code> itself, then your project effectively imports all of Underscore. I refer to this as “using the monolithic interface” in a wide sense.</p>
<p>Don’t worry though! With modular Underscore, you can have all the tricks that <code>_</code> provides, such as chaining, and still be selective about which parts you want to import. Basically, you can create your own variant of the monolithic interface. I’ll cover the details below.</p>
<p>I should add that Underscore is both lightweight and widely adopted. Using the standard monolithic interface is a wise choice in many cases. More on this below as well.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-modular-interface">What is the modular interface?</h3>
<p>As of version 1.11, every individual part of Underscore can be imported from a separate module. Selectively importing these parts directly, instead of relying on a module that gives you the monolithic interface, amounts to using the modular interface.</p>
<p>There is a separate module for each Underscore function. Some of these functions, notably <code>mixin</code> and <code>chain</code>, can be used to create your own customized monolithic interface.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the modular interface brings powerful flexibility but also responsibility. The standard monolithic interface is well designed and coherent. If you choose to omit parts of it, you might end up with something that doesn’t do what you want.</p>
<p>I will detail the options and the pitfalls below.</p>
<h3 id="why-tiny-modules">Why tiny modules?</h3>
<p>In general, spreading the source code of a project over multiple modules promotes code reuse. If I can pick the code that I am interested in from your library, without having to import code that I am not interested in, then I am more likely to use the code that you already wrote, instead of reinventing the wheel. Everyone saves time and we get our flying cars sooner.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/pull/2849">modularized Underscore</a>, I went for the most extreme option: I put every function in a separate module. I did this in order to maximize the potential for code reuse. I want users to be able to select <em>exactly</em> the code that they need; no more, no less. I am already working on a library that will exploit this myself.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-treeshaking">What about treeshaking?</h3>
<p>In theory, I would not need to go all the way down to individual function modules in order to get perfect selectivity. Tools like <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">Rollup</a> can isolate individual functions from a larger module, a “trick” known as treeshaking. In practice, however, static analysis of JavaScript is hard. With everything being mutable and unsafely typed, it can be hard to tell whether one piece of code might influence another, especially without human intelligence, and the tools are far from perfect as a result.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/pull/2826">early stage</a> of my modularization effort, all of the exported functions were still pooled together in a single ES module. At this stage, I tested treeshaking with <code>_.map</code>. It sort of worked, in the sense that the result was only about half as large as the whole Underscore library. When I further split this module down to the individual functions, however, <code>_.map</code> shrank by another factor of 3. It turns out that <code>_.map</code>, and the other Underscore functions that it depends on, together make up only one sixth of the library.</p>
<p>\( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \), so there is a whole third of the Underscore code that Rollup is not able to treeshake. The only way to avoid needlessly importing that code is to manually isolate it in a separate module, which is exactly what I did.</p>
<h3 id="what-build-variants-can-i-choose-from">What build variants can I choose from?</h3>
<p>The source code consists of ESM modules. These modules live in the <code>modules/</code> package subdirectory and you can use them directly. From the source, we build several variants in order to cater to a wide range of use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>underscore.js</code> (in the package root), the monolithic UMD bundle. This file has the same path and the same format as older versions of Underscore. It is also still the <code>main</code> entry of the package, and it is the variant that you are most likely to use in the short term.</li>
<li><code>underscore-esm.js</code>, the monolithic ESM bundle. While fully supported, this variant is likely to see mostly experimental usage in the short term.</li>
<li><code>amd/</code>, the modular AMD build. This directory contains an AMD version of each source module.</li>
<li><code>cjs/</code>, the modular CommonJS build, analogous to the modular AMD build.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Monolithic bundle” in the first two build variants means both that the variant provides the monolithic interface, and that it is entirely contained in a single file.</p>
<p>Naturally, only the modular variants support modular usage. All variants support monolithic usage, but for efficiency, it is best to use the monolithic bundles.</p>
<h3 id="why-have-monolithic-build-variants">Why have monolithic build variants?</h3>
<p>Modules are useful, but the monolithic bundles have some compelling advantages as well (besides backwards compatibility):</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is easier to read and it is easier to see the big picture. This is why we render the <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore-esm.html">single-read annotated source</a> from the monolithic build. Although it can be fun and somewhat illuminating to discover the code by clicking through <a href="https://underscorejs.org/docs/modules/index-all.html">the annotated modules</a>.</li>
<li>Reading a single large file from a file system is substantially faster than reading many small files.</li>
<li>On the web, sending a single request with a large response is substantially more efficient than sending many requests with small responses.</li>
<li>Since Underscore is such a major library, cache retention is likely to be very good if you embed the standard monolithic bundle from a CDN, especially the UMD bundle. More on this in the next sections.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-a-cdn">What are the benefits of a CDN?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/using-a-cdn-to-speed-up-static-content-delivery">CDNs</a> are <em>awesome</em>, especially for open source libraries. In a nutshell, websites often use the same resources—such as Underscore—and by referencing those resources from a common URL, instead of hosting their own copies, they enjoy <em>collaborativ…</em></p></article></div>

	<p><img alt="SQUADS HAVE EXISTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS" src="https://otherinter.net/squad-ancient.png"></p>
<p>Recent events&nbsp;have completely exposed the limits of individual agency, creating a powerful demand for squad-based forms of resiliency. The COVID-19 pandemic is the most recent of these social bonding agents: though we're <em>physically</em> distancing, <em>emotionally</em> we're getting closer. First priority when the virus dropped was securing your squad. The need for group coordination and decision-making soon followed.</p>
<p>But today's emerging culture of group cohesion is driven equally by the social and financial precarity of urban life. <em>Family are those we share space and rent with</em>. Priced out of tier-1 cities, individuals have banded together to survive a jobless market with no social safety net.</p>
<p>Squads are both a product of—and a response to—contemporary social atomization. The trope of "getting a place upstate" signifies young city-dwellers' desire for new kinds of squad-based homesteading. HOMESQUADING is a modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-the-land_movement">back-to-the-land movement</a>—swap Whole Earth-inspired post-war communes with post-internet surf clubs microblogging the virtues of cooperative housing, permaculture gardening, and solar-powered mesh networks.</p>
<p>Squad culture is the antithesis of neoliberal individualism. Millennials are healing from decades of irony poisoning, rediscovering what it's like to have generative, exploratory relationships with one another. Younger generations are already imbued with extremely powerful squad energy, equipped with formative experiences in Minecraft, DOTA 2, and Fortnite parties.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-ngram.png" alt="Military connotations aside, the arrival of group DMs ushers a new age of &quot;SQUAD&quot; discourse."></p>
<p>Military connotations aside, the arrival of group DMs ushers a new age of "SQUAD" discourse.</p>
<p>Whether bound together for survival or for lols, the squads formed by today's crisis will be resilient. Distance is no longer a barrier with the closeness of network space—soon vital culture will be predominantly enacted by fictive kin. Group collaboration is now the strong default, putting squads at the center of social, cultural, and economic life. To paraphrase Bill Bishop: today people are born as individuals, and have to find their squad.</p>

<p>While ancient squads were brought together by the struggle for survival, always-on group communication sets the scene for contemporary squad culture. Group chats and adapted team workspaces create shared context and institutional memory. One necessary condition of the squad is this sense of <em>persistence</em>: co-presence and continuous availability to one another.</p>
<p>But the squad is more than a loose network of affiliations, it's a coherent body. A second prerequisite of squad formation is self-recognition. It's not you or me. It's <em>Us</em>. <em>We.</em> <em>Ours</em>. This pillar often follows from the first. Squads may start as one-off Telegram channels, but they soon become "The Group Chat," a metonym for the squad itself.</p>
<p>For the squad to understand itself as a whole, it maintains boundaries circumscribing strong group norms. Fuck a Dunbar number—the ideal squad count is no more than 12. How can you really be <em>present</em> with more than a dozen people? Small groups are crucial for tight coordination. A greater network may surround the squad, making it appear big and fuzzy from the outside. But for the core crew, an invisible circle binds and protects a space of group identity.</p>
<p>As SQUAD VIBES grow, so does the possibility of interdependence and resource sharing—social, emotional, financial. Trust brought by consistent socialization and self-recognition is a foundation for exploring what the squad is capable of together. SQUAD CULTURE has only just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvJ7yW7Y3RY">begun</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-theory.png" alt="Theory of the squad"></p>

<p>The pandemic flipped the script on sharing space IRL, but our newly domestic reality only brought to the physical world what was already extremely online. Originally conceived as series of linked documents, Web 2.0 mass productization turned the internet into a series of linked interiors.</p>
<p>Today's squads are expressions of digital locality and the new squad era forces us to reconsider the individuated logic of early social networks. Contrary to early visions of hypertext, the internet is not a singular World Wide Web, traversed by individuals. To be online today is to enter the global arena. Mass social media are hazardous PvP zones no one should traverse without team support.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-network-groupings.png" alt="Network graph of twitter with people-based groupings"></p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-network.png" alt="Network graph of twitter"></p>
<p>The Twitter subcultures shown above are only a sliver of an expansive social deep web. Beneath this fuzzy graph is SQUAD SPACE, the network of inner-zones where digital microcultures are born: group DMs, Discords, Slacks, Keybases. Memes forged in SQUAD SPACE bubble out into the "clearnet" above, pwning NPCs on the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">internet of beefs</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-spaces.png" alt="Evolution of squad spaces"></p>
<p>Squad culture is downstream of squad space, and the digital places squads inhabit are only getting more advanced. The Discord can suddenly be on calls together. The Keybase can now use Git. <a href="https://subpixel.space/entries/come-for-the-network-pay-for-the-tool/">The team toolkit defines its capabilities</a>, and different platforms enable different modes of squad thought. Squad space is more than environment, it's a collective body, a shared cognition layer. Squad space is where market-moving trades are planned, conspiracies are conceived, and memes are spawned. Members of the squad may live in different geographies—but within this space, everyone is on SQUAD TIME. <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memes/">The founding of a new group DM is year zero</a>.</p>
<p>Group dynamics ebb and flow with their environment, and nowhere more than SQUAD SPACE. Ecology calls this process “niche formation.” Online it's SQUAD CULTURE.</p>

<p>Inside the subterranean caves of the social deep web, chosen-kin groups grow their own culture. The squad doesn't need its own micro-currency—images, art, music, takes, shitposts, and, indeed, roasts are the native medium of exchange. Likewise squads have little use for internal financial incentives. Instead, playful exchanges produce trust, reciprocity, and VIBES—the ineffable group energy that squads value most. Accordingly, the core of squad production is the continuous production of the squad itself.</p>
<p>Evidenced by the power of crypto memetics, ragtag squads of shitposters have the power to define new forms of value based on their own esoteric social frameworks. Memeing produces "assets" that cannot be traditionally valued, but are capable of commanding cultural and economic movements.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-vibes.png" alt="Examples of squad vibes, including Twitch plays Pokemon, Chainlink $LINK Marines, Weird Sun Twitter, Brockhampton, Tik Tok Hype Houses, Theory of Vibe by Peli Grietzer, Bitcoin, and Headless Brands"></p>
<p>Memes, hot takes, internal language, 𝓪𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓬𝓼... artifacts that can only be formulated as a group are the mainstay of squad production. The group exudes potent SQUAD VIBES, and vibes attract. Outsiders want to share the vibe—sometimes for the social capital, sometimes because the content produced is of strategic value, and always because the energy is infectious. After enough fire in the group DM, some squads begin to externalize their social products. Podcasting is obviously a squad technology. Rapid publishing turns memes into whitepapers, quickly flooding the marketplace of ideas with locally-grown squad humor.</p>
<p>Whether formed by necessity or chance, once together the squad's potential for creative production is immeasurable. <a href="https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/?lang=enview">VIBE</a> is an unstable substance of high informtion density. In formalizing their vibes, squads may accidentally give birth to <a href="https://otherinter.net/web3/headless-brands/">headless brands</a>, virtual personalities, and pseudonymous entities they may not even be able to control. Thus the squad transitions from its youthful, entropic state, harnessing its vibes to create a source of unfathomable squad energy.</p>


<p>Group identity. Shared space. Vibes. These not only enable the creation of social capital, but strengthen the squad's capacity to organize, minimizing transaction costs and leading to greater productive capacities and resilience; this is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm">the nature of the squad</a>." But while squads can be viewed as a "nexus of contracts", unlike the Coasean firm, they are without legal structure. Social contracts are instead effected through the unspoken bonds of <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/the-vibes-theory-of-organisational-design-937a73f791cd">mutual respect and ingroup norms</a>.</p>
<p>But to sustain this solidarity economy the squad may look for ways to translate vibes into monetizable modes of public engagement: clients, subscribers, sponsors, music deals, yields. SQUAD PRODUCTION begins with the creation of processes and interfaces to convert creative labor into units that can be transmitted by global network participants. Here SQUAD TOOLS come into play. Vibes generated at the DAW, on the Figma board, or in the gaming lobby are turned consumable cultural instruments. Then it's just a matter of distribution. Young artists create online galleries and independent labels because they allow groups to interact (and transact) with the world through familiar organizational patterns. Bandcamps, Twitch pages, DAOs are public APIs for squads to interact with entities beyond their trust boundary.</p>
<p><img src="https://otherinter.net/squad-trust-stream.png" alt="Example of a Twitch stream from Berlin-based Trust (squad)"></p>
<p>Some digital tools are public interfaces, while others are used to coordinate internally. Today this SQUAD INFRASTRUCTURE is comprised of simple software primitives: Venmo, Splitwise, Cash App. These apps are financial plumbing that facilitate internal coordination between squad members by minimizing the awkwardness of asking your friends for money. Despite the strong demand for SQUAD RESILIENCY, the social stigma of group finances is still a major barrier to economic exchange among friends.</p>
<p>In-app mechanics like budget trackers, polls, and coin-flips offer a half-way point between social agreements and technical solutions. For instance Splitwise relies heavily on the social norms to ensure expenses are entered accurately. By allowing individuals to opt-in to a set of rules for retroactive settlement the group's social friction and coordination costs are reduced. Civilization advances by extending the number of important functions squads can perform without thinking.</p>
<p>Some believe new software can liberate "individual creators." But this kind of thinking inevitably leads to Uberized platform-mediated wage labor. We want to liberate squads. <em>The <strong>group</strong> is the basic user class for the tools we need today as a society, yet few pieces of software allow the squad as a whole to produce cooperatively and generate wealth together</em>. To fully realize SQUAD CULTURE this must change.</p>

						<p>It’s easy to imagine that governments were always as bureaucratic as they are today. Certain policies, like the widespread granting of monopolies in the seventeenth century, or the presence of a powerful landed aristocracy, seem like archaic products of a past that was simply more corrupt. The fact that governments rarely got involved with healthcare or education before the mid-nineteenth century seems the product of a lack of imagination, or perhaps yet another product of our ancestors’ venality – simply what happens when you put the war-hungry knights and nobles in charge.</p>
<p>But the bureaucratic state of today, with its officials involving themselves with every aspect of modern life, is a relatively recent invention. In a world without bureaucracy, when state capacity was relatively lacking, it’s difficult to see what other options monarchs would have had. Suppose yourself transported to the throne of England in 1500, and crowned monarch. Once you bored of the novelty and luxuries of being head of state, you might become concerned about the lot of the common man and woman. Yet even if you wanted to create a healthcare system, or make education free and universal to all children, or even create a police force (London didn’t get one until 1829, and the rest of the country not til much later), there is absolutely no way you could succeed.</p>
<p>For a start, you would struggle to maintain your hold on power. Fund schools you say? Somebody will have to pay. The nobles? Well, try to tax them — in many European states they were exempt from taxation — and you might quickly lose both your throne and your head. And supposing you do manage to tax them, after miraculously stamping out an insurrection without their support, how would you even begin to go about collecting it? There was simply no central government agency capable of raising it. Working out how much people should pay, chasing up non-payers, and even the physical act of collection, not to mention protecting that treasure once collected, all takes substantial manpower. Not to mention the fact that the collecting agents will likely siphon most of it off to line their own pockets.</p>
<p>As a monarch in 1500, you would be forced to rely heavily on delegation. As the economic historian Jared Rubin emphasizes, every ruler requires agents to propagate their rule. These can take the form of big burly blokes with heavy weapons — your enforcers — and they can take the form of people spreading the ideology of your right to rule, lending your orders legitimacy and more generally spreading social norms of obedience — the local officials, jurists, and clerics. Crucially, these propagating agents needed to be kept on-side at all costs. Hence the tax exemptions for nobles, many of whom were rich enough to support their own private armies, and whose ancestors might have been granted such a privilege by one of your predecessors.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc’s village, for example, was exempted from taxation <i>forever,</i> because of her role in restoring the French king’s military fortunes. And hence the control often exerted over policy by religious figures, who could give one’s rule divine sanction in the eyes of the people. It is no surprise that the emperors of China carefully cultivated themselves at the head of as many religions as possible (one of the reasons that Christianity, with its rather awkward stress on Jesus being the king of kings, was occasionally banned from the empire). As economic historians Mark Koyama and Noel Johnson argue, this focus on appeasing religious legitimisers was one of the reasons rulers so often sought to stamp out heretics and heathens.</p>
<p>Even beyond satisfying the propagating agents, however, core state activities like tax collection were heavily reliant on delegation of authority. Absent an expensive bureaucracy to do it on your behalf, it was much easier to farm out the activity to others. When taxing a predominantly agrarian society — in 1500, only 3.6% of England’s population lived in cities — it made most sense to appoint a local noble to be tax farmer for an area. As a local, they would know the area well, and the products of the land are relatively straightforward to tax. It’s not exactly easy to hide. And as for the tax farmer, they could be remunerated by taking a cut of what they collected. Corrupt, yes. But inevitable and even seen as legitimate, given the lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>Your capacity as a ruler was thus entirely governed by the <em>quid pro quo</em>, and heavily restricted by the deals made by your predecessors. Cities were granted charters, giving them various rights of self-governance, in return for collecting taxes from among their own members (commerce and industry being much harder to tax than land, and thus requiring more consent). And, of course, there were occasionally times when the defence of the realm might require extra taxes — for such instances, rulers convened parliaments. Taxes raised by parliaments were referred to, somewhat confusingly, as “subsidies”. But that is exactly what they were: special subsidies granted to the monarch, by the collected representatives of the nobles and the various other propagating agents, for a one-off extraordinary purpose – albeit giving those collected agents some say over policy.</p>
<p>It was not until 1689, when there was a coup, that an incoming ruler allowed the English parliament to sit whenever it pleased. Before that, it was convened only at the whim of the ruler, and dispersed even at the slightest provocation. In 1621, for example, when James I was planning to marry his heir to a Spanish princess, Parliament sent him a petition asserting their right to debate the matter. Upon hearing of it, he called for the official record of parliamentary proceedings, personally ripped out the page with the offending vote, and promptly dissolved the Parliament. The downside, of course, was that James could not then acquire any parliamentary subsidies.</p>
<p>Ruling was thus an intensely personal affair, of making deals and finding ways to circumvent deals you had inherited. Increasing your capabilities as a ruler – state capacity – was thus no easy task, as the typical ruler was stuck in an essentially medieval equilibrium. Imposing a policy costs money, but raising money involves imposing policy. Breaking out of this chicken-and-egg problem took centuries of canny leadership. The rulers who achieved it most would today seem hopelessly corrupt.</p>
<p>To gain extra cash without interference from Parliament, successive monarchs first asserted and then abused their ancient prerogative rights to grant monopolies over trades and industries. They eventually granted them to whomever was willing to pay, establishing monopolies over industries like gambling cards or alehouses under the guise of regulating unsavoury activities. They also sold off knighthoods and titles, and in 1670 Charles II even made a secret deal with the French that he would convert to Catholicism and attack the Protestant Dutch, all in exchange for cash. Anything to not have to call a potentially pesky Parliament. At times, the most effective rulers even resembled mob bosses. Take Elizabeth I’s anger when a cloth-laden merchant fleet bound for an Antwerp fair in 1559 was allowed to depart. Her order to stop them had not arrived in time, thus preventing her from extracting “loans” from the merchants while she still had their goods within her power.</p>
<p>Yet, ironically, it was when monarchs lost control that they did most to boost the capabilities of the centralised state. It was under Parliament, first in the 1650s when it briefly overthrew the monarchy, and then from the late 1680s following its deal with the usurping William III, that British state capacity began to most rapidly and inexorably grow. Likewise, in France, it was following the French Revolution that the steady rise of state capacity was boosted — it was then, over three centuries after the fact, that the perpetual tax exemptions for Joan of Arc’s village were finally rescinded.</p>
<p>Parliaments, as bodies of legitimising agents, despite their lack of representation in any modern democratic sense, had the unquestioned legitimacy with which to raise taxes, change policy, and undo the deals of previous monarchs. In the process, they often trampled on the ancient liberties of citizens and subjects. But, unlike monarchs, they found it much easier to force the changes through. When motivated by the needs of war — often the one thing members could agree on — parliaments in the eighteenth century were able to raise cash that would have been unfathomable to the monarchs of even a few decades before. And it was parliaments, also, that were eventually susceptible in the nineteenth century to the lobbying of those who wished the state to involve itself in areas like education, health, and policing.</p>
<p>The route to state capacity thus took centuries of blood, dirty dealing, corruption and campaigning to make the states we have to today. But it is difficult to see how it could have been done in any other way.</p>

    <p>It takes roughly 2 weeks to form a habit; it takes roughly two weeks to get comfortable in a new environment. A common mistake is to treat a new report’s first couple weeks like college orientation - social, light hearted, get-to-know-you stuff. If your report spends the first two weeks reading C# documentation and having lunch out on the town with the team, guess what, they’ve just normalized that behavior as what the role is.</p>

<p>The answer: start your report doing real work as soon as possible. If they’re a software engineer, they should be committing code week one (ideally day 2 or 3); If they’re a product manager, they should be attending meetings and picking up supporting activities on a similar time frame. Then the tone has been set - working here means getting things done.</p>

<p>This means as manager you need to give your report tractable work in the first week. Managers not being ready for a report to start is the number one reason people end up normalizing underperformance, because they had nothing meaningful to do. If a manager describes a report as not having initiative in the first couple weeks it’s a red flag - it’s the manager’s job to provide new hires with clear paths to contribute immediately.</p>

<p>Another main reason people fall into onboarding traps is because your organization has painfully slow onboarding. Endless HR videos, slow security processes, a mountain of fragile technology setup - these all make for a shitty and counterproductive start at a company. Optimize your onboarding to get people doing what you hired them to do. Look to formalize performance indicators of your onboarding. For example, for engineers this could be time-to-first-commit and time-to-joining-sprints.</p>

<p>This approach holds for managers and executives as well. In that cohort it’s also common and a common red flag for people to spend the first couple weeks putzing around under the guise of “getting to know what’s going on”. Managers and executives should be involved in the decisions of the team from day 1 and developing artifacts - plans, TODO lists, strategy documents - in the first couple weeks. With good managers and executives you see them day 1 adding perspective and insight into conversations, and everyone collectively appreciates that the right person has been hired.</p>

<p>Onboarding is one of the most critical periods in a person’s time at a company. It’s one of the highest ROI periods when managing someone. Take that opportunity to set expectations properly and measure success quantiatively.</p>

                </h5><p><span><p>The door lock - a key function in every modern home, as well as a product which is today undergoing drastic change. The digital revolution has not left the door lock untouched, and there is today a wide variety of digital door locks utilizing technologies ranging from touch displays to fingerprint readers.</p><p>The premises of the project was to try a different approach to the digital door lock and implement it schoolyard-style using a secret knock sequence, set by the user. The secret sequence would consist of two elements, both a rhythmical and a positional pattern. To unlock the door, the user would therefore need to simultaneously knock the correct rhythm and knock at the correct positions. To record and analyze the knock vibrations, piezo electric sensors connected to an Arduino Uno were used. To unlock the door, a small servo motor, two gears and a timing belt were used to turn the lock turning knob .</p><p>Despite a short time frame and hardships due to the limitations caused by the coronavirus outbreak, a fully functional prototype which fulfilled both reliability and consistency was achieved. It could with good consistency recognize the test sequence, which was the intro rhythm to â€�We Will Rock Youâ€� knocked in a square pattern. But even with flawless functionality, the conclusion would have been the same. The security of the system may be exceptional from a technical perspective, but it falls flat when the human factor is taken into account. The ability for a potential burglar to simply watch as one executes the secret knock is too much of a security hazard for the system to ever be considered as a competitor to other alternatives. The usage of the system is therefore better suited for applications where the thrill of using the product is more important than the actual security of it.</p></span></p><h5>Abstract [sv]

Det hemliga knackningsmÃ¶nstret skulle dÃ¥ bestÃ¥ av bÃ¥de ett rytmiskt och ett positionellt mÃ¶nster. DÃ¤rmed skulle den som ville Ã¶ppna dÃ¶rren behÃ¶va knacka bÃ¥de rÃ¤tt rytm, och pÃ¥ rÃ¤tt stÃ¤llen pÃ¥ dÃ¶rren. FÃ¶r att spela in och analysera vibrationerna frÃ¥n knackningarna anvÃ¤ndes piezoelektriska sensorer kopplade till en Arduino Uno.

<p>From Germany come leaks around the performance of the&nbsp;<strong>AMD EPYC MILAN</strong>&nbsp;CPUs, which are expected to be the first CPUs with the&nbsp;<strong>Zen3</strong>&nbsp;microarchitecture&nbsp;to hit the market.&nbsp;As indicated, the&nbsp;<strong>7nm</strong>&nbsp;manufacturing process, the same maximum number of cores (64), the use of DDR4 memory, and the PCI-Express 4.0 interface are maintained.</p>
<p>The novelties are changes in the structure of the Core Compute Die (CCD) and, therefore, of the Core Compute Complex (CCX).&nbsp;Each of the current CCDs consists of two CCX clusters in which the L3 cache is divided into two 16MB caches.&nbsp;With MILAN&nbsp;<strong>this cache will not be divided</strong>, so it comes in the form of a single 32 MB cache.&nbsp;AMD itself had mentioned integrating more than 32 MB in October, so it apparently has not reached more than 32 MB.&nbsp;The number of nuclei is identical to eight per CCD, but the CCX clusters in their former form no longer exist.</p>
<p>The data also provides performance values: these speak of&nbsp;<strong>a +15 percent CPI-related performance increase</strong>&nbsp;for entire workloads.&nbsp;For EPYC processors with up to 32 cores, AMD wants to achieve&nbsp;<strong>a performance increase of +20 percent</strong>&nbsp;compared to ROME processors with Zen2 cores;&nbsp;single thread performance should also increase&nbsp;<strong>by +20 percent</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;For the largest EPYC processors with up to 64 cores, AMD expects a performance increase&nbsp;<strong>of around 10 to 15 percent</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Apparently,&nbsp;<strong>AMD can achieve a higher clock frequency</strong>&nbsp;for processors with fewer cores, so that the increase in performance has a correspondingly greater effect with fewer cores.&nbsp;So far this is not surprising, as it is the expected performance improvement since practically the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>If we want a bigger performance leap, we will have to wait for the&nbsp;<strong>AMD EPYC GENOVA</strong>&nbsp;, where&nbsp;<strong>Zen4 @ 5nm</strong>&nbsp;with TDPs from 120&nbsp;<strong>to 240W</strong>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<strong>DDR5</strong>&nbsp;memory&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>PCI-Express 5.0</strong>&nbsp;interface&nbsp;would come into play&nbsp;, which would arrive at the end of 2021.</p>

For example, we <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-lead-engineer-programming-language-typescript-took-off-thanks-to-googles-angular/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopted TypeScript in its early days</a> because we wanted all developers using the framework to take advantage of compile-time type checking. This way, we enabled an excellent development experience for everyone with better editor support, allowing people to ship apps with <a href="http://earlbarr.com/publications/typestudy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fewer issues</a>.</p><p id="d454">In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.angular.io/version-10-of-angular-now-available-78960babd41">v10</a> we announced a <strong>strict opt-in mode that allows us to perform more build-time optimizations and help you deliver faster apps with fewer defects</strong>. This mode is still only an opt-in because it comes with its trade-offs — stricter type checking and extra configuration. <strong>We want to hear from you which of these trade-offs will make you more productive and allow you to deliver better apps.</strong></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*DYmwph_Jdr5cqt0T.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="012b">To opt into the strict mode, you need to create a new Angular CLI app, specifying the <code>--strict</code> flag:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="109f">The command above will generate a workspace with the following settings enabled on top of the defaults:</p><ul><li id="baee">Strict mode in TypeScript, as well as other strictness flags recommended by the TypeScript team. Specifically, <code>strict</code>, <code>forceConsistentCasingInFileNames</code>, <code>noImplicitReturns</code>, <code>noFallthroughCasesInSwitch</code></li><li id="ce10">Turns on strict Angular compiler flags <code>strictTemplates</code> and <code>strictInjectionParameters</code></li><li id="4b64">Reduced bundle size budgets by ~75%</li><li id="63c6">Turns on <code>no-any</code> TSLint rule to prevent declarations of type <code>any</code></li><li id="9e06">Marks your application as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/#mark-the-file-as-side-effect-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">side-effect free</a> to enable more advanced tree-shaking</li></ul><p id="fc43">Let us look at each one of these in detail.</p><p id="8fca">Researchers have proven empirically that TypeScript’s compiler helps us fix more issues before we ship our app to production. For more details, check <a href="http://earlbarr.com/publications/typestudy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“To Type or Not to Type: Quantifying Detectable Bugs in JavaScript.”</a> To not step on the way of folks getting started with Angular, by default, we currently don’t enable the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strictest TypeScript compiler options</a> in new CLI workspaces.</p><p id="ce08">One of the first things many developers using Angular do, to get more help from the compiler is to enable the following flags in <code>tsconfig.json</code>:</p><ul><li id="df36"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictPropertyInitialization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strictPropertyInitialization</a></li><li id="e383"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictNullChecks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strictNullChecks</a></li><li id="bd61"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noImplicitAny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noImplicitAny</a></li><li id="cbbc"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictBindCallApply" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strictBindCallApply</a></li><li id="d30b"><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictFunctionTypes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strictFunctionTypes</a></li></ul><p id="049d">This way, they can more confidently ship to production because the compiler has given them some guarantees that their app aligns to a specific contract, defined by the type system. In the CLI’s strict mode, we enable the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript’s </a><code><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">s</a>trict</code><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> flag</a>, which turns these on by default.</p><p id="8680">Two of the flags that will have the biggest impact on your development process are <code>strictPropertyInitialization</code> and <code>strictNullChecks</code>. With <code>strictPropertyInitialization</code>, the following snippet will throw a compile-time error because we haven’t initialized <code>title</code>:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="ee12">To fix it, you’d have to either set <code>title</code> to a string value or change its type, for instance:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="b07c">One additional check we’ve enabled is the <code>no-any</code> TSLint rule (yes, we’ll be <a href="https://angular.io/guide/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving away from TSLint</a>; this rule has its <a href="https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-explicit-any.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESLint equivalent</a>). This way, we can use more type information during our <code>ng update</code> command and more confidently migrate your apps across Angular versions. Let us look at an example:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="0908">If we wanted to migrate your project away from <code>deprecatedMethod</code> we wouldn’t have been able to given that the type of <code>client</code> is <code>any</code>. To migrate your project with confidence, we’d need the information that <code>client</code> has the type of <code>HttpClient</code> with an explicit type annotation: <code>client: HttpClient</code>. This way we’d know that <code>deprecatedMethod</code> belongs to our migration target rather than it just happened that another object has a method with the same name.</p><p id="1f86">The <code>strictTemplates</code> flag is an Angular specific configuration that strict mode enables under <code>angularCompilerOptions</code> in <code>tsconfig.json</code>. Let’s look at the following snippet:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="541d">Currently, Angular will not perform any type checking at compile-time. If you enable <code>strictTemplates</code>, Angular will check if <code>todo</code> has a property <code>title</code> and if <code>user.isAdmin</code> exists. Additionally, if you have any of the strict TypeScript flags enabled, the Angular compiler will enable the same strictness checks for the template. For example, if we have <code>strictNullChecks</code> and <code>strictTemplates</code> in the following snippet we’ll get a type error:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="7d88">This will help us ensure we’ve initialized <code>article</code> before accessing its property. A way to fix this error would be: <code>&lt;h1&gt;{{ article?.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;</code> using the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/template-expression-operators#the-safe-navigation-operator----and-null-property-paths" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe navigation operator</a> (similar to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optional chaining</a>).</p><ul><li id="e187"><strong>[Con] </strong>The compiler will be stricter. It will throw compile-time errors if you haven’t initialized a property, check if an expression is null, if you have type errors in your templates, etc. If you want to prototype something rapidly and correctness is not important to you, this may slow you down. Such compile-time errors could also be confusing for people getting started with Angular.</li><li id="7455"><strong>[Pro] </strong><code>strictNullChecks</code> and <code>strictPropertyInitialization</code> will make sure you’re not accessing properties or calling methods of null references.</li><li id="93e7"><strong>[Pro] </strong>Angular will also be able to help you discover more issues ahead of time by type checking your templates.</li></ul><p id="e565"><a href="https://web.dev/performance-budgets-with-the-angular-cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bundle budgets</a> provide a guarantee that the performance of your app will not unnoticeably regress over time. In Angular CLI’s <code>angular.json</code> file, we have predefined error and warning budgets. If the size of a specific JavaScript bundle or style exceeds the warning budget, you’ll get a warning message; if you exceed the error budget, your build will fail.</p><p id="1361">By default, we’ve set pretty high budgets:</p><ul><li id="00a7">2MB warning and 5MB error budget for the initial JavaScript we send to the browser</li><li id="bd6f">6KB warning and 10KB error budget for the styles of any component</li></ul><p id="9f86">In strict mode, these numbers drop to:</p><ul><li id="2772">500KB warning and 1MB error budget for the initial JavaScript we send to the browser</li><li id="3851">2KB warning and 4KB error budget for the styles of any component</li></ul><p id="94be">To make sure you fit the budget:</p><ul><li id="95ad">Make sure you are aware of what you have in your production bundles. <a href="https://angular.io/guide/deployment#inspect-the-bundles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source-map-explorer</a> will come handy here</li><li id="2c45">Use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.angular.io/angular-tools-for-high-performance-6e10fb9a0f4a">lazy-loading</a></li><li id="024c">Avoid large imports in your component styles</li></ul><ul><li id="8b5c"><strong>[Con]</strong> According to reports we have, over 50% of apps ship more than 1MB of JavaScript. With the tighter bundle budgets, your build will fail if you exceed this number. If the initial load time performance of your app is not critical for your use case, you’ll be getting build failures and you will have to update the budget manually.</li><li id="6652"><strong>[Pro]</strong> If you introduce a large dependency by accident, your build will fail, and you’ll catch the regression ahead of time. Overall, bundle budgets will guard your application against growing in size.</li></ul><p id="5d52">The last strict mode option we will look at is related to tree-shaking. Tree-shaking is a form of dead code elimination, in which the build tooling removes unused code. To enable webpack to remove unused modules, in the strict mode, we create an extra <code>package.json</code> with all of your apps and libraries. This <code>package.json</code> file has a single property - <code>sideEffects</code> set to <code>false</code>.</p><p id="556c">It’s practically impossible to determine with static code analysis if a module produces side effects or not in a language as dynamic as JavaScript. This means that our optimistic assumption may potentially break your app. Let us look into more details what this actually means.</p><p id="a66c">Currently, with the Angular CLI webpack delegates tree-shaking to <a href="https://github.com/terser/terser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terser</a>, the JavaScript optimizer we use. Let’s look at an example:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="ae4b">Here we have the following dependency graph:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2128/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png" width="1064" height="776" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9bGufPhGdGOmdEcaQQjeiQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Visualization of the dependency graph</figcaption></figure><p id="ecae">When we run webpack with entry point <code>index.js</code> we’ll get the following output:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="9487">Notice that although we don’t use <code>subtract</code> and <code>PI</code>, they are still in the final bundle. If we run webpack in production mode, terser will statistically determine that we’re only using <code>add</code>, and it will get rid of the exported <code>subtract</code> and <code>PI</code>.</p><p id="99c2">webpack includes the module <code>constants.js</code> in the final bundle only because it’s not sure if it produces side effects or not. For example, if it adds globals, writes to <code>localStorage</code>, or sends HTTP requests, removing this module will break our app.</p><p id="dfcd">Suppose we specify the <code>sideEffects</code> property to <code>false</code> in the corresponding <code>package.json</code> to our project. In that case, webpack will assume <code>utils.js</code>, <code>constants.js</code>, and <code>operations.js</code> do not produce any side effects and will not include the unused modules in the final bundle. Here’s what the final bundle would look like in this case:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="269d">If we enable terser, it’ll get rid of <code>index_subtract</code> and <code>subtract</code> since we don’t use them, and inline <code>add</code>, which will produce:</p><figure><div></div></figure><ul><li id="7f58"><strong>[Con</strong>] You now have multiple <code>package.json</code> files — one for your workspace, and one for each of your libraries and apps. This could be confusing for folks getting started with Angular CLI.</li><li id="8e0b"><strong>[Con</strong>] If you have side effects in any of your modules and webpack tree-shakes it away, you’ll get a runtime error.</li><li id="52d2"><strong>[Pro]</strong> You’ll get smaller apps overall.</li></ul><p id="657d">Let us spend a minute to look at the second point. Imagine <code>constants.js</code> had the following content:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="971a">If we have incorrectly specified the <code>sideEffects</code> flag to <code>false</code> and webpack gets rid of this module since we don’t reference it, the <code>localStorage.setItem('foo', 'bar')</code> statement will not execute. This, later on, can lead to issues in our app if we rely that we have this information in <code>localStorage</code>.</p><p id="1ce1">Everything we mentioned so far has its trade-offs. If we want fewer issues in production, we need to fight with stricter compiler options, and if we want smaller bundles, we may have to enable extra, potentially unsafe configuration.</p><p id="5cb0"><strong>Please comment in this post and let us know which one of these configuration options you want us to enable by default and why.</strong> We’re building the Angular CLI for you, and we want you to be part of the decision process on what features we provide.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>The other day I watched “See” on Apple TV+. The premise of the show is that after some apocalyptic event, humanity has lost its sense of sight and all humans are born blind. I quite enjoyed watching it but I can’t say I care much whether it gets extended for another season.</p>

<p>Anyway, one thing they do in the show is tie knots in strings and ropes to communicate. People trace the strings with their fingers, reading them like books. The system is never explained in much detail but people in the show are able to send messages that way. I thought this was a very cool idea and started thinking about how to design a system like that.</p>

<p>Initially, I considered a knot-based morse code with either two types of knots or the presence/absence of one type of knot to represent dots and dashes. Since that would mean up to five knots per letter, however, and I wanted to keep the number of knots as low as possible, I decided to come up with my own encodings of the Latin alphabet. To keep things simple, I used a fixed number of knots per letter.</p>

<p>Given these constraints, I had to decide how many different types of knots my system would be based on. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, the only numbers that make sense are 2, 3 and 6. Two types of knots require five knots per letter, three types require three knots and six types require two.</p>

<p>My last major contact with the world of knots was as a young boy on vacation with my parents at the North Sea coast, learning about knots used on fishing ships. Since I don’t remember much about those knots, I hit google to see what was on offer. Turns out that (like for everything in this world) there is a community of knotters online.</p>

<p>To be suitable for this projects, the knots had to fulfil the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Distinctiveness</strong>: they had to be distinct to the touch so that the “reader” could tell them apart without needing a sense of sight.</li>
  <li><strong>Pull resistance</strong>: I’m sure there’s a term of art for this in professional knot tying. The knots should not come undone when pulling on opposite ends of the string.</li>
  <li><strong>Placability</strong>: choosing a location on the string and placing the knot there should be easy. This is probably true for all knots with sufficient practice but it’s easier for some than for others.</li>
  <li><strong>Locality</strong>: it should be possible to tie the knot without having to pull through one end of the string. Turns out there’s a phrase for this, knots of this kind are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_%28knot%29%23In_the_bight">tied in the bight</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/test-knots2.jpg" alt="test-knots">
<em>Testing different knots. Turns out twisted twine is not ideal for tying knots.</em></p>

<p>After an evening of playing around with different knots, these are the ones I ended up choosing:</p>

  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhand_knot"><strong>Overhand</strong></a>: this is the most fundamental knot and my go-to to tie anything together.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_loop"><strong>Butterfly</strong></a>: this knot creates a nice distinctive loop.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly + 1</strong>: this is what I called a butterfly knot with an additional overhand knot in the loop.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly + 2</strong>: same as above but with two overhand knots.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.101knots.com/barrel-knot.html"><strong>Barrel</strong></a>: this knot creates barrel along the string.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_figure-eight_loop"><strong>Double figure-eight</strong></a>: a knot that forms two loops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Six knots with two knots per character give us 6^2 = 36 possible combinations which is exactly what we need for 26 letters and 10 digits (no spaces or lowercase letters exist in this encoding). One optimisation I made in mapping these combinations to the different letters and digits was to assign each knot a difficulty value (turns out I was pretty off in my guesses of how difficult each knot would be to tie). Each possible combination of two knots then had a combined difficulty equal to the sum of the difficulties of each constituent knot. I assigned the letters in order of frequency such that the most frequent letters would be easiest to tie, the remaining ten combinations I assigned to the ten digits at random. This is the mapping I ended up with:</p>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/mapping.jpg" alt="test-knots">
<em>Mapping knots to letters &amp; digits.</em></p>

<p>Reading about knots online, I discovered that paracord is the medium of choice for people who pursue this hobby. I got some and it is a much more pleasurable experience to tie with compared to the cheap twine I was using before. Another purchase I made was what seems to be the authoritative source on knots: The Ashley Book of Knots. I have only skimmed the book so far but if I ever make a version two of the speaking knots, I’m certain it will be a repository of possible knots to integrate into any future encoding.</p>

<p>After tying a few one letter strings, I eventually tied this seven meter beast:</p>

<p><img src="https://soender.blog/images/knots/human-rights.jpg" alt="human-rights">
<em>“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”</em></p>

<p>After trying out the system, here are some things I learned about the different knots:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Overhand</strong>: the fact that this is not tied in the bight makes this much more annoying to tie than I first thought. I would not include this knot again for this reason.</li>
  <li><strong>Butterfly</strong>: this knot and its variants are perfectly suited for this project and don’t have any downsides.</li>
  <li><strong>Barrel</strong>: this knot is aesthetically pleasing but not only is it not tied in the bight, it needs three pull-throughs to be completed! There does seem to be a variant of it that doesn’t have this downside but I haven’t played with it yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Double figure-eight</strong>: this knot works but it wastes a lot of string and has a very thick main part that the two loops grow out of. It’s also hard to distinguish from the butterfly by touch alone.</li>
</ul>

<p>I might decide to spend more time on this project in the future but for now, I’m happy with how much fun I’ve already had with it. If I do, these are some ideas for possibly improvements and additions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different knots/different mapping based on what I learned about the knots I chose.</li>
  <li>Some way of preventing the reader to get out of sync with which pairs on the string form the letters. If either the author or the reader of the message accidentally skip one knot, the message ends up garbled. This isn’t a big issue since when that happens, all that’s required is to shift one knot and try again.</li>
  <li>Single knots for common letters or even words to speed up the tying process. This would also help with synchronisation.</li>
  <li>Some way of indicating the direction a string is meant to be read in. Maybe a bead tied into the string. I considered beads also as part of the encoding but decided against it so that no additional material would be needed to write a message.</li>
  <li>Splicing together pieces of string. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_knot">blood knot</a> should make this possible. Since it looks very similar to the barrel knot that’s part of the current encoding, I would probably have to choose between the two. This could indicate a space. Assembling longer messages from multiple pieces of string would also somewhat solve the problem of having to tie knots that are not died in the bight in long pieces of string.</li>
  <li>The distance between two knots could be integrated into the encoding and assigned some significance.</li>
  <li>Maybe some completely different way of encoding meaning that isn’t based on the Latin alphabet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand">Shorthand</a> could be a possible source of inspiration for a writing system that is designed for speed. Googling for similar ideas, I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu">Quipu</a> system used by the Inca people. I couldn’t find much about how specifically it worked and maybe that knowledge isn’t extant but it would be cool to learn more about it.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the beginning of this year, I joined <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" target="_blank"><strong>On Deck</strong></a> – a fellowship of entrepreneurs at various stages of launching their startups – with the goal of expanding my professional network in the Bay Area and finding a co-founder for my next venture.</p><p>‍</p><p>On Deck was designed as a 10-week onsite program, with social events such as weekend trips, lunches, etc. However, no one had anticipated a global pandemic to strike, and On Deck had to switch to fully remote operations even before the group had a chance to meet in person.</p><p>‍</p><p>The decision to continue as a remote program came a few weeks before the cohort start date. By then, I have already flown into San Francisco, rented a place, and was testing several startup ideas. As such, the announcement was a huge blow to me, and I was disheartened to learn that the sessions would be conducted online. All the dinners, parties and team bonding activities I was looking forward to have been replaced with Slack chats and Zoom calls.</p><p>‍</p><p>In retrospect, it is incredible how quickly On Deck managed to reorganize the entire curriculum into a fully-remote event. Kudos to their swift response and hard work in making On Deck 2020 possible! If they had cancelled the cohort, I would not have met all the amazing people and my co-founder.</p><p>‍</p><h3>So how did it all play out?</h3><p>The first day started with a 4-hour virtual kickoff session. We were split into groups and played icebreaker games. Through introductions, games, and breakout activities, we got to know everyone in the cohort.</p><p>‍</p><p>Without us knowing at the time, our groups were not random. On Deck evaluated the participants and thoughtfully paired those with complementary skills together. Therefore, it was not entirely coincidental that the first person I spoke to that day became my co-founder (months later). Job well done On Deck!</p><p>‍</p><p>What followed was 10 weeks of diverse activities:</p><ul role="list"><li>Breakout sessions</li><li>Hackathons</li><li>Speed dating</li><li>1:1 meetings</li><li>Virtual dinners</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>The breakout sessions were a dream come true – imagine the cool founders you follow on Twitter all appearing in your calendar: <a href="https://twitter.com/julialipton" target="_blank"><strong>Julia Lipton</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover" target="_blank"><strong>Ryan Hoover</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vhmth" target="_blank"><strong>Vinay Hiremath</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/andreasklinger" target="_blank"><strong>Andreas Klinger</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33" target="_blank"><strong>Elizabeth Yin</strong></a>, and so on. You are free to select topics that are relevant or of interest to you to attend. Each session has around 10 participants, so there are ample opportunities to ask questions and interact with the speaker.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img alt="Snack was built for an ODF hackathon." src="https://assets.website-files.com/5df35853014f242fc4ae89f1/5f47e314a1a0eae8151bf231_snack-call.jpeg"></p><figcaption>(Snack was built for an ODF hackathon)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Meanwhile, hackathons allowed groups to work together and demonstrate their strengths. It was during one of these hackathons that I built <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Snack</strong></a>. On Deck were the first adopters and their feedback shaped the product today. At this point in time, I already had several conversations with my future co-founder on starting a business together. I look up to him &amp; like what he is working on, and him seeing me build a hackathon project that grew to be used by hundreds of Slack organizations is what sealed the deal.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Today</h3><p>My co-founder (<a href="https://twitter.com/_BenHQ" target="_blank"><strong>Ben</strong></a>) and I are building a <a href="https://contra.com/" target="_blank"><strong>professional network</strong></a> for people you actually work with. Meanwhile, <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/team" target="_blank"><strong>Tracy</strong></a> has taken over the day-to-day Snack operations of providing serendipity-as-a-service to teams.</p><p>‍</p><p>Joining <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" target="_blank"><strong>On Deck</strong></a> is undoubtedly one of the best moves I have pursued. Never have I thought a virtual program could be this engaging and inspiring. In fact, the 10 weeks with On Deck were some of the most sociable weeks in my professional life, and the sense of community continues to be felt to this day.</p><p>‍</p><p>On Deck did an excellent job creating what felt like serendipity, but is actually a diligently orchestrated event with hand-picked individuals that form a supportive community of shared goals and deep subject expertise. I am excited to share the magic that I felt during O nDeck with you through <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Snack</strong></a>. ❤️</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="4cd9">When you are building Kubernetes applications, itâ€™s easy to end up in with â€œauthentication sprawlâ€� where all of your services have different authentication mechanisms. This tutorial walks through how to centralize your authentication mechanisms using an IdP and an API gateway.</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://blog.getambassador.io/@alex_gervais?source=post_page-----d509ffbc7b6f----------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Alex Gervais" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*qrt6AVoODoXwvJUGbeuv0w.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p id="dcd5"><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak</a> is a widely adopted Identity and Access Management (<a href="https://www.getambassador.io/learn/kubernetes-glossary/iam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IAM for short</a>) open-source solution. 2014 was a big year for groundbreaking technologies as both the Keycloak and Kubernetes projects were initially released a few weeks apart. Unsurprisingly, many Kubernetes end-users are turning to Keycloak as the preferred way to manage access to the secure APIs and services of their platform.</p><p id="3311">Simply running Keycloak in Kubernetes wonâ€™t however make your platform secure. A lot of concerns are left to the user to configure and implement: from exposing the Keycloak API endpoints using TLS and an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingress-controller</a>, to enforcing security policies on specific business endpoints. When solving these problems, we have a bias towards using an API Gateway solution to handle encrypted connections and centralize API management policies instead of re-implementing authentication strategies in every language and application of your microservice architecture.</p><p id="a6b3">Our goal today will be to install Keycloak as our IAM solution and secure it behind the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Edge Stack</a>, our API Gateway acting as a Kubernetes ingress controller. As a final step, we will deploy a sample application and demonstrate how to use Keycloak as an Identity provider (<a href="https://www.getambassador.io/learn/kubernetes-glossary/idp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IdP for short</a>) to restrict access to this application with OAuth2 using request Filters.</p><p id="0895">In this tutorial, we will use a non-production-ready Keycloak installation. To simplify our dependency graph, weâ€™ll use the in-memory datastore, which is totally suitable for a demo but wouldnâ€™t guarantee high-availability in a production environment. If you are looking for production-grade persistence, <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/index.html#_database" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keycloak offers a variety of storage solutions</a>.</p><p id="eedf">The ingress controller is the missing building block in most Kubernetes offerings. Although Kubernetes defines an Ingress resource, it is not actually backed by any implementation that will turn the resource into a public service! The choice and installation of an ingress solution are left to the operator. Here, we will use the community version of the Ambassador Edge Stack, because of its direct integration with Keycloak for authentication, to expose and secure public traffic coming in from internet requests to downstream private services running in our Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="c455">At the end of the tutorial, weâ€™ll be up and running with the Ambassador Edge Stack doing TLS termination at the edge of the Kubernetes network, exposing our Keycloak installation under <code>/auth/</code> and securing our Quote application under <code>/backend/</code>.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1496/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png" width="748" height="520" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9QX_XGf-xUNGzwayl7cM0Q.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="4461">Scaffolding with the K8s Initializer</h2><p id="0bfb">Kubernetes is often made fun of because of the copious amounts of YAML required. Instead of going into a scavenger hunt for YAML samples and assembling all puzzle pieces together from stale sources, weâ€™ll be using the <a href="https://app.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K8s Initializer</a> to generate all of the Kubernetes resources for us. The K8s Initializer is a project generator tool similar to what exists for application developers: think Spring Initializr or Yeoman.</p><p id="0d5d">The wizard-like interface of the K8s Initializer will guide us through a few questions to understand and configure specific settings that vary from one cloud provider to the other. These implementation details are often where promises are broken and portability falls short, making it hard to configure ingress controllers and expose services to public traffic. Hopefully, we can do away with the little gotchas by using a comprehensive tool like the K8s Initializer who will provide us with an optimal configuration.</p><p id="b086">Specifically for this tutorial, we picked our target Kubernetes cluster: â€œGoogle Kubernetes Engineâ€� with a â€œGoogle External Load Balancer (L4)â€� load balancer. We also chose a public Hostname for our installation. Using a public hostname will require an extra step to configure a DNS entry to point to our installation, but given we want to demonstrate how to build a public secure application stack, itâ€™s worth the extra effort. As for the K8s Initializerâ€™s Auth configuration, we undoubtedly selected Keycloak, with a temporary password.</p><p id="8d03">Once satisfied with our K8s Initializer options, we hit the â€œdownloadâ€� button. Weâ€™ll be given a set of ready-to-go YAML files and instructions.</p><p id="21d8">Give it a try! <a href="https://app.getambassador.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://app.getambassador.io/</a></p><h2 id="56e8">Installing the Ambassador Edge Stack</h2><p id="fad2">Weâ€™ll start by installing the Ambassador Edge Stack simply because it contains a bunch of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions</a> dependencies. Given you have access to your desired Kubernetes cluster, the installation will be as simple as running <code>kubectl apply</code> commands and configuring a DNS entry to point to the external IP of the provisioned service.</p><h2 id="d5bb">Installing Keycloak</h2><p id="4d13">Installing Keycloak from the generated YAML is again straightforward: a single <code>kubectl apply</code> command. One curious cat might peek at the Keycloak YAML file, donâ€™t worry it wonâ€™t kill you! Youâ€™ll actually be able to appreciate how the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/using/intro-mappings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Mapping</a> resource will instruct traffic hitting the public <code>/auth/</code> prefix endpoint to be forwarded to our private Keycloak pod running in our Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="f8e2">Giving Keycloak a few minutes to start, weâ€™ll then be able to access itâ€™s UI at <a href="https://domain-name/auth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://domain-name/auth/</a>. Since we chose to let â€œ<em>Ambassador terminate TLS using a Letâ€™s Encrypt certificateâ€�</em> in the K8s Initializer options, we can appreciate how automatic TLS termination is happening with a secure certificate for our Keycloak installation.</p><p id="e690">We can then log in to Keycloakâ€™s Administration Console UI using the default <code>admin</code> username and the temporary password weâ€™ve selected previously to configure Keycloak to our needsâ€¦ and change the password!</p><h2 id="befa">Configuring a Keycloak Realm, Client and User</h2><p id="a442">To secure our APIs, we will be using our shiny new Keycloak installation as our IdP. We first need to create a client to handle authentication requests from Ambassador Edge Stack. All of these configuration steps can be achieved using the Keycloak UI.</p><ol><li id="06c0">We first start by creating a new â€œRealmâ€�. Hovering on top of the â€œMasterâ€� label in the right-hand navigation, we can click on â€œAdd realmâ€�. We picked <code>ambassador</code> as the â€œNameâ€� of our new realm. This will be needed later on to configure the <code>authorizationURL</code> field in the auth Filter.</li><li id="6e10">Weâ€™ll create a new client by navigating to â€œClientsâ€� and clicking â€œCreateâ€�. We chose the following settings: <br>- <em>Client ID</em>: <code>ambassador</code> â€” This value will be used in the <code>clientID</code> field of the auth Filter.<br>- <em>Client Protocol</em>: <code>openid-connect</code><br>- <em>Root URL</em>: None, left blank</li><li id="5859">On the following screen, we configured the Client with:<br>- <em>Access Type</em>: <code>confidential</code><br>- <em>Valid Redirect URIs</em>: <code>*</code></li><li id="2392">Navigating to the â€œMappersâ€� tab in our Client, we clicked â€œCreateâ€� and used the following settings:<br>- <em>Protocol</em>: <code>openid-connect</code><br>- <em>Name</em>: <code>Ambassador Mapper</code><br>- <em>Mapper Type</em>: <code>Audience</code><br>- <em>Included Client Audience</em>: Select the name of the Client from the dropdown. Remember, we named our Client <code>ambassador</code>.</li><li id="cde8">Going back to our <code>ambassador</code> Client, we navigated to the â€œClient Scopesâ€� section and configured our Client for <code>offline_access</code>.</li><li id="6c77">Back again to our <code>ambassador</code> Client, we then navigated to the â€œCredentialsâ€� section. We took note of the â€œSecretâ€� value as it will be used later when configuring our auth Filter.</li></ol><p id="aeec">Along with our Client configuration, letâ€™s configure a Keycloak â€œUserâ€�:</p><ol><li id="2481">Navigating to the â€œUsersâ€� section of the Keycloak Administration Console, we will click on â€œAdd userâ€�. We gave our user a simple username: <code>my-keycloak-user</code>, then clicked â€œSaveâ€�.</li><li id="c77c">On the following screen, we switched to the Userâ€™s â€œCredentialsâ€� tab to set a temporary password.</li></ol><p id="b25e">Now that we have a user with which we are able to authenticate ourselves with, letâ€™s deploy an application.</p><h2 id="49f6">Deploying a Quote service</h2><p id="902c">Deploying custom applications on Kubernetes is achieved by creating some Kubernetes resources defined asâ€¦ You guessed it, more YAML! This time, since we are deploying a sample backend application, the sample is somewhat lightweight. You can save the following definitions to a â€œquote-service.yamlâ€� file and deploy it using <code>kubectl apply -f quote-service.yaml</code>.</p><pre><span id="4f23">---<br>apiVersion: v1<br>kind: Service<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  ports:<br>  - name: http<br>    port: 80<br>    targetPort: 8080<br>  selector:<br>    app: quote<br>---<br>apiVersion: apps/v1<br>kind: Deployment<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  replicas: 1<br>  selector:<br>    matchLabels:<br>      app: quote<br>  strategy:<br>    type: RollingUpdate<br>  template:<br>    metadata:<br>      labels:<br>        app: quote<br>    spec:<br>      containers:<br>      - name: backend<br>        image: docker.io/datawire/quote:0.4.1<br>        ports:<br>        - name: http<br>          containerPort: 8080<br>---<br>apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2<br>kind: Mapping<br>metadata:<br>  name: quote-backend<br>  namespace: default<br>spec:<br>  prefix: /backend/<br>  service: quote</span></pre><p id="c66d">This will create a Kubernetes <code>Deployment</code>, <code>Service</code>, and <code>Mapping</code> to publicly expose our running Quote application under the <code>/backend/</code> path. Give it a try, itâ€™s currently unprotected: <a href="https://domain-name/backend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://domain-name/backend/</a>.</p><h2 id="dbb3">Securing access</h2><p id="1525">Building on the configurations we applied to our Keycloak installation in the â€œConfiguring a Keycloak Realm, Client and Userâ€� section earlier, weâ€™ll be creating an OAuth2 <code>Filter</code> and <code>FilterPolicy</code> resources in Kubernetes. Donâ€™t forget to replace the placeholders in this YAML sample with the values from your installation! Once again, save the following definitions to a â€œkeycloak-filter.yamlâ€� file and deploy it using <code>kubectl apply -f keycloak-filter.yaml</code>.</p><pre><span id="31c3">---<br>apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2<br>kind: Filter<br>metadata:<br>  name: keycloak-filter<br>  namespace: ambassador<br>spec:<br>  OAuth2:<br>    authorizationURL: https://{domain-name}/auth/realms/ambassador<br>    audience: ambassador<br>    clientID: ambassador<br>    secret: {client_secret}<br>    protectedOrigins:<br>    …</span></pre></div></div></div>

included edge detection, machine learning, or just… something simpler.</p><p>Turns out, it's that last one! Shoutout to

for owning the only real

for <code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code>&nbsp;— the class that handles this logic, and the focus
of this post.</p><p>We'll look at how the metadata harvester works, how to feed extra data to it, and how to completely
break this form of screenshot cropping.</p><blockquote><p>Note: Like so many things on this site, this is much more of a curiosity than
something you should actually do in a production app, especially given how awkward
the implementation is. If you did want to leverage Apple
internals — why waste it on something like this?
<a href="https://bryce.co/recreating-imessage-confetti/">Add some confetti</a> or something instead.</p></blockquote><p><code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code> (pronounced “ssssscreenshot-metadata-harvester”, as far as I'm concerned),
is the primary class responsible for collecting screenshot information from your app.</p><p>When a screenshot is taken,
<code>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</code> will work with your app to generate a full-page PDF-based screenshot
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreenshotservicedelegate">if you provide one</a>, but otherwise,
it will simply collect two pieces of metadata: the current <code>NSUserActivity</code>'s title, and the bounds of
any “important views” that are present on the screen.</p><p>You can easily see this bounds-collection system in action using <code>lldb</code>. First, set a breakpoint
on <code>_contentRectsForMetadata</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>b</span> <span>+</span><span>[</span><span>SSScreenshotMetadataHarvester</span> <span>_contentRectsForMetadata</span><span>]</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Note that the breakpoint wasn't able to resolve to an actual address —
that's because <code>ScreenshotServices.framework</code> is loaded dynamically, and (in my case)
I haven't taken a screenshot yet. But <code>lldb</code> will resolve the correct location
as soon as the framework is loaded later anyways.</p><p>Next, we'll take a screenshot, and execution will pause.
We can then step out of <code>_contentRectsForMetadata</code> and inspect the
return value in register <code>x0</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// Breakpoint triggered in `_contentRectsForMetadata`:

</code></pre></div><p>And there we have it! That array contains the rects that our screenshots will snap to
when cropping.</p><p>The views we're collecting bounds from belong to two categories:</p><ol><li>The root view of any view controllers that are currently added to the hierarchy</li><li>If visible, the frame of the on-screen keyboard (sometimes)</li></ol><p>The second category here is somewhat interesting — the keyboard's frame is based on
a call to <code>+[UIPeripheralHost visiblePeripheralFrame]</code>, which doesn't account for
the iPad's floating or split keyboard modes.</p><p>We're not here to talk about keyboards though, so let's look at the more interesting
side of the metadata: view controllers’ view bounds.</p><h4 id="view-controller-traversal">View Controller Traversal</h4><p>The algorithm for finding each view frame traverses the view
controller hierarchy by looking at each view controller's child
view controllers and presented view controller (if any).</p><p>For each of these, the bounds of the view controller's root view
is taken, minus any safe area insets; the bounds are then converted
to the window's coordinate space and appended to a list.</p><p>The resulting algorithm looks something like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>/*</span><span>*</span><span>

</code></pre></div><p>So in a nutshell, view controllers are really what drives the snap areas here.</p><h4 id="-not--abusing-ios-screenshot-cropping-mechanism"><em>Not</em> Abusing iOS’ Screenshot Cropping Mechanism</h4><p>To start with, given that view controllers determine snap areas, it's worth
pointing out that strategic use of child view controllers can actually get you
nicer snap areas somewhat naturally.</p><p>You can even take this to some extremes, like making collection view cell contents
backed by their own view controllers, as discussed in
<a href="https://twitter.com/khanlou">Soroush Khanlou</a>‘s
<a href="https://khanlou.com/2015/04/view-controllers-in-cells/">original article</a>, or
<a href="https://twitter.com/wibosco">William Boles</a>’
<a href="https://williamboles.me/hosting-viewcontrollers-in-cells/">excellent follow-up</a>.
In fact, William's demo project acts as a great example of this behavior:</p><video playsinline="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" preload="auto" data-setup="{}">
<source src="https://bryce.co/screenshot-cropping/collectionview-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/webm"><source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/ogg"></video><p>I wouldn't advocate for structuring your app any differently just
for the minor benefit of nicer cropping for screenshots — especially
something as involved as view controllers within cells.</p><p>But, if you find yourself in a scenario where you're deciding whether or
not to use child view controllers in a given situation — keep in mind that
this is one interesting advantage, however small!</p><h4 id="defining-arbitrary-snap-areas">Defining Arbitrary Snap Areas</h4><p>There are two options for modifying the screenshot snap areas,
both of which are a bit terrible.</p><p>The first option is to simply add empty child view controllers
defining the areas you're interested in. By manipulating
the view controller's root view bounds and safe area insets, you can add
arbitrary snap areas. You don't even need to add the view to the parent's
view hierarchy —&nbsp;only a call to <code>-[UIViewController addChildViewController:]</code> is
needed.</p><p>However, this is… questionable at best. In my case, I'd much rather
just swizzle. The setup is made a bit more complex due to us not being able
to use a category (since the class isn't available at link or launch time),
and due to it being a class method.</p><p>There are a few ways around this, like forcing a dependency on
<code>ScreenshotServices.framework</code>, but this all-in-code setup is the cleanest I've come up with:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="objc"><span>// Holds the original implementation of

is not too interesting. Instead, let's look at how we can use this ability

continue snapping to rects further along in the returned values array.</p><p>This means order matters; if we return snapping rects
with <code>origin.x</code> values of…</p><div><pre><code data-lang="plain">origin.x = 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

But if we reverse the rect order…</p><div><pre><code data-lang="plain">origin.x = 14, 13, 12, 11, 10
</code></pre></div><p>… then we will snap to <code>10</code> instead!</p><p>We can also add rects approaching from both directions to hone in on an area from either side.
This gives us the ability to inflate the snap distance from the default

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Firefox 80 and my confusion over its hardware accelerated video on Linux</h2>

	<p><small>August 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The news of the time interval is that Firefox 80 is out and in
theory it can support hardware video acceleration on X11, not just
Wayland (<a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/08/firefox-80-release-linux-gpu-acceleration">source</a>,
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Firefox-80-Released">also</a>).
The master Mozilla tracking bug for hardware accelerated video on
X11 is <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619523">bug #1619523</a>, with all
sorts of information. So I downloaded the official release (one of
my Firefox setups uses the official builds these days for reasons
beyond the scope of this entry) and tried to get it to do accelerated
video playback. The short version is that I think I've failed, but I'm
not sure why.</p>

<p>Even in Firefox 80, getting VA-API accelerated video playback
requires a whole series of magic incantations in <code>about:config</code>
preferences and perhaps environment variables when you start Firefox
(this may change in the next release). Assuming that all of those
are set right, Firefox can apparently still decide that it doesn't
like your Linux video driver (or its version), your specific hardware,
or perhaps either or both of the resolution of the source video and
the resolution of your display. Some or many of these can be forced
with Firefox settings, but at the same time the bug reports I've
read say that sometimes Firefox ignores hardware acceleration because
it's slower for the specific circumstances, or because it has known
bugs. If Firefox is making a sensible decision for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/HomeMachine2018">my specific
hardware</a>, that's one thing and I want
it to do what will work best. But if I've missed a setting or if
Firefox is just being twitchy about something, I also want to
override it. In general I know my hardware is capable of hardware
accelerated playback of videos at far lower CPU usage than Firefox
manages (on the same videos).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Firefox won't tell me what it's doing or why, at
least not in a way that I can understand. I've peered into the
depths of <code>about:support</code>, which tells me some of the 'what' but
not the 'why', and I've tried some of the things from <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619523">bug #1619523</a>
without success. If Firefox is or isn't going to do hardware
accelerated video playback, I wish it would tell me both what it was
doing and why. Otherwise I'm probably going to go on being confused
and annoyed with it.</p>

<p>(I care about hardware acceleration not just because of CPU load
but because my perception is that hardware acceleration is necessary
to play back a full sized video smoothly without dropping frames
every so often. This may be wrong on modern hardware, even on my 4k
display.)</p>

				<p> &gt;&gt;&gt; What is Pointer?</p>
				<p> Pointer is a reading club for developers. It's a window into what other current and future CTOs are reading and thinking about. Super high quality engineering-related content, not just trendy topics or link bait.</p>
			</div>	
			
			<div>
				<p> &gt;&gt;&gt; What kind of content belongs in Pointer?</p>
				<p> Anything worth reading. It can be language-specific or framework-agnostic, or not even strictly technical as long as it's relevant to a developer. Folks have shared interesting open source projects, a blog post on engineering cultural anti-patterns, and even an academic CS paper from 1982 about why counting starts with 0.</p>

<p><strong>By Chris Hedges</strong> / Original to Scheerpost</p>



<p>The persecution of the attorney Steven Donziger is a grim illustration of what happens when we confront the real centers of power, masked and unacknowledged by the divisive cant from the Trump White House or the sentimental drivel of the Democratic Party. Those, like Donziger, who name and fight the corporate control of our society on behalf of the vulnerable see the judiciary, the press and the institutions of government unite to crucify them.</p>



<p>“It’s been a long battle, 27 years,” Donziger said when I reached him by phone in his apartment in Manhattan.</p>



<p>Donziger, who has been fighting polluting American oil companies for nearly three decades on behalf of indigenous communities and peasant farmers in Ecuador, has been under house arrest in Manhattan for a year.&nbsp;He will go to trial in federal court in New York on September 9 on contempt of court charges, which could see him jailed for six months.&nbsp;Ever&nbsp;since he won a multibillion-dollar judgment in 2011 against the oil giant Chevron, the multinational has come after him personally through litigation that threatens to destroy him economically, professionally and personally.</p>



<p>“Our L-T [long-term] strategy is to demonize Donziger,” Chevron wrote in an internal memo in 2009, as reviewed<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/when-feds-demur-judge-charges-ecuador-crusader-himself/" target="_blank"> by Courthouse News</a>.</p>

<p>“It started when Texaco went into Ecuador in the Amazon in the 1960s and cut a sweetheart deal with the military government then ruling Ecuador,” Donziger told me. “Over the next 25 years, Texaco was the exclusive operator of a very large area of the Amazon that had several oil fields within this area, 1500 square miles. They drilled hundreds of wells. They created thousands of open-air, unlined toxic waste pits where they dumped the heavy metals and toxins that came up from the ground when they drilled. They ran pipes from the pits into rivers and streams that local people relied on for their drinking water, their fishing and their sustenance. They poisoned this pristine ecosystem, in which lived five indigenous peoples, as well as a lot of other nonindigenous rural communities. There was a mass industrial poisoning.”</p>



<p>“By the time I went down there in the early 1990s, many people had died, cancer rates were skyrocketing according to several independent health evaluations, people were really hurting. There was zero regard for the lives of the local people by Texaco. I was a very young lawyer back in 1993 when I first went to Ecuador. It was like looking at an apocalyptic scene. There was oil on the roads. People were living in abject poverty. They had no shoes. They would get oil on their feet when they walked along the roads. The oil pollution had permeated every aspect of daily life. It was in the food supply. It was in the water supply. It was in the air. The average person there would get exposed multiple times a day to very harmful, cancer-causing toxins, with foreseeable results.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I, with other lawyers, filed a lawsuit in New York against Texaco. The reason we filed in New York was because Texaco’s headquarters were in New York in 1993. The decisions to pollute in Ecuador, to play God to the people of Ecuador, were made in New York. We sued in New York. Texaco tried to get the case back to Ecuador where they had never been held accountable, where they knew the indigenous peoples had no money or resources to find lawyers.”</p>



<p>“They thought it would just go away,” said Donziger. “Over a 10-year period, we battled to get a jury trial in the United States. Ultimately, they won that part of the battle. It went down to Ecuador.”</p>



<p>“We started working with a team of Ecuadoran lawyers in the early 2000s. We went forward with the lawsuit. We produced voluminous scientific and testimonial evidence, showing that they caused probably the world’s worst oil pollution. It was called the ‘Amazon Chernobyl’ by locals and experts. They dumped 16 billion gallons of toxic waste. They did it deliberately to save money. This was unlike the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which was a terrible accident, even though it was a product of horrendous negligence by BP. This was done by design to pollute, knowing that people would die, and that indigenous groups would be decimated, and that this beautiful part of the Amazon would be destroyed.”</p>



<p>The refusal to abide by even minimal environmental regulations saved Texaco an estimated $3 on every barrel of oil produced over 26 years (1964-1992), <a href="https://amazonwatch.org/news/2019/0625-chevrons-corrupt-legal-practices-called-out-by-leading-human-rights-and-environmental-ngos">according to Amazon Watch</a>, or an estimated extra $5 billion in revenue. The hundreds of waste pits the company eventually abandoned in Ecuador, on average, contain 200 times the contamination allowed by typical global standards.</p>



<p>“They tried to grind us down using classic corporate defense tactics,” Donziger said of the legal war. “They filed thousands of motions. We stood strong. We had a great legal team of Ecuadorian lawyers.”</p>



<p>In the end, they won a stunning victory, a rare moment of accountability for first-world conglomerates who rape the environment of developing nations by exploiting weak, corrupt governments.</p>



<p>“The verdict came down, about $18 billion in favor of the affected communities, which is what it would take at a minimum to clean up the actual damage and compensate the people for some of their injuries. That eventually got reduced on appeal in Ecuador to $9.5 billion, but it was affirmed by three appellate courts, including the highest court of Ecuador. It was <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/ecuadorians-can-sue-chevron-in-canada-supreme-court-rules/">affirmed by the Canadian Supreme Court</a>, where the Ecuadorians went to enforce their judgment in a unanimous opinion in 2015.”</p>



<p>Chevron, as the evidence mounted against it, sold their assets in Ecuador and left the country. The corporation threatened the plaintiffs with <a href="https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-calls-for-dismissal-of-ecuador-lawsuit">a “lifetime of litigation”</a> if they attempted to collect, and, according to internal Chevron memos, launched a legal and media campaign that has cost an estimated $2 billion to prevent payment of the settlement and to demonize and destroy Donziger.</p>

<p>Donziger came to his epic battle against Chevron through journalism. “I was a journalist on my college newspaper,” he said of his time as a history major at American University. “My first job out of college was as a journalist with [United Press International]. I worked for UPI in Washington. They were strong in Latin America. I traveled to Managua in 1983 or 1984, I don’t remember exactly, and found work in the UPI bureau. I was 23 years old. I worked in the UPI bureau in Managua during the Sandinista era.”</p>



<p>He left UPI after a year in Managua but stayed on in Nicaragua to work as a freelance journalist for newspapers such as <em>The Fort Lauderdale News, The Toronto Star</em> and <em>The Atlanta Constitution</em>. He spent about three years as a reporter before going to Harvard Law School. When he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, he worked as a public defender in Washington, D.C. He documented Iraqi civilian casualties in Iraq following the first Gulf War that became a report adopted by the United Nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A classmate at law school was from Ecuador. His classmate’s father organized a trip in April 1993 for lawyers and medical professionals to look at the contamination caused by the oil extraction in the Amazon. That trip, which Donziger joined, spawned the suit against Texaco. He would make more than 250 trips to Ecuador over the next two decades.</p>



<p>“Journalism significantly shaped my views and skill set,” he said. “It was vital to allowing my work to be successful. From the beginning this was a unique litigation, for many reasons, but one of the reasons was we, as a team, decided to work across multiple platforms. If we only saw this case as a lawsuit we would never win.”</p>



<p>“Chevron controlled the legal system in Ecuador with their influence. We needed to operate across different platforms, including engaging with the media and carrying out significant public education. Most Ecuadoreans, other than those who lived in the region, knew nothing about the pollution that had been happening in their country. We carried out zealous advocacy in the public arena. We realized that the indigenous people would never get a fair trial in Ecuador if they did not illuminate what had happened to them and get public support.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The fact that I am detained shows how far we’ve come and how much risk Chevron feels. It’s not a sign we lost. It’s the opposite.”</p><cite>Steven Donziger</cite></blockquote>



<p>Both the judge who oversaw its lawsuit against Donziger for “racketeering” and Chevron itself “claim that this type of activity is wrong,” he said. “The irony is that what we were doing is what the big oil companies have always done. They always operate in the public relations domain, lobbying Congress to pass legislation to extinguish various legal claims, meeting political leaders …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/">Bootstrap 5 Alpha</a>&nbsp;was released in June 2020. The new Bootstrap removes jQuery and no longer supports Internet Explorer (IE). The team said it’s time to move on from “what’s outdated or no longer appropriate”.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap framework</a>, originally developed and open-sourced by Twitter, has been an indispensable tool for web developers. It provides a ready-to-use set of UI components and a grid system essential for adaptive web pages that need to display well across PC and mobile browsers. Since its inception, Bootstrap has always had a dependency on the jQuery framework. The&nbsp;<a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery framework</a>, originally created in 2006, is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks of all time. It provides powerful language features and cross-browser compatibility in an era when web technologies are going through many challenges and experimentations to support a variety of use cases ranging from interactive web pages, single-page apps, AJAX requests, and mobile web apps.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to 2020, with JavaScript standards and dominant web browsers already supporting most of the features in jQuery, the Bootstrap team decided to move on. The Bootstrap 5 framework has removed jQuery as a requirement. It saved 85KB of minified JavaScript, which could be significant as Google starts to&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/search-ads-speed">use page speed as a ranking factor for mobile web sites</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience.html">soon for desktop web sites</a>&nbsp;as well. The Bootstrap team does this because Bootstrap 5 also no longer supports&nbsp;Internet Explorer. The team noted that all supported browsers provide jQuery replacement features in vanilla JavaScript. The decision to drop Internet Explorer is probably due to the fact that&nbsp;<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide">IE’s market share has now dropped below 3% even among Desktop PC users</a>.</p>



<p>Developer&nbsp;<a href="https://flaviocopes.com/">Flavio Copes</a>&nbsp;has an article on&nbsp;<a href="https://flaviocopes.com/jquery/">“Should you use or learn jQuery in 2020.”</a>&nbsp;In it, he pointed out vanilla JavaScript replacements from jQuery’s most popular features. Here are some examples.</p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_0"><li>Selecting DOM elements using the # or . notation:&nbsp;<code>document.querySelector('.button')</code></li><li>Waiting for page DOM to load:&nbsp;<code>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () =&gt; { ... })</code></li><li>Executing AJAX requests:&nbsp;<code>fetch('/api.json').then(response =&gt; response.text()).then(body =&gt; console.log(body))</code></li></ul>



<p>If developers create a new web application in 2020, jQuery will&nbsp;probably no longer be necessary. The web has finally evolved beyond jQuery.</p>



<p>Another benefit of dropping IE is that Bootstrap 5 supports CSS custom properties. They make CSS more flexible and even programmable. For some examples, check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/tables/#how-do-the-variants-and-accented-tables-work">docs on how to style tables</a>&nbsp;in Bootstrap 5.</p>



<p>Besides dropping jQuery, Bootstrap 5 also brings some notable features. Bootstrap 5 has an updated UI look and feel to focus more on-page content. It has a redesigned and better-looking set of custom form controls. It also has a new logo and&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/26/bootstrap-icons-alpha5/">300+ additional icons</a>. For web sites that make heavy use of icons, the new SVG sprite allows developers to load all icons in a single SVG file and then use them as needed. That will likely increase web site performance and improve HTML readability.</p>



<p>The Bootstrap framework is open-source software available under the MIT license. Submitting bugs and fixes of&nbsp;<a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 5 alpha</a>&nbsp;to the team via its&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/twbs">GitHub repo</a>&nbsp;are welcomed.</p>

<p>Pop quiz: Apart from being tech companies, what do Amazon, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Spotify, Kickstarter, Indiegogo, DoorDash, Postmates, and TaskRabbit all have in common?</p>



<p>Answer: They all use&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe</a>&nbsp;to process payments.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.001.jpeg" alt="How Stripe Grew"></figure>



<p>While it might not be a household name (yet), Stripe has quietly been taking over the world of online payments. In fact, if you’re reading this post, there’s a good chance you’ve already made a purchase via Stripe (even if you didn’t know it).</p>



<p>In the past year,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/jdewitt29/status/1050017508516876289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">84%</a>&nbsp;of U.S. adults purchased something via Stripe. And when you consider that there are now more than&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/us/customers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a million</a>&nbsp;businesses using Stripe to process payments, it’s easy to see how that 84% figure became a reality.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.002.jpeg" alt="How Stripe grew"></figure>



<p>Of course, Stripe’s success didn’t happen overnight. The company’s co-founders, brothers Patrick Collison and John Collison, started the company in 2010 after dropping out of college and receiving a seed investment from Y Combinator (the startup accelerator program). And while older brother Patrick, Stripe’s CEO, was 21-years-old when they founded Stripe, and younger brother John, Stripe’s president, was 19, this wasn’t their first rodeo. They sold a previous company, Auctomatic, for $5 million in 2008, back when Patrick was 19 and John was just 17.</p>



<p>Flash forward to 2018 and Patrick and John Collison are two of the youngest billionaires in the world. After raising $245 million in September of 2018, their company Stripe is now valued at $20 billion – 4,000x more than what their first company had been worth.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.003.jpeg" alt="Stripe valuation"></figure>



<p>When you look at this incredible level of&nbsp;hypergrowth&nbsp;that Stripe has been able to achieve, it begs the obvious question:</p>



<p><strong>How the heck did they do it?</strong></p>



<p>In this post, we’ll dive deep into how Stripe was able to go from $0 to $20 billion in less than a decade. Ultimately, there are four key lessons all companies can benefit from implementing:</p>



<ol><li>Solve a real problem.</li><li>Obsess over customer experience.</li><li>Have a vision for the future.</li><li>Read books…lots of books.</li></ol>



<h2>1) Solve a real problem.</h2>



<p><strong>☝️ That’s how Stripe generated word-of-mouth around their new product.</strong></p>



<p>When the Collisons launched their first company, Auctomatic, back in 2007, they came to an unexpected realization. They realized that the hardest part of starting an online business wasn’t coming up with an idea, or coding that idea into reality, or marketing that idea to potential customers. Instead, as John explained in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/stripe-payments-apple-amazon-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, “The hardest part was finding a way to accept customers’ money.”</p>



<p>At the time, the largest eCommerce companies invested in building their own systems for processing payments online. But for scrappy startups (like Auctomatic), this wasn’t a viable solution. Doing so was too expensive and required weeks of back-and-forth with the bank. So instead, many of those startups turned to PayPal, which promised to make accepting online payments easier. Only…it didn’t. To the Collisons, PayPal still felt unnecessarily clunky and complex, and it came with too many regulations and setup fees. For developers who wanted to get payments up-and-running on a website quickly and easily, there was still no solution on the market.&nbsp;<strong>At a time when every other aspect of starting an online business had become easier, accepting payments remained complicated.</strong></p>



<p>And that’s how the idea for&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/press" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe</a>&nbsp;– “a developer-focused, instant-setup payment platform that [can] scale to any size” – was born. As John told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1813087/inside-stripe-paypal-competitor-backed-paypal-founders-peter-thiel-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast Company</a>, “Stripe really did come about because we were really appalled by how hard it was to charge for things online.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.004.jpeg" alt="Josh Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>In 2011, the year the Collisons officially launched Stripe, they visited PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and told them, in a nutshell, that PayPal was outdated and broken. Then, the Collisons asked them for money…and got it. Recognizing the issues the Collisons saw with the current online payments infrastructure were legitimate, Thiel and Musk led Stripe’s $2 million Series A round of fundraising that same year alongside Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz.</p>



<p>Talk about a gutsy move. As John told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/stripe-payments-apple-amazon-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, “It’s a little impetuous to go to PayPal founders and say payments on the internet are totally broken. But look, you can WhatsApp anyone around the world and it’s free. It’s a remarkable act of coordination between the telcos and ISPs and the people who own the fiber underneath the sea to create this global communications network. Then, if you look at the economic infrastructure, we haven’t even started.”</p>



<p>The Collison brothers didn’t set out to revolutionize the world of online payments processing when they founded Stripe. Instead, they set out to solve the legitimate problem they faced as developers and entrepreneurs. And, as it turns out, they weren’t alone. Fellow developers and entrepreneurs who were part of the same accelerator program (remember Y Combinator) were experiencing the same problem and soon began adopting Stripe in droves – and they began telling their friends about it.</p>



<p>For the first couple of years, word of mouth among developers was the lifeblood of Stripe’s business. As Patrick explained in an interview with&nbsp;<a href="http://techzinglive.com/page/939/168-tz-interview-patrick-collison-stripe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechZing</a>, “Initially it very much spread through a word of mouth process. That was surprising to us because it’s a payment system not a social network so it’s not something you’d think would have any virality whatsoever. But it became clear that everything else was so bad and so painful to work with that people actually were selling this to their friends.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.005.jpeg" alt="Patrick Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>It’s clear that the spark that got Stripe’s growth started was identifying a legitimate problem that resonated with lots of people. But in order to maintain the word of mouth that accompanied Stripe’s launch, and in order to keep that word of mouth positive, Stripe couldn’t simply rest on its laurels: It needed to invest in delivering a stellar customer experience, both for its own customers and for its customers’ customers.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.drift.com/summit/revgrowth-virtual-experiences/"></a>2) Obsess over customer experience.</h2>



<p><strong>☝️ That’s how Stripe attracted its biggest accounts, like Lyft.</strong></p>



<p>Developers who switch from legacy payments processing systems to Stripe notice the difference in experience&nbsp;<em>immediately</em>. For starters, installing Stripe on a website or in an app requires copying and pasting just seven lines of code – that’s it! A process that once took weeks can now happen in a single day.</p>



<p>As John explained in an interview with NPR, “We have lots of stories of people integrating payments in an afternoon or an evening and then launching their business the next day. And that just worked consistently.”</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0drift0ho9g7wbfexi.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-stripe-grew-images.006.jpeg" alt="Josh Collison Stripe"></figure>



<p>Of course, that installation experience is essential to what makes Stripe such an effective product. As you read in the previous section, developers had been longing for a payments solution they could quickly and easily plug into their own products, and Stripe delivered.</p>



<p>In addition to making their installation process a breeze, Stripe made their entire end-to-end customer experience as enjoyable as possible. For example, Stripe’s documentation is famously clear and concise, which makes it easy for developers to find answers to any questions they might have. Stripe also regularly hosts meetups, hackathons, and other events where developers can talk about their experiences with Stripe and share best practices.</p>



<p>Stripe did such a good job of building goodwill around its brand that when it started sending out welcome packages to new customers, which included Stripe-branded stickers and t-shirts,&nbsp;<em>developers actually wore those t-shirts</em>. As Facebook product manager Morgan Brown wrote in a&nbsp;<a href="https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/how-stripe-marketed-to-developers-so-effectively" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growth Hackers</a>&nbsp;article, the Stripe swag “only fueled the positive vibes developers had of the company. These t-shirts were worn proudly and the care packages shared on social media, mostly from developer recipients to other developers who they were connected to online.”</p>



<p>And while it’s easy to see how Stripe’s focus on customer experience helped the service become even more popular among developers, we’re still only looking at one half of the Stripe experience. Because in addition to reimagining the way sellers accepted payments online, Stripe also reimagined the way buyers pay for things online. In other words, Stripe isn’t just concerned about the experiences its customers have, it’s also concerned about the experiences its customers’ customers have.</p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor, Paypal, Stripe doesn’t insert itself into the buying process. Instead, it works behind the scenes, which means buyers never have to leave a company’s checkout page or enter some third-party-branded workflow in order to complete a transaction. When you buy something from a company via Stripe, Stripe gets out of the way and does its job in the background. It’s seamless – there are no interruptions.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as a seller, using Stripe means you get to maintain a one-to-one connection with your buyer. As Stripe’s Chief Business Officer, Bill Alvarado, told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1813087/inside-stripe-paypal-competitor-backed-paypal-founders-peter-thiel-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast Company</a>&nbsp;back in 2012: “You look at Google Checkout, you look at PayPal – they get in the way of the product. In many ways, Google and PayPal are trying to create their own relationship with your customer. I think that’s the thing that Stripe has done right. We’ve designed this for fast use, yes, but also so that you can retain control of your experience, your product, and your customers.”</p>



<p>It’s this dedication to customer experience that led to Stripe win deals with major companies, like Facebook, Google, Slack, Salesforce.com, Shopify, Target, OpenTable, Yelp, and Lyft. Case in point: When the Collison brothers were asked in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=608512576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NPR</a>&nbsp;interview how Stripe was able to get a company like Lyft’s attention, John responded that the fundamental and most important thing was that Stripe “enabled product experiences that they wanted to have.”</p>



<p>Specifically, with Lyft, the ride-sharing service needed a system that allowed them to both charge their customers&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;pay their drivers – something that didn’t exist yet.</p>

As powerful as it is, it is generally  taught at the pre-college level without much consideration on its<strong> underlying theory</strong> or its <strong>alternatives</strong>…</p><p>In this guide though, we’ll take a look at both of those, and delve into the different types of <strong>division procedures</strong> under the different scenarios. We’ll also try to illustrate their role in promoting a holistic understanding about division and numbers in general — through candid analysis and a wide range of examples.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Long-Division-Guide-for-Integers-Logo.png" alt="Definitive Higher Math Guide on Long Division for Integers — Logo" width="850" height="283" title="Long Division Guide for Integers Logo"></figure></div><p>(By the way, are you fairly acquainted with the content of this guide? If so, you might find this comprehensive <strong>summary worksheet</strong> both challenging and useful.)</p><span> </span><h2 id="terms"><span id="Euclidean_Division_%E2%80%94_Terminology"></span><a href="#toc">Euclidean Division — Terminology</a><span></span></h2><p> In arithmetic, we often like to express a number $n$ as chunks of another (non-zero) number $d$.  When that happens, we’re said to be dividing $n$ by $d$, where $n$ is known as the <strong>dividend</strong>, and $d$ the<strong> divisor.</strong></p><p> In general, given a dividend $n$ and a divisor $d$, we can express $n$ as $dq + r$ for some <em>integer</em> $q$ and some number $r$, and while $n$ can have many <strong>$dq+r$ representations</strong>, there is only one such representation where $ 0\le r &lt; |d|$.</p><p>In particular, in the case where the dividend and the divisor are <em>integers</em>, this result is known as the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Division Theorem (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division#Statement_of_the_theorem" target="_blank">Division Theorem</a></strong>, but even if they are not, the following still apply in general:</p><ul><li>$q$ — which is the unique <em>integer</em> in the above $dq+r$ representation — is known as the <strong>quotient</strong>.</li><li>$r$  — which is the unique number in the above $dq+r$ representation — is known as the <strong>remainder</strong>.</li><li>The act of finding those two numbers is called an <strong>Euclidean division</strong>, or more colloquially, <em>division with remainder</em>.</li></ul><div><p>In Case You’re Wondering…</p><p>The Division Theorem for integers is generally established by relying on the <strong>Well-Ordering Principle</strong>. For the general case, the <strong><a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Archimedean_Principle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Archimedean Property for real numbers</a> </strong>might be of help.</p></div><p>So what’s being implied here is that the dividend and the divisor are generally fixed numbers, while the <strong>interim quotients</strong>/<strong>remainders</strong> can change depending on the stage of the division we’re in. Furthermore:</p><ul><li>The equation $n=dq+r$ is known as the <strong>algebraic representation</strong> of the division.</li><li> The equation $\displaystyle \frac{n}{d} = q + \frac{r}{d}$ is known as the <strong>fractional representation</strong> of the division.</li></ul><p>(to be sure, there’s also the <strong>mixed fraction</strong> $\displaystyle q \, \frac{r}{d}$, though such notations are generally more prone to confusion when we move beyond the integers.)</p><p>And of course, there’s also the <strong>graphical representations</strong> of the division as well — which we’ll get into after some preliminary theory on division procedure.</p><h2 id="edptheory"><span id="Euclidean_Division_Procedure_%E2%80%94_Theory"></span><a href="#toc">Euclidean Division Procedure — Theory</a><span></span></h2><p> Of course, the Division Theorem is a neat piece of logic guaranteeing that in an Euclidean division scenario, the <strong>quotient</strong> and the <strong>remainder </strong>exist and are unique. However, it doesn’t offer us much clue as to how we should go about finding those numbers in practice…</p><p> But then, that’s precisely where the primary topic of our interest — <strong>Euclidean division procedure </strong> — comes into play.</p><p> In a nutshell, these are the finite, recursive procedures that seek to find the quotient and the remainder through <strong>iterated subtractions</strong>. They tend to operate by deducting the dividend repeatedly — usually in a series of <em>leaps</em> — until it becomes smaller than the divisor itself.</p><p>And when that happens, the process comes to an end — with the <strong>last interim quotient </strong>and <strong>remainder</strong> being the answers to the original Euclidean division.</p><p>Or more specifically:</p><ol><li>Given a dividend $n$ and a (non-zero) divisor $d$, we would begin the procedure by <strong>deducting</strong> $n$ (or its absolute value) by $d$ — an integer number of times (say $q_1$). This would lead to an interim remainder $r_1$, and the following interim algebraic representation of the division: \[ <br>n = d q_1 + r_1 \]</li><li> At this point, if $0 \le r_1 &lt; |d|$, then the division procedure is finished. If not, we would continue with the <strong>same process</strong> by deducting $r_1$ (or its absolute value) by $d$ — another integer number of times (say $q_2$). This would lead to the next interim remainder $r_2$, and the next algebraic representation of the division:  \[ n = d q_1 + d q_2 + r_2 \]</li><li> So as we go through the <strong>$i^{\text{th}}$ iteration</strong> of the division, we would obtain:<ul><li> The <strong>$i^{\text{th}}$-stage quotient </strong>$q_i$</li><li> The <strong>interim quotient</strong> $q_1 + \cdots + q_i$</li><li> The <strong>interim remainder</strong> $r_i$</li></ul></li><li> And if we choose the stage quotients judiciously so that the $|r_i|$ decreases by, say, at least $1$ at each stage, then after a <em>finite</em> number of iterations (say $m$), we’d be guaranteed to generate an <strong>interim remainder</strong> $r_m$ such that $0 \le r_m &lt; |d|$. And when that happens, our final algebraic representation would become: \begin{align*} <br>n &amp; = dq_1 + \cdots + dq_m + r_m \\ &amp; = d (q_1 + \cdots +q_m) + r_m  \end{align*} At which point, the division procedure would come to an end, yielding $q_1 + \cdots + q_m$ and $r_m$ as the <strong>quotient</strong> and the <strong>remainder</strong> of $n \div d$, respectively.</li></ol><p>Here, notice that whether $n$ and $d$ are integers or not, the interim quotients must be always kept as <strong>integers</strong> — and are the only ones among the $n$, $d$, $q$s, $r$s that must satisfy that requirement.</p><p>For this guide though, we’ll restrict ourselves to the cases where both $n$ and $d$ are integers, and look at the division methods and approaches that come out of those. These include the <strong>long/short division methods</strong>, the <strong> chunking methods,</strong> the <strong>freeform method </strong>— among other less graphical division approaches.</p><h2><span id="Integer_Division"></span><a href="#toc">Integer Division</a><span></span></h2><p>Since the concept of division has its basis on the natural numbers, it makes sense that we first start from there and illustrate some of the <strong>primary methods</strong> being involved. Once there, we’ll slowly expand our toolset with other alternate methods and approaches — so that other scenarios of integer divisions can be included as well.</p><h3><span id="Case_1_%E2%80%94_DigitBased_Methods"></span><a href="#toc">Case 1 — Digit-Based Methods</a><span></span></h3><p> If you have a tape that’s<strong> 1529 cm</strong> long and you want to cut it down into pieces of <strong>7cm chunks</strong>, how many of those pieces can you make? And after all is said and done, how much of the tape would remain?</p><p> Well, as you might guess, this is nothing more than the following <strong>division problem</strong>: \[ 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529} \] which can be solved by using the traditional <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="long division method (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division" target="_blank">long division method</a></strong>, or — if we prefer — the abbreviated <strong>short division method</strong> as well.</p><h4><span id="Long_Division"></span><a href="#toc">Long Division</a><span></span></h4><p>As you might already know, the long division procedure consists in setting up the division tableaus so that at each stage, we would be cranking out a digit of the <strong>quotient</strong> — by deducting the dividend/interim remainder by the largest number of times possible.</p><p>In this case for example, since $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $100$ times, but not $1000$ times, we know that we should begin the process by looking into the <strong>digit-multiples</strong> of $100$.</p><p>In fact, a bit of inspection would show that $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $200$ times, but not $300$ times. This would lead us to choose $200$ as our first <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which would in turn produce the following tableau: \begin{array}{r} 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em]   \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em]   129  \end{array} And here is the beauty about this approach: since we’ve already established that $1529$ can be deducted by $7$ $200$ times, but not $300$ times, this means that we definitely won’t be further deducting $1529$ by $100$ times or more, and that all that remains is to focus at the <strong>digit-multiples</strong> of $10$ instead.</p><p>In fact, a little bit of inspection would show that $129$ — what remains now of $1529$ — can be deducted by $7$ $10$ times, but not $20$ times. This would lead us to choose $10$ as the next <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which in turn would lead to the following tableau:  \begin{array}{r} 10 \\[-0.35em] 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em]   \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em]   129 \\[-0.3em] \underline{\phantom{1}70} <br>\\[-0.25em] 59 \end{array} As you can see here, our notation is a bit unusual in that the numbers are being stacked up at the <strong>extremes</strong>, but those are there for a few reasons — which will become clearer in the next few sections.</p><p>But that aside, notice that since we’ve already established that what remained of $1529$ could be deducted by $7$ $10$ times, but not $20$ times, this means that we’ll definitely not be further deducting it by $10$ times or more — and that a deduction by a <strong>digit-multiple</strong> of $1$ should be our next step.</p><p>In fact, it doesn’t take a long time to realize that $59$ — what remains now of $1529$ — can be deducted by $7$ $8$ times, but not $9$ times. This would lead us to choose $8$ as our next <strong>stage quotient</strong>, which in turn would lead us to our next tableau: <br>\begin{array}{r} 8 \\[-0.35em] 10 \\[-0.35em] 200 \\[-0.35em] 7 \enclose{longdiv}{1529}\kern{-0.15ex} <br>\\[-0.3em]   \underline{1400} <br>\\[-0.25em]   129 \\[-0.3em] \underline{\phantom{1}70} <br>\\[-0.25em] 59 \\[-0.3em] \underline{56} \\[-0.25em] 3 \end{array} Here, notice that since we’ve already established that what remained of $1529$ could be deducted $8$ times, but not $9$ times, it already followed by then that what <em>would</em> remain of $1529$ must be smaller than the <strong>divisor</strong> itself. In fact, this is reflected in our last tableau as well.</p><p>But either way, the division procedure is now coming to its end, yielding $200 + 10 + 8 = 218$ as the quotient, $3$ as the remainder, and the following <strong>representations</strong> of the division as well:</p><ul><li><strong>Algebraic representation</strong>:  $1529 = 7 (218) + 3$</li><li><strong>Fractional representation</strong>: $\displaystyle \frac{1529}{7} = 218 + \frac{3}{7}$</li></ul><h4><span id="Long_Division_Shorthands_%E2%80%94_Quotient_Merging_and_Omissions_of_Zeros"></span><a href="#toc">Long Division Shorthands — Quotient Merging and Omissions of Zeros</a><span></span></h4><p>Now, in the above example, there are two interesting peculiarities. The first one — which is easier to spot — is the fact that each stage quotient takes the form of a <strong>leading digit</strong> followed by zeros (or no zero), with the place of the leading digit moving to the right at each stage — <em>without ever overlapping</em>.</p><p>So the natural question becomes: “Does this apply to all long division tableaus at every stage?” Fortunately, the …</p></section></div></div></div></div></div>

August 28, 2020 | https://lpil.uk/blog/gleam-v0.11-released/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lpil.uk/blog/gleam-v0.11-released/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>It’s time for another Gleam release! This time as well as taking a look at
what’s new in the compiler, we’re going to take a look at what’s new in the
wider Gleam ecosystem too.</p>

<h2 id="record-update-syntax">Record update syntax</h2>

<p>Previously when we wanted to update some of the fields on the record we would
need to create a new instance and manually copy across the fields that have
not changed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>level_up</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>:</span> <span>Pokemon</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_level</span> <span>=</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.level</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_moves</span> <span>=</span> <span>moves_for</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span> <span>new_level</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Pokemon</span><span>(</span>
    <span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>new_level</span><span>,</span>
    <span>moves</span><span>:</span> <span>new_moves</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.name</span><span>,</span>
    <span>species</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span>
    <span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.item</span><span>,</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is quite verbose! Worse, it’s error prone and annoying to type every
time.</p>

<p>To remedy this problem <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton">Quinn Wilton</a> has
added the record update syntax to Gleam, so now we only need to specify the
fields that change.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>level_up</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>:</span> <span>Pokemon</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_level</span> <span>=</span> <span>pokemon</span><span>.level</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>new_moves</span> <span>=</span> <span>moves_for</span><span>(</span><span>pokemon</span><span>.species</span><span>,</span> <span>new_level</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Pokemon</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>pokemon</span><span>,</span> <span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>new_level</span><span>,</span> <span>moves</span><span>:</span> <span>new_moves</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All data in Gleam is immutable, so this syntax does not alter the values of
the existing record, instead it creates a new record with the original values
and the updated values.</p>

<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tomwhatmore">Tom Whatmore</a> has added some new features to
Gleam’s numbers.</p>

<p>There’s now syntaxes for binary, octal, and hexadecimal int literals.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// 4 ways of writing the int 15</span>
<span>let</span> <span>hexadecimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>0xF</span>
<span>let</span> <span>decimal</span> <span>=</span> <span>15</span>
<span>let</span> <span>octal</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>o17</span>
<span>let</span> <span>binary</span> <span>=</span> <span>0b00001111</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These might be handy in many situations such as when implementing
<a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/gleam-chip8">a virtual machine</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lpil/tetromino">a game of tetris</a> in Gleam.</p>

<p>Underscores can now be added to numbers, making larger numbers easier to read.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>billion</span> <span>=</span> <span>1_000_000_000</span>
<span>let</span> <span>trillion_and_change</span> <span>=</span> <span>1_000_000_000_000</span><span>.</span><span>57</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="type-holes">Type holes</h2>

<p>Type holes can be used to give partial annotations to values.</p>

<p>Here we’re saying that <code>x</code> is a List, but we’re not saying what type the list
contains, leaving the compiler to infer it.</p>



<p>This may be useful when adding annotations for documentation or to use a more
restrictive type than would be inferred by the compiler, as you can leave out
any parts of the annotation that are not important to you there.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-improvements">Compiler improvements</h2>

<p>The majority of the compiler work in this release has been improvements to
existing features.</p>

<p>The formatter style has been improved in several ways, and the performance of
the formatter has been improved. One popular change is to how it formats
assignments that don’t fit on a single line.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Before</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>
  <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>session</span><span>),</span>
<span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>application_registry</span><span>.get_session</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.user_id</span><span>)</span>

<span>// Now</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>,</span> <span>session</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>application_registry</span><span>.get_session</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>.user_id</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much better!</p>

<p>Additionally several error messages have been improved to include more
information on how to fix the problem, and a whole bunch of bug have been
squashed. Please see the
<a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for
more detail.</p>

<h2 id="http">HTTP</h2>

<p>Outside of the compiler the big new thing in Gleam is the first release of
<a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http">Gleam HTTP</a>. Inspired by existing libraries such as Ruby’s Rack,
Elixir’s Raxx, and Haskell’s WAI, Gleam HTTP provides a single well-typed
interface for creating web applications and clients while keeping the
underlying HTTP client and server code modular.</p>

<p>In Gleam a HTTP service is a regular function that takes a HTTP request and
returns a HTTP response, where request and response are types defined by the
HTTP library.</p>

<h4 id="services">Services</h4>

<p>Here’s a simplistic service that echoes back any body sent to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>Request</span><span>}</span>

<p>As a normal Gleam function it is easy to test this service, no special test
helpers or test server are required.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>should</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gleam’s HTTP library also provides middleware, which can be used to add
additional functionality to a HTTP service.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>bit_builder</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>middleware</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>service</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>my_app</span><span>.echo_service</span>
  <span>// Add a header</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.prepend_resp_header</span><span>(</span><span>"made-with"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Gleam"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>// Convert the response body type</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.map_resp_body</span><span>(</span><span>bit_builder</span><span>.from_bit_string</span><span>)</span>
  <span>// Support PATCH, PUT, and DELETE from browsers</span>
  <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>middleware</span><span>.method_override</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="running-a-service">Running a service</h4>

<p>Once we have defined a service we want to run the service with a web server so
that it can handle HTTP requests from the outside world. To do this we use a
HTTP server adapter, such as one for the <a href="https://github.com/elli-lib/elli">Elli Erlang web server</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>elli</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>elli</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>my_app</span><span>.service</span><span>,</span> <span>on_port</span><span>:</span> <span>4000</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or one for the <a href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy">Cowboy Erlang web server</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>my_app</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span><span>/</span><span>cowboy</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>cowboy</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>my_app</span><span>.service</span><span>,</span> <span>on_port</span><span>:</span> <span>4000</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or even using the adapter for the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug">Elixir’s Plug interface</a>, so that a
Gleam HTTP service can be mounted within an Elixir Phoenix web application.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyAppWeb</span><span>.</span><span>UserController</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>MyAppWeb</span><span>,</span> <span>:controller</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>show</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>conn</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>GleamPlug</span><span>.</span><span>call_service</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>:my_app</span><span>.</span><span>service</span><span>/</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A list of all available server adapters can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http/#server-adapters">Gleam HTTP
project’s README</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to see more examples of Gleam HTTP being used to create a
web application see the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/example-echo-server">echo server</a> on GitHub. It
includes all the above as well as other concepts such as routing and logging.</p>

<h4 id="http-clients">HTTP clients</h4>

<p>HTTP services are only half the story! We also can use the HTTP library to
make out own requests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>http</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>httpc</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_my_ip</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>response</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.default_req</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_method</span><span>(</span><span>http</span><span>.Get</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>http</span><span>.set_host</span><span>(</span><span>"api.ipify.org"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>httpc</span><span>.send</span>
  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>.body</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we’ve build a HTTP request and sent it using the <code>httpc</code> client adapter,
returning the response body if the request is successful.</p>

<p>A list of all available client adapters can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/http/#client-adapters">Gleam HTTP
project’s README</a>.</p>

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed making it. I want to thank Micah for giving me the opportunity to learn from him and showcase his work to our community." -Leilany</p><h2 id="tell-us-a-bit-about-yourself-">Tell us a bit about yourself!</h2><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NnSAWn7UoXi8GS8REutxeE0cVfrnAae2YeqMWOGcj0Iw4DRaoSHUOTRyZLZl73ZEfujCiecwTzKOrdYzkEVZYkbcChPHZq4cJtksDXbfHbV6kafDilLX-A6kmLIIUw"></figure><p>Hello, my name is Micah Iverson. I am many things: Husband, Father, Designer, Developer, Entrepreneur, and Interior House Painter to name a few. My wife and I have been married since 2016 and have two boys (10 and 12). We live in Castle Rock Colorado, which is located about 30 minutes South of Denver. I am originally from Iowa, have lived in Minnesota, and of course now Colorado.</p><p>I have two degrees, one in design and another in 3D Animation. I have also studied computer science, photography, pottery, and grew up helping my dad build and remodel things. <em>(He is a carpenter/cabinet builder.)</em></p><p>In September of 2018, I stepped away from my design and development career and started my own interior house painting company which has continued to be extremely successful and continues to grow. In my free time, I focus on my own personal, digital products to relax and hopefully, one day will be my primary focus and revenue source.</p><h2 id="what-are-you-making">What are you making?</h2><p>As many people know, I make a lot of things, of which you can check out here: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.krazier.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1598466186406000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0RVfOCL3YgTIhIkAVAXbe8">https://www.krazier.com</a> but the one I spend a lot of my time on and has been growing the fastest is Retrospect. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.retrospect.team&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1598466186406000&amp;usg=AOvVaw18nsSYhG0Y9pINGNtWMKO0">https://www.retrospect.team</a></p><p>Retrospect is a real-time collaboration tool for retrospectives, tasks, and ideas.</p><h2 id="how-did-the-idea-for-your-product-come-to-mind">How did the idea for your product come to mind?</h2><p>I was working for a company a couple of years ago and we needed a tool to do retrospectives and the existing solutions we found were not designed well and didnâ€™t work all that great, not to mention the bigger solutions costing a lot of money to use for a relatively small need that we had. I set out to build a simple, affordable solution that looked good too.</p><h2 id="what-inspired-you-to-make-your-product">What inspired you to make your product?</h2><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wmkyhgs67HaZAalvciwqT6cj56V3OKmQQdK9SojC05r4XwoelQxx7YjFCk3t_Hst_HHV7-yXuXpD8FqWziizHUeAMW6T-BTTbfeGwVC8m2p-iNoaXEsFipWMuIoytQ"><figcaption>Retrospect.</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned above, it was originally out of necessity, but it is become a bit of a passion project to see just how far I can take it. With the Covid19 lockdown situation, this type of tool has only become more important for businesses to take advantage of.</p><p>Retrospect is purposefully â€œsimpleâ€�, we did not set out to make another Trello or Asana type of tool. Those tools are great and are a nice compliment to what we are building. One important focus for us has been â€œanonymityâ€� in the product. With Retrospectives, it is important to be able to provide critical feedback, it can be hard to do that if there is the potential for your co-workers to get upset with something you may have said. With Retrospect, everything you publish to a board is kept anonymous so that you can give that critical feedback without fear of retaliation.</p><p>Retrospect will always be affordable; we want this service to be approachable to as many people as possible while still being worth our time financially. We provide great pricing and a great solution and hope people will recognize that and find value in what we offer.</p><blockquote>I make because it is fun, I make because I know how, I love the challenge, the risk, and the huge potential it offers.</blockquote><h2 id="why-embark-on-the-maker-s-journey">Why embark on the makerâ€™s journey?</h2><p>I have always enjoyed building things, from Legos and plastic models to do-it-yourself projects around the house and of course digital designs and products. We live in a world that is very digital and very accessible for anyone to learn to design or code their own software. With tools like Makerlog, we can now share our progress, connect with other makers, and build things together. By nature, building software is often an â€œindividualâ€� thing to do, so having resources to connect with others makes the journey a lot more fun and open to learning from so many types of people.</p><p>A lot of people have a bit of an ambition to make something, whether it is art, electronics, gardening, woodworking, jewelry, or software. It is a way for us to get away from the day-to-day requirements in our lives and focus on something that we love to do without the stress of having to do it for anyone else. I make because it is fun, I make because I know how, I love the challenge, the risk, and the huge potential it offers.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-see-the-future-of-your-product">How do you see the future of your product?</h2><p>Retrospect has come a long way since the initial launch about two years ago, we have provided more permissions, more functionality, and improved the experience. The future has a lot of potential for new features and growth.</p><p>With the number of projects, I work on, I tend to push out a lot of smaller updates rather than huge feature releases. It is easier for us to manage and it also does not overwhelm our uses with huge UI changes that might make the tool unexpectedly harder for them to use.</p><p>As we continue to push out updates, our user audience will continue to expand. At first, our focus was on â€œretrospectivesâ€� which mostly development teams would find value in, the average person does not need a retrospective tool in their day-to-day lives. We are working towards making this a tool that has a useful impact on a daily level both professionally and personally. This means new types of functionality and a refreshed focus on our marketing and branding. Some of which will be happing over the coming weeks.</p><h2 id="as-of-today-what-are-your-stats">As of today, what are your stats?</h2><p>As of today, our stats areâ€¦</p><ul><li><strong>Users:</strong> 6,290</li><li><strong>Boards:</strong> 3,925</li><li><strong>Cards:</strong> 48,947</li><li><strong>Monthly Pageviews:</strong> 10K+</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $2K+ (We will be switching to a subscription model soon.)</li></ul><h2 id="how-do-you-use-makerlog">How do you use Makerlog?</h2><p>I post my daily updates but try to focus on important tasks rather than â€œI had a coffee todayâ€�, I do not want to spam the feed with things that are not important to know. I read most of the discussions and contribute when it makes sense.</p><p>I love Makerlog because it has allowed me to meet so many people that I never would have met any other way (other than maybe through Twitter). I feel like I have some lifelong friends despite having never met anyone in person, yet.</p><blockquote>I love Makerlog because it has allowed me to meet so many people that I never would have met any other way (other than maybe through Twitter).</blockquote><h2 id="what-are-the-biggest-challenges-of-being-a-maker">What are the biggest challenges of being a maker?</h2><p>The life of a maker is basically learning to deal with challenges daily, things you never would have thought you have to deal with. The bigger, more obvious challenges are lack of motivation, lack of revenue, and plain old fear.</p><p>Motivation, as makers we are by default motivated to work on things, that is what makes us a maker in the first place. The challenge comes into play when you have been working on something for a long time and it just feels like it will never be completed. There is always that â€œone more thingâ€� to do, person to reach out to, reason not to go live. When you do almost everything yourself, you simply get exhausted and lack of motivation is inevitable. Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s a bad thing, it just means you need to learn how to renew that motivation to push forward. For me I like to go to or watch movies, it is one easy way for me to reset my mind and get back into thigs. I also like to clean my desk or house, make a list of every task I have, and then work through the easy ones as fast as possible since lack of motivation often comes from knowing you should be doing something else so you end up doing nothing at all. If you can get the easy things done, then it helps you get motivated again.</p><p>Lack of revenue, this is a devastating challenge to a lot of people. We often see those â€œovernight successâ€� stories, that usually are not overnight. Though, these days we are seeing a lot of people who will literally build something one day and have a lot of success the next, the question is how long-term is that success? The obvious goal of being a maker is to generate revenue so you can get away from that 9-5 job, the unobvious issue is that it can take years to get enough revenue to do that. A lot of people do not realize this fact and give up too early and go back to what they were doing before. We also canâ€™t â€œdo it allâ€� so we often have to hire some pieces out, if you have no revenue, this becomes a big burden and can literally prevent you from even finishing your project.</p><p>Fear, people have a lot of fear in their minds. It is an important thing to be aware of and work on as being maker means dealing with a lot of unknowns. Fear is a good motivator though; it can force you to learn something faster than you thought possible. When I first started launching products, I was scared to death. Now that I have launched so many projects, I barely stress out at all. It just comes with practice and experience to get over or at least manage your fears.</p><p>You are likely not able to cause too much damage with something you build, so go out and build something, launch it, and learn from it. The more you do it, the more interesting it becomes.</p><blockquote>The more you fail the more you learn.</blockquote><h2 id="managing-so-many-projects-how">Managing so many projects, how?</h2><p>As of right now, I have 11 public projects plus my day job, plus several new projects I am working on and my #MakerMillion journey. It looks like a lot, it is a lot, but it is not as crazy as it sounds.</p><p>Retrospect is my primary focus; I spend the most time on this project compared to any other one I have (outside of my day job). Everything else sort of just â€œruns itselfâ€�, I have very little time commitment reserved for them on a day-to-day basis. Yes, I work on them, but it is not a constant, urgent requirement. Some things I have not hardly touched in months, partly because I am focused on other things and partly because I just lose interest in them for a while.</p><p>I work in cycles and sprints, I will come up with a feature idea, work hard on it for a week or two, launch it and then move onto the next thing. I do this over and over across all my projects. If I tried to focus on one thing, for a long time, I would get super bored with it, I like having the ability to jump around. This approach very likely prevents me …</p></div></div>

August 28, 2020 | https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/writing-labels.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/writing-labels.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>It has been a very productive and interesting journey creating Labcodes’ design system: there are always challenges and something new to learn. One thing we are doing is making sure we have our research and study references documented, alongside with the team's design choices, so we can have consistency throughout the components, and, mainly, a unison connection with our design principles. </p>
<p>One topic that always finds a way to catch my attention is the user interface short texts, and I was responsible, in our design system project, for the conception of the notifications, buttons and dropdown menu components. In common, they require guidelines and rules for writing its labels, in case of menu and buttons, and longer messages, for banners and toasts.</p>
<p>I remember that a long time ago, in the first versions of a mobile application that I don't remember which one, I read somewhere on the internet (sorry for the lack of references) about a change made to the interface: the term “my library” was set to “your library ”. OK! But what's interesting about that?</p>
<p>It was at that moment that the software began to communicate directly with its users. In the example, instead of considering the library as belonging to the system, the system now reports that the library belongs to the user. This change shows how short texts details change the reader's perception of a product. Below I will return to this subject.</p>
<h2>Writing labels</h2>
<p>Labels are commands applied to interface elements such as menus, tags, buttons, text inputs and other interface elements. They directly address users by communicating something or requesting an action. These commands are associated with interactive flows, normally change the system's state, and must be brief, informative and extremely clear. (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ui-copy/">adapted from n/n group</a>)</p>
<p><em>Each company has its own brand guide, which should present the tone and voices that the organization’s written communication should have. You can use it as a basis for writing according to how your company does it. Applying these rules, as well as other good writing practices, are a great path for good results. Here at Labcodes we have our own writing guide, which helps us a lot.</em></p>
<p>Following this reasoning, our design system's buttons have labels that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must communicate exactly what will happen when the user interacts with this component.</li>
<li>Only the first letter of the label's sentence is capitalized, as well as any other specific noun that requires capitalization.</li>
<li>They are as short as possible, preferably with a maximum of 3 words.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As difficult as it is to reduce actions labels to just 3 words, we chose to keep this rule as a </em>challenge in order to train our synthesis skills and communicate what really matters.*</p>
<p>For action menus we use some specific rules, but they are also applicable to buttons and other label categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use verbs and imperative phrases to describes the action triggered by the interaction. Never use verbs alone, always alongside a noun. For example: “Move item”, “Edit description”, “Get help". </li>
<li>Use nouns for actions that navigates to other pages (navigation actions/links). For example: “Keyboard shortcuts”, “Profile editor", “System settings”.</li>
<li>Don't use articles. They can complexify something that is simpler, increasing the length of a line, in addition to generating other unwanted effects. For example: write “Add bookmark” instead of “Add a bookmark”.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Let's take a step back to when I mentioned how short texts can change the perception of a product. Be aware when labeling system or user's owned items. A good example is to write “Your settings” instead of “My settings” since we are talking about user's preferences, that, even being stored by the system, they are still personal choices. This very naming choice shows attention to detail by making explicit product core values and showing who is in charge.</em></p>
<p><em>The dialogue between the system and its users must be direct, clear and friendly. When writing texts for interfaces, imagine the system as an experienced technical person talking to a non-technical person who needs to know what to do next, explaining a question in an understandable way, without making the experience dense or scary.</em></p>
<p>Something important to consider when writing button labels is the use of terms such as "Ok", "Yes", "No", "Finish", which does not have an explicit meaning for its triggered actions. It may be nice to spell out the actions that will be performed as the use of generic terms can cause difficulties in understanding or lead the user to take an action that they will regret.  </p>
<p>Most users typically press buttons or select actions without paying much attention to what they are doing. To avoid these inconveniences, in potentially destructive actions or that could cause an error, always provide a way to undo the action and use clear labels that help the user to recognize the options of "Undo", "Cancel", "Interrupt". In some cases, it may be useful to add a second confirmation layer to avoid data loss.</p>
<p><em>In common cases, there is simply not enough space in an application to accommodate commands with long labels, so, just repeating here the reminder to keep everything very simple. Consider it as a mantra and always ask yourself if it can be simplified further without losing clarity. Give preference to labels with only one line of text that contain up to 4 words.</em></p>
<h2>The design model for user interface texts</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/text-ui#a-design-model-for-ui-text">Microsoft has very interesting material on a design model for interface texts:</a></p>
<p>“As you think about UI text and its placement on your UI surfaces, consider these facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>During focused, immersive reading, people read in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order (in Western cultures).</li>
<li>When using software, users aren't immersed in the UI itself but in their work. Consequently, users don't read UI text, they scan it.</li>
<li>When scanning a window, users may appear to be reading text when in reality they are filtering it. They often don't truly comprehend the UI text unless they perceive the need to.</li>
<li>Within a window, different UI elements receive different levels of attention. Users tend to read control labels first, especially those that appear relevant to completing the task at hand. By contrast, users tend to read static text only when they think they need to.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“For a general design model, don't assume that users carefully read the text in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order. Rather, assume that users start by quickly scanning the whole window, then read UI text in roughly the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive controls in the center</li>
<li>The commit buttons</li>
<li>Interactive controls found elsewhere</li>
<li>Main instruction</li>
<li>Supplemental explanations</li>
<li>Window title</li>
<li>Other static text in main body</li>
<li>Footnotes”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should also assume that, once users decide what to do, they immediately stop reading any text and take action.</strong></p>
<h2>Moving forward</h2>
<p>Behavior, for me, is always something very fascinating that holds my attention. I always try, like our whole team, to produce content that is easy to understand.</p>
<p>Making available information clear is crucial to the decision-making process and guidance on interfaces, and in many cases the displayed information is scarce, garbled or the environment presents misplaced, wrong or contradictory messages, leading the user to fall back to more instinctive techniques such as trial and error, or luck.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered that the orientation process within an interface depends, in addition to its structure, on the way that texts and micro texts are written? In the next post, I will bring the lessons and our decisions to these short texts applied in notifications such as banners and toasts.</p>
<p>In the meantime, do you have any questions, suggestions or want to start a conversation? The comments section is open, and we want to know what you think and your experiences on writing for interfaces! See you soon :)</p>

<p>I’ve been using WordPress CMS for more than 10 years now. I’ve seen its evolution from a blogging platform to a fully featured website builder.</p>



<p>In December 2018, WordPress launched <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gutenberg</a> editor. The community, including myself, received it with mixed feelings.</p>



<p>On the one hand it looked like something innovative, intended to change the way users create and publish content, on the other hand it seemed like an incomplete tool trying to improve something that was already working great.</p>



<div><p>I’m now writing this post using <a href="https://wpindigo.com/wordpress-gutenberg-vs-elementor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gutenberg editor</a> and there is nothing particularly wrong with it. However, I sometimes find it difficult to use and confusing, even after using it on a daily basis. It simply doesn’t provide the user experience I’m used to.</p><p>Overall, I don’t like Gutenberg. Let me explain why. There are so many little things that simply don’t work as required. Here are a few examples:</p></div>



<ul><li><strong>The UI is not intuitive</strong>  – important controls are hidden, there are too many useless options, the icons are confusing and not representative. I don’t need spotlight mode, top toolbar, cog icons and other useless features.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1269" height="535" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons.png" alt="gutenberg confusing icons" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons.png 1269w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-300x126.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-1024x432.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-confusing-icons-768x324.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1269px) 100vw, 1269px"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="605" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options.png" alt="gutenberg hidden options" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options.png 1436w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-300x126.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-1024x431.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-hidden-options-768x324.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>I don’t need the Edit/Select mode</strong> – in previous versions I could select the content from all blocks and copy or move them. Now I have to change the mode from Edit to Select and then I’ll be able to do the same thing. </li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1136" height="286" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options.png" alt="gutenberg edit-select options" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options.png 1136w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-300x76.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-1024x258.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-edit-select-options-768x193.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>It’s not front-end editing</strong> – you add blocks in your back-end and preview them in the front-end. There is no way to edit blocks and other elements in the front end (except using the fullscreen mode which is not accurate).</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Block/pattern editing is a nightmare</strong> – if you’ve ever used <a href="https://elementor.com/?ref=13693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elementor</a> or any other decent page builder, you’ll understand what I mean. You can easily adjust a simple block like image or button, but when you have a more complex block, things get really complicated. It’s super hard to adjust elements and editing becomes a difficult task.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1427" height="621" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing.png" alt="gutenberg block-pattern editing" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing.png 1427w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-300x131.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-1024x446.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-block-pattern-editing-768x334.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1427px) 100vw, 1427px"></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Embeds are useless</strong> – what’s the point to embed a Youtube video if you can’t adjust the width of the video or set up the autoplay option. You will anyway need to include the video via custom code.</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Images</strong> – you can’t simply drag and drop multiple images at once, as in Classic Editor. Now, you have to create a gallery, select your images, post the gallery and adjust the columns. Used to be simpler and more efficient.</li></ul>







<ul><li><strong>Issues</strong> – if something goes wrong, let’s say you create an HTML block and your code is not valid, WordPress will notify you and give you options to Resolve the issue. Why? I don’t need to convert this block, I just want to edit the HTML code, which is not possible without converting the block.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1143" height="581" src="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block.png" alt="gutenberg resolve block" srcset="https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block.png 1143w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-300x152.png 300w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-1024x521.png 1024w, https://wpindigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gutenberg-resolve-block-768x390.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1143px) 100vw, 1143px"></figure>



<p>I like changes, but why did they change something that was working really well? Looks like they are pushing this product further, without listening to the community and in my opinion it gets worse.</p>



<p>Thank God we have the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Classic Editor</a> and can use it for now. I hope that Gutenberg will improve and the team will make it more user friendly and easy to use. For now, I will never use it to create new pages or more complex layouts. I think that it’s way behind <a href="https://elementor.com/?ref=13693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elementor</a> and other page builders.</p>



<p>So, what do you think? Is Gutenberg a failure or a success? Please share your thoughts.</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/08/24/bcrypt-step-by-step/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/08/24/bcrypt-step-by-step/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Bcrypt is a <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">key derivation function</a>, which can be thought of as a slow <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function</a>. Its purpose is to <em>slowly</em> convert a piece of input data to a fixed-size, deterministic, and unpredictable output. A common use-case is to convert a password into an n-bit cryptographic key, which can then be used for safe authentication. </p>



<p>Here at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault,</a> we use Bcrypt in our security systems. Bcrypt is a very popular password hashing function, so much so that it’s the hash function we currently teach the implementation of in our <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Practical Cryptography</a> course.</p>



<h2>What Bcrypt Looks Like</h2>



<p>Using Bcrypt on the password <em>myPassword123</em> would produce something like the following:</p>



<pre><strong><em>myPassword123</em> </strong>-&gt;
$2y$12$vUw4OU4EAl4w4vC6/lA33OtDSYGhiIdekdT9iOoSs9/ckwrffaEui</pre>



<p>That output can be used to compare against future hashes against to see if the original data matches.</p>



<h2>Why not compare passwords directly?</h2>



<p>In web development,<em> </em>it is insecure to store user’s passwords in plain text. If an attacker were to gain access to the server’s database they could find raw email/password combinations and use them to attack the same users on other sites. </p>



<p>At the <em>very least</em> we must hash user’s passwords, but hash functions like <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-2</a> and MD5 are too fast to be secure. Using a KDF like Bcrypt provides security benefits over fast hashes because it is computationally expensive and slow. If an attacker gains access to a database of password hashes made with fast algorithms it is easy for them to “reverse” the hashes by guessing different inputs and seeing if the outputs match.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say the attacker finds the following entry in a database:</p>



<pre>user@gmail.com 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p>They can try hashing common passwords like:</p>



<pre>password1 -&gt;
0b14d501a594442a01c6859541bcb3e8164d183d32937b851835442f69d5c94e
password2 -&gt;
6cf615d5bcaac778352a8f1f3360d23f02f34ec182e259897fd6ce485d7870d4
password3 -&gt; 5906ac361a137e2d286465cd6588ebb5ac3f5ae955001100bc41577c3d751764</pre>



<p><br>The password, <code>password3</code>, produced a matching hash! Now the attacker knows that <code>user@gmail.com</code> is likely to use the password <code>password3</code> on other sites and can go hack other accounts. This is only possible because the attacker is able to quickly compute many hashes per second and guess millions of potential passwords.</p>



<p>A slow KDF like Bcrypt solves this problem.</p>



<h2>Bcrypt Output Format</h2>



<pre>$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy
\___/\__/\_____________________________/\___________________________________/
Alg   Cost                  Salt                                            Hash</pre>



<ul><li><code>2a</code>: The hash algorithm identifier (Bcrypt)</li><li><code>10</code>: Cost factor (2<sup><code>10</code></sup>&nbsp;= 1,024 rounds of key expansion)</li><li><code>N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMye</code>: 16-byte (128-bit) salt, base64 encoded to 22 characters</li><li><code>IjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy</code>: 24-byte (192-bit) hash, base64 encoded to 31 characters</li></ul>



<p>Direct from <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>



<h2>Bcrypt Explained Step by Step</h2>



<p>Bcrypt can be visualized with the following Go-like pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func bcrypt(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (hash string) {
	// Initialize Blowfish state with expensive key setup algorithm
	// This is the slow part of the algorithm
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes := expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost, salt, password)

	// Repeatedly encrypt the text "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt" 64 times
	// 24 bytes = three 64-bit blocks
	ctext := "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt"
	for i := 0; i &lt; 64; i++ {
		// Encrypt using standard Blowfish in ECB mode
		ctext = encryptECB(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, ctext)
	}

	// return the version, cost, salt, and ctext in the proper format
	return "$2a${cost}${salt}{ctext}"
}</code></pre>



<p>As you can see, Bcrypt depends heavily on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)" rel="noopener">Blowfish</a> cipher. Put simply, Bcrypt is an expensive key expansion coupled with Blowfish encryption.</p>



<p>The <code>expensiveBlowfishSetup</code> function can be understood by following pseudo code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">// pEighteenSubkeys: array of 18 subkeys
// sFourSubBoxes: Four substitution boxes
// Each S-Box is a 256-length array of uint32
func expensiveBlowfishSetup(cost int, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32) {
	// Initialize arrays
	pEighteenSubkeys := [18]uint32
	sFourSubBoxes := [4][256]uint32

	// Fill pEighteenSubkeys and sFourSubBoxes with the hex digits of pi 
	// This initial state works as in the original Blowfish algorithm
	// it populates the P-array and S-box entries with the fractional part of pi in hexadecimal
	pEighteenSubkeys = fillWithPi(pEighteenSubkeys)
	sFourSubBoxes = fillWithPi(sFourSubBoxes)

	// Permutate P and S based on the password and salt
	pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, salt, password)

	// This is the "Expensive" part of the "Expensive Key Setup"
	// Otherwise the key setup would be identical to Blowfish
	// Expand the key an exponentially increasing number of times
	// depending on the cost factor
	for i := 0; i &lt; math.Pow(2, cost); i++ {
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, password)
		pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes = expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, 0, salt)
	}

	return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p><code>The expandKey function</code> is executed an exponentially increasing number of times depending on the value of the <code>cost</code> parameter. The <code>expandKey</code> function is explained by the following pseudo-code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func expandKey(pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32, salt [16]byte, password [72]byte) (
	pEighteenSubkeys [18]uint32, sFourSubBoxes [4][256]uint32
	) {

	// Mix password into the pEighteenSubkeys array
	// by XORing password with subkeys
	for i := 0; i &lt; 18; i++{
		// treat the password as cyclic, XOR 32 bit chunks of password with subkeys
		pEighteenSubkeys[i] ^= password[i % 18]
	}
 
   // Treat the 128-bit salt as two 64-bit halves 
   saltHalf[0] = salt[0:63]
   saltHalf[1] = salt[64:127]

   // Initialize an 8-byte (64-bit) buffer with all zeros.
   block := [8]byte

   // Mix internal state into P-boxes   
   for i := 0; i &lt; 9; i++ {
	  // XOR 64-bit block with a 64-bit salt half
	  // Each iteration alternating between saltHalf[0], and saltHalf[1]
      block ^= saltHalf[(i-1) mod 2]

	  // Encrypt block using current key schedule with blowfish block encryption
	  block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block)
	  
	  // Split block and use as new subkeys
      pEighteenSubkeys[2*i] = block[0:31]
	  pEighteenSubkeys[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
   }

   // Mix encrypted state into the internal S-boxes of state
   for i := 0; i &lt; 4; i ++ {
      for j := 0; j &lt; 127; j++ {
		// Encrypt block using blowfish block encryption
		// where salt[i] is 64 bit chunks
        block = Encrypt(pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes, block ^ salt[i])
        sFourSubBoxes[2*i] = block[0:31]
		sFourSubBoxes[2*i + 1] = block[32:63]
	  }
	}
    return pEighteenSubkeys, sFourSubBoxes
}</code></pre>



<p>It helps me to visualize the details of the pseudo-code by using a more “real” programming syntax like Go. If that doesn’t help you then take a look at the code on the <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Algorithm" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page here.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

    

    
        
    

    

<p><em>This is a series of notes on colour search design based on my experiences
desgining search interfaces for the lipstick search engine <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a>.
I will link other parts of the series here as they become available.</em></p>

<h2 id="simple-yet-flexible-the-design-of-the-query-page">Simple yet flexible: the design of the query page</h2>

<p>The initial design of the <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a> search interface drew heavy inspiration
from the relative minimalism of the Google search engine front page, which
has a graphic, a search box and a few buttons as the main features.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/Lipcolourmatch_PP_3.png" alt="Google Search Engine"></p>

<p><em>The design of Google’s text-based search engine is minimal.</em></p>

<p>However, one of the reasons that such a scarcity of elements works for Google’s usecase
is that text search is a good deal more simple than the search interface of a
niche colour search engine. Not only does the UI designer need to provide a suitable
UI element for choosing colours, this UI element also needs to account for the various textural
subtleties that a user may desire to search for.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/duckduckgo-search-bar.gif" alt="DuckDuckGo"></p>

<p><em>DuckDuckGo features a minimal search bar.</em></p>

<p>In the case of lipcolours, a product has variation not only in the shade, but also in the finish.
The same colour can appear as metallic (the formula has a added element for high shine and reflectivity), shimmer (the formula is shiny with tiny sparkles), cream (not as shiny as metallic, but more reflective than matte) and matte, which is usually the most pigmented and least reflective form a lipcolour. These variations in texture need to be taken into account in the search query.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/lipglossdemo.gif" alt="Lipgloss"></p>

<p><em>Searching for a lipgloss in a particular shade on <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a></em></p>

<p>To capture this complexity (the solution described here is not perfect by any means and will certainly require more iterations), the initial colour search UI design for <a href="http://lipcolourmatch.com/">lipcolourmatch.com</a> featured
a colour wheel selector powered by the open source library iro.js and a drop down
control for adding desired finish and product type filters. For example, one could, if
desired search for lipstick and liquid lipstick products in a matte navy blue colour.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/navyblue.gif" alt="Navyblue"></p>

<p><em>Searching for navy blue lipsticks and liquid lips in a matter finish.</em></p>

<h2 id="displaying-the-search-results">Displaying the search results</h2>

<p>The next important step in the design of a colour search engine is the format of
the results. The initial inspiration was once again drawn from the world
of text based search engines where web pages that best match a user’s query are listed
in descending order.  Some search engines like Google paginate the results, while
others like DuckDuckGo offer an infinite-scroll-lazy-loading experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/google-pagination.png" alt="Paginated search results from Google"></p>

<p><em>UI design for paginating search results on Google</em></p>

<p>As the user scrolls down, the backend returns more and more results.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/duckduckgo-pagination.gif" alt="DuckDuckGo pagination"></p>

<p><em>DuckDuckGo pagination is an infinite-scroll.</em></p>

<p>In addition to the results, the results pages of search engines usually also
display the original query, to help the user see what they searched for and how well what they found
with the help fo the search engine matches what they searched for.</p>

<p>The initial design of the colour search engine results followed the template above fairly closely.
The results page features a “You searched for” section that shows a coloured circle featuring the
colour the user chose from the colour wheel on the main page and then a list of results in a
descending similarity order. The closest colours (according to the colour search engines similarity metric) are listed first.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/searchresults.png" alt="Search resuslts"></p>

<p><em>Search results from the colour search engine feature the original query, the results in descending order of colour similarity as well as small cards with information.</em></p>

<p>Each search result is displayed with a small card that has a circular colour element that captures the colour of the product. In addition, each card has information about the brand, the product type and the finish.</p>

<h2 id="grid-like-results-to-facilitate-comparison">Grid-like results to facilitate comparison</h2>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/Lipcolourmatch_PP_4.png" alt="Results comparison"></p>

<p><em>One key task a user wants to do is to compare the results with the query. This is farily simple with a text search engine but harder when the query is a colour.</em></p>

<p>One of the main tasks that a user is interested in doing is comparing
the colour in the search query to the colour of the items
returned in the results to see how close the matches are to the query.
Thinking back to the results page of traditional text-based
web search engines, we can see that the pagination design (whether it’s
a traditional pagination UI or an infinitely scrolling UI) does not
interfere with the process of comparison that a user engages in.
We take the query we entered into the search engine and then scan
the results checking which one could potentially have useful
information related to the query. It’s relatively easy to keep
a text query in mind, so the paginated approach does not pose
a major hindrance to the user’s goal of comparing the query to the results.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/mac-chili-pages.gif" alt="Mac Chili Paginated"></p>

<p><em>Paginated search results from the colour search engine. Keeping the exact query colour in mind and paginating to compare results can be hard.</em></p>

<p>However, keeping the exact shade of a colour (the colour in the query) in your mind and then scrolling
or paginating through each result card and comparing the colours is challenging.
You can see for yourself in the animated screencapture above.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.race-conditions.net/images/mac-chili-grid.gif" alt="Mac Chili Grid"></p>

<p><em>A grid design facilitates colour comparison.</em></p>

<p>One solution for this would be to dock the “You searched for” card at the top
of the screen while scrolling and thus facilitate quick and easy side by side
comparison. However, for the time being implementing this with the Bootstrap
framework proved too difficult, so instead I’ve opted for implementing a grid
of results with a side by side card arrangement that displays the queried
colour on the left and allows the user to populate the card on the right
with a search result from the grid.</p>

<p>I will be iterating more on this design in the near future and look forward
to sharing what I learn with you!

  <p>Google is an evil company. When they're not <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/11/google-facebook-surveillance-privacy/">surveilling billions of people</a>, they're <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/08/13/google-resumes-its-senseless-attack-on-the-url-bar-hides-full-addresses-on-chrome-canary/">trying to harm the web</a> or <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-25/google-fires-four-employees-citing-data-security-violations">firing employees for organizing</a>. My <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/full-stack-ethics">first entry on this blog</a> was about reasons to avoid Google products. I don't like Google!</p>
<p>The thing is, Google is everywhere, and Google is free. It's probably not much of an exaggeration to say that everyone who spends time online has used a Google service. In a lot of cases, they're the default option that people choose without thinking. At some point, I just decided to stop. No more Google in my life.</p>
<p>Is that even possible in 2020? Mostly!</p>
<p>Some Google services are easily replaced. Others are difficult because of network effects, and still others just don’t seem to have any good competitors that I’ve found.</p>
<p>So here are all the Google services I used to use, how easy it is to avoid them and what I use instead.</p>
<h3 id="google-search">Google search</h3>
<p>I thought this one would be okay, since it’s a big target. The most promising competitor here seems to be <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, but ultimately I’ve been disappointed by their search results. They're fine for easy queries, like if I type the exact name of what I’m searching for. More complex queries — for example, pasting an error message from my terminal — are not great. DuckDuckGo make it easy to search Google by prefixing a query with <code>g!</code>, which I end up doing far too often.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: medium</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-chrome">Google Chrome</h3>
<p>If you've written it off in the past, you should revisit <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>. It's fast, its developer tools are great and it aggressively blocks trackers and advertisers. As of writing this, it's blocked 339 trackers for me today.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363424/mozilla-layoffs-quarter-staff-250-people-new-revenue-focus">Mozilla's recent layoffs</a> — including their <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveALee/status/1293487542382333952">developer tools team</a> — are worrying. If Firefox starts going downhill again, I'll probably switch to Safari. That would suck, though — Firefox is the last major bastion against the Webkit/Blink browser engine monoculture.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="android">Android</h3>
<p>I use an iPhone, so no problems here!</p>
<p>This might be a good time to mention that I have <a href="https://itep.org/fact-sheet-apple-and-tax-avoidance/">qualms</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-apple-china-catcher-20180116-story.html">with</a> <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/184283/why-third-party-browsers-will-always-be-inferior-to-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/">Apple</a>, too — but they seem to be the least worst of the two real choices for a cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="gmail">Gmail</h3>
<p>There are a million and one email services, so I wasn’t expecting too much trouble with this one. Partially because my email address is <code>@jake.nyc</code>, not <code>@gmail.com</code>, so there was no annoying transition where everyone had to update their contact info.</p>
<p>I went with <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> ($50 per year on their annual plan) and I have no complaints. It was super easy to import all my emails from Gmail. The webmail and phone apps are both good — although because my work uses Gmail, I use <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/">Spark</a> in order to have all my email accounts in one app.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-calendar">Google Calendar</h3>
<p>Fastmail email accounts come with a calendar, and it's interoperable with Google calendars. Or they're both compatible with some open standard; I'm not a calendar power user. Whatever the case, it works fine.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-maps">Google Maps</h3>
<p>After the disastrous Apple Maps rollout, I was worried that this would be a tough one to replace. Not so! If you have an iPhone, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/">Apple Maps</a> gives you everything you want in a maps app. And their maps have <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps-continental-united-states">gotten really good</a>. I'm happy to report that you can leave those fears in 2012.</p>
<p>If you're a city dweller like I am, there's an even better option: <a href="https://citymapper.com/">CityMapper</a>, which focuses specifically on public transit. They also have real-time transit alerts and offline maps. I use CityMapper whenever I'm taking public transit, and Apple Maps on the rarer occasion that I'm driving somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-docs">Google Docs</h3>
<p>The only two of these I really use are Docs and Sheets. I’m mostly able to cover everything with a combination of tools: <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> for prose, <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> for general note-taking and <a href="https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/">Soulver</a> for math related stuff. I would like to find a good full–featured spreadsheet replacement but so far that hasn’t been a huge obstacle.</p>
<p>The real issue is that I often use documents and spreadsheets with other people. And unfortunately, Google has built a nice little walled garden here. There's no easy way for me to collaborate with someone else without forcing them to also forego Google Docs. On top of that, other services build on top of Google's products. I use <a href="https://www.tillerhq.com/">Tiller</a> to stay on top of my spending, but they only support importing data into Google Sheets and Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: hard</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h3>
<p>This is basically the same story as Google Docs, with the caveat that it's much less common for me to need a shared filesystem with someone. I use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> for myself, which usually suffices when I need to share a file. That said, it's still part of the same ecosystem as Google Docs, which makes it hard to avoid if you use the former.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: medium</strong></p>
<h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Privacy conscious analytics services seem to be <em>en vogue</em> these days, so it wasn’t difficult to find a replacement I liked. I picked <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a> and have been very happy with it. It’s $14 a month and you can put it on as many websites as you want; I have it powering both this site and <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a>.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of obscure metrics Google Analytics gives you that Fathom doesn’t have, but I’ve never missed them. Maybe I would if I were really into marketing data. But pageviews, uniques, referrers, time on site and bounce rate is enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: easy</strong></p>
<h3 id="youtube">YouTube</h3>
<p>This one is a little weird, since the differentiating factor between YouTube and competitors is content rather than a set of features. I'm not a big YouTube user so it doesn’t bother me too much, but if someone sends me a video there’s basically no way for me to see it elsewhere.</p>
<p>I’m rating this one “hard” because it’s basically irreplaceable, but as someone who doesn’t watch many YouTube videos anyway it doesn’t really affect me. Your mileage may vary!</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: hard</strong></p>

			<p>stumpled upon a bug in openssh … did a small config change in sshd_config, deployed it with ansible … and <strong>lost connectifity to all these boxes immediately</strong> … and of course, i did a config check before reloading the sshd daemon, and the config check was fine.</p>
<p>i can’t belife that nobody else found this before, as it’s really simple to reproduce. and it’s working with openbsd, debian, centos and mostly on all system which have opensshd implemented (and that’s a lot of …)</p>
<h2 id="reproduce-the-bug">reproduce the bug</h2>
<p>just add the following line to your sshd_config, do a config check and restart sshd. and you will not be able to login aging through ssh!</p>
<p><strong>DON’T TEST THIS ON YOUR PRODUCTION SYSTEMS!</strong></p>
<p>you need a console and root login/password (or do some recovery procedures in single user mode) to fix this !</p>
<pre><code>root@debian:~# echo "Match Address 2001:db8::/16"  &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config

stoege@puffy200 255 ~$
</code></pre><h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>the problem is that you configured a host address instead of network address. this is not recognized by the config checker but by the sshd daemon itself.</p>
<p><strong>so, a simple Typo can bring your ssh daemon down! Reboot safe :)</strong></p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Match Address 192.168.1.1/24  -&gt; break your ssh daemon</strong></p>
<p><strong>-&gt; you have either a wrong network mask or a wrong subnet declaration</strong></p>

        <p><em>The integral of the secant is well known to any beginners calculus student. Yet this integral was once a major outstanding maths problem. It was first introduced by Geradus Mercator, who needed it to make his famous map, in 1569. He couldn’t find it, and used an approximation instead. The exact solution was found accidently 86 years later without calculus in 1645. It then took another two decades until a formal proof was given in 1668, 99 years after Mercator first proposed the problem.</em></p>

<p>As this <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/how-math-works">comic</a> by SMBC rightly teases, the history of mathematics is often not so straightforward. 
Theorems, formulas and notation that are routinely discussed in class, were once insights or accidents themselves.
This is the story of one such formula, the integral of the secant. 
I first read about it almost a decade ago<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, when I got interested in cartography: the science and art of mapmaking. 
This integral is of vital importance to the Mercator map, and therefore many online maps that use it, like <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/">Apple Maps</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a>.</p>

<p>This story has been told several times before: see <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3603395">1</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0025570X.1980.11976846">2</a> or <a href="https://scholarworks.umt.edu/tme/vol7/iss2/12/">3</a>.
But these are all journal articles, consigned mostly to academics.
I want to present it here in a less formal and more colourful setting, to make it more accessible.</p>

<p>This is an article about mathematics, so familiarity with the following is helpful: algebra, trigonometry, radians and basic calculus. 
These are usually covered in advanced high school maths classes or first year maths courses.</p>

<h2 id="first-year-maths">First year maths</h2>

<p>In first year maths at university, after a month of differentiation, we were starting the inverse problem: integration. 
Differentiation  is the mathematics of finding gradient functions for curves.
Integration is the mathematics of inverting this - given a gradient function, what is the curve? 
My lecturer was introducing the integration of trigonometric functions.
He started off with:</p><p>

\[\int sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + c \:\text{  and } \int cos(x) dx = sin(x) + c\]

</p><p>This relationship made sense, because sine and cosine derivatives were opposites. Just had to be careful of minus signs. Next he derived the integral for the tangent:</p><p>

\[\int tan(x) dx = \int \frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}dx = -ln|cos(x)| + c\]

</p><p>Ok, that was tricky. It was not immediately obvious that the inverse of the chain rule could be used here, because the function $cos(x)$ was present with its derivative $sin(x)$.
But given enough thought, it made sense. Then he said, this is the integral of the secant, and learn it off by heart:</p><p>

\[\int sec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + c\]

</p><p>OK, where did that come from? My lecturer offered no explanation. It was easy to verify that it worked by finding the derivative. 
(Paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/0025570X.1980.11976846">2</a> has a more complex proof using only integration.)
But how had he come up with that?</p>

<p>I think, at this point, most first year calculus students like me have the following fleeting thoughts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Integration is much harder than differentiation.</li>
  <li>Some mathematician must have stumbled on this through differentiation first.</li>
  <li>It doesn’t matter anyway because where will I ever use this?</li>
</ol>

<p>Actually, number 1 is true, as many a student can testify after writing a test. 
Number 2 is false - in fact it was found by a teacher while looking at raw numbers. 
Such a method for finding an integral is so unusual, that one might conjecture it is the <em>only</em> integral that has been found like this.
Surely in calculus class, where raw numbers are so rare, you would be laughed at if you attempted to solve an integral like that.
Lastly, number 3 remains true for me. But this doesn’t mean this integral isn’t useful - it is used to construct the Mercator map. 
That is why a teacher was crunching numbers when he serendipitously realised what the formula was.</p>

</figure>

<p>The secant is a standard trigonometric function. It is defined as the ratio of the hypotenuse $c$ to the adjacent side $a$ for an angle $\varphi$ in a right angled triangle.
In mathematical notation, the definition is:</p><p>

\[sec(\varphi) = \frac{c}{a}\]

</p><p>It is the reciprocal of the more widely used cosine function:</p><p>

\[sec(\varphi) = \frac{1}{cos(\varphi)}\]

</p><p>Here are the graphs of the secant and cosine for the angles from $-2\pi$ (-360°) to $2\pi$ (360°):</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/secant_graph.png" alt="Definition of the secant">
</figure>

<p>The integral of the secant can be interpreted as the area under the graph<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This is illustrated by the shaded region.</p>

<h2 id="an-introduction-to-cartography">An introduction to cartography</h2>

<p>The earth, which is a sphere<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, cannot be projected onto a flat map without distortion. 
Over the years, cartographers have devised many different map projections which try to balance minimising distortion with other properties. 
They come in all shapes and sizes.
Lists of these projections can be found <a href="https://map-projections.net/singleview.php">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections">here</a>.
I will explain two of the simplest here, which will help with understanding the Mercator map in the next section.</p>

<p>All map projections can be represented as equations that transform spherical co-ordinates to flat map co-ordinates.
The co-ordinates on the sphere are the angles $\varphi$ and $\lambda$. These correspond to lines of latitude (parallels) and longitude (meridans) respectively. 
The co-ordinates on the flat map are $x$ and $y$. A map projection is therefore a transformation from $\varphi$ and $\lambda$ to $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>One of the simplest and oldest known projections is the equirectangular projection:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/equirectangular.png" alt="Equirectangular map">
	<figcaption>Equirectangular map. From <a href="https://map-projections.net/single-view/rectang-0">map-projections.net/singleviewp/rectang-0</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is made by mapping meridians and parallels to vertical and horizontal straight lines of constant spacing.
This has the affect of stretching out objects along the parallels.
The equations for this projection are:</p><p>

\[\begin{align} y &amp;= R\varphi\\ x &amp;= R\lambda \end{align}\]

</p><p>While the equations are simple, the construction process can be hard to visualise. Here is my attempt:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/equirectangular_construction.png" alt="Equirectangular map construction">
	<figcaption>A segment of the sphere is peeled off and flattened.
The right most image shows a top view of the flattening. The arcs are pulled flat in the longitudial direction, so that they become straight lines.
They do not change length in this process, but that requires stretching out the sides along the $x$-axis. 
Thus a single point where all the arcs meet, is stretched into a line.   </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The equirectangular map has a total area of $(2\pi R)(\pi R)=2\pi^2 R^2$ while the surface area of the sphere is $4\pi R^2$. 
Therefore this projection distorts the area by a factor of $\frac{\pi}{2}\approx1.57$.</p>

<p>A different kind of projection can be obtained by projecting lines from the sphere onto the mapping plane. 
An example is the Lambert cylindrical projection. 
It is made by wrapping a cylinder around the sphere and projecting points onto it via lines parallel to the $x$-axis. 
Here is a visualisation of this construction:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/Cilinderprojectie-constructie.jpg" alt="Lambert cylindrical map construction">
	<figcaption>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cilinderprojectie-constructie.jpg">Wikipedia</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And here is a cross section of the sphere along side the final map:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/Lambert_construction.png" alt="Lambert cylindrical  map">
	<figcaption>Lambert cylindrical  map. Edited from <a href="https://map-projections.net/single-view/lambert">map-projections.net/singleviewp/lambert</a>  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The equations are:</p><p>

\[\begin{align} y &amp;= Rsin(\varphi)\\ x &amp;= R\lambda \end{align}\]

</p><p>For objects near the equator, this results in very little distortion, such as for Africa. But objects near the poles are compressed because of the sphere’s curvature. 
This can be seen clearly with Greenland.</p>

<p>This map has the useful property that its area is equal to the surface area of the sphere. Thus, while objects are distorted, their areas are still correct.
The relative scale of Greenland to Africa is therefore accurately represented in this map.</p>

<h2 id="the-mercator-map">The Mercator map</h2>

<p>In 1569, Gerardus Mercator wanted to make a global world map that would be useful for navigation. 
He lived in a time when sailing across vast ocean distances was the norm. (In 1492, Christopher Columbus had discovered America by sailing all the way from Spain.)
The maps shown above are fine for artistic impressions and applications, but not for navigation.
The distortions prevent doing any accurate distance and bearing measurements on the map. 
At a local level, lines (eg. roads) which in reality intersect perpendicularly to each other, would be appear to be slanted with respect to each other.</p>

<p>In particular, Mercator wanted to make a map where rhumb lines would be straight. Rhumb lines are curves of constant bearing relative to meridians. 
To follow a rhumb line, a navigator only needs to maintain the same bearing on their compass for the whole journey.
For example, here is the rhumb line through modern day New York and Cape Town:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/secant-mercator/NY_to_CPT.png" alt="Arcs from NY to CPT">
	<figcaption>Made with software from <a href="https://imaginary.org/program/rhumb-lines-and-spirals">imaginary.org/program/rhumb-lines-and-spirals</a> and Inkscape </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At each point along the rhumb line, the angle $\theta$ with the meridian is 48.56°, which corresponds to a bearing of 311°26’18’’ from Cape Town to New York. 
I’ve also shown the great circle, which is a circle whose centre lies on the centre of the sphere. 
Travelling along the great circle is always shorter. In this case, the distance is 12550 km instead of 12600 km along the rhumb line.
With modern technology, it is easy for ships and aeroplanes to stick to the great circles. But back in Mercator’s day, this was rather difficult. 
So sailors preferred to stick to rhumb lines. They would rather get to their destination by travelling a little longer, then get lost and travel a lot more.</p>

<p>Mercator’s idea was to stretch out a cylindrical projection map in the North-South direction to preserve shapes and angles.
Looking at the Lambert projection<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, it can be seen that a different stretch factor is required for each latitude. At the equator, no stretch is required.
At the 45° parallel only a small amount of upward stretching is required. The objects close to the poles have to be stretched a lot to uncompress them.</p>

<p>This stretch factor can be calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>

	<figcaption>Construction process for the Mercator map. Edited from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection"> Wikipedia</a> images </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First Mercator divided the globe into graticules of equal spacing $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\lambda$. 
Along the meridians, the arc length of each graticule is $R\delta\varphi$.
Along the parallels, the radius of the circle is …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I've been working as a <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0">Research Software Engineer</a> (RSE) at universities in the UK for many years now, across a variety of fields of research (particle physics, synthetic biology, cardiology, etc.) as both a user of computing services and as a provider of them.
One thing that I've seen cropping up repeatedly is a tendency to want to chase the latest fad.
Now, in academia the latest fad is often up to ten years behind the state-of-the-art so, for example, it's only in the last few years that we've seen "deep learning" cropping up in every grant application.
One of the things I do in my job is try to <a href="https://milliams.com/courses">educate researchers</a> about these technologies so that they know what they're actually asking for and to ensure that if researchers are talking about doing "big data" since they have "megabytes of data" they won't be embarased by a grant reviewer who knows their stuff.</p>
<p>The push in this direction is completely understandable. The grant application business is extremely competitive and anything you can put in your proposal to catch the eye of a reviewer is going to count in your favour.</p>
<p>This is all particularly evident when talking about data.
Research money goes to the problems which are most worthy and there's an assumption that the harder the problem, the more worthy it is.
Furthermore, there's an assumption that the more data one has, the bigger and more difficult the research problem.
This naturally pulls together into an idea that if your problem is a "big data" problem then it's more likely to get funded.
You therefore see grant applications trying to convince reviewers that they're doing "big data" when really they're dealing with linear or spatial datasets of maybe only gigabytes to a terabyte.
That's certainly <em>a lot of</em> data but it often lacks the complexity that requires what one would really consider <em>big</em> data solutions.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not trying to downplay these areas of research.
Instead I'm trying to argue that the problems being solved here are just as worthy of investigation, even without couching it in terms of "big data".
<em>Most</em> research problems I see discussed at Universites are not big data and they are all interesting problems.
I think it would be healthy to reduce the allure of big data and let people know that it's ok to not fall into that category.
Part of the problem is that there's no good name for this scale of data problem: that which is a little too big to realistically do on a single laptop or desktop but well below the size or complexity to require a big data machine or a Hadoop cluster.</p>
<p>I've toyed with many names when trying to teach how to tackle problems of this size: <em>Large Data</em>, <em>Biggish Data</em>, <em>Medium Data</em>.
Until now, none have ever grabbed me so I've decided to coin a new term, <strong>meso-data</strong>.
<em>Meso</em> here means "middle" or "intermediate" cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia#Etymology">Mesopotamia</a> ("between rivers").</p>
<div id="meso-computing">
<h2>Meso-computing</h2>
<p>Along with the problem in the data domain (mostly coming from buzzword-chasing), there's a similar issue in the computing-power domain.
Most research follows a common path of starting with a small investigation on a researcher's laptop until they have too many simulations to run or they are taking longer than the working day and so can't be finished in time.
At this point most research institutes will encourage the use of whatever central computing resources they have, usually a single large HPC cluster.</p>
<p>Research institutes such as Universities face a pressure of trying to justify their expenditure on computing resources by extolling all the big problems they're solving: how many nano-seconds of molecular dynamics they're pushing thorugh or how fine-grained the meteorological grid they can simulate.
This encourages the creation of systems which cater towards those few groups in the university who are able to make really good use of a supercomputer — those who can run large multi-node MPI jobs with optimised code for the specific hardware and who have experts in their team who understand high-performance computing.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it further increases the divide in power and complexity between running on one's laptop and using a central facility.
Similar to with meso-data, there's a large number of researchers — I would argue <em>most</em> researchers — whose needs sit right in the middle.
They're not doing <em>super</em>computing, they're doing <em>meso</em>-computing.</p>
<p>These researchers are best supported with small domain-specific batch clusters, with cloud computing (perhaps using <a href="https://cluster-in-the-cloud.readthedocs.io/">Cluster in the Cloud</a>), with software-as-a-service or with just some hands-on help from an RSE to get their code running more efficiently on their laptop.</p>
<p>Maybe Pandas is sufficient or perhaps they need to use Dask.
Maybe <a href="https://milliams.com/courses/parallel_python">a course</a> on <tt>concurrent.futures</tt> to magically make their code finish in a quarter of the time is the right solution.
Regardless, the solution is probably not to rewrite it in Fortran, using MPI to scale across 64 nodes or to rent a Hadoop cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-middle">
<h2>The middle</h2>
<p>There will be those reading this who think I'm stating the obvious, who think "I've been working in this area for years, what's new?".
That's kind of the point, a lot of researchers sit here but the fact is that they are under-served.
Most aren't computer experts and will use whichever tools are available, advertised to them and are easy to use.
This inevitably means that they email to one another Excel spreadsheets with maybe some R or Python scripts with hard-coded paths.
These researchers are getting stuck as "<a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">Expert Beginners</a>".
People who know their entry-level tools so well the short-term barrier to learning how to use them properly or using a better tool for the job is higher than seems worthwhile.</p>
<p>They want to scale their research but when they look around themselves to see what the University can provide, they're told about getting access to the supercomputer or how if they put their data into an Elasticsearch database things would be better.
That jump is far too big and we need to solve the social problem of allowing them to take only as many steps across the meso-data divide as they need to.
We need well-explained and easy-to-use tools at every stage of the scaling process, not just at the top end.</p>
<p>These terms, <em>meso-computing</em> and <em>meso-data</em>, are deliberately humble.
They are explicitly not about trying to be the biggest but rather about thoughtfully considering the problem at hand and choosing the right hammer.
Unlike with big data, people shouldn't have to ask the question "is this a meso-data problem" because if they're asking the question, the answer is "yes".
I want people to be comfortable saying in grant applications "since this is a meso-data challenge, we request funding for the skills and resources needed to tackle it" and ask for a full-time RSE without having to pretend that they're doing big data or need a dedicated supercomputer.
Labels are helpful and I think that these labels apply well to a good chunk of the research community.</p>
<p>Meso-data comes with its own set of tools and solutions which are partially distinct to big data's.
I haven't invented a whole new area of endeavour, many people have been working on solutions here for decades, but it's certainly not an area that attracts excitement or research money as it should.</p>
<p>These are still hard problems, and in my experience they are solving real-world challenges or furthering our understanding of the universe.
Meso-computing and meso-data projects still need expertise from RSEs or data scientists to make sure that the research is still reliable, reproducible, tested and understandable.</p>

The prototype received some government funding and was designed and built in Auckland in cooperation with <a href="https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/">Callaghan Innovation</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It has received a Royal Society Award nomination, and New Zealand’s second largest electricity distribution company, <a href="http://www.powerco.co.nz/">Powerco</a>, will be the first to test Emrod technology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The company was founded by serial tech entrepreneur Greg Kushnir, who was determined to find a technology that can reduce power distribution costs, avoid outages and support renewable energy.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;“We have an abundance of clean hydro, solar, and wind energy available around the world but there are costly challenges that come with delivering that energy using traditional methods, for example, offshore wind farms or the Cook Strait here in New Zealand requiring underwater cables which are expensive to install and maintain,” said Mr Kushnir.</span></p>
<p><span>“I wanted to come up with a solution to move all that clean energy around from where it’s abundant to where it’s needed in a cost-effective, eco-friendly way.</span></p>
<p><span>“Energy generation and storage methods have progressed tremendously over the last century but energy transmission has remained virtually unchanged since Edison, Siemens, and Westinghouse first introduced electric networks based on copper wires 150 years ago.”</span></p>
<p><span>When Mr Kushnir investigated ways to transmit energy wirelessly over vast distances he was struck by how little has been done in the field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Everyone seems to be fixated on the notion that energy comes to consumers as electricity over copper wires and I knew there had to be a better way,”</span></p>
<p><span>Kushnir approached distinguished NZ scientist Dr Ray Simpkin of Callaghan Innovation who lead a feasibility study and worked on the prototype. Callaghan Innovation backed Emrod with a research and development grant and seconded their lead scientist to work on the game changing prototype.</span></p>
<p><span>By significantly reducing infrastructure costs, Emrod’s technology has the capacity to support remote communities such as in Africa and the Pacific Islands by providing access to cheap, sustainable energy to power schools, hospitals, and economies.</span></p>
<p><span>“The statistics are pretty compelling. We are talking about a potential 50 per cent increase in sustainable energy uptake, up to 85 per cent reduction in outages and up to 65 per cent reduction in electricity infrastructure costs due to the Emrod solution,” said Kushnir.</span></p>
<p><b>Powering our local communities</b></p>
<p><span>The company has achieved strong interest from electricity distributors with </span><a href="https://www.powerco.co.nz/"><span>Powerco</span></a><span>, New Zealand’s second-largest distributor deciding to invest in a proof of concept of the technology.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re committed to innovation, and finding new ways to deliver power safely and efficiently to our customers”, says Powerco’s Network Transformation Manager Nicolas Vessiot.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re interested to see whether Emrod’s technology can complement the established ways we deliver power. We envisage using this to deliver electricity in remote places, or across areas with challenging terrain.”</span></p>
<p><span>“There’s also potential to use it to keep the lights on for our customers when we’re doing maintenance on our existing infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p><span>Emrod will deliver the</span><span> next prototype to Powerco in October </span><span>and will spend two to three months carrying out lab testing and training Powerco personnel before moving to a field trial.</span></p>
<p><span>“The system we are currently building for Powerco will transmit only a few kilowatts but we can use the exact same technology to transmit 100 times more power over much longer distances. Wireless systems using Emrod technology can transmit any amount of power current wired solutions transmit,” said Kushnir.</span></p>
<p><b>Safety is Paramount</b></p>
<p><span>Safety of the prototype is also front of mind for Emrod, who is using a non-ionizing Industrial, Scientific and Medical frequency (ISM) band to transmit power.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The company has been communicating with the regulator Radio Spectrum Management (RSM) continuously from the get go and maintaining the highest safety standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The rigorous process we are undertaking is aimed at proving the technology is safe with higher power levels on a larger scale. It also helps in creating maintenance guidelines for companies like Powerco that will be using our devices,” said Kushnir.</span></p>
<p><span>“We have chosen this widely used and well-regulated frequency because there’s a long history of using it safely around humans and its scientifically proven safety guidelines, which are accepted internationally.</span></p>
<p><span>ENDS</span></p>

<p>DebConf20 was due to take place in Haifa, Israel this year (<a href="https://debian.community/debconf20-palestine-messages-censored-debian-project/">a separate controversy about Debian censoring Palestine</a>) but it was moved online due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Therefore, what happens to all the sponsorship money collected in 2020?  Let's look at how Debian parks money in Switzerland.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, Debian paid somebody to work on DebConf fundraising <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/alums/">as an Outreachy</a>, generating a lot of gossip that is unfair to the woman concerned.  Naturally, as in any business, fundraising salaries and other costs of acquiring sponsors are the first things that will be deducted from the budget.  We share the view of those who feel she was underpaid: the woman is a highly experienced event organizer.  Debian paid a total of $6,000 for her services, $2,000 per month.  $500 was deducted by Outreachy administrator, Sage Sharp.  This is also controversial, as Sage Sharp does the same work that Debian's GSoC Administrators do, Sage Sharp receives a cut of the money but the Debian GSoC Administrators don't receive anything.  If the woman was employed at an event management company in Israel, she would have received more than $6,000 <em>every</em> month, overtime pay, illness and accident insurance, pension, maternity rights and a performance bonus.  Many non-profit organizations give their fundraising staff at least 10% of all revenues as salary and bonus.  With her experience, the woman in question would easily get that salary package in any other industry.</p>

<p>After deducting the $5,500 Outreachy salary and $500 Sage Sharp fees, what does Debian do with the rest of the money <a href="https://debconf20.debconf.org/sponsors/">from these sponsors</a>?  As we are online in 2020, there are no venue expenses, no travel and accommodation expenses.  We estimate that DebConf has received over $100,000 from these companies and nobody knows where it will go.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Item</th><th>Increase</th><th>Decrease</th></tr>
<tr><td>Sponsor donations</td><td>$100,000</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Fundraising cost (Outreachy employee)</td><td></td><td>$6,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>DebConf20 online surplus</td><td>$94,000</td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<em>(Not actual figures, estimated from previous DebConfs)</em>

<p>Will this money be used to pay all the volunteers for the next DebConfs?  Or will it be used for other Debian purposes?</p>

<p>Let's have a look at DebConf13 to find the answer.</p>

<img width="40%" alt="Debian hiding money Switzerland" src="https://debian.community/assets/debconf13-logo.png">
<p>DebConf13 organizers had organized the venue and catering contracts separately.  Neither the venue hire or catering contract included provision for washing the dishes.  At the last minute, DebConf organizers had to reach out to local labor-hire companies to find temporary workers and <a href="https://debian.community/assets/2013-07-08-urgent-dishwashing-proposal.pdf">they received a proposal for the work</a>.  Nonetheless, they didn't want to pay people.  As usual, various people suggested they should try to conscript volunteers to do this tedious work:</p>

<blockquote><em>
Subject: Re: [Debconf-team] Urgent: Dishwashing &amp; Cleaning<br>

From: Tiago Bortoletto Vaz &lt;tiago@debian.org&gt;<br>
To: debconf-team@lists.debconf.org<p>

On Mon, Jul 08, 2013 at 07:57:07PM +0200, Holger Levsen wrote:<br>
&gt; seriously, buy two dishwashing machines (max 1000€ total) and let them be<br>
&gt; filled by volunteers... 5k for dishwashing is like 3% of our total budget.<br>

I'd join a team to coordinate volunteers on this.</p></em></blockquote>

<p>Volunteers don't come to DebConf to wash dishes, they want to relax after dinner, meet people, attend any evening seminars and learn new things.</p>

<img width="30%" alt="debian women, diversity, washing dishes, debconf, outreachy, intern, woman" src="https://debian.community/assets/debconf13-women-washing-dishes.jpg">
<p>Nonetheless, organizers proceeded to seek volunteers for this task.  We notice that female participation in dishwashing was close to thirty percent, much higher than the <a href="https://debian.community/laura-arjona-reina-carnival-mafia-murders/">two percent rate of female participation in development</a>.  Is that a win for diversity?</p>

<p>While discussion about expenditures and volunteers took place on the public <em>debconf-team</em> list, discussions about profit from fundraising were kept on <em>debian-private</em> (<a href="https://debian.community/debian-private-leaked/">leaked elsewhere</a>).  Local volunteers, who do most of the work in each DebConf destination, were subscribed to <em>debconf-team</em> but they never have access to <em>debian-private</em> so they didn't see the following email:</p>

<blockquote><em>Subject: Call for ideas -- useful ways of spending Debian money<br>
Date: Tue, 1 Oct 2013 21:46:17 +0200<br>
From: Lucas Nussbaum &lt;leader@debian.org&gt;<br>
To: debian-private@lists.debian.org<br>
CC: auditor@debian.org, philipp@hug.cx<p>

[ TL;DR: <b>ETOO_MUCH_MONEY</b> -- need ideas to flush queue ]</p><p>

Hi,</p><p>

Thanks to the fantastic work of the DebConf13 sponsorship (fundraising)<br>
team, DebConf13 generated a surplus. The current estimate of it is <b>CHF 38k</b> (that's <b>USD 42k</b>, or <b>EUR 31k</b>). That's excellent news.</p><p>

The not-so-excellent news is that it means that the debconf13<br>
association will have to pay income taxes for it. (no estimate yet;<br>
Philipp Hug (DC13 and debian.ch treasurer) will get in touch with a tax<br>
expert).</p><p>

Even if Switzerland has been very welcoming towards Debian, it would not<br>
be a bad idea to try to avoid paying too much taxes. A good way to do<br>
that is to spend some of the surplus (in ways useful to Debian, of<br>
course).</p><p>

Could you start thinking of useful ways to spend some money? servers?<br>
porter boxes? buildds? sprints? Of course, it would need to be spent before<br>
the end of 2013. There are no known restrictions on what we can buy or<br>
where we can ship. What we end up buying will of course be made public<br>
as usual. To move forward, please reply to this mail, providing an<br>
estimate and a justification. Or mail leader@ + auditor@ if you prefer.</p><p>


Somehow related: we are participating in GNOME's Outreach Program for<br>
Women, winter edition[1].</p><p>

As already stated in April[2], I wouldn't favor a situation where Debian<br>
funds are used to pay OPW participation on a regular basis. However, as<br>
an experiment, it makes sense to help that happen for the first time (it<br>
didn't happen in the summer edition).</p><p>

So, if the fundraising effort currently being set up fails to raise<br>
enough money for one stipend, but still raises a significant amount of<br>
money, I will authorize the use of Debian money for the difference<br>
(likely for at most $2900 -- that's half the stipend, so the other half<br>
needs to come from fundraising).</p><p>

[2] https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/04/msg00108.html</p><p>


Q: Why is this on -private@?<br>
A: Because I'm not sure yet how cautious we need to be about the DC13<br>
   surplus situation. Better safe than sorry. We can restart the<br>
   discussion on a public list when/if things are cleared.<br>
 Thanks,</p><p>

Lucas</p></em></blockquote>

<p>Let us amend that final answer:</p>

<blockquote><em>Q: Why is this on -private@?<br>
A: because we didn't mention this money in the thread about washing dishes<br>
</em></blockquote>

<p>Despite Nussbaum's intention to spend the money, it remains in a Swiss bank account with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostFinance">PostFinance</a>.</p>

<img width="30%" alt="Miriam Ballhausen, Bird &amp; Bird, Women in Business Law Awards 2020 Finalist" src="https://debian.community/assets/twobirds-bird-bird-miriam-ballhausen-women-business-law-award-finalist-2020.jpg">
<p>Where does all the money go?  Well, we know that some of it goes to lawyers.  After a volunteer's father died, Debian was the only organization to send him insults through a lawyer.  We've been told Miriam Ballhausen at Bird &amp; Bird charges EUR 300 per hour for her services, which now includes writing emails and letters on behalf of the Debian project.  The Debian Project doesn't exist as a legal entity, Ballhausen has so far refused to reveal who is actually instructing her.</p>

<p>If that rate is correct, the EUR 31,000 profit from DebConf13 would pay for 100 hours or two weeks of full-time lawyer work.  We doubt that we will see Frau Ballhausen assisting with the dishes.</p>

<p>We would have thought that the legal profession may have some minimum standards, expecting lawyers to respect volunteers at a time of grief and expecting them to be able to identify who they work for.  Not in Germany.  Ballhausen's antics with Debian have seen her <a href="https://awards.womeninbusinesslaw.com/Europe-shortlist?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wibl-eu&amp;utm_content=twittershare#Rising-stars">nominated for the Women in Business Law Awards 2020</a>.</p>

<img alt="Miriam Ballhausen, insults, harassment, abuse, volunteer, GDPR" src="https://debian.community/assets/bird-bird-miriam-ballhausen-gdpr-abuse-debian.png">

<p>The next DebConf for 2021 was supposed to go to Prishtina, Kosovo.  It has been suggested it will be pushed back one year to 2022 but given the pandemic situation, that is not a definite decision.  There are currently no Debian Developers in Kosovo who have access to the financial information in <em>debian-private</em>, we hope that Debian will be as generous in paying the Kosovo local team as they have been with lawyers but we are doubtful.</p>

<p>I’ve heard ham radio is dying since as far back as I can remember. It’s one of those common sayings you always hear. Like, “get off my lawn,” and “kids these days.” But is it true? Is there any evidence to support this? Let’s take a closer look.</p>



<h2>Ham radio licensees are increasing</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png" alt="" width="733" height="447" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0.png 900w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-300x183.png 300w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-768x469.png 768w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/85F2F076-403E-44C1-8418-1D54A6FB8EB0-850x519.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px"></figure>



<p>Data from the ARRL shows that ham radio licensees are increasing. When you look at the chart above, you see two significant markers that are likely driving this growth. </p>



<ul><li>The removal of the code requirement by the FCC.</li><li>The economic collapse of 2008.</li></ul>



<p>The Morse code requirement was always an intimidating part of obtaining your General FCC license. Learning Morse code is like learning a second language. It takes time and effort to learn, and that’s not a bad thing. However, it doesn’t change that it scared many people away from the hobby. When the FCC removed this requirement in 2007, I believe it opened the door for many who spent years on the fence. Then you have the economic downturn of 2008. What does that have to do with ham radio? A lot.</p>



<p>After the economic downturn, the United States watched as survivalism, now commonly calling “prepping,” entered mainstream culture. People were worried as the country was involved in multiple wars and our economy was on the brink of collapse. Citizens stocked up on food storage, water, firearms, and…<em>communications equipment</em>. As our country spiraled into more turmoil ham radio licenses steadily increased to more than 750,000 by the end of 2019. </p>



<h2>Is ham radio a hobby or a public service?</h2>



<p><strong>The debate between ham radio being a public service or just a hobby is a common argument</strong>. The reason we exist is to ultimately have a trained citizenry that can response to natural disasters. This will always be a thread in our hobby, but this thread is merging more and more with digital functions, including the Internet. That’s where some people get grumpy.</p>



<h3>FT8/JS8Call</h3>



<p><a href="https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FT8/JS8Call</a> has drew the ire from older operators who don’t see it as “real ham radio.” Though the technology could have huge implications for passing traffic when conditions are rough in remote parts of the world.</p>



<h3>Digital Mobile Radio (DMR)</h3>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Mobile Radio</a> has exploded in growth in the past decade. Many amateur radio operators use <a href="http://k0lwc.com/what-is-the-range-of-a-dmr-hotspot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet-connected hotspots</a> to operate from their shack without tying up local repeaters. These Internet-connected repeaters hold value, the biggest is the ability to have two different time slots carrying voice traffic simultaneously on one repeater, whether they have an Internet connection or not. DMR doesn’t need to have an Internet backbone to be a game-changer for emergency communications.</p>



<p>Ham radio will always be a hobby where those engaged are practicing to help if the need ever arises, whether they participate in public service events with local clubs or not. And younger operators are redefining how it’s done with new digital technologies — and that’s a great thing!</p>



<h2>Millennials are not killing ham radio… they’re the future</h2>



<p>Some ham radio operators believe younger hams are “killing” the hobby. These often dismissive and vile opinions are not great for the future of amateur radio. Integrating new technology like VOIP and microcomputers into amateur radio is what it’s all about—using the resources available to communicate and exchange information with others around the world. Who cares how we get it done?</p>



<h3>Getting young kids involved in ham radio</h3>



<p>We must get children interested in the hobby. Today, kids aren’t impressed with the ability to talk around with the world on 100 watts and a wire. They’re just not. How do we get young people interested in the digital age where they can communicate anywhere in the world with a tap of a button? The ARRL hasn’t done a great job in attracting young people — but there are things we can do!</p>



<h3>Capitalize on the next generation of space exploration</h3>



<p>The United States is embarking on the next generation of space exploration. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are making space and engineering cool again, and ham radio could easily ride that wave. Focus on targeting kids interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and educate them on AMSAT and the potential to communicate with the International Space Station (ISS). Using space exploration as a drive for getting a ham license would be a fantastic entry point for space geeks everywhere.</p>



<h3>Use remote HF and SWL stations to spark interest</h3>



<p>For young ham radio operators who already have their license, look no further than <a href="https://www.remotehamradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remote Ham Radio</a> as a shining example of how to get kids interested in upgrading their license. <a href="https://www.remotehamradio.com/youth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They offer a program where kids can win free time</a> using world-class remote DX contest stations. The young hams have to meet the following criteria:</p>



<ul><li>Be 25 years old or younger</li><li>Hold a General class or higher license</li><li>Be a member of the ARRL</li><li>Have an interest or experience in DXing/Contesting</li><li>Tell us why RHR would be a good fit for you</li></ul>



<p>Kudos to Remote Ham Radio for offering this program to young hams!</p>



<h3>POTA/SOTA combines ham radio and outdoor adventure</h3>



<p>Living in Colorado, I grew fond of Summits On The Air (SOTA) rather quickly. I mean, it’s cool. You can exercise while playing ham radio all at the same time. We should be focusing on how we can use these outdoor portable operations to attract young hams who love the outdoors. For the extreme outdoor enthusiasts, it would be wise to focus on the usefulness of being able to communicate from the wilderness where cell phone signals are non-existent.</p>



<p><strong>Ham radio has evolved</strong>, albeit slowly compared to other technology sectors. That evolution is inevitable. We can’t fight it. We shouldn’t fight it. We need to find ways to encourage new exploration of communication methodology. That all starts with younger ham radio operators bringing new ideas and skills to our hobby.</p>



<p>Let’s not fight it. Let’s embrace it.</p>

                    <p>A few thoughts about my experiences switching from Mac to a ThinkPad with Linux the past year. For context, I'm the founder and maker of <a href="https://wobaka.com/">Wobaka.com</a> and <a href="https://bootstrap.email/">Bootstrap.email</a>. I work with front/backend development, design, marketing and sales every day. I code primarily in Clojure + ClojureScript but I also do some JavaScript, Ruby/Rails, Python and Bash on a regular basis.</p><p>I wrote this post for my past and future self.

<p>Two months ago, I self-published a book called <a href="https://zerotosoldbook.com/">Zero to Sold: How to Start, Run, and Sell a Bootstrapped Business</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1277573850297966592">released it on Twitter</a>. Within twenty-four hours, I sold 350 copies. Within another twenty-four hours, the book was #1 on Product Hunt and already a category bestseller on Amazon. After a week, 1000 copies had been sold, with sales still going strong and the book ranking as #1 New Release in the “Startups” and “Small Business” Amazon categories. How did this happen?</p>

<h2>The Void</h2>



<p>It started with a blog post that I never published. In 2018, I was so fully immersed in working on <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/from-founding-to-exit-in-two-years-the-feedbackpanda-story/">FeedbackPanda, a teacher productivity SaaS</a> that I co-founded with my partner <a href="https://twitter.com/SimpsonDaniK">Danielle</a>, that I didn’t have much time or energy to write. Every day was filled with customer conversations and product work, with barely any space to reflect on what we had learned. I used the few moments of clarity to jot down notes in a text document, hoping that I’d find some time to polish them into an article. But it never got anywhere near being ready to be published.</p>



<p>And then, we <a href="https://www.sureswiftcapital.com/blog/bootstrapped-saas-founders-sell-business/">chose to sell the business</a>. After a few months of due diligence and transitioning the business over to the new owners, I finally had all the time I ever wanted. My life turned from running a business at full speed into idling my thumbs. When you build an exceptionally sellable company, you focus on making yourself replaceable. Little did I know that once I was replaced, I didn’t have a purpose anymore. So I threw myself right into my next project: documenting what we did and sharing what we had learned. Leading up to building FeedbackPanda, I had consumed a lot of content that successful founders had shared with the community. I wanted to do the exact same thing now: give back to other bootstrapped founders and indie hackers.</p>



<p>Since I hadn’t yet decided on a medium through which I would share my insights, I started collecting content ideas by taking notes whenever I thought of a particular theme. I knew that I would want to release articles on many subjects on a platform, so I planned them out as blog posts from the start. I started working on this list in August of 2019.</p>



<p>Initially, all those ideas revolved around coping with stress and anxiety on some level. That had been the emotional state in which I had found myself in towards the end of running FeedbackPanda. The first series of blog posts I wanted to write was called <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/emotional-journey/">The Emotional Journey of a Bootstrapped Founder</a>.</p>



<p>In a Notion document, I created a table of all my blog post title ideas. Quickly, after I had exhausted all my anxiety-related topics, I pivoted into other areas of running a SaaS business as well. Within a couple days, I had aggregated somewhere between forty and fifty blog post ideas. At that point, I understood for the first time that this might be my next big project.</p>

<p>Whenever I felt like it, I would click on each blog post title idea and jot down a few thoughts on what I’d write about in the article. I would add links to interesting essays, research papers, even photos of little sketches I made on paper.</p>

<p>Several blog posts took shape over the weeks, and I decided to turn this project into reality. I polished those articles following <a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro">Julian Shapiro’s recommendations</a>. I ended up with ten or so pieces to start the blog with.</p>



<h2>The Blog</h2>



<p>Here’s an open secret about me: I’m incredibly lazy. If I can avoid tedious work, I’ll spend a lot of time to make sure I never have to do it again. While this really helped us build a well-documented and highly automated business, it is a drawback for a content creator. Writing well and regularly takes a lot of discipline. I knew that I needed some structure in place to hold myself accountable beyond the articles I had already written.</p>



<p>To make sure that this project wouldn’t just evaporate, I decided to commit to building a blog by publishing one article every week, for at least two years. But how could I force myself to write every week? Looking at the content that I regularly consume, I figured that releasing a newsletter every week would keep me accountable for writing something meaningful regularly.</p>



<p>When I built The Bootstrapped Founder blog, I immediately set it up to host the Bootstrapped Founder Newsletter. I released the first episode of that within days of making the blog public. <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1194647611988480000">I announced the launch on Twitter</a>, and got just a few likes. Not surprising.  I had a fledgling audience of maybe 500 followers on Twitter, and I made sure to share my content as much as I could within those first few weeks, including <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/the-bootstrapped-founder/launched-the-bootstrapped-founder-blog--LtZG5nAqrB8ucRj5F-v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the IndieHackers product page</a> I had created for the blog.</p>

<p>My Twitter strategy was simple: just be myself. I love reading the stories of other founders, no matter if they are succeeding or struggling. Amplifying those voices, retweeting their milestones, and commenting when they asked for help was something I consciously did every day. Within weeks, my audience grew, apparently both intrigued by my blog posts, levels of activity, and engagement with the community.</p>



<p>That gave me the fuel to write more and more. There were weeks where I’d work on three to five blog posts at the same time, driven by the discussions I had on Twitter. More and more topics and themes emerged through this work. The list of forty blog post title ideas turned into a list of hundreds of topics, all in different stages of being worked on.</p>



<p>Throughout all of this, people started asking to consume my content on another medium: they wondered if I would ever start a podcast. As a German who learned speaking English mostly from watching Al Bundy on Married with Children and raid-leading large groups of gamers in World of Warcraft back in 2008, I hesitated to put myself out there in an audio-only format. But I quickly understood that this would result in many exciting opportunities: I could diversify my userbase to include those who had no time to read, those who didn’t like reading, it would be another channel to market whatever I would end up selling in the future, and it would allow my readers to put a voice to the thoughts. I would just read the article aloud as the first half of each show. Then, I could add some unscripted content to each episode to make it attractive for those who already read what I had written. Since I wanted the material between the podcast and the blog to be synchronized, I spent a few weeks recording a show or two every day to catch up.</p>



<h2>The Guide</h2>



<p>While I was on this journey through my back catalog, I noticed a fascinating thing. All those blog posts titles I had written when random thoughts had occurred to me seemed to fit into a structure. A larger entity started to take shape. After a few hours of shuffling titles around in a Notion document, I had found that I was well on my way to write a fully-fledged guide on bootstrapping. Without knowing or intending for it to happen, here it was, everything I knew about the journey from idea to acquisition.</p>



<p>I had written maybe 30% of the actual articles I wanted to have in that guide. I decided to go at it for the rest of them the only way I know as a software engineer and bootstrapper: sketch out a foundation and then iterate slowly and deliberately. For the guide (that at that point was called “The Bootstrapped Founder Guide to Bootstrapping,”) that meant that it would start with a compendium. I outlined it by sorting the blog posts I had already written into a structure and putting only headlines in the gaps. Then, over a few days, I filled out those gaps with two to three paragraphs each. I condensed the most important points I would want to make in those yet-to-be-written articles into a few sentences.</p>



<p>And then, I <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1222896794893336578">immediately released the compendium</a> on the 30th of January of 2020, two months after I had started writing on the blog. A few days prior, a Twitter follower had suggested the name “From Zero to Sold,” which I really liked. I shortened it to “Zero to Sold,” and featured the compendium prominently on my website and social media profiles.</p>

<p>From there on, I continued to write an article every week, shared it with my growing newsletter audience, read it on the podcast, and integrated it into the compendium. When I had written around half of the number of articles I wanted to write, someone on Twitter asked me if they could get the compendium as a PDF. They said they’d even pay $10 for it. That really made me think. And when I think, I tweet. Lots of people replied that they’d love to see the compendium fleshed out as a full book.</p>



<p>Suppose you’ve looked into Zero to Sold or have checked out the compendium. In that case, you will know that I recommend an Audience-Problem-Solution-Product approach. Start with a group of people you want to help, find their critical problems, envision a solution that fits their workflow, and build a product in the medium they wish to use. And here was a group of founders and indie hackers (an audience I love), telling me that they need guidance on building their business (a critical problem commonly shared), asking for a full-journey guide (a clear solution to the problem), as a book (as a medium of product consumption). This could not be more validated if I wanted to.</p>



<p>So I sat down to write the rest of the book.</p>



<h2>The Manuscript</h2>



<p>Let me share a few details on how that exactly happened. The first few blog posts were written in Notion, which really didn’t lend itself to long-form writing. I quickly migrated those texts over into individual markdown files, which I …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re interested in a <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/why-you-should-try-graphql/">writeup about GraphQL itself head on over here</a>. In this piece, we’ll take a look at some of the many handy GraphQL tools that make using it even more worthwhile. Bear in mind there’s quite a few of them so we’re not going to get through the lot of them in one go.</p>
<h2>Prisma</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, working with GraphQL will require you to set up a database. Well, there’s also BaaS so you can outsource it, but what if you don’t want to? This is where Prisma comes in, it’s a clever middle ground between doing it yourself and outsourcing.
<strong>Prisma is an ORM library</strong> that lets you interact with the database from the server in the language you choose. So if you want to write to your MySQL database you don’t have to do it in SQL, Prima lets you do it in Python, JavaScript or some other language you prefer. </p>
<p>You might think: <em>“Yeah, but that’s just what a regular ORM library does”</em>. True, but Prisma comes with a few added functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>database agnostic: Prisma currently supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and AWS Aurora, with more to come soon,</li>
<li>supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Flow, and Go,</li>
<li>provides premade basic CRUD queries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relay</h2>
<p><strong>Relay is a JavaScript framework</strong> created by Facebook for fetching and managing GraphQL data. Relay is supposed to be the go-to tool for GraphQL users with a focus on validating and optimizing your code. Another focal point is being a <strong>bridge between GraphQL and React</strong>. Relay lets you set up your data requirements using GraphQL and then it will handle the fetching, collecting queries into network requests to get you exactly what you wanted.</p>
<p>Relay is composed of three main loosely coupled modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relay Compiler: a GraphQL compiler that analyzes, validates, and optimizes GraphQL in your code.</li>
<li>Relay Runtime: a full-featured GraphQL runtime for building higher level client APIs</li>
<li>Relay/React: a product API that integrates Relay Runtime with React</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apollo</h2>
<p><strong>The APOLLO platform</strong> is an implementation of GraphQL that transfers data from the server to your UI. <strong>Apollo-client</strong> is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that lets you manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. The aim is to enable you to build UI components that fetch data via GraphQL. <strong>Apollo-server</strong> is a quick way for building an API for GraphQL using data from any source by using a spec-compliant server that can be queried from any GraphQL client, including the Apollo-client. </p>
<p>Let’s look at the Apollo-client features:</p>
<ul>
<li>a declarative approach to data fetching, all the logic for retrieving data, tracking, loading and uploading it to the UI is contained in a single query,</li>
<li>designed for modern React, the Apollo client takes advantage of the latest React features such as hooks,</li>
<li>adaptable, can be dropped into any JavaScript app seamlessly,</li>
<li>universally compatible, can be used with any GraphQL API.</li>
</ul>

<h2>URQL</h2>
<p><strong>urql is a versatile and highly adaptable GraphQL client</strong> by Formidable labs. It uses React hooks and components and intends to be a lighter client than the others. A versatile tool that you can <strong>customize to fit your needs</strong> and fine-tune as you get further along working with GraphQL. </p>
<p>The aim is hitting a middle ground, keeping it somewhat simple while also being able to handle complex assignments by:</p>
<ul>
<li>performance and functionality, significantly lighter than other clients,</li>
<li>customization, the client provides a few default Exchanges, easily customizable code that handles interactions with the API, app or framework,</li>
<li>instantly ready to use, urql is basically ready for work right off the bat and does not require extensive configuration like some other clients,</li>
<li>named after an iconic sitcom character.</li>
</ul>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>All networking applications essentially boil down to stringing together
multiple asynchronous calls in the <em>right</em> way.
Traditionally for programs written in C this would be done through
registering callbacks where the callee either handles the event itself
or dispatches through a state machine.
In such implementations however reasoning about memory safety
can be treacherous, with it sometimes requiring full-program knowledge.
Futures, or promises, as they are also referred to,
ease in that regard by allowing asynchronous programs
to be written in direct style, keeping the control flow linear.</p>

<p>All things considered, I do think that futures can be a good fit
for C programming under the right circumstances.
I also hope this article can serve to help one understand Rust futures,
by being a separate reference that only touches the fundamentals.</p>

<p>The Rust futures story is especially interesting because it is
fundamentally different from the usual workings of futures
in functional languages or, say, JavaScript.
Whereas other implementations are <em>push</em>-based -
meaning you give a function to be pushed to with
the resolved result of the future -
Rust futures are <em>poll</em>-based.
Let us see how this looks in C with the simplification
that we limit ourselves to a single task,
i.e. one top-level future running on one thread.
This is common in embedded programming, and still <em>fairly</em> manageable
without the security guarantees given by Rust.
<a href="https://libuv.org/">libuv</a> is used for the event loop.
No heap allocations will be required - it is all downhill from here
(Get it? Because the stack grows down.) -
other than those imposed by the libuv interface.</p>

<p>The main <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html"><code>std::future::Future</code></a> trait
translated into C as a virtual method table becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>{</span> <span>POLL_PENDING</span><span>,</span> <span>POLL_READY</span> <span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>poll</span><span>)(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>);</span>

	<span>// For now let's skip this method</span>
	<span>// void (*drop)(struct Future *self, struct Context *ctx);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As an example, let us consider the simplest case:
A future that immediately resolves with the number <code>4</code>,</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Poll</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>*</span><span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>self</span><span>;</span>
	<span>self</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>SimpleFuture</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>future</span><span>;</span>
	<span>int</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>simpleFuture</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>future</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>.</span><span>poll</span> <span>=</span> <span>simpleFuturePoll</span><span>,</span> <span>}</span> <span>};</span>

<span>// ... and in the event loop</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>simpleFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>);</span> <span>// =&gt; POLL_READY</span>
<span>// Here we can now use the result</span>
<span>simpleFuture</span><span>.</span><span>result</span> <span>// =&gt; 4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To <em>attempt</em> to resolve the future, we poll it;
it returns <code>POLL_READY</code> and as such we are done.
And for futures that instead return <code>POLL_PENDING</code> when polled,
we just make sure to poll them again later -
futures are lazy and do not make progress unless actively told to do so.
No one knows better than the future itself when it should
be polled again - <em>awoken</em> -
so the context given to all futures allows them to awake their own task.
With many parallel tasks the additional complexity would make itself apparent here,
but in our case something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>struct</span> <span>Future</span> <span>*</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>;</span>
	<span>uv_loop_t</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>wakeTask</span><span>(</span><span>struct</span> <span>Context</span> <span>*</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>poll</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>mainFuture</span><span>,</span> <span>ctx</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>POLL_READY</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>);</span> <span>// Finished!</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>will suffice.
Polling the future once at startup will then kick off the machinery.</p>

<p>For a libuv timer future, we would want to write something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>TimerStatus</span> <span>{</span> <span>TIMER_NOT_STARTED</span><span>,</span> <span>TIMER_WAITING</span><span>,</span> <span>TIMER_FINISHED</span> <span>};</span>

<p>The timer handle is made to hold a reference to the future in
its user data field,
so that the callback knows which future to toggle the status on.
However this requires the future object to be pinned in memory,
moving it would make the reference dangling.
Rust deals with this unsafety using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/index.html">Pin construct</a>,
that wraps a pointer type, <code>P</code>,
and only permits operations that cannot move the pointee
(for cases where it may not always be safe to do so, i.e. <code>P: !Unpin</code>)
and ensures its memory remains valid until it gets dropped,
or helps make manually vetted code <em>nonleaky</em>.
In C there is no such thing;
the closest you will get is with a red paragraph buried in the documentation.
This means treading with care,
allocating storage for the main future once and never copying it, and
only referring to futures with pointers to their static place in memory.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to get by with just one global <code>uv_timer_t</code>
by recognizing that whenever the main future is awoken either:
(I) A timer, necessarily the one with smallest timeout, fired;
or (II) All timers need be dropped and reset, since the futures form a tree,
as we will see.</p>

<h2 id="after-you">After you</h2>

<p>Running multiple futures sequentially is just a matter of
constructing a new future that polls each future to completion,
one after the other.
The poll method of the outer future will have to return <code>POLL_PENDING</code>
after each intermediate step,
before continuing where it left off - like a coroutine.
Rust turns each future into a state machine,
and doing the same in C means playing the part of the Rust compiler.
An adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">Duff’s device</a>,
as <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">described by Simon Tatham</a>,
can help cut down on the boilerplate.
The idea is that with a <code>switch</code> statement enveloping the whole function-body,
you can yield by creating a unique label using the <code>__LINE__</code> macro
where execution will begin upon reentry,
setting the switch-expression as such, and returning.
The following macros do just that</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>Coroutine</span><span>;</span>

<span>#define COR_START(s) switch (*(s)) { case 0:;
#define COR_YIELD(s, r) do {*(s) = __LINE__; return (r); case __LINE__:;} while(0)
#define COR_END }
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>where <code>s</code> is a pointer to the coroutine state.
Great care has to be taken because when returning all locals are invalidated -
if only there was a language that could statically check for such mistakes.
Awaiting then becomes</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#define AWAIT(s, ctx, fut) while ((fut)-&gt;poll((fut), (ctx)) == POLL_PENDING) \
	COR_YIELD((s), POLL_PENDING)
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>that is, yielding until the given future is resolved.</p>

<p>To illustrate, here is a future that prints four times to standard output,
first thrice at one second intervals, and then again after two more seconds:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>TestFuture</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Note that the local <code>i</code> had to be spilled to the future struct
in order to persist across yield points,
and that unions are used to show what variables are active at each step,
and squeeze out that last driblet of performance even in the face of
uncompromising undefined behaviour threats from all directions.</p>

<h2 id="off-to-the-races">Off to the races</h2>

<p>In a similar vein, multiple futures can be made to run in parallel
using a future combinator whose poll method polls all of its children
and either waits for all to complete - <em>joins</em> them,
or selects the first to become ready.
The latter is a tad more difficult, so let us focus on that.
The reason is that after the first future has resolved,
the rest may still be running, their memory possibly referenced elsewhere.
This is where the <code>drop()</code> method that we have skimmed over comes in.
Dropping a pinned object should relax the constraint
that its memory remains valid.
The drop implementation of <code>TimerFuture</code> above could for example
call <code>uv_timer_stop()</code> so the callback never fires
or overwrite the dangling reference to the future with <code>NULL</code>.
For other types, since their drop implementations are …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Selling software to the enterprise is hard, rewarding, and nothing like this movie.</p>

<p>The enterprise SaaS industry is booming. Much has been written about how to scale B2C tech, as consumer technology companies such as Google, Facebook, or Netflix enjoy near-monopolies, employ hordes of people, and command appropriately dominant mindshare. A relative lack of material has been written about building enterprise software, particularly from a product &amp; engineering point of view.</p>

<p>In this post series we’ll describe techniques on building an easily sellable SaaS product. To set the stage, we’ll define “enterprise buyers” as companies that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employ 500+ people</li>
  <li>Are prepared to pay around $100,000 or (much) more for strategic products</li>
  <li>Regularly make long-term, multi-year software buying commitments</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enterprise-sales-is-like-marriage">Enterprise Sales is Like Marriage</h2>

<p>SaaS covers a wide spectrum of businesses: from enterprise products that cost tens of millions of dollars over multiple years, to freemium products that start at $10/month. The strategies that help you sell one will not (typically) work for the other. The process of settling on the former product is like getting married: months to years building the relationship, multiple suitors, and meetings with the parents, all with the intention of making a decades long commitment. Buying a $150/year utility SaaS, by comparison, is like a Tinder date that ends with getting busy in the back of a Prius.</p>

<p>Once you see the similarities between enterprise buying and marriage, many dimensions of how to sell high-value SaaS become more clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Like a marriage, it’s important to have integrity. Don’t oversell – put your best foot forward (brush your teeth before the first date!) but have integrity in how you sell yourself (don’t lie about your job, your height, or where you went to school).</li>
  <li>You need to offer something differentiated. Nobody wants to settle – you need to be the best catch in at least one, and preferably multiple important dimensions.</li>
  <li>There are a lot of stakeholders. “Meeting the parents” is a key step in serious dating; meeting your buyer’s Procurement and Infosec teams can be a (disturbingly) similar experience.</li>
  <li>You need to be the right partners for each other. Enterprise sales relies upon product/<strong>customer</strong> fit – you should solve a need for your buyer, and you should be able to actually deliver. A common example: over-selling to a Fortune 500 company as a 40-person company, when you don’t have the stability, maturity, or headcount to deliver the service that they expect. Maybe you all are just meeting at the wrong moment in your lives.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I began my career I didn’t understand this dynamic at all. I imagined that enterprise sales was like trying to meet someone at a bar: look as hot as possible, go to a few steak dinners, dance poorly and hope for the best. Superficial stuff. In reality, building a product that can sell to big-company buyers requires scoring well across a broad constellation of factors: the equivalents of getting a good education, having a steady job, and demonstrating that you know how to clean your apartment. Enterprise buyers expect to be courted, and as a builder you have the tools to put your best foot forward.</p>

<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-an-enterprise-sale">The Anatomy of an Enterprise Sale</h2>

<p>These posts on how to sell to the enterprise are rooted in the core drivers that impact huge software purchases. Understanding these drivers as a product builder can help you navigate the arcane “dating” process behind closing your first (or next) enterprise logo:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spending millions of dollars on a software solution is necessarily a complex process due to the sheer amount of “stuff” going on at a large company.</li>
  <li>Enterprise software deployments have a complex web of stakeholders. The buyer of enterprise software is often different from the user, as software is (often) bought by executives but used by their teams. Decisions on which vendors to use can take on a political dimension, as they can make or break careers.</li>
  <li>Change is <em>extremely</em> expensive to enterprise buyers because they’re massive and built for momentum over agility. Like a battleship, they can carry a lot of people very far but are a pain to turn. Enterprise companies value stability, and they want to commit upfront to a long-term partner.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this series, we’ll discuss strategies for building a product that will sell to the enterprise, and that will keep them happy for years. Following posts will break down strategies we’ve found helpful, and hopefully provide some ideas as you develop your own products.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Building a product that can sell to the enterprise is difficult but rewarding.</li>
  <li>Enterprise sales is like dating with intent to marry, with many of the same dynamics.</li>
  <li>Enterprise buyers’ decision-making is influenced by several important drivers: the complexity of enterprise businesses, complicated webs of stakeholders, and the need to plan on long time horizons.</li>
</ul>

    <small>Published on 28. August 2020</small>
    <p>You can find a lot of articles about how to prevent deadlocks in Go, but most of them focus on concurrency patterns and synchronization tools like mutexes. While it is important to know some techniques to prevent them, a trap you can stumble across more easily without noticing, are database transaction deadlocks.</p><p>A transaction deadlock can occur when you start one or more transactions and run queries outside of transactions while they are still active. If you run too many transactions and queries at the same time, you might run out of database connections in the connection pool. Here is a simple example of that:</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">// We will ignore errors for this example,
// you should always check them of course.

tx, _ := db.Begin()
tx.Exec(`INSERT INTO "foo" ("a", "b") VALUES (4, 2)`)

// ...

db.Query(`SELECT * FROM "foo" WHERE "a" = $1 AND "b" = $2`, 4, 2)

// DEADLOCK

tx.Commit()</code></pre><p>In this example, we create a new transaction and insert something to the database. Later on, we try to query the same result from the database. That the inserted row has not been committed yet, is not the actual issue, as you would receive no result in that case. The real issue here is that if you run this code concurrently, you might run out of connections. How many connections are opened to the database can be configured. As soon as your code reaches the <code>db.Query</code> the last connection might be occupied by the transaction and therefore blocks until a connection is available, which might never happen.</p><p>So how do you fix this? First of all, all queries should be run either outside or inside a transaction for a specific part of your code. Even if you run a transaction block and a non-transaction block concurrently, the non-transaction block will not be blocked by the transaction forever (but the non-transaction block might need to wait for the other part to finish). Additionally, you can use a linter or another tool to make sure all queries are run completely inside or outside of transactions.</p><p>I usually write integration tests against the database. If you do the same, you can configure the connection pool size to make sure the tests will only use a single connection. That way the tests will run into a deadlock should you have forgotten to use a transaction somewhere. You can easily configure that inside the <code>TestMain</code> function for a package.</p><pre><code language="text/x-go">func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	db.SetMaxOpenConns(1) // db is the *sql.DB created somewhere
}</code></pre><p>I hope this helps you to prevent some nasty deadlock bugs. I found quite a few in a larger code base by limiting the connection pool. In production, you should use multiple connections to speed up things of course.</p>

<h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
<p>This is part 1 of a 4-part miniseries on issues with WebAssembly and proposals to fix them. <a href="http://troubles.md/why-do-we-need-the-relooper-algorithm-again/">Part 2 here</a>, <a href="http://troubles.md/the-stack-is-not-the-stack/">part 3 here</a>, <a href="http://troubles.md/microwasm/">part 4 here</a>.

This article assumes some familiarity with virtual machines, compilers and WebAssembly, but I’ll try to link to relevant information where necessary so even if you’re not you can follow along.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Also, this series is going to come off as if I dislike WebAssembly. I love WebAssembly! I wrote a <a href="http://troubles.md/why-wasm/">whole article about how great it is</a>! In fact, I love it so much that I want it to be the best that it can be, and this series is me working through my complaints with the design in the hope that some or all of these issues can be addressed soon, while the ink is still somewhat wet on the specification.</p>

<p>I’m sure you’re all familiar with WebAssembly by now. It’s seeing use everywhere, from plugins to blockchain smart contracts to, of course, the web. If you go to the Wikipedia article for WebAssembly right now, you’ll get a great overview of the technology, except for one thing: the “Design” section states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly code is intended to be run on a portable abstract structured stack machine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope.</p>
<h2 id="stack-machines-vs-register-machines">Stack machines vs register machines</h2>
<p>The difference between a stack and a register machine is essentially this: a stack machine pops values from and pushed values onto a stack, so for example a <code>+</code> operation will pop the last two values off of the stack, add them together, and then push the result back onto the stack. A register machine has some number of places where values can be stored, and operations reads and writes to those registers. So <code>+</code> will take 3 arguments, 2 that represent the registers to read the operands from and 1 that represents the register to write the result to<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The problem with registers is that there is no liveness analysis. If you have some code like so:</p>
<pre><code>%0 = 1
%1 = 2
%2 = add %0, %1
...
</code></pre><p>Are <code>%0</code> and <code>%1</code> used after the addition? Without lookahead, you have no way of knowing. Even in SSA<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> register machines like LLVM IR (where each register is written to exactly once) the liveness of each register must be continuously recalculated. This means that you have overhead associated with compilation - knowing the liveness of variables is extremely important for generating efficient assembly, but instead of the liveness being calculated when creating the IR and stored as a part of it you have to recalculate this data every time.</p>
<p>If the IR is entirely in-memory this isn’t so bad, especially if your code is in SSA form, but it means that you have to do extra work for the same quality of code and it means that a streaming compiler (like FireFox’s Wasm baseline compiler) is unable to produce good code.</p>
<p>You can, of course, add liveness analysis metadata to the machine, but that liveness analysis is only useful if your code is in SSA form - if it’s not SSA form then the liveness is <em>extremely</em> coarse-grained.</p>
<p>Well, that’s where WebAssembly comes in. See, WebAssembly has these things called locals. Locals are mutable variables that live for the lifetime of a function. Since WebAssembly blocks can’t take arguments, they’re the only way for blocks to receive data from outside. This includes stuff like loop counters, the classic example for SSA-defeating mutable variables, but it also includes regular blocks. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>add</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>block</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
    <span>; Can't read the result of the add above</span>
  <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You have to do this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>local</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>local.set</span> <span>0</span> <span>(</span><span>add</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>2</span><span>)))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>block</span> <span>(</span><span>result</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>local.get</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is a problem. Usually a stack machine can be trivially converted to SSA form with liveness analysis - an item on the stack is dead when it is used as the argument to an operator - no ifs, no buts. Even a <code>pick</code> operator<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> can be thought of in these terms as long as the argument to <code>pick</code> is a compile-time constant, although generally the SSA conversion of a stack machine that includes a <code>pick</code> instruction would be implemented using refcounting - meaning that reading a variable doesn’t involve creating an unnecessary new one. However, locals are a problem. They’re mutable, so you can’t trivially convert them to SSA, and they always live for the lifetime of the function.</p>
<p>This poses a problem for optimisation. SSA form is one of the most powerful optimisation tools. The fact that locals are mutable defeats that, and the fact that they’re global to the function defeats liveness analysis. For an example of why this is an issue, say you’re trying to compile WebAssembly into some native architecture. You’ll compile your code into one that uses some number of arguments in registers, but now unless you do your own liveness analysis on that function those registers are permanently marked “in use” by those arguments. Without extra analysis you don’t know when the last usage of that argument is, and so you can’t ever reuse the register used by that argument for something else. Even a function that never uses any of its arguments still can’t reuse the space used by those arguments for anything else.</p>
<p>This essentially makes WebAssembly a register machine without liveness analysis, but not only that, it’s a register machine that isn’t even in SSA form - both of the tools at our disposal to do optimisation are unavailable. In a true, optimising compiler we can recreate that information, but WebAssembly was already emitted by a compiler that generated that information once. There’s no technical reason why we should have to do that work again, it’s just a deficiency in the language. A compiler that has to act on a stream of WebAssembly has less ability to recreate this information and will end up generating significantly worse code for essentially no good reason.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>The developers of the WebAssembly spec aren’t dumb. For the most part it’s an extremely well-designed specification. However, they are weighed down by WebAssembly’s legacy. WebAssembly started out not as a bytecode, but more like a simplified binary representation for asm.js. Essentially it was originally designed to be source code, like JavaScript. It would be a more-efficient representation thereof but it still wasn’t a proper virtual machine instruction set. Then, it became a register machine<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and only at the last minute did it switch to stack-based encoding for the operators. At that point, concepts like locals were quite entrenched in the spec. Not only that, but for the most part the WebAssembly specification team were flying blind. No streaming compiler had yet been built, hell, no compiler had yet been built. It wasn’t clear that having locals would be problematic - after all, C gets by just fine using local variables that the compiler constructs the SSA graph for.</p>
<p>It’s only by working on a streaming WebAssembly compiler for integration with <a href="https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a> that I realised these issues, as well as more issues that I’ll get to in later articles in this series. Before then I considered WebAssembly’s design to be utterly rock-solid, and in fact I still strongly believe that most of the decisions made were the right ones. Although it has problems, it’s incredible how much the WebAssembly working group got right considering it was such relatively unknown territory at the time of the specification’s writing.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-alternative">What’s the alternative?</h2>
<p>So currently locals represent both function arguments and local variables. There is <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value/blob/master/proposals/multi-value/Overview.md">a proposal to allow blocks to have arguments and both functions and blocks to return more than one value</a>. With this, it becomes possible to get rid of locals entirely. Loop counters are implemented by having the counter be given as an argument, and then when you jump to the header of the loop you must have the new value of the counter on the stack. This acts like a phi function but is much conceptually simpler. Since it’s impossible to get the address of locals in WebAssembly there’s no need for <code>alloca</code> in any form - unlike in LLVM, you don’t need to have locals at all. The only thing left is to implement function arguments by having the function start with its arguments on the stack and you no longer need locals at all.</p>
<p>This massively reduces the complexity of the WebAssembly specification and compilers for it without reducing the expressivity, and allows the compilers generating the WebAssembly to encode more of their knowledge about the original source into the WebAssembly itself. Although optimising compilers will probably not generate better code from this, they will become much simpler and easier to maintain, and streaming compilers will become significantly simpler and produce significantly better code.</p>
<p>Finally, not only is a stack machine like this automatically in SSA form, but it’s automatically in <em>strict</em> SSA form. This means that it is statically impossible to access undefined variables. In WebAssembly as it exists now, you have to zero locals when entering a function unless you can statically prove that the local is always set before it is accessed. Again, the compilers almost always have this information, and removing locals makes accessing undefined memory statically impossible.</p>
<p>Join me next time where I tackle WebAssembly’s problematic control flow.</p>

  <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3a8e939667e3734b84dff063fff3965fe824553c/d7922/uploads/good-names.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In <a href="https://toolbox.humandeluxe.com/2020/08/07/how-to-name">this video</a>, I walked you through our naming process. We usually work in a workshop format to create a long list of potential brand names for our clients. This can be done either remote or onsite. If you’ve missed this it the last time, make sure you watch the video first:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8Hlbp8mp_I?color=white&amp;theme=light"></iframe>

<p>Once we have the long list of names, how do we make the selection? How do we distinguish between good and bad brand names?</p>

<p>The process is twofold: On the one side, we need too identify good brand names, on the other side we need to exclude all the bad names. So let’s look at the first part: How do you create a good brand name?</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-brand-name">What makes a good brand name?</h2>

<p>At Human Deluxe, we follow the teachings of Alexandra Watkins, who created the SMILE &amp; SCRATCH principles: Good names make you smile, bad names leave you scratch your head. Of course, these are Acronyms, so let’s look at how to make yourself SMILE with a good name:</p>

<p>The qualities of a good name:</p>

<p><strong>Suggestive</strong>: A good name will give you a hint of a positive brand experience. It will suggest the rest of the brand for you. Great examples of this are travel company KAYAK or streaming service Pandora: Once you open the streaming box, it would not stop playing – clever, right?</p>

<p><strong>Meaningful</strong> A good name resonates with your target audience. Not only do they feel good, but they already know what to expect. Obvious examples of this are domain provider Namecheap, diet drink Slimfast or even good old Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>Imagery</strong> A great name is visually evocative. It creates a picture in your head that people will instantly associate with your brand. Even if a name is abstract, it will be able to give your audience a certain association and idea of what it could look like. Think of brands like: Caterpilar or Citibank – these are great examples.</p>

<p><strong>Legs</strong> Like a good hiker, a great name has strong legs. It lends itself to a theme for extra mileage: A name with great legs can shine through to the whole brand, directing the tonality and vocabulary. Personally, I like how twitter worked that in: A single microblogpost is a Tweet, the logo is a bird, even certain icons would be bird-themed, like the birdhouse Home button or the egg avatar.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional</strong> A good brand name moves people. does not only work in their mind, it touches their heart. This works for both B2C and B2B companies. Business brands don’t have to be boring. In fact, they can swing up to greater heights if they have an emotional impact, distinguishing themselves from their dull competition. Brands that are brave enough to be emotional do connect with humans like no other. Take Yahoo! or Greenpeace for example – it works.</p>

<p>If you want to figure out if your brand is good, your name for these criterias. At best, a good name ticks all of them. At least, your name should check one or two criterias. At any cost, avoid head scratchers names. In our next article, we will explain what these are and how you identify them. Sign up for our newsletter to get this article earlier than everybody else, as well as the free name checker template.</p>

<p>One of the major challenges of writing a journal article is to keep track of versions - both the different versions you create as the document progresses, and to merge in the changes made by your collaborators. For most academics Microsoft Word is the default writing tool, and it is both very good and very bad in this. Very good because the <em>track changes</em> feature makes it easy to see what has changed since the last version and who made the changes. Very bad because this feature is built around keeping everything in a single Word document, so that only one person can work on on a manuscript at a time. This usually means sending manuscripts around by email, and being very careful about not confusing different versions of the document, which requires <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531">creativity</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Approaches to overcome these challenges are to a) integrate the Word documents into collaboration tools such as Sharepoint and Office 365, or document sharing services such as Dropbox and Google Docs (if you use it just for that), or b) use a different authoring tool altogether. If neither of these approaches works for you, you have a third option: use the version control system <strong>git</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mulvany.net/presentations/WikimaniaOpenScholarshipTalk.slides.html#/3">Git</a> is software that helps with <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/25/using-microsoft-word-with-git/(http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)">tracking changes to files</a> so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is typically used to track changes of software source code (and was originally developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005), but in fact git can be used for any file where we need to keep track of versions over time. Git is open source software that runs locally on your computer, so please go ahead and start tracking changes to your manuscripts (or other complex documents) with git. Any time you want to store a version, do a <code>git commit</code> with a little description and an optional tag.</p>
<p>This approach is not ideal, as git was written with source code in text format in mind and for example doesn’t understand what has changed between two revisions of a Word document. Some people will tell you to never store binary files in a version control system, but don’t listen to them. Instead give git a tool to convert Word documents into plain text, and git will then happily tell you what has changed between revisions. Several tools can do this, but since earlier this month Pandoc can read Word documents in <code>docx</code> format. Do the following to have Pandoc convert Word documents into markdown, and to compare the revisions by word and not by line (which makes more sense):</p>
<pre><code># .gitattributes file in root folder of your git project
*.docx diff=pandoc</code></pre>
<pre><code># .gitconfig file in your home folder
[diff "pandoc"]
  textconv=pandoc --to=markdown
  prompt = false
[alias]
  wdiff = diff --word-diff=color --unified=1</code></pre>
<p>You can then use <code>git wdiff important_file.docx</code> to see the changes (with deletions in red and insertions in green), or <code>git log -p --word-diff=color important_file.docx</code> to see all changes over time.</p>
<p>While you can now track revisions of a Word document and see the changes, you also want to be able to merge different versions of a Word document together so that you and your collaborators can work on the manuscript in parallel. Git can’t merge binary files together, so you need to first convert the Word document into a format that git understands. Just as in the previous example we can use Pandoc for that, with markdown as the textual format. This would also work with HTML or LaTeX, but the simplicity of markdown makes it better suited for version control which doesn’t know about the markup of these formats.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that git became so popular with software developers is that it is a <strong>distributed version control system</strong> instead of a centralized system such as Subversion. This means that you can track all revisions locally on your computer, but can still synchronize your revisions with another user. <strong>Github</strong> is a popular service that facilitates this synchronization and adds some nice features on top. One way to collaborate with your co-authors is therefore to set up a Github repository (public or private) for your manuscript, and store the master version of the manuscript in markdown format. Instead of working on the master version directly, you would use Pandoc to convert back and forth between this master version in markdown format and your Word document, and would continue to use Word as authoring tool. <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/18/introducing-rakali/">Rakali</a> is a Pandoc tool that I released last week that can help automate this document conversion. Github has a a number of features to facilitate collaboration that can be used here, e.g.&nbsp;Github issues for discussion and task management.</p>
<p>There are still a few rough edges in the workflow described above (e.g.&nbsp;only partial support of Word track changes), but it is an interesting approach to collaborate using Microsoft Word and git. And this workflow can of course be enhanced to also include authors that write in LaTeX or one of the other formats that Pandoc supports. One nice side effect of using markdown is that Github will automatically render a webpage for the document (which it will not do for HTML without extra effort).</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we are thrilled to announce the public release of <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt"><code>defmt</code></a> ("de format").
<code>defmt</code> stands for "deferred formatting" and it's a highly efficient logging framework.
As we covered in <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/21st-century-embedded-tooling/">our blog post about embedded tooling for the 21st century</a> we hope <code>defmt</code> will serve as the base for features like data visualization and interactive logging front-ends.
In this post we'll cover how to use <code>defmt</code> with <code>probe-rs</code> supported devices and what you can do with <code>defmt</code> today.</p>



<p>We have created a <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template">Cargo project template</a> to make the setup easier.
Here are the setup steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <strong>git</strong> version of <code>probe-run</code>, <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/probe-run/">a custom Cargo runner that lets you run embedded apps if they were native apps</a>. Be sure to enable the <code>defmt</code> Cargo feature!</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo install <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--features</span> defmt
</code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Either initialize the project template with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate"><code>cargo-generate</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template/archive/master.zip">fetch a copy</a> and initialize the <code>Cargo.toml</code> manually.</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo generate <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--name</span> my-app
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are not using <code>cargo-generate</code> you'll need to manually enter the <code>author</code> and <code>name</code> fields in <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [package]
<span>-# authors = ["{{authors}}"]
-# name = "{{project-name}}"
</span><span>+name = "my-app"
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After that there are a few TODOs in the template.
You can <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> for the word TODO (<code>rg TODO .cargo .</code>) to find them but we'll walk you through all of them in this blog post.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pick a chip from <code>probe-run --list-chips</code> and enter it into <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If, for example, you have a nRF52840 Development Kit from one of <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020">our workshops</a> then replace <code>{{chip}}</code> with <code>nRF52840_xxAA</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
<span>-runner = "probe-run --chip {{chip}} --defmt"
</span><span>+runner = "probe-run --chip nRF52840_xxAA --defmt"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Adjust the compilation target in <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 chip you'll want to use the <code>thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code> target.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [build]
<span>-target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+
-# target = "thumbv7m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M3
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabi"   # Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 (no FPU)
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F and Cortex-M7F (with FPU)
</span><span>+target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F (with FPU)
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Add a HAL as a dependency.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 you'll want to use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nrf52840-hal"><code>nrf52840-hal</code></a>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [dependencies]
<span>-# some-hal = "1.2.3"
</span><span>+nrf52840-hal = "0.11.0"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Now that you have selected a HAL fix the HAL import in <code>src/lib.rs</code></li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code> // my-app/src/lib.rs
<span>-// use some_hal as _; // memory layout
</span><span>+use nrf52840_hal as _; // memory layout
</span></code></pre></div>


<p>You are now all set to <code>cargo-run</code> your first <code>defmt</code>-powered application!
There are some examples in the <code>src/bin</code> directory.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/hello.rs</span>

<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_main</span><span>]</span>
<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_std</span><span>]</span>

<span>use</span> <span>my_app</span> <span>as</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span> <span>// global logger + panicking-behavior + memory layout</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>cargo run</code>-ning this program produces the classic "Hello, world!" output.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rb` is an alias for `run --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rb hello
<span>    Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s

resetting device
0.000000 INFO Hello, world!
(..)

</span><span>$</span> <span>echo</span> <span>$?</span>
<span>0
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or if you are using VS code + Rust-Analyzer, instead, you can open the <code>src/bin/hello.rs</code> file and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/run-rust-on-your-embedded-device-from-vscode/">click the "Run" button as we demonstrated in a previous blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Now let's take a closer look at the features of the framework.
This post will be a quick overview.
For more details check out <a href="https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/">the <code>defmt</code> book</a>.</p>



<p>We have wired the <code>panic_handler</code> to <code>defmt</code> to make panicking much cheaper.
Consider this example, which is part of the project template:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/panic.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>panic!</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It produces this output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb panic
<span>0.000000 INFO main
0.000001 ERROR panicked at src/bin/panic.rs:11:5
stack backtrace:
   0: 0x00000554 - __bkpt
   1: 0x00000524 - template::exit
   2: 0x00000514 - rust_begin_unwind
   3: 0x000001c8 - core::panicking::panic_fmt
   4: 0x000001a2 - core::panicking::panic
   5: 0x00000164 - panic::__cortex_m_rt_main
   6: 0x00000108 - main
   7: 0x00000238 - ResetTrampoline
   8: 0x00000214 - Reset
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you may have seen from our previous posts with <code>probe-run</code> you get a stack backtrace for free!</p>

<h2 id="binary-size">Binary size</h2>

<p>What I wanted to highlight here is the binary size.
Here's the output of <code>cargo-size</code> (part of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binutils"><code>cargo-binutils</code></a> project).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo size <span>--bin</span> panic <span>--</span> <span>-A</span>
<span>section              size        addr

.rodata               360       0x600
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>An here's the output of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-bloat"><code>cargo-bloat</code></a></p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo bloat <span>-n</span> 5 <span>--bin</span> panic

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are <strong>no</strong> <code>core::fmt</code> function calls there and that's what makes the binary so small.</p>

<h2 id="vs-rprintln">vs <code>rprintln!</code></h2>

<p>Let's compare against a program that uses <a href="https://docs.rs/rtt-target/0.2.0/rtt_target/macro.rprintln.html"><code>rtt_target::rprintln</code></a>, which is hard-wired to <code>core::fmt</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#</span><span>[</span><span>cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry</span><span>]</span>

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The biggest functions are <code>core::fmt</code> related.
The <code>defmt</code>-powered <code>panic</code> uses 1.59 KB of Flash (<code>.text</code> + <code>.rodata</code>); <code>panic-rprintln</code> uses 13.85 KB.
That's almost a whopping 9x savings.
See the table below for the complete breakdown:</p>

    <tr>

<p>Now you can panic without reservation: panic messages are no longer binary-size expensive.
Also, no more need to reach out for crates that discard panic information, like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/panic-halt"><code>panic-halt</code></a>, to keep the binary size low.</p>



<p>If you have used the <code>log</code> crate before you know that it supports 5 logging levels: trace, debug, info, warn and error – sorted from lowest severity to highest.
<code>defmt</code> supports the same five levels through 5 logging macros: <code>trace!</code>, <code>debug!</code>, <code>info!</code>, <code>warn!</code> and <code>error!</code>.
Let's see them in action:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/levels.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"info"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>trace!</span><span>(</span><span>"trace"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>warn!</span><span>(</span><span>"warn"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>debug!</span><span>(</span><span>"debug"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>error!</span><span>(</span><span>"error"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 TRACE trace
0.000002 WARN warn
0.000003 DEBUG debug
0.000004 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not shown above but the logging level (e.g. INFO) gets nicely colored in the terminal output.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>The main reason for having logging levels is to be able to filter some of them out.
If we re-run the <code>levels</code> example but compile it using the <code>release</code> profile we get less output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rrb` is an alias for `run --release --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rrb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 WARN warn
0.000002 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is because the project template has been configured to report all logging levels when the <code>dev</code> profile is used, but only INFO and higher severity logs when the <code>release</code> profile is used.</p>

<p><code>defmt</code> defaults to logging nothing (filtering everything out) but this behavior can be configured via Cargo features.</p>

<p>If you look at the project template's <code>Cargo.toml</code> you'll see that the <code>defmt-default</code> feature is enabled for the top crate (<code>my-app</code>):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[features]</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"defmt-default"</span><span>,</span>
<span># "dependency-a/defmt-trace",</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>defmt-default</code> behavior logs at TRACE level and higher severity if profile is <code>dev</code> and log INFO and up if profile is <code>release</code>.
The other features like <code>defmt-warning</code> enable logging at the specified level (WARN) and up regardless of the compilation profile (<code>dev</code> or <code>release</code>).</p>

<p>Logging filters can be configured per crate using Cargo features.
If you have used the <a href="https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.7.1/env_logger/"><code>env_logger</code></a> crate you may have used the <code>RUST_LOG</code> environment variable to enable logging in dependencies.
With <code>env_logger</code> you use <code>RUST_LOG=dep-a=debug,dep-b=info</code> to enable DEBUG logging in <code>dep-a</code> and INFO logging in <code>dep-b</code>.
With <code>defmt</code> that configuration is done in the top crate's <code>Cargo.toml</code> as shown below:</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [features]
 default = [
   "defmt-default",
<span>-# "dependency-a/defmt-trace",
</span><span>+  "dep-a/defmt-debug",
+  "dep-b/defmt-info",
</span> ]
</code></pre></div>


<p>So far we have only logged string literals in our examples but <code>defmt</code> also supports formatting arguments.
<code>core::write!</code> supports a variety of formatting parameters, each one associated to a formatting trait: <code>{:?}</code> (<code>Debug</code>), <code>{}</code> (<code>Display</code>), <code>{:x}</code> (<code>Hex</code>).
<code>defmt</code> has a single formatting trait: <code>Format</code>, which is associated to the <code>{:?}</code> formatting parameter.</p>

<p><code>{:?}</code> expects a type that implements the <code>Format</code> trait.
<code>Format</code> is implemented for primitives like integers and slices.
To implement <code>Format</code> for user-defined types (structs or enums) use the <code>#[derive(Format)]</code> attribute.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>{:?}</code>, there are formatting parameters for some primitives: e.g. <code>{:u8}</code>, <code>{:bool}</code>.
Prefer these parameters for primitives as they compress the …</p></div></div>

Enjoy!</p><p>By the way we might have jumped the gun a bit with the title but 2021 is almost here. We're pretty sure these apps will stand the test of time. We use these apps ourselves every day, we have deployed them on behalf of our clients and we are confident they will remain highly competitive options throughout 2021, and if that changes we'll update this article. Good Luck!</p><p>If these apps aren't your cup of tea, we have good news. There are hundreds of other free social apps that you can search for on github.com.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>The IAM policy is the cornerstone of security of an AWS account. There is an oft-repeated notion of the shared responsibility model that stipulates that certain parts of security is the responsibility of the cloud provider, such as preventing malicious parties physical access to the infrastructure. On the other hand, the cloud provider gives you security controls and it is your responsibility to use them properly.</p> <p>The main security control is IAM and it is used everywhere inside AWS. With IAM you are not only able to create users for people who need access to the account but also to define what each user has access to.</p> <p>There are several types of policies, but the two most important ones are the identity-, and the resource-based policies. Whatever you do in your AWS account you’ll need to use these.</p> <h2 id="identity-based-policies">Identity-based policies</h2> <p>Identity-based policies are the easier of the two, as some variation of it is present in most systems. They <strong>define what an identity can do</strong>, such as a user has access to an S3 bucket.</p> <p>There are two types of identities in AWS: <strong>users and roles</strong>. By attaching a policy to an identity you can give it permissions to access resources. For example, you can attach this policy to allow a user to read an object in an S3 bucket:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span>
	</span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
		</span><span>{</span><span>
			</span><span>"Action"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
				</span><span>"s3:GetObject"</span><span>
			</span><span>],</span><span>
			</span><span>"Effect"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Allow"</span><span>,</span><span>
			</span><span>"Resource"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"arn:aws:s3:::&lt;bucket&gt;/text.txt"</span><span>
		</span><span>}</span><span>
	</span><span>]</span><span>

To give access to your account, you can use a role that can be used by identities in another account. This way you don’t need to create users and transfer secrets (passwords or access keys) to grant cross-account access. Another use-case is users logging in via SAML or Cognito. Instead of creating a user for every single person who can log in, you define a role and all users assume it. Then you can give permissions to the role and all users signed in this way will gain those permissions.</p> <p>Also, AWS services use roles to gain permissions to access your account. For example, CloudTrail can put logs into a CloudWatch Log group, but it needs permission to do so. On the Trail config, you need to specify a role:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role-72cf0208de53148da9ebb597ccf983890b3c5c8ba59222865e849f81918718c9.png" integrity="sha256-cs8CCN5TFI2p67WXzPmDiQs8XIulkiKGXoSfgZGHGMk=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This role allows the CloudTrail service to assume it:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role_trust-88790c9eb727ab035fd2e4d564b15ca8bb07951376ea75da8e0918ce8d92983f.png" integrity="sha256-iHkMnrcnqwNf0uTVZLFcqLsHlRN26nXajgkYzo2SmD8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>And the role has the policies to access CloudWatch Logs:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_permissions-e536a8a0d9a50b84c797d688f891bdc7440c1a6c010d919b7e6bc9854dee03bd.png" integrity="sha256-5TaooNmlC4THl9aI+JG9x0QMGmwBDZGbfmvJhU3uA70=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This way you have full control over what a given service can do. And this pattern appears in many places. A Lambda function uses a role in a similar way, the S3 bucket replication gains permissions to write a bucket using a role, and AWS Organizations creates a role in the member account so that you can initialize the resources inside it.</p> <h2 id="resource-based-policies">Resource-based policies</h2> <p>What if there is no identity to attach the policies to? This is the case for anonymous access, and also when an AWS service does not use a service role, such as an API Gateway. When there is no identity, identity-based policies can not be used.</p> <p>Many, but not all, AWS services <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">support resource-based policies</a>. These are policies attached to the resource and these can give access when there is no identity.</p> <p>S3 buckets support bucket policies which can be used to give <strong>anonymous access</strong> to the bucket:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span>

</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>*</code> Principal means “everybody” that includes non-users.</p> <p>Another example is <strong>how Lambda allows an API Gateway to call it</strong>. This gives the <code>lambda:InvokeFunction</code> permission to one API:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

	</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Similarly, <strong>the role’s trust policy is a resource-based policy</strong>. This allows services and identities to assume the role. For example, a cross-account access role can use this trust policy to allow access from a different account:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span>

		</span><span>}</span><span>
	</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Another example is to allow the Lambda service to use this role:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span>

		</span><span>}</span><span>
	</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>Action</code> in resource-based policies can be one that is relevant to the service. A bucket policy can allow <code>s3:GetObject</code>, a role the <code>sts:AssumeRole</code>, while a Lambda the <code>lambda:InvokeFunction</code>.</p> <p>And the <code>Resource,</code> when needed, can only start with the resource’s own ARN. This makes sense as one resource can only give access to itself or things below it but not to unrelated resources.</p> <p>How the resource defines who gets access and how specific this control is depends on the service. The <code>Principal</code> element is always present and that can define users, roles, services, other accounts, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html">a few other things</a>.</p> <p>But, especially with services, this is not granular enough. For example, when a role’s trust policy defines the Lambda service, it does not specify <em>which</em> Lambda function to trust. Similarly, the role for the CloudTrail allows the <code>cloudtrail.amazonaws.com</code> service, but there is no further restrictions on <em>which trail</em>.</p> <p>Some resource policies support conditions to allow only a given resource. For example, the policy for a Lambda function is able to selectively allow the API which can call it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"ArnLike"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
		</span><span>"AWS:SourceArn"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"&lt;api gw arn&gt;/sign/*/*"</span><span>
	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Unfortunately, there is no generic way to know which resource-based policies support further restrictions on the caller using conditions. You need to check the AWS-provided policy examples to see what conditions are possible.</p> <h2 id="using-together">Using together</h2> <p>When both types of policies are effective then you can use both to give and restrict access. When an IAM user wants to get an object from an S3 bucket then both the policy attached to the user and the one defined on the bucket are effective.</p> <h3 id="allowing-access">Allowing access</h3> <p>With most services if <em>either</em> of the policies give access to an action then it will be granted. The notable exceptions are KMS key policies and cross-account role trust policies where <em>both</em> the resource and the identity needs an explicit Allow.</p> <p>As resource-based policies can grant access to identities, the notion that a user can not do anything without attaching policies to it is not true. For example, a bucket policy can allow a user to get objects and that is effective even if the user has no permissions on its own:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

Doch auch in der veranstaltungsfreien Zeit engagiert sich das CERT stets für die Sicherheit seines Umfelds.</p>
<h2>Digitale Corona-Listen</h2>
<p>Bei einem gemeinsamen Restaurantbesuch wurden Mitglieder des CERT gebeten, sich in eine <em>digitale</em> "Corona-Liste" einzutragen. Die gastgebenden Gastronominnen wollten die verpflichtende Datenerfassung offenbar modern und unkompliziert gestalten – mit Hilfe einer Cloud-Software.</p>
<p>Deren vollmundige Versprechen über die Sicherheit der erfassten Daten weckten Argwohn und Altruismus des CERT-Teams. Wie erwartet hatte das System akuten Bedarf an Sanitäts- und Brandschutzmaßnahmen durch Spezialkräfte des CCC.</p>
<h3>Über 87.000 Corona-Datensätze und 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen</h3>
<p>Verschiedene Schwachstellen ermöglichten den Zugriff auf insgesamt 87.313 Corona-Kontakterhebungen von 180 Restaurants, die das System aktiv nutzten*.</p>
<p>Im betroffenen System wurden jedoch nicht nur Corona-Listen, sondern auch Reservierungen, Bestellungen und Kassenumsätze gespeichert. <a href="https://archive.is/BS7zG">Der Cloud-Service wirbt damit</a>, monatlich über 96 Mio. Euro Umsatz von 7,7 Mio. Kundinnen sowie 600.000 Reservierungen über das System abzuwickeln*. Persönliche Daten von Besucherinnen werden vor allem bei Reservierungen und Corona-Registrierungen erfasst.</p>
<p>Insgesamt war der Zugriff auf 4,8 Mio. Personendatensätze aus über 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen möglich, wie der Cloud-Service bestätigt*.</p>
<h3>Daten reichen über ein Jahrzehnt zurück</h3>
<p>Erstaunt stellte das CERT fest, dass im System personenbezogene Daten gespeichert sind, die teilweise ein ganzes Jahrzehnt zurückreichen. Der Cloud-Service versteht sich als "<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service#Datenschutz_(DSGVO">Auftragsverarbeiter</a>" und verortet die Verantwortung zur Löschung bei den Gastronominnen. Die wiederum schienen sich dessen oft nicht bewusst zu sein und vertrauten verständlicherweise auf die Full-Service-Cloud.</p>
<h2>Mehrere Schwachstellen</h2>
<h3>Mangelndes Rechte-Management</h3>
<p>Durch eine fehlerhafte Prüfung der Zugriffsrechte konnte im Handumdrehen administrativer Vollzugriff auf sämtliche im System gespeicherten Daten erlangt werden. Andere Fehler in der API ermöglichten Nutzerinnen auch ohne besondere Rechte den Zugriff auf schützenswerte Daten, die nicht für Ihre Augen bestimmt waren. So konnte zum Beispiel Restaurant A auf die Corona-Daten von Restaurant B zugreifen.</p>
<h3>Unzureichend geschützte Passwörter</h3>
<p>Auch unzureichend geschützte Passwörter konnten mittels einfachem API-Request abgerufen werden. Dabei fielen dem Katastrophenschutz des CCC nicht nur Hashes, sondern auch Passwörter im Klartext auf. Für neuere Accounts wurde immerhin eine zeitgemäße Hashing-Methode verwendet.  Dennoch hätten in einer Stichprobe über 25% der Passwörter aus ihren Hashes geborgen werden können. Triviale Passwörter wie "1234" deuteten auf das Fehlen einer angemessenen Passwortrichtlinie hin.</p>
<p>Das Risiko schlecht geschützter Passwörter geht über den betroffenen Dienst hinaus, weil Nutzerinnen oft dazu neigen, das gleiche Passwort für mehrere Accounts zu verwenden.</p>
<h3>Großzügiges Bestellsystem</h3>
<p>Haben Sie in der Vergangenheit einmal vergeblich auf Ihr bestelltes Essen gewartet? Oder wurde Ihnen in einer Hamburger Eck-Kneipe mit 42 Litern Bier eine spontane Freude bereitet? Vielleicht hatte einfach nur eine brasilianische Teenagerin Spaß an der offenen API… Diese hat es ohne weitere Hindernisse ermöglicht,</p>
<ul>
<li>die Speisekarten aller Restaurants einzusehen und damit</li>
<li>für Dritte Bestellungen <em>auszulösen</em> oder zu <em>stornieren</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Selbstverständlich unter Umgehung sämtlicher gesetzter Einschränkungen. Weltweiter, grenzenloser Service!</p>
<h3>Schnelle Reaktion des Cloud-Anbieters</h3>
<p>Alle gefundenen Schwachstellen wurden durch die CERT-Mitglieder <em>Sophie, Martin, cwoomio, <br> deinkoks, Lady_Raven, Metal_Warrior, <br> Wellenformer, blubbel und cbro</em> <br> schriftlich dokumentiert und dem Betreiber gastronovi mit der Bitte um Behebung mitgeteilt.</p>
<p>In einer zügigen Reaktion bestätigte gastronovi alle gemeldeten Schwachstellen und machte sich an die umgehende Behandlung. Den lebensrettenden Sofortmaßnahmen folgt auf Rat des CCC nun auch eine ausführliche Diagnostik des Systems durch geschultes Fachpersonal.</p>
<h2>CCC rät von digitalen "Corona-Listen" ab</h2>
<p>Laut gastronovi sind die gemeldeten Schwachstellen inzwischen kuriert. Doch auch <a href="https://www.modzero.com/modlog/archives/2020/07/06/mit_webapps_gegen_covid-19/index.html">in den Systemen anderer Cloud-Services wurden bereits ähnliche Schwachstellen gefunden</a>.</p>
<p><em>"Denken first, digital second",</em> kommentiert Linus Neumann, Sprecher des Chaos Computer Clubs. <em>"Viele digitale Corona-Listen wurden mit der heißen Nadel gestrickt und machen schwer zu haltende Datenschutzversprechen. Die Sicherheit eines Papiersystems ist hingegen auch für Laien leicht zu beurteilen."</em></p>
<p>So haben etablierte Cloud-Services bestehende Systeme oft nur hastig "umfunktioniert", statt sich spezifisch mit den Sicherheits- und Datenschutzanforderungen des Contact-Tracings auseinanderzusetzen.</p>
<p><em>"Die sensiblen Daten landen dann nicht etwa beim Restaurant, sondern auf einem großen Haufen irgendwo im Internet, wo sie die nächsten Jahre auf interessierte Hackerinnen warten."</em></p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für Besucherinnen</h3>
<p>Sollte Ihr präferiertes Restaurant auf Cloud-Erfassung <em>bestehen</em>, raten wir zu neuen kulinarischen Abenteuern in anderen Etablissements.</p>
<p>Doch auch bei papierbasierter Erfassung empfiehlt der CCC das <a href="https://twitter.com/frank_rieger/status/1289113251461173248">Einrichten einer gesonderten pseudonymen E-Mail-Adresse nur für diesen Zweck</a>. Viele kostenlose Dienstanbieter ermöglichen zum Beispiel eine Weiterleitung von eingehenden Nachrichten an die eigentliche E-Mail-Adresse.</p>
<p>Fünfzehn Minuten Aufwand gewährleisten Datensparsamkeit ohne das Risiko, eine wichtige Warnung zu verpassen.</p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für die sichere Erfassung</h3>
<p>Der Chaos Computer Club rät grundsätzlich von digitalen Corona-Listen ab – erst recht, wenn diese ihre Daten in einer Cloud speichern, statt im Restaurant.</p>
<p>Auch in unseren eigenen Hackspaces verwenden wir folgendes Papier-System:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jede Besucherin oder Gruppe erhält einen <em>gesonderten Zettel</em> zur Erfassung, damit nicht die Daten anderer Gäste eingesehen werden können.</li>
<li>Der ausgefüllte Zettel wird in einen verschlossenen Briefkasten geworfen, um ihn dort <em>vor neugierigen Blicken zu schützen</em>.</li>
<li>Dieser wird am Ende des Tages in einen Umschlag geleert, welcher mit dem <em>Datum des erfassten Tages beschriftet und versiegelt</em> wird.</li>
<li>Die versiegelten Umschläge werden an einem <em>sicheren Ort</em> aufbewahrt.</li>
<li>Täglich wird ein Umschlag <em>sicher vernichtet</em>, dessen Frist abgelaufen ist – und ein neuer kommt hinzu.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Empfehlungen an den Gesetzgeber</h3>
<p>Das Ziel, Besucherinnen im Falle eines Falles schnell informieren zu können, ist legitim und wichtig. Dennoch wurden dem Unterfangen eine Reihe unnötiger Probleme in den Weg gelegt</p>
<ol>
<li>Es häufen sich die Fälle, in denen die <a href="https://www.haufe.de/compliance/recht-politik/polizeizugriff-auf-corona-gaestelisten-der-gastronomie-unzulaessig_230132_522174.html">Listen für Polizei-Ermittlungen zweckentfremdet wurden</a>. Derartige Maßnahmen motivieren Besucherinnen, falsche Daten in die Listen einzutragen.</li>
<li>Der Gesetzgeber sieht keinen Anlass, <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2020/gastro-vorratsdatenspeicherung-bundesregierung-will-corona-listen-nicht-besser-schuetzen/">diesem Datenmissbrauch ein Ende zu setzen</a>.  Damit wird das geringe verbliebene Vertrauen weiter untergraben.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/corona-und-restaurants-kundendaten-fuer-einen-schnellen-flirt-a-453e410e-50d4-4d2a-a128-fdaa2b34eee2">In vielen Einrichtungen liegen die Listen offen aus, was die Sorge vor unerwünschtem Kontakt durch andere Gäste weckt</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Leichtfertig verspieltes Vertrauen kann jetzt nur noch durch eine klare gesetzliche Regelung zurückgewonnen werden.</p>

When Chrome version 85 is released, it will <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/08/highlighting-great-user-experiences-on.html">apply the label “Fast page” to links</a> on web pages.</p><p>The label appears on a menu when a user does a long-press on a link. It only displays when a destination page is considered fast based on Core Web Vitals and real-world data from Chrome users. However, if a page is considered fast by Core Web Vitals, but there isn’t enough real-world data for the page, it won’t display the label.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1234" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png" alt="Fast page label" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png 2048w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-300x181.png 300w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1024x617.png 1024w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-768x463.png 768w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1536x926.png 1536w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1046x630.png 1046w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-150x90.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"><figcaption>Chrome 85 will have “Fast page” label when a user long-presses a link</figcaption></figure><p>The label is likely a taste of how Google will be incorporating Core Web Vitals into Google Search. It’s highly probable that Google will use a label or icon to denote fast pages, similar to what they do now for AMP pages. I also predict that sites will be told that more searchers click on results that have a fast symbol, and therefore they’ll need to score “Good” on Core Web Vitals, or they may not rank as well. I think that presupposition will age well come next year.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="778" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1.png 750w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-289x300.png 289w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-607x630.png 607w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-150x156.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure><p>For now, the label will be limited to Chrome users that are in <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2392284">Lite mode</a> (an Android-only feature) or have “<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9116376">Make searches and browsing better</a>” turned on (a setting that sends URLs of pages you visit to Google).</p><h2>Never miss an important story</h2><p>Weekly news updates, no spam, and you can unsubscribe anytime.</p> <div><p><img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=240&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="120" width="120" loading="lazy"></p><div><p><a rel="author" href="https://www.coywolf.news/jon-henshaw/">Jon Henshaw</a></p><p><small>Jon is the founder and Managing Editor of Coywolf.

It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p><p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. But, installing and using them appears to be difficult for a large number of users.</p><p>I see these questions often on Stackoverflow and similar websites -</p><ul><li>how to compute VMAF?</li><li>how do I compile VMAF on Ubuntu?</li><li>how do I calcuate VMAF using FFmpeg?</li><li>no such filter <code>libvmaf</code> when trying to use VMAF with FFmpeg.</li><li>VMAF example commandline</li></ul><p>and the list simply goes on.

</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2: Compute the VMAF score between the two videos.</strong><br>From the commandline below, you can see that we are providing the two input sequences, and then we are scaling both to 1920x1080 using a <code>bicubic</code> filter. This is important because VMAF works only on sequences having the same resolution (and the frame rate should match, else you’ll have serious problems). We are also asking FFmpeg to compute the PSNR score for these two sequences.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mpg -i test_1080p30.mpg -filter_complex <span>"[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; [main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json"</span> -f null -
</code></pre></div><p>and it should print the VMAF score as follows on the console</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">[libvmaf @ 0x55803f80c7c0] VMAF score: 86.375268
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><ol><li>The detailed per-frame details are contained in the JSON file. It contains the per-frame VMAF and PSNR scores as requested.</li><li>In FFmpeg’s filter, you can use either <code>bicubic</code> or <code>lancsoz</code> filters for the upsampling process. Netflix <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/vmaf-the-journey-continues-44b51ee9ed12">suggests</a> that <code>bicubic</code> is a better choice.</li></ol><h2 id="options-for-vmaf-using-ffmpeg">Options for VMAF using FFmpeg</h2><p>The following commandline options are available in FFmpeg for computing VMAF.</p><ul><li><code>model_path</code>
Set the model path which is to be used for SVM. Default value: <code>/usr/local/share/model/vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl</code></li><li><code>log_path</code>
Set the file path to be used to store logs.</li><li><code>log_fmt</code>
Set the format of the log file (xml or json).</li><li><code>enable_transform</code>
This option can enable/disable the score_transform applied to the final predicted VMAF score, if you have specified score_transform option in the input parameter file passed to run_vmaf_training.py Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>phone_model</code>
Invokes the phone model which will generate VMAF scores higher than in the regular model, which is more suitable for laptop, TV, etc. viewing conditions. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>psnr</code>
Enables computing psnr along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>ssim</code>

Set number of threads to be used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>0</code>, which makes use of all available logical processors.</li><li><code>n_subsample</code>
Set interval for frame subsampling used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>1</code></li><li><code>enable_conf_interval</code>
Enables confidence interval. Default value: <code>false</code></li></ul><h2 id="common-problems-while-using-vmaf-and-ffmpeg">Common problems while using VMAF and FFmpeg.</h2><p>P1. While installing FFmpeg from the official compilation guide on Ubuntu 18.04, you will face this error <code>ERROR: gnutls not found using pkg-config</code>. To prevent this, you need to install <code>sudo apt-get install libunistring-dev</code>.</p><p>P2. Another common problem when running FFmpeg with VMAF is this <code>error libvmaf xxx not found using pkg config</code>. This means that while compiling FFmpeg, you didn’t tell it where the <code>libvmaf</code> files are. Simply run the export command and it should fix the issue.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>export</span> <span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>=<span>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

<p>
	(part of <a href="https://sive.rs/d1">the “do this” directives</a>)
</p>
<h3>1.
	Prioritize lifestyle design.
</h3><p>
	You’ve made it, so it’s all about you, now.  Make your dreams come true.
</p><p>
	Shape your surroundings to please your every desire.
</p><p>
	Make your <a href="https://sive.rs/book/TimeParadox">immediate gratification</a> the most important thing.
</p>

<h3>2.
	Chase that comparison moment.
</h3><p>
	You have the old thing. You want the new thing.
	Yes! Do it! Be happy for a week.
</p><p>
	Ignore the fact that the <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StumblingOnHappiness">happiness only comes from the moment of comparison between the old and new</a>.
</p><p>
	Once you’ve had your new thing for a week, and it becomes the new norm, seek happiness from another new thing.
</p>

<h3>3.
	Buy, not rent.
</h3><p>
	Why rent a house, castle, boat, or car, when you can buy?
</p><p>
	It’s not about the thing, it’s about identity.
	This shows who you are now.
</p>

<h3>4.
	Internalize your new status.
</h3><p>
	You worked hard to get here.
	Celebrate. Relax.
</p><p>
	Admit you are in a different class of people now, with different needs.
</p><p>
	Understand there is no going back.
</p>

<h3>5.
	Be a connoisseur.
</h3><p>
	Learn what others say is the finest.
</p><p>
	Insist on only the finest.
</p><p>
	You will now be <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StoicJoy">unhappy</a> with anything but the finest.
</p>

<h3>6.
	Get to know your possessions.
</h3><p>
	Now that you own the best, it’s time to focus on what you’ve got.
</p><p>
	Learn all about the features of your new possessions.
</p><p>
	Spend more time getting your surround sound and heated floor just right.
</p><p>
	Work out the solar panel charging of your Tesla car.
	This is important.
</p>

<h3>7.
	Acclimate to comfort.
</h3><p>
	Eliminate every discomfort from your life.
</p><p>

The idea is a simple one- many Makers asked me over the last year about printing smaller parts for the <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">Raspberry Pi Recovery Kit</a>, and I started playing around with options.  I knew I didn’t want to just re-hash the old deck, and I knew I really wanted a better display for this year.  Let’s jump in with what’s different:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>No Pelican case required!  It’s pretty obvious from the photos that you don’t need to spend $50 or more on a case, especially if you are going to drill holes in it, or don’t actually need a waterproof case.</p></li><li><p>Smaller Bill of Materials (BOM).  The original Raspberry Pi Recovery kit was very expensive to build, primarily because I sourced the coolest looking parts I could, which can be expensive or just hard to get (like the keyboard).  This project has a much simpler BOM, so simple that here it is:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>1 kg spool of Paramount 3D’s Olive Green PETG - <a href="https://amzn.to/31lMcqy">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>(Optional) 1K spool of Carbon Fiber PETG and hardened steel nozzle - <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/carbon-fiber-pro-series-petg-filament-1.75mm/sk/MHQ646TD">Link</a> and <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/e3d-v6-extra-nozzle-hardened-steel-1.75mm-x-0.40mm/sk/MSDV7HN9">Link</a></p></li><li><p>Low profile, stainless steel M5 screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/92855A513/">McMaster Carr Link</a></p></li><li><p>M5 threaded rod - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93325A413/">McMaster Carr</a> (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Evq9Vu">bolt cutters</a> are optional, but use safety gear)</p></li><li><p>Four threaded inserts - <a href="https://amzn.to/2FWzNBj">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Pimoroni HDMI Display - <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4337">Adafruit Link</a></p></li><li><p>Short HDMI Cable - <a href="https://amzn.to/31tQP21">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Four brass M2.5 standoffs - <a href="https://amzn.to/2CUUKeF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Raspberry Pi 4 - <a href="https://amzn.to/2YwHFzF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Core Design - <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/b4bWC7f62Ab-sizzling-fyyran/">Tinkercad Print Layout</a>, <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eTexyDTsTKR-stunning-kieran/">Tinkercad Assembled Version</a>, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579460">Thingiverse</a></p></li><li><p>Thumb Screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93886A240/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li><li><p>Cord Grip - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/8302K161/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Something easier to modify/hack over time.  The <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">RPRK</a> was designed to be a “finished” product and execution on an idea, and with people making their own, I thought it would be more fun this time around if people could swap out parts for their own, even ones to radically change the look of the deck.</p></li><li><p>I abandoned panel mount ports on this project.  Panel mounts are often for looks only, at least on many of my older builds, and to keep costs down I just ditched them.  Big, rounded rectangle holes work for me, and don’t cost $15 each time I want to change something.</p></li><li><p>Finally, I wanted a design I could continue to refine and modify for my own projects.  Hopefully I’ll have more of those to share soon!</p></li></ul><p>With that out of the way, let’s go over the basic design.  This can be used as assembly instructions in a pinch too.  Here’s the front frame, which the Pimoroni display will connect to.  That’s really done last, so we won’t see this part again for a while.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597467959462_38425"><p>With that out of the way let’s focus on the main frame, which helps hold it all together.  Here are some of the parts.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_18333"><div><p>The design is simple for the front- there are four threaded inserts for holding the display on the front.  Make sure they go on the front of the front frame.  There are two halves of the front frame, which is held together by the “joiner” part, which has spare M5 holes in case you want to mount something here.  I was still on a carbon fiber kick (read: I still had the hardened steel nozzle installed) so that part was printed with that stuff.  It’s great, but not required if you don’t want to deal with a second and somewhat picky filament.</p><p>Next it’s all about printing all of the rear parts, including what I call the ends and the top/bottom.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_22206"><p>The top and bottom parts are not interchangeable between top and bottom, they go on one orientation only.  This will likely take a while to print!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_26233"><div><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong></p><p>As you start to assemble be careful of the resistance of some of the deeper holes that screws and threaded rods are going into.  If you feel too much resistance you may need to drill or tap some of the holes- this depends a ton on your printer.  This is especially true of the M5 threaded rod in the next section, which can get bound in the many parts and get very difficult to move.  If you think that’s happening, back out the M5 rod and use a power drill to drill the part holes.  You really only need threading on the parts on each end of the enclosure, and even if you drill it all out, end caps/nuts will do fine to hold the whole thing together.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_27776"><div>

This design took about 7 months to design, including a 3 month break due to life and COVID impacts.  I am lucky so far to be able to continue to work on these projects, and it’s been a great relief to “finish” it.  Like all of my previous projects here, all of the design files and parts lists are in this article so people can make/modify as they see fit.  I would remind fellow makers that it’s licensed under a non-commercial license, so while you can print/modify, doing so commercially is not supported under this project.  Want to do that?  Just reach out to me and we can figure something out.</p><p>Going forward though, many of my originals like this one will be for sale in my shop.  They will be more expensive than making it yourself, so if you’re willing to try- make one!  Commissions are limited and not guaranteed, so the items from my project builds may not last.  Check out <a href="https://back7.co/store">https://back7.co/store</a> to see what’s in stock.</p><p>With that out of the way, here are some quick FAQs on my projects related to this one, the Mil-Plastic case:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Aren’t these just Raspberry Pi laptops?</strong>  Actually, they’re a bit more than that.  This is part sculpture, part functional electronics, and part exercise in design and DIY.  If you want a laptop, then that’s probably the option for you.  These are meant to be hacked/modded/upgraded and redesigned.  I don’t know of a laptop that comes even close to that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do you realize this isn’t waterproof?</strong>  Yes, this is closer to a desk toy than a field computer. </p></li><li><p><strong>How do you get your prints to look like that?</strong>  One simple answer- slow prints (no faster than 45mm/sec), a clean build plate, and no supports.</p></li><li><p><strong>Are you open to commissions or building these for sale?</strong>  I am doing very limited commissions, and they are more expensive than building it yourself.  <a href="https://back7.co/store/original-raspberry-pi-mil-plastic-assembled-kit">This original version is available in the Back7 store here</a>, but after that any additional builds will …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of its mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

<iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0On19DRA2fU?start=88" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="lazy lazy-hidden mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></center><p>Truthfully, we’re all being held hostage. I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

			<p><em>Edit from 2015/12/17: Memory model described in this article is deprecated starting Apache Spark 1.6+, the new memory model is based on UnifiedMemoryManager&nbsp;and described in <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-memory-management/" target="_blank">this article</a></em></p>
<p>Over the recent time I’ve answered a series of questions related to ApacheSpark architecture on StackOverflow. All of them seem to be caused by the absence of a good general description of the Spark architecture in the internet. Even official guide does not have that many details and of cause it lacks good diagrams. Same for the “Learning Spark” book and the materials of official workshops.</p>
<p>In this article I would try to fix this and provide a single-stop shop guide for Spark architecture in general and some most popular questions on its concepts. This article is not for complete beginners – it will not provide you an insight on the Spark main programming abstractions (RDD and DAG), but requires their knowledge as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>This is the first&nbsp;article in a series. The second one regarding shuffle <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-architecture-shuffle/" target="_blank">is available here</a>. The third one about new memory management model <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-memory-management/" target="_blank">is available here</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the official picture available on the <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.0/cluster-overview.html">http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.3.0/cluster-overview.html</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official-300x140.png?resize=300%2C140" alt="Spark Architecture Official" width="300" height="140" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png?resize=300%2C140&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-Official.png?w=607&amp;ssl=1 607w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>As you might see, it has many terms introduced at the same time – “executor”, “task”, “cache”, “Worker Node” and so on. When I started to learn the Spark concepts some time ago, it was almost the only picture about Spark architecture available over the internet and now the things didn’t change much. I personally don’t really like this because it does not show some important concepts or shows them not in the best way.</p>
<p>Let’s start from the beginning. Any, any Spark process that would ever work on your cluster or local machine is a JVM process. As for any JVM process, you can configure its heap size with <em>-Xmx</em> and <em>-Xms</em> flags of the JVM. How does this process use its heap memory and why does it need it at all? Here’s the diagram of Spark memory allocation inside of the JVM heap:</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Heap-Usage.png?resize=475%2C631" alt="Spark Heap Usage" width="475" height="631" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Heap-Usage.png?w=475&amp;ssl=1 475w, https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Heap-Usage.png?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>By default, Spark starts with 512MB JVM heap. To be on a safe side and avoid OOM error Spark allows to utilize only 90% of the heap, which is controlled by the <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction</em> parameter of Spark. Ok, as you might have heard of Spark as an in-memory tool, Spark allows you to store some data in memory. If you have read my article here <a href="https://0x0fff.com/spark-misconceptions/">https://0x0fff.com/spark-misconceptions/</a>, you should understand that Spark is not really in-memory tool, it just utilizes the memory for its LRU cache (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms</a>). So some amount of memory is reserved for the caching of the data you are processing, and this part is usually 60% of the safe heap, which is controlled by the <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction</em> parameter. So if you want to know how much data you can cache in Spark, you should take the sum of all the heap sizes for all the executors, multiply it by <em>safetyFraction</em> and by <em>storage.memoryFraction</em>, and by default it is 0.9 * 0.6 = 0.54 or 54% of the total heap size you allow Spark to use.</p>
<p>Now a bit more about the shuffle memory. It is calculated as “Heap Size” * <em>spark.shuffle.safetyFraction</em> * <em>spark.shuffle.memoryFraction</em>. Default value for <em>spark.shuffle.safetyFraction</em> is 0.8 or 80%, default value for <em>spark.shuffle.memoryFraction</em> is 0.2 or 20%. So finally you can use up to 0.8*0.2 = 0.16 or 16% of the JVM heap for the shuffle. But how does Spark uses this memory? You can get more details on this here (<a href="https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/shuffle/ShuffleMemoryManager.scala">https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/shuffle/ShuffleMemoryManager.scala</a>), but in general Spark uses this memory for the exact task it is called after – for Shuffle. When the shuffle is performed, sometimes you as well need to sort the data. When you sort the data, you usually need a buffer to store the sorted data (remember, you cannot modify the data in the LRU cache in place as it is there to be reused later). So it needs some amount of RAM to store the sorted chunks of data. What happens if you don’t have enough memory to sort the data? There is a wide range of algorithms usually referenced as “external sorting” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting</a>) that allows you to sort the data chunk-by-chunk and then merge the final result together.</p>
<p>The last part of RAM I haven’t yet cover is “unroll” memory. The amount of RAM that is allowed to be utilized by unroll process is <em>spark.storage.unrollFraction</em> * <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction</em> * <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction</em>, which with the default values equal to 0.2 * 0.6 * 0.9 = 0.108 or 10.8% of the heap. This is the memory that can be used when you are unrolling the block of data into the memory. Why do you need to unroll it after all? Spark allows you to store the data both in serialized and deserialized form. The data in serialized form cannot be used directly, so you have to unroll it before using, so this is the RAM that is used for unrolling. It is shared with the storage RAM, which means that if you need some memory to unroll the data, this might cause dropping some of the partitions stored in the Spark LRU cache.</p>
<p>This is great, because at the moment you know what exactly Spark process is and how it utilizes the memory of its JVM processes. Now let’s switch to the cluster mode – when you start a Spark cluster, how does it really look like? I like YARN so I would cover how it works in YARN, but in general it is the same for any cluster manager you use:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN-1024x826.png?resize=625%2C504" alt="Spark Architecture On YARN" width="625" height="504" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=1024%2C826&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?resize=624%2C503&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?w=1816&amp;ssl=1 1816w, https://i2.wp.com/0x0fff.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spark-Architecture-On-YARN.png?w=1250&amp;ssl=1 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>When you have a YARN cluster, it has a YARN Resource Manager daemon that controls the cluster resources (practically memory) and a series of YARN Node Managers running on the cluster nodes and controlling node resource utilization. From the YARN standpoint, each node represents a pool of RAM that you have a control over. When you request some resources from YARN Resource Manager, it gives you information of which Node Managers you can contact to bring up the execution containers for you. Each execution container is a JVM with requested heap size. JVM locations are chosen by the YARN Resource Manager and you have no control over it – if the node has 64GB of RAM controlled by YARN (<em>yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb</em> setting in yarn-site.xml) and you request 10 executors with 4GB each, all of them can be easily started on a single YARN node even if you have a big cluster.</p>
<p>When you start Spark cluster on top of YARN, you specify the amount of executors you need (<em>–num-executors</em> flag or <em>spark.executor.instances</em> parameter), amount of memory to be used for each of the executors (<em>–executor-memory</em> flag or <em>spark.executor.memory </em>&nbsp;parameter), amount of cores allowed to use for each executors (<em>–executor-cores</em> flag of <em>spark.executor.cores</em> parameter), and amount of cores dedicated for each task’s execution (<em>spark.task.cpus</em> parameter). Also you specify the amount of memory to be used by the driver application (<em>–driver-memory</em> flag or <em>spark.driver.memory</em> parameter).</p>
<p>When you execute something on a cluster, the processing of your job is split up into stages, and each stage is split into tasks. Each task is scheduled separately. You can consider each of the JVMs working as executors as a pool of task execution slots, each executor would give you <em>spark.executor.cores</em> / <em>spark.task.cpus</em> execution slots for your tasks, with a total of <em>spark.executor.instances</em> executors. Here’s&nbsp;an example. The cluster with 12 nodes running YARN Node Managers, 64GB of RAM each and 32 CPU cores each (16 physical cores with hyper threading). This way on each node you can start 2 executors with 26GB of RAM each (leave some RAM for system processes, YARN NM and DataNode), each executor with 12 cores to be utilized for tasks (leave some cores for system processes, YARN NM and DataNode). So In total your cluster would handle 12 machines * 2 executors per machine * 12 cores per executor / 1 core for each task = 288 task slots. This means that your Spark cluster would be able to run up to 288 tasks in parallel thus utilizing almost all the resources you have on this cluster. The amount of RAM you can use for caching your data on this cluster is 0.9 <em>spark.storage.safetyFraction&nbsp;</em>* 0.6 <em>spark.storage.memoryFraction&nbsp;</em>* 12 machines * 2 executors per machine * 26 GB per executor = 336.96 GB. Not that much, but in most cases it is enough.</p>
<p>So far so good, now you know how the Spark uses its JVM’s memory and what are the execution slots you have on your cluster. As you might already noticed, I didn’t stop in details on what the “task” really is. This would be a subject of the next article, but basically it is a single unit of work performed by Spark, and is executed as a <strong><em>thread</em></strong> in the executor JVM. This is the secret under the Spark low job startup time – forking additional thread inside of the JVM is much faster that bringing up the whole JVM, which is performed when you start a MapReduce job in Hadoop.</p>
<p>Now let’s focus on another Spark abstraction called “<em><strong>partition</strong></em>”. All the data you work with in Spark is split into partitions. What a single partition is and how is it determined? Partition size completely depends on the data source you use. For most of the methods to read the data in Spark you can specify the amount of partitions you want to have in your RDD. When you read a file from HDFS, you use Hadoop’s InputFormat to make it. By default each input split returned by InputFormat is mapped to a single partition in RDD. For most of the files on HDFS single input split is generated for a single block of data stored on HDFS, which equals to approximately 64MB of 128MB of data. Approximately, because the data in HDFS is split on exact block boundaries in bytes, but when it is processed it is split on the record splits. For text file the splitting character is the newline char, for sequence file it is the block end and so on. The only exception of this rule is compressed files – if you have the whole text file compressed, then it cannot be split into records and the whole file would become a single input split and thus a single partition in …</p></div></div>

<p>The amount of folks who are up in arms about <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/25/linux_kernel_email/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sarah Novotny's views on email based workflows in Linux</a> put a smirk on my face today, but I figured I would post my own opinions, having both spent way too many hours with mutt, offlineimap, postfix, and so on. I even wrote an entire article series on this for Ars Technica that is so old I can't even find it on the web any more. And Lee Hutchinson's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/how-to-run-your-own-e-mail-server-with-your-own-domain-part-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version is from 2014</a>! </p>

<p>How can someone who is wanting to contribute to the kernel possibly not know how to send a plain text email? If you can't do that then you have no business in the kernel right?</p>

<p>It's not a matter of can't, it's a matter of won't. There's a reason no one writes their resumes in LaTeX either.  Sure, I can do it. I figured it out, achievement unlocked. </p>

<p>You would be shocked at the amount of <em>core contributors to Kubernetes</em> that we routinely find aren't subscribed to the main mailing list. Sending git formatted patches over email, are you kidding? Most of my open source collaborators aren't even  <em>reading</em> their emails lol. </p>

<p>You don't send a mail to the list to propose something, you <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps" rel="noopener" target="_blank">write an enhancement proposal</a> and if you're nice, you might mention it on a list, but all that activity happens in GitHub. And if you want a meaty discussion you hop onto Zoom and discuss it high bandwidth style with your SIG before moving on. You're not going to find lengthy discussions about technical features on many of our mailing lists, you'll find them in the GitHub issues, PR comments, and meeting transcripts. </p>

<ul>
<li>VMware (my employer) has incredible Kubernetes and cloud native content: <a href="https://tgik.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TGIK</a>  is all on YouTube. </li>
<li>It's not a coincidence that <a href="https://www.openshift.com/streaming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenShift streams on twitch</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>No fair you say! There's a difference between using/consuming technical content and coordinating/running an entire project. That's the point, not any more! </p>

<p>Watch how Martin Wimpress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ICRjjjMbEE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">does a live package update in Ubuntu MATE</a>. That level of interaction with the audience isn't just the future of OSS development, it's the present. Our next kernel people, Debian maintainers, library maintainers, and everything inbetween are sitting in places like this and this is how they interact with themselves and their communities. There's just too much awesome shit in the world for people to slow down to figure out emails and mailman. And if you think this is just about email, wait until you see how much coordination and awesome stuff is happening in Discord. Yep, this is about IRC too, all of it. </p>

<p>I hear ya, I wish plaintext wasn't on the way out as a workflow, but at the end of the day, most projects aren't Linux. You can't afford an email mailing list workflow, you need to be where the developers are. New developers coming into the field are as likely to be on AOL than setting up mutt, that's just how it ended up. The distribution developers know how to do this, it's part of their job, but let's not kid ourselves,  the eyeballs are not on mailing lists.</p>

<p>Linux is missing an entire generation of new talent due to this. I don't sweat it, Linux is fundamental technology, it'll survive just fine, but it'll continue to be a workflow that won't jive with a number of people coming into the field. </p>

<p>Also it's pretty evident from most Microsoft conspiracy comments that no one bothered to look up Sarah's OSS credentials, but of course, that didn't surprise you either. Her points still stand if you replace GitHub with GitLab, or whatever tool you prefer. </p>
