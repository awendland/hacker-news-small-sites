Under the Rain-Making Control Act (1967) you are advised that it is an offence to <a href="http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/ltobjst8.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/9D788B5BB4776F24CA257C3100008D44/$FILE/67-7637aa016%20authorised.pdf" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>"carry out unauthorised rain-making operations"</u></a>. </p><p id="viewer-5hc95">Getting a measure of how many laws there are in Australia is not easy, but one practitioner's resource <a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com.au/products/the-laws-of-australia/" target="_top" rel="noopener"><em><u>The Laws of Australia</u></em></a> proudly lists over 40,000 legal propositions across 320 specific topics and 36 broad topic areas. Despite the legal maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse, it is clear that it is impossible for even an interested reader to have a full and complete knowledge of the law - let alone a disinterested reader. </p><p id="viewer-eodrf">In the Design of Everyday Things, Donald Norman describes two crucial principles for a useful object: <em>Discoverability</em> and <em>Understanding</em>. It should be easy to learn how an object works, and clear to see how to use it. For the vast majority of laws, this is not the case: a typical Act may run for many hundreds of pages, define case-specific jargon, refer to rules set out in external pieces of legislation, involve ambiguities, internal inconsistencies, or simply poor writing (the 528 page <a href="https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2001-071" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>Duties Act in Queensland</u></a> is a prime example).</p><p id="viewer-8n06i">In part, this is nature of the beast: the administrative structure for a law to be changed is a complicated and multi-staged affair, involving a parliament which will not seek to amend a law unless it serves for political capital. Repairing cracks in the sidewalk is necessary, but it's nothing you want to turn into a press statement. As a result law is updated only sporadically, and often in response to the most vocal and focal failures rather than being optimised. </p><p id="viewer-ekgl9">There are moves to improve this process. One of the more interesting is being led by the CSIRO <a href="https://data61.csiro.au/en/Our-Research/Our-Work/Future-Cities/Optimising-service-delivery/RaaP" target="_top" rel="noopener"><em><u>Regulation as a Platform</u></em></a><em> </em>project which recommends converting regulatory rules into machine readable logic which can be quickly checked for internal consistency, and clearer ways this may communicated to the public or automated for simple administrative tasks. Advances in natural language processing may additionally aid in users being able to ask for clarification for a legal rule, and receive general advice from a machine.</p><p id="viewer-ci8o1">The idea <a href="https://theconversation.com/csiro-wants-our-laws-turned-into-computer-code-heres-why-thats-a-bad-idea-130131" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>has received pushback</u></a> due to concern that an algorithmic approach to law removes the human element and the role of discretion. Moreover the stink of Robodebt scandal makes some leery of outsourcing application of the law too far to machines. However the idea has some merit - not only in terms of directly using new tools for searching or interpreting the law; but also conceptually, using programming concepts to better understand how law may be better designed to run efficiently and user-friendly. </p><p id="viewer-dlmsk">In many ways a law is a program which runs on society rather than on circuits: wet, squishy humanware rather than hardware. It involves a system of logic and operation. Functions which are defined and acted upon in a systematic order, with constraints provided which restrict the operation of a system. The analogy is particularly clear for administrative law applied by rote. However, it also applies for laws which require the application of discretion or decision-making (the decision maker is simply a sub-operation requiring a person). </p><p id="viewer-6vdkf">In code, there is the concept of algorithmic efficiency - how resources (time and storage) vary with the size of an operation. This is measured by reference to the cost of a base operation (e.g. adding up two numbers, or plucking out an item from a list). The common measure is the worst case running time: a constant operation <em>O(1)</em> runs the same time no matter the size of the input; a linear operation <em>O(N) </em>runs as the sum of the base operations; and polynomial operations [e.g. <em>O(N^2)</em>],<em> </em>and exponential operations [e.g. <em>O(2^N)</em>] run increasingly less efficiently with the size of the input. Designing an efficient algorithm is understandably a goal for a good program that will run fast and easily with little overhead. </p><p id="viewer-dshb6">In principle the idea of algorithmic complexity also applies to law. Here we have additional forms of resources: costs of implementation (the cost of administrative public servants), costs of interpretation (the cost of understanding the law, e.g. employing external legal advice, reading legislation, or checking informal explainers), and costs in terms of error correction (the judicial system, including the many barriers to entry). While less tangible, these are similar to those borne by computers in algorithmic complexity: they represent the cost of resources required to run a particular process, which may be comprised of many smaller processes or required actions. </p><p id="viewer-4kiqo">As a result programming principles can be applied to make law more efficient and user-friendly. The aim is to minimise the total costs of operation while sufficiently achieving the desired legal aim. Looking at the regular individual operations involved in a procedure, including complex, expensive, or repeated operations, is the first step in improving the efficiency of a law. Beyond thinking about law in terms of algorithmic complexity, there are a number of core programming techniques that lend themselves to direct analogies in legal design. Many of the rules outlined in The Pragmatic Programmer (outline <a href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-se/teaching/K-CCD-2014/Pragmatic-Programmer-summary.pdf" target="_top" rel="noopener"><u>here</u></a>) are directly applicable - particularly ideas around orthogonality (reducing cross-dependencies), maintaining single unambiguous definitions, and building in exception handling are all good concepts. </p><p id="viewer-1pb16">It's no coincidence that the authors of The Pragmatic Programmer turned to legal analogies when outlining concepts for programmers. As is often the case when two fields share conceptual links learnings from the two domains can flow in both directions, and legal professionals and policy designers would be advised to learn and take from design techniques in computer science where they can. </p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="body"><h2>👁👄👁</h2><h2>WHAT IT REALLY IS</h2><p>JUNE 26TH, 2020</p><p>You’re probably wondering what this is. Well, it started off as just what it is.</p><p>A group of us changed our Twitter names to include "👁👄👁" because we thought it was a funny trend from TikTok. People started noticing the change on their timelines, noting the creepiness of the emojis in particular. For a brief period of time, everyone who added the emojis to their name was added to a giant Twitter group conversation. From there, things unfolded.</p><p>What started out as a meme in our small group chat grew bigger than we ever imagined. So we thought about how to make use of the hype cycle we’d stumbled upon. But honestly, we didn’t have to think too hard: in this moment, there’s pretty much no greater issue to amplify than the systemic racism and anti-Blackness much of the world is only beginning to wake up to. We’re excited that we could use our newfound platform to drive action towards a few causes that are doing important work towards racial justice: <a href="https://thelovelandfoundation.org/loveland-therapy-fund/">Loveland Foundation Therapy Fund</a>,<a href="https://www.theokraproject.com/">The Okra Project</a>,<a href="https://www.innocenceproject.org/">The Innocence Project</a>, and others.</p><p>We’ve done pretty well for a non-existent product. 👁👄👁.fm was the top product of the day on Product Hunt (Theranos who?). The website accumulated 20,000 email signups and thousands of tweets sharing the link. We were covered in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/face-emoji-twitter-it-is-what-it-is-promo-a9587351.html">The Independent</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularmstrongtech/2020/06/26/what-is--oh-it-is-what-it-is/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">Forbes</a>. We got shoutouts from <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/what-does-mean-well">Josh Constine</a> and <a href="https://wfh.substack.com/p/the-6-builders-who-will-thrive-in">Brianne Kimmel</a>. Some folks on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/hg26ip/whats_the_deal_with_this_it_is_what_it_is_app/">Reddit</a> puzzled over who we were. <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1276585276626726913?s=20">Andrew Chen</a> of Andreessen Horowitz, <a href="https://twitter.com/shannonpurser/status/1276631647157235712">Shannon Purser</a> of Stranger Things, and <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1276418907968925696">Elon Musk</a> may have subtweeted us? The <a href="https://twitter.com/itiseyemoutheye">@itiseyemoutheye</a> Twitter and accounts of our teammates were inundated with invite requests. Most importantly, we raised over $60,000 in donations from people who hoped to get special treatment within our fabled waitlist. An anonymous donor has agreed to match the first $50,000 and we would love to work with anyone else who wants to match. Please DM us! </p>In a strange way, this sort of became an anti-statement against what we’d all seen on tech Twitter. We’re a <a href="https://xn--mp8hai.fm/demographics.png">diverse</a>, ragtag group of young technologists tired of the status quo tech industry, and thought that we could make the industry think a bit more about its actions. Despite calls-to-action like that “<a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">It’s Time to Build</a>” essay we’ve all read, most of the industry (from product teams to VC) still stays obsessed with exclusive social apps that regularly ignore — or even silence — real needs faced by marginalized people all over the world, and exclude these folks from the building process. As an industry, we need to do better.<p>We sincerely thank you for spreading the word and donating to these important causes. In conclusion, it is what it is: a meme that leveraged the relentless hype of exclusive apps and redirected it towards a critical social need. Thank you, and remember that unlike 👁👄👁, #BlackLivesMatter and other social movements aren't trends or hype cycles. Let’s keep giving back as best as we can.</p><p>Signed,</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/itiseyemoutheye/following">The 👁👄👁 Team</a></p><p><a href="https://shop.itiswhatitis.fm/">We do have merch though.</a><br>All proceeds are donated to organizations that support Black lives.</p></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These are some of the common myths about Patents and Trademarks in startups.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have a startup idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>It’s natural to feel defensive about our <a href="https://hitstartup.com/startup-ideas-vs-problems/" target="_blank">startup idea</a>, but patents are for invention/innovation and not for a startup idea; even if we get nightmares about <a href="https://hitstartup.com/faang-will-steal-my-idea/" target="_blank">FAANG stealing our startup idea</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-an-innovative-app-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have an innovative app idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>Most countries don’t allow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200213051434/https://www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/software_patents_fulltext.html" target="_blank">patent for a software</a>. Economic theories, methods of doing business, mathematical methods or computer programs&nbsp;as such&nbsp;are not patentable inventions in several countries.</p><h3 id="my-patent-attorney-said-they-are-patentable">My patent attorney said they are patentable</h3><p>Did you read all the clauses in the agreement you signed with your patent attorney? The decision to award a patent to an invention/innovation lies solely with the patent examiner of the country. By the time a patent application is filed, till it comes to examination, several years and thousands of dollars would have been spent.</p><p>Although ethically, a patent attorney should explicitly convey their doubts on patentability of an invention, few rarely do. Even when Prior Art Search(Searching for conflicting patents) is conducted by the patent attorney, they are not always successful in bringing up the conflicting patents because our patent application is not drafted yet.</p><p>But, when the Govt. patent examiner does the Prior Art Search while examining our patent application, they will likely find conflicting patents if it exists.</p><h3 id="i-have-paid-my-patent-attorney-explained-my-invention-now-all-i-have-to-do-is-just-sit-tight-for-a-patent">I have paid my patent attorney, explained my invention, now all I have to do is just sit tight for a patent</h3><p>An average patent attorney drafts patent for anything from innovation in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidet" target="_blank">bidet</a> to quantum computers, so they are experts in using language to define an invention but they are rarely an expert in any field of invention.</p><p>So, this requires utmost care from the inventor to work along with the patent drafter to articulate their invention with appropriate vocabulary.</p><p>Unfortunately, patent attorneys tend to force the inventor to not to be specific in describing their invention in the patent application in order to exploit the loop holes in patent examination; This may help in getting the patent, but it also enables someone else to exploit the same loop holes to file a patent for the copy of our invention by just changing the grammar/vocabulary because our patent was too generic.</p><h3 id="i-have-filed-for-a-patent-no-one-would-copy-my-innovation-invention">I have filed for a patent, no one would copy my innovation/invention</h3><p>Examination of patent takes several years, although in the meantime we could use ‘patent-pending’ tag if our patent application gets published, finding someone who is copying our invention takes proactive approach. If the copied invention is being applied for patent, we need to detect it from published journal of the patent office and raise a concern.</p><p>All these takes extraordinarily focused effort and budget.</p><h3 id="i-have-applied-for-a-patent-via-pct-i-will-receive-patent-for-all-countries">I have applied for a patent via PCT, I will receive patent for all countries</h3><p><a href="https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/" target="_blank">PCT - Patent Cooperation Treaty</a> simplifies the process of applying for a patent in several countries who are part of the PCT treaty, but the process of obtaining a patent depends upon the individual country’s patent laws.</p><p>Even during filing PCT, the second phase i.e. national phase involves filing documents for patent application in the respective individual countries requiring working with the patent attorney’s of those countries resulting in thousands of dollars of expense for each country we wish to apply for via PCT.</p><p>We can extrapolate the same process for patent examination in each of those countries.</p><p>Then there are certain countries which even while being part of the PCT, doesn’t enforce patent protection for inventions of other countries in order to protect their local businesses which copies our invention.</p><h3 id="i-have-received-my-patent-it-would-prevent-someone-from-copying-my-invention">I have received my patent, it would prevent someone from copying my invention</h3><p>Like any law, existence of a law doesn’t prevent someone from violating it; enforcement and judicial process should uphold that law. Similarly, existence of patent doesn’t prevent someone from copying our invention.</p><p>We need to find the violator, pursue an often lengthy and expensive judicial process to claim our right to the invention protected by the patent.</p><h3 id="i-m-the-inventor-in-the-patent-i-can-do-anything-with-it">I’m the inventor in the patent, I can do anything with it</h3><p>Unless the inventor in the patent is the owner of the patent, the inventor has no right to the patent. This is often the case when businesses file patents, where the business is the owner in the patent and the employee is the inventor in the patent.</p><h3 id="patents-are-only-for-protecting-my-invention">Patents are only for protecting my invention</h3><p>The main reason to protect the invention is to reap the value of the invention if needed. Patents offer commercial and strategic value to businesses.</p><p>So, patents are often used for trading them for money or for other patents in organizations apart from using it for protecting their inventions.</p><h3 id="patents-make-me-look-cool">Patents make me look cool</h3><p>Not necessarily, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/new-low-bad-patent-patent-troll-sues-ventilator-company" target="_blank">patent trolls</a> have left a bad taste in the inventor/innovator community; so much so that many are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIihrcqJYA" target="_blank">choosing not to file patent for their invention</a>.</p><p>Expenses, effort, lengthy unfair judicial trials has made several startups to not pursue patent for their invention in favor of capital efficiency.</p><h3 id="open-source-projects-doesn-t-need-patents">Open-source projects doesn’t need patents</h3><p>Open-source projects might need patents to <a href="https://golang.org/PATENTS" target="_blank">protect itself from getting sued for patent infringement</a>. Open-source projects protected by patents can prevent large organizations from stealing our project <a href="https://keivan.io/the-day-appget-died/" target="_blank">without due credit</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-product-name-i-need-to-trademark-it">I have a startup/product name, I need to trademark it</h3><p>Unless the startup/product has created value for its customers, so that a counterfeiter is using that startup/product name for forgery; trademarks for startup/product names are useless. Besides, in most countries just <a href="https://hitstartup.com/when-to-register-our-startup/" target="_blank">incorporating/registering our startup as a company</a> would prevent anyone else from using the same name for their company.</p><h3 id="trademark-automatically-applies-to-the-name-and-the-logo">Trademark automatically applies to the name and the logo</h3><p>Trademarking the name and logo are separate process namely wordmark and device mark respectively. Device mark might include text when it’s alongside the logo.</p></div></div>]]>

In an age where your personal data is being shared with far more companies than you can imagine, the folks at <a href="https://techpolicyinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Prince_Wallsten_How-Much-is-Privacy-Worth-Around-the-World-and-Across-Platforms.pdf" target="_blank" data-proxy-href="/proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Ftechpolicyinstitute.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F02%2FPrince_Wallsten_How-Much-is-Privacy-Worth-Around-the-World-and-Across-Platforms.pdf&amp;hash=493602e26ad60bf36acbdc1d6d52c624" rel="nofollow noopener">Tech Policy Institute</a> decided to take a poll. The general public was asked how much money they believe they should be paid by data amalgamators in exchange for their browsing habits, location history, etc. The answers from U.S. respondents ranged from caring almost not at all to just see ads, to demanding $10 for data collectors to see total bank account balances.</p><p>

Across all of the activities covered, Americans would only demand about $3.50/month on average to have each individual piece of personal data shared. A figure far too low when digital advertising revenue eclipsed $100 billion in 2019.</p><p>

As it stands now, the public is being paid $0 for all of the personal information which they choose to share, and for the information which they may not even know is being collected. That information is being used to build data profiles on an individual level which are then repackaged as “targeted advertisements” through ad networks. It’s why you can be searching for something on Google on your desktop and 6 hours later you see multiple ads on Facebook for the same thing for which you were searching on a different machine earlier.</p><p>

VPNs can help cut down on much of the data we unwittingly share, though you’re still going to end up sharing some information if you log into the same accounts across multiple networks or devices.</p><p>

Big Data has, unfortunately, creeped into our lives and is further entrenching itself as time goes on. What’s scary is that Americans, for the most part, do not seem to be concerned about it. Until legislation is passed limiting what can and cannot be collected, there isn’t a lot that can be done about data amalgamation on the macro level. On an individual level, taking care to opt-out of sharing whenever possible, using a VPN and limiting the number of apps on your phone can protect you to some degree.</p></div>

  <p><time datetime="2020-06-09T09:45:00-0400">Tue, Jun 9, 2020</time></p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/posts/hp712-nextstep-part-1">last post of this series</a>, I set up NeXTstep on an HP PA-RISC <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/pizzaboxes/hp712">workstation</a>. Today, I’m going to get down to business: configure networking, install system patches, outfit it with developer tools, and install some useful software!</p>
<p>As with the previous post, I’ve also made a YouTube video that covers roughly the same topics! If video is your speed, I’d love for you to check it out!</p>
<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4hs4K7AEvQ" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My goal is to end up with a capable machine that I can use like it might have been when new, and learn from the experience.</p>
<h2 id="foreshadowing-networking-woes">Foreshadowing networking woes</h2>
<p>While it is possible to transfer files from SCSI drives (or even floppies!), <strong>getting a pizzabox on my home network makes loading software much easier</strong>.
I first tried out NeXTstep on this workstation a couple years ago. The OS installed OK, but I ran in to trouble with networking. I was initially optimistic that I would figure it out:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think I'm done for the day but soon if I can fight with NFS and NetInfo (lolololol) I can get screenshots off it and software on</p>— cron mom (@sophaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/sophaskins/status/962427825608429568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2018</a></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>NARRATOR</strong>: she did not soon win the fight with NFS and NetInfo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hang on a second: NeXTstep is a workstation-focused Unix operating system from the 80s-90s - <strong>how could it be difficult to get it on a network</strong>? The answer is a thing called NetInfo.</p>
<p>In a surprise to exactly no one, NeXTstep, being from a company founded by Steve Jobs, had it’s own NeXT-only ecosystem of tools that fit together amazingly well. <strong>The cornerstone of NeXTstep networking was NetInfo</strong>. If you had a collection of NeXT computers on a network, NetInfo gave you a system to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manage user accounts that would work across all machines</li>
<li>configure file sharing</li>
<li>control permissions around access to network resources</li>
<li>assign IP addresses and hostnames</li>
<li>quickly bring new machines in to the network</li>
<li>serve this information in a highly-available manner</li>
</ul>
<p>which is to say: NetInfo is a “directory services” system. That’s all well and good - in the early 1990s that space had many competitors and a “right path” hadn’t yet been established, but…<strong>I don’t <em>want</em> my machine to be part of a directory</strong>, **I just want it to be on my existing TCP/IP network.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-simple-network">Starting a “simple” network</h2>
<p>With that in mind, I (naively) attempted to use the “SimpleNetworkStarter” application.</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/simple-network-starter-1.png" alt="SimpleNetworkStarter">
    </p>
    <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/simple-network-starter-1.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption>
          <p>SimpleNetworkStarter</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>The SimpleNetworkStarter window has three “steps”:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>how we’ll integrate</strong> with an existing NetInfo network (since I don’t intend to interact with one at all, I have to choose “Provide the services specified below”, a sort of catch-all)</li>
<li>Specify <strong>my hostname and IP address</strong> - if I were connecting to an existing NetInfo network, I might not have to do this. “Network Options” lets me set more granular IP settings like netmask and gateway; “NetInfo Options” lets me choose how to integrate with existing domains (if relevant).</li>
<li>Setup <strong>network services</strong>: for my setup I don’t really want <em>any</em> of these things, but as a standalone NeXTstep system, I do have to “Maintain the master copy of network administrative data” (aka, the NetInfo database).</li>
</ol>

<p>So far, this feels like a really good start, but will it let me fetch files from an NFS share?</p>
<h2 id="networking-woes">Networking woes</h2>
<p>I immediately tried connecting to my NAS over NFS - after all, the main point of setting up networking was making it easier to transfer files. Unfortunately, it didn’t work - I could set up the NFS mount with NFSMananger (more on how to do that later), but the mountpoint would always be empty. Here you can see me attempting to reach it by IP address:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/failing-nfs-mount.png" alt="a failing NFS mount">

      <figcaption>
          <p>a failing NFS mount</p>

  </figure>
</div>

<p>So I had <em>some</em> sort of problem. To narrow down potential issues, I ran a few tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>attempting to ping my NAS</strong> from the workstation - this turned out to not work because NeXTstep doesn’t seem to have any <code>ping</code> command. There are probably ways to accomplish something equivalent with the tools it <em>does</em> have, but I just moved on</li>
<li><strong>attempting to ping the workstation</strong> from elsewhere on my network. This worked - I was able to ping it from my laptop!</li>
<li><strong>attempting to connect to my NAS with FTP</strong> - one of the few network tools NeXTstep <em>does</em> seem to have is FTP, so I gave it a shot. To my surprise, this works!</li>
</ul>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-ip.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully)">

      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>It did not work via hostname, though, which points to at least some trouble with DNS. Taking a deeper look at the “NeXTstep 3.3 Network and
System Administration Manual” section on “<a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Docs/NeXTStep/3.3/nsa/11_MixedNet.htmld/index.html">NEXTSTEP Computers in a Mixed Network</a>” (which I probably should have done earlier) shows that <strong>I need to manually configure DNS</strong>. There’s no GUI options for it, you just have to write out an <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/resolv-conf.png" alt="editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi">

          <p>editing /etc/resolv.conf in vi</p>

  </figure>
</div>

<p>After rebooting, I was able to access the NAS via FTP by hostname:


</p><div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-hostname.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname">

      <figcaption>
          <p>connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>But still couldn’t use NFS. What gives? I have network connectivity in both directions, and DNS is also now working! I believe this is as far as I got a few years ago, and man I was FRUSTRATED.</p>
<p>Eventually I thought to look in the system log (<code>/usr/adm/messages</code>) for hints:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/dmesg.png" alt="an error from autonfsmount">
    </p>
    <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/dmesg.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption>
          <p>an error from autonfsmount</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>and there it was:</p>
<pre><code>autonfsmount: Can't get my address
</code></pre><p>Can’t get…<em>my</em> address? Doesn’t the computer know its own address? While I don’t know <em>why</em> it has to do this (googling has provided me a couple of <a href="https://rute.gerdesas.com/node31.html">quick asides</a> mentioning it, but not much detail), <strong>mounting an NFS server requires working <em>reverse</em> DNS for your IP</strong>.</p>
<p>I do have a real-ish DNS server for my home network, and it populates based on DHCP leases and IP reservations. This workstation, though, was just <strong>using an IP that I habitually hardcode for pizzaboxes (192.168.1.200)</strong>. I double-checked the DHCP server config, and it was indeed set up with a different host for that IP, and not set up at all for this hostname. I replaced that entry with one for <code>hp712</code> at <code>192.168.1.200</code> for the MAC address of my workstation, and crossed my fingers.</p>
<p>It worked! I could browse my NAS from the file-browser.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-an-nfs-mount">Setting up an NFS mount</h2>
<p>After all that rigamarole, the right way to configure a remote NFS mount goes through the NFSManager.app. While NFSManager lets you configure both “exports” (local directories I share with others) and “imports” (remote directories I want to mount locally).</p>

<p>That’s it? A lot of struggle got me to this point, but <em>finally</em> I can transfer files.</p>
<h2 id="patch-tuesday">Patch Tuesday</h2>
<p>The first order of business is to <strong>run system updates</strong>. NeXTstep 3.3 was released in mid-1995, and it had three patch updates: the <a href="https://www.nextop.de/NeXTAnswers/2066.html">first</a> at the end of 1995, and the second and <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/nextstep3.3_patch_3_overview.pdf">third</a> in late 1999. Since NeXT were acquired by Apple in 1997, this patch was made by Apple to address Y2k bugs and other longstanding issues. Thanks, Apple! <a href="https://youtu.be/gaI6kBVyu00?t=28"><em>Thapple</em></a>.</p>
<p>The third patch is a cumulative update, so that should be all I need. Nextcomputers.org generously <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/">hosts</a> the patch for download. Because I’m using an HP PA-RISC machine, I need <code>NS33RISCUserPatch3.tar</code>. System updates need to be installed as the <code>root</code> user, and if you run them as <code>me</code> (the default user) NeXTstep doesn’t prompt to escalate privilges, it just gives an error. Thus, I need to log in as <code>root</code> directly. In order to do that, I need to give the <code>me</code> user a password so the system will stop automatically logging in at boot (giving me a chance to log in as <code>root</code>). To set a password, you go to Preferences.app and navigate to the lock icon.</p>

<p>By default, the <code>root</code> password is blank (you can of course fix this after login in the same way as setting a password for the <code>me</code> account). I navigated to where I had put the patch tarball on my NAS, copied it to the HP 712, and unarchived it.</p>

<p>After a reboot, I’m on the most recent version of NeXTstep for PA-RISC, and ready for the year 2000!</p>

<p>What’s next for making a usable system? Developer tools! <strong>NeXTstep came on two sets of discs - “User” for the main operating system, and the optional “Developer” disc</strong> with compilers, GUI building tools, libraries, and documentation. While there were separate versions of NeXTstep User for CISC (m68k and i386) and RISC (PA-RISC and SPARC) platforms, the Developer disc is “quad-fat” - it contains binaries for all four platforms.

<b>Abstract.</b> ACM's 2018 A.M. Turing Award was about
<em>deep learning</em> in artificial neural networks.
ACM lauds the awardees for work based on algorithms
and conceptual foundations first published by other researchers 
whom the awardees failed to cite
(see </a><a href="#exec">Executive Summary</a>
and Sec. 
<a href="#I">I</a>,
<a href="#V">V</a>,

<a href="#XXI">XXI</a>,
<a href="#XIII">XIII</a>, 
<a href="#XIV">XIV</a>,  
<a href="#XX">XX</a>, 
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>).
ACM explicitly mentions "astonishing" deep learning breakthroughs in 4 fields:
<a href="#A"> (A) speech recognition</a>, 
<a href="#B">(B) natural language processing</a>, 
<a href="#C">(C) robotics</a>, 
<a href="#D">(D) computer vision</a>,
as well as "powerful" new deep learning tools in 3 fields: 
<a href="#VII">(VII) medicine, astronomy, materials science</a>.
Most of these breakthroughs and tools, however, were directly based on 
the results of my own labs in the past 3 decades 
 (e.g., Sec.  
<a href="#A">A</a>,
<a href="#B">B</a>,
<a href="#C">C</a>,
<a href="#D">D</a>,
<a href="#VII">VII</a>,
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>,
<a href="#VI">VI</a>,
<a href="#XVI">XVI</a>). 
I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history (e.g., Sec. 
<a href="#II">II</a>,  
<a href="#V">V</a>, 
<a href="#XX">XX</a>,
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>) 
and also 
mention 8 of our direct priority disputes 
with Bengio &amp; Hinton (Sec.  <a href="#XVII">XVII</a>, <a href="#I">I</a>).

<p>We must stop crediting the wrong people for inventions made by others.
Instead let's heed the recent call in the journal <em>Nature</em>:
<b>"Let 2020 be the year in which we value those who ensure that 
science is self-correcting"</b> <a href="#SV20">[SV20]</a>.
Like those who know me can testify, finding and citing original sources of scientific and technological innovations is important to me, whether they are mine or other people's <a href="#DL1">[DL1]</a> <a href="#DL2">[DL2]</a> <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a> <a href="#NASC1">[NASC1-9]</a>. The present page is offered as a resource for computer scientists who share this inclination. 
By grounding research in its true intellectual foundations and crediting the original inventors, 
I am not diminishing important contributions made by popularizers of those inventions. 
My goal is to encourage the entire community to be more scholarly in its efforts, to recognize the foundational work that sometimes gets lost in the frenzy of modern AI and machine learning,
and to fight plagiarism in all of its more or less subtle forms. 
I am also inviting others to contribute additional relevant 
references (send them to <em>juergen@idsia.ch</em>). 



</p><p> I will focus on 
contributions praised by
ACM's official justification <a href="#T19">[T19]</a> of the

<b>I'll point out 
that  highly cited publications of the awardees ignored fundamental

While Drs. LeCun &amp; Bengio &amp; Hinton (<b>LBH for short</b>)  
have made  useful improvements of algorithms for 
artificial neural networks (<b>NNs</b>) 
and deep learning (e.g., </a><a href="#I">Sec.  I</a>), ACM lauds
them for more visible 
work based on fundamental methods whose inventors they did not cite,
not even in later surveys
(this may actually explain some of  ACM's misattributions). I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history.

<b>Sec. <a href="#II">II</a>:</b> 
In contrast to ACM's claims, 
NNs for pattern recognition etc. were introduced long before the 1980s. 
 <b>Deep learning with multilayer perceptrons started in 1965</b> through Ivakhnenko &amp; Lapa
long before LBH who have never cited them, not even in recent work.
<b>In the 1980s,</b> "modern" gradient-based learning 
worked only for rather shallow NNs,
<b>but it became really deep in 1991 in my lab,</b>
first through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201">unsupervised pre-training of NNs</a>, 
then through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">supervised LSTM</a>.
<b>Sec.  <a href="#I">I</a></b> contains 4 subsections 
<b><a href="#A">A</a>, <a href="#B">B</a>, <a href="#C">C</a>, <a href="#D">D</a></b>
on <b>the  4 deep learning "breakthroughs" explicitly 
mentioned by ACM</b>. ACM does not mention that they were 
mostly based on deep learning techniques of my team:

</p><p>
<b>Sec.
<a href="#A">A: Speech Recognition</a></b> (see also <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp; <a href="#XV">XV</a>): The first superior end-to-end neural speech recognition 
combines two methods from my lab: <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a> (1990s-2005) and CTC (2006), applied to speech in 2007. 
Hinton (2012) and Bengio (<a href="#XV">XV</a>)
still used an old hybrid approach of the 1980s and 90s;
Hinton et al. (2012) did not compare it to 
our revolutionary CTC-LSTM (<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">which was soon on most smartphones</a>).

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#B">B: Natural Language Processing</a></b> (see also  <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp;  <a href="#XVI">XVI</a>): 
The first superior end-to-end neural machine translation  
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">soon used for several billions of
translations each day by the big platform companies</a>)
was also based on our <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#C">C: Robotics</a></b>.
Our LSTM trained by <b>Reinforcement Learning</b> (RL) was also the core of the 
most visible breakthroughs in robotics and video games.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#D">D: Computer Vision</a></b>
(see also   
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a> &amp; <a href="#XIV">XIV</a>  &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a>  &amp;  <a href="#VI">VI</a>)
was revolutionized by <b>convolutional NNs</b> (CNNs).
The basic CNN architecture is due to Fukushima (1979). 
NNs with convolutions were later (1987) combined by Waibel with backpropagation and weight sharing, 
and applied to speech. <b>All before</b> LeCun's CNN work  (<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>).
We showed twice (1991-95 and 2006-10) that 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">deep NNs 
don't need unsupervised 
pre-training</a> (in contrast to Hinton's claims). Our team (Ciresan et al.)  
made CNNs fast &amp; deep enough for  
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html">superior computer vision  in 2011</a>,
<b>winning 4 image recognition contests in a row
before Hinton's team won one</b>. ResNet (ImageNet 2015 winner)
is a special case of our earlier <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/highway-networks.html">Highway Nets</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec.  <a href="#XIV">XIV:</a></b>
Again ACM recognizes work that failed to cite the pioneers.
Long before Hinton (2012), Hanson (1990) had a variant of <b>dropout</b>, 
and v. d. Malsburg (1973) had <b>rectified linear neurons</b>; Hinton did not cite them.
Already in 2011,
our deep &amp; fast CNN  more than <b>"halved the error rate for object recognition"</b> (ACM's wording) 
in a computer vision contest 
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/superhumanpatternrecognition.html">where LeCun participated</a>), 
long before Hinton's similar CNN (2012). 
<b>Sec. <a href="#XI">XI</a>:</b>  ACM mentions GPU-accelerated NNs  
pioneered by Jung &amp; Oh (2004). LBH
did not cite them.
Our deep GPU-NN of 2010 debunked <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">unsupervised pre-training (introduced by myself in 1991 and later championed by Hinton)</a>, 
and our GPU-CNN of 2011 was the first  
to win contests in <b>computer 
vision</b> (explicitly mentioned by ACM).
 

</p><p>
<b>Sec.  
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a></b>:
ACM credits LeCun for developing CNNs. However, the foundations of CNNs were laid earlier by 
Fukushima and Waibel  (Sec. <a href="#D">D</a>).
 ACM also explicitly mentions <b>autonomous driving</b> and <b>medical image analysis</b>.
The first team to win relevant international contests in these fields 
through deep CNNs was ours (2011, 2012, 2013).
<b>Sec.  
<a href="#VII">VII</a>:</b> ACM explicitly mentions  <b>medicine</b> and
 <b>materials science</b>. Our deep NNs were the 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/first-time-deep-learning-won-medical-imaging-contest-september-2012.html">first to win medical imaging competitions</a>
 in 2012 and 2013, and the first to apply deep NNs to material defect detection in industry (since 2010).


</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#XII">XII</a> &amp; <a href="#XIX">XIX</a> &amp; <a href="#XXI">XXI</a>:</b> Modern

Hinton has never cited him.
<b>Sec. <a href="#XX">XX</a>:</b> ACM credits LeCun for work on

on this (since 1965).
<b>Sec. <a href="#XXI">XXI</a>:</b> ACM credits LeCun for work on

And also for work on
<b>deep learning for graphs</b> that failed to cite 
the earlier work  by Sperduti &amp; Goller &amp; Küchler &amp; Pollack.



</p><p>
<b>Sec. 
<a href="#XV">XV</a>:</b> ACM credits Bengio for hybrids of NNs and  probabilistic models of sequences. 
His work
was not the first on this topic, and is 
not important for <b>modern deep learning speech recognition systems</b> (mentioned by ACM) based on our CTC-LSTM
 (Sec.

June 26, 2020 | https://www.nickwilcox.com/blog/arm_vs_x86_memory_model/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.nickwilcox.com/blog/arm_vs_x86_memory_model/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>With Apple’s recent announcement that they are moving away from Intel X86 CPU’s to their own ARM CPU’s for future laptops and desktops I thought it would be a good time to take a look at the some differences that can affect systems programmers working in Rust.</p>

<p>One of the key areas where ARM CPU’s differ from X86 is their memory model. This article will take a look at what a memory model is and how it can cause code to be correct on one CPU but cause race conditions on another.</p>

<h2 id="memory-models">Memory Models</h2>

<p>The way loads and stores to memory interact between multiple threads on a specific CPU is called that architecture’s Memory Model.</p>

<p>Depending on the memory model of the CPU, multiple writes by one thread may become visible to another thread in a different order to the one they were issued in.</p>

<p>The same is true of a thread issuing multiple reads. A thread issuing multiple reads may receive “snapshots” of global state that represent points in time ordered differently to the order of issue.</p>

<p>Modern hardware needs this flexibility to be able to maximize the throughput of memory operations. While CPU clock rates and core counts have been increasing with each new CPU iteration, memory bandwidth has struggled to keep up. Moving data from memory to operate on is often the bottle neck in the performance of applications.</p>

<p>If you’ve never written multi-threaded code, or only done so using higher level synchronization primitives such as <code>std::sync::Mutex</code>, you’ve probably never been exposed to the details of the memory model. This is because the CPU, despite whatever reordering it’s memory model allows it to perform, always presents a consistent view of memory to the current thread.</p>

<p>If we look at the below snippet of code that writes to memory and then reads the same memory straight back, we will always get the expected value of <code>58</code> back when we read. There is never the case that we’d read some stale value from memory.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read_after_write</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>u32_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>u32_ptr</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>();</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"the value is {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_value</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>I’m using volatile operations because if I used normal pointer operations the compiler is smart enough to skip the memory read and just prints the value <code>58</code>. 
Volatile operations stop the compiler from reordering or skipping our memory operation. However they have no affect on hardware.</em></p>

<p>Once we introduce multiple threads, we’re now exposed to the fact that the CPU may be reordering our memory operations.</p>

<p>We can examine the snippet below in a multi-threaded context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>writer</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>reader</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>(),</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we initialize the contents of both pointers to <code>0</code>, and then run each function in a different thread, we can list the possible outcomes for the reader. We know that there is no synchronization, but based on our experience with single threaded code we think the possible return values are <code>(0, 0)</code>, <code>(58, 0)</code> or <code>(58, 42)</code>. But the possibility of hardware reordering of memory writes affecting multi-threads means that there is a fourth option <code>(0, 42)</code>.</p>

<p>You might think there are more possibilities due to the lack of synchronization. But all hardware memory models guarantee that aligned loads and store up to the native word size are atomic (u32 or a 32-bit CPU, u64 on a 64-bit CPU). If we changed one of our writes to <code>0xFFFF_FFFF</code>, the read will only ever see the old value or the new value. It will never see a partial value like <code>0xFFFF_0000</code>.</p>

<p>If the details of the CPU’s memory model are hidden away when using regular memory accesses, it seems like we would have no way to control it in multi-threaded programs where it affects program correctness.</p>

<p>Luckily Rust provides as with the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module containing types that gives us the control we need. We use these types to specify exactly the memory ordering requirements our code needs. We trade performance for correctness. We place restrictions on what order the hardware can perform memory operations, taking away any bandwidth optimizations the hardware would want to perform.</p>

<p>When working with the <code>atomic</code> module, we don’t worry about the actual memory models of individual CPU architectures. Instead the operation of the <code>atomic</code> module works on an abstract memory model that’s CPU agnostic. Once we’ve expressed our requirements on the loads and stores using this Rust memory model, the compiler does the job of mapping to the memory model of the target CPU.</p>

<p>The requirements we specify on each operation takes the form of what reordering we want to allow (or deny) on the operation. The orderings form a hierarchy, with each level placing more restrictions the CPU. For example <code>Ordering::Relaxed</code> means the CPU is free to perform any reordering it wants. <code>Ordering::Release</code> means that a store can only complete after all proceeding stores have finished.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how atomic memory writes are actually compiled, compared to a regular write.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>sync</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we look at the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/uVQM8T">X86 assembly</a> for the above code, we see the first three functions produce identical code. It’s not until the stricter <code>SeqCst</code> ordering that we get a different instruction being produced.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>

        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first two orderings use the <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> (<strong>MOV</strong>e) instruction to write the value to memory. Only the strictest ordering produces a different instruction, <strong><code>XCHG</code></strong> (atomic e<strong>XCH</strong>an<strong>G</strong>), to a raw pointer write.</p>

<p>In contrast we can see there is a difference once we hit the release ordering requirement. The raw pointer and relaxed atomic store use <strong><code>STR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore <strong>R</strong>egister) while the release and sequential ordering uses the instruction <strong><code>STLR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore with re<strong>L</strong>ease <strong>R</strong>egister). <em>The <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> instruction is this disassembly is moving the constant <code>58</code> into a register, it’s not a memory operation.</em></p>

<p>We should be able to see the risk here. The mapping between the theoretical Rust memory model and the X86 memory model is more forgiving to programmer error. It’s possible for us to write code that is wrong with respect to the abstract memory model, but still have it produce the correct assembly code and work correctly on some CPU’s.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-multi-threaded-program-using-atomic-operations">Writing a Multi-Threaded Program using Atomic Operations</h2>

<p>The program we’ll be exploring builds upon the concept of storing a pointer value being atomic across threads. One thread is going to perform some work using a mutable object it owns. Once it’s finished that work it’s going to publish that work as an immutable shared reference, using an atomic pointer write to both signal the work is complete and allow reading threads to use the data.</p>

<h2 id="the-x86-only-implementation">The X86 Only Implementation</h2>

<p>If we really want to test how forgiving the X86’s memory model is, we can write multi-threaded code that skips any use of the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module. I want to stress this is not something you should ever actually consider doing. In fact this code is probably undefined behavior. This is an learning exercise only.</p>

<p>This will be a 2 post guide, where we will scrape this website on <code>Page Title</code>, <code>URL</code> and <code>Tags</code>, for blog posts, then we will ingest this data into Elasticsearch. - <a href="">This Post</a></p>
<p>Once we have our data in Elasticsearch, we will build a Search Engine to search for these posts, the frontend will consist of Python Flask, Elasticsearch Library and HTML, which will be coverend in <a href="https://sysadmins.co.za/building-a-search-engine-for-our-scraped-data-on-elasticsearch-part-2/">Part 2</a></p>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong></p>
<p>Always ensure that you are scraping for the right reasons, in this example, I will use my own blog site as the target, and I won't be scraping the websites data, but only Page Title, URL and Tags, so that we have enough data for our search engine.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>For this example I am using Ubuntu 16.04, and we will need some dependencies to install for our Python Script:</p>
<pre><code>$ apt udpate &amp;&amp; apt upgrade -y
$ apt install python python-dev python-setuptools python-lxml openssl libssl-dev python-pip
$ pip install requests
$ pip install bs4
$ pip install elasticsearch
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Python Scraper:</strong></p>
<p>Here is our Python Scraper that will scrape the data from a <code>sitemap.xml</code> and ingest the data into Elasticsearch:</p>
<pre><code>import re
import time
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es_client = Elasticsearch(['http://10.0.1.10:9200'])

drop_index = es_client.indices.create(index='blog-sysadmins', ignore=400)
create_index = es_client.indices.delete(index='blog-sysadmins', ignore=[400, 404])

def urlparser(title, url):
    # scrape title
    p = {}
    post = title
    page = requests.get(post).content
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'lxml')
    title_name = soup.title.string

    # scrape tags
    tag_names = []
    desc = soup.findAll(attrs={"property":"article:tag"})
    for x in xrange(len(desc)):
        tag_names.append(desc[x-1]['content'].encode('utf-8'))

    # payload for elasticsearch
    doc = {
        'date': time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        'title': title_name,
        'tags': tag_names,
        'url': url
    }

    # ingest payload into elasticsearch
    res = es_client.index(index="blog-sysadmins", doc_type="docs", body=doc)
    time.sleep(0.5)

sitemap_feed = 'https://sysadmins.co.za/sitemap-posts.xml'
page = requests.get(sitemap_feed)
sitemap_index = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')
urls = [element.text for element in sitemap_index.findAll('loc')]

for x in urls:
    urlparser(x, x)
</code></pre>
<p>This scraper will grab all the posts from the <code>sitemap.xml</code> then loop through each post, with the given logic, ingest the data into elasticsearch.</p>
<p><strong>Running the Python Scraper:</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ python scraper.py
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Verify Documents in Elasticsearch:</strong></p>
<p>After you have executed the python script, have a look at elasticsearch to confirm if the documents were ingested into Elasticsearch:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl http://10.0.1.10:9200/_cat/indices/scrape-sysadmins?v
health status index            uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
green  open   blogs-sysadmins gyHONBcwTmaVjZVRj6dYew   5   1         80            0    289.6kb        144.8kb
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see we have ingested 80 documents, having a look at one of our documents:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl http://10.0.1.10:9200/blogs-sysadmins/_search?pretty -d '{"size": 1}'
{
  "took" : 5,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 5,
    "successful" : 5,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : 80,
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "blogs-sysadmins",
        "_type" : "docs",
        "_id" : "AV6j3bZEzCREvIW7N4yt",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "date" : "2017-09-21",
          "url" : "https://sysadmins.co.za/bash-script-setup-a-3-node-hadoop-cluster-on-lxc-containers/",
          "tags" : [
            "LXC",
            "Hadoop",
            "Scripting",
            "LXD"
          ],
          "title" : "Bash Script setup a 3 Node Hadoop Cluster on LXC Containers"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong></p>
<p>In my <a href="https://sysadmins.co.za/building-a-search-engine-for-our-scraped-data-on-elasticsearch-part-2/">next post</a>, I will guide you through the steps on setting up a Search User Interface that will be our search engine to search from blog posts that is stored in Elasticsearch.</p>

Their offer? A system with familiarities appreciated by developers and online services welcomed by users.</p><p>Please note that, due to consistency with other sources, this article separates storage units between the metric prefix (i.e. megabytes or ‘MB’) and the standardised binary prefix (i.e. mebibytes or ‘MiB’), thus:</p><ul><li>1 MB = 1000 KB</li><li>1 MiB = 1024 KiB</li></ul><p>… and so forth.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>The processor included in this console is a slightly customised version of the famous <strong>Intel Pentium III</strong> (an off-the-shelf CPU for computers) running at <strong>733 MHz</strong>. With this, one can assume this console is just a PC behind the scenes… I won’t tell you the answer, but I promise that at the end of the article you will be able to reach your own conclusion.</p><p>Anyhow, Pentiums, along with other lines of CPUs designed and manufactured by Intel, were incredibly popular in the computer market. Such was Intel’s market share that they became the de-facto reference point for quality: As a typical user, if you wanted a good computer and had the budget, you only had to look for <em>something</em> carrying an Intel CPU. We all know by now that there are more factors involved, but that’s what the marketing guys at Intel managed to project.</p><h4 id="technical-information">Technical information</h4><p>Now that we positioned Intel in the map, let’s go back to the topic of this console. During my research, I was expecting to find documentation with the level of depth as other CPUs (MIPS, SuperH, ARM, etc), but instead, I stumbled across an excessive amount of marketing terms that only diverted my search. So, for this article, I came up with a structure to organise all the necessary information which will help to understand how this CPU works. Furthermore, I will try to introduce some terminology that Intel used to brand this CPU.</p><p>Having said that, let us take a look:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-branding-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-branding">Branding</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-the-isa-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-the-isa">The ISA</a></li><li id="tab-1-3-the-microarchitecture-link"><a href="#tab-1-3-the-microarchitecture">The Microarchitecture</a></li><li id="tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc-link"><a href="#tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc">CISC or RISC</a></li><li id="tab-1-5-the-core-link"><a href="#tab-1-5-the-core">The Core</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-branding"><h4>Branding</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox/cpu/branding.113be6f183d200764d7cfc590548c60fe637af1411fccff6cb274c99c9a5fa28.png"><picture>

So what does this mean? Back then (early 00s), the Pentium series represented the next-generation of CPUs. They were ‘new high-end’ that grouped all the fancy technology that made computers super-fast, plus it helped buyers decide which CPU they had to buy if they wanted <em>the best of the best</em>.</p><p>The Pentium III replaced Pentium II, which in turn replaced the original Pentium. Moreover, when the first Pentium came out, it replaced the 80486, which in turn replaced the 80386… You get the idea. What matters is that ‘Pentium’ is mainly a brand name, it’s not directly associated with its inner workings. Therefore, we must go deeper!</p><p>To dive further and not get lost in the way, I have catalogued the information into three sections which combined, make up the chip. The first the <strong>Instruction Set Architecture</strong> or ‘ISA’ (the group of instructions used to command the CPU), <strong>Microarchitecture</strong> (how is the ISA implemented in silicon) and the <strong>Core</strong> (what set of components are used to package the microarchitecture to form the specific CPU model).</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-the-isa"><h4>The ISA</h4><p>Indeed, after I mentioned the name Intel it was a matter of time before I introduce the famous <strong>x86</strong>, its instruction set.</p><p>Even though x86 first appeared with the release of the 16-bit CPU called <strong>Intel 8086</strong> in 1978, the ISA has been constantly expanded with more instructions as more Intel CPUs were released (80186, 80286 and so on). Consequently, x86 started to fragment as more ground-breaking features were added (i.e. ‘real mode’, vs ‘protected mode’ vs ‘long mode’). To tackle this, modern x86 applications commonly targeted the 80386 ISA (also referred as <strong>IA-32</strong> or <strong>i386</strong>) as a baseline, which among other things, operates in a 32-bit environment.</p><p>Subsequently, Intel presented enhancements of IA-32 in the form of <strong>extensions</strong>, meaning these may or may not be included in an IA-32 CPU. Programs can query the CPU to check if a specific enhancement is present. The Xbox’s CPU includes two extensions:</p><ul><li><strong>MMX</strong> (Multimedia Extension): Adds 57 SIMD instructions and 8 64-bit registers (integers only) that can speed up vector operations.</li><li><strong>SSE</strong> (Streaming SIMD extension): Another SIMD-type extension which addresses some of the limitations of MMX (lack of floating-point support and unable to use floating-point unit in parallel). It adds 8 128-bit registers (called ‘XMM’) that hold four 32-bit floats; and 56 new instructions.</li></ul><p>Good news is that since the console will always have the same CPU features, programmers can optimise their code to exploit these extensions as they will always be present.</p></div><div id="tab-1-3-the-microarchitecture"><h4>The Microarchitecture</h4><p>When it comes to building a circuit that can interpret x86 instructions, Intel has come up with so many different designs for their CPUs. Some designs were featured with the release of a new Pentium Series (i.e. Pentium 4) while others are featured when Intel releases an ‘enhanced’ version of a Pentium (such as the ‘Pentium Pro’). Nevertheless, since the release of the first Pentium, the microarchitecture is identified with a different name from the CPU model. For example, the original Pentium includes the ‘P5’ microarchitecture.</p><p>Now, the Xbox CPU, along with the rest of Pentium III processors, use the <strong>P6 Microarchitecture</strong> (also known as ‘i686’). This is the 6th generation (counting from the 8086) which features:</p><ul><li>A <em>massive</em> <strong>14-stage pipeline</strong>.</li><li><strong>Out-of-order execution</strong>: If possible, the CPU re-orders the sequence of instructions to increase efficiency and performance.</li><li><strong>Speculative prediction</strong>: Similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#features">branch prediction</a>, but it also executes the branch that the CPU has predicted it will be chosen.</li></ul><p>Having said that, take a closer look at these features. It so happens they are very similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#features">previous consoles</a>, however, the other CPUs are very different in terms of design compared to Intel ones. Historically, one could argue that Intel could have never been able to accomplish, let’s say, a pipelined CPU. Yet they managed to do so, so let us see why…</p></div><div id="tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc"><h4>CISC or RISC</h4><p>All of the competitor’s consoles previously analysed contain a <strong>RISC</strong> CPU whereas Intel’s x86 ones are <strong>CISC</strong>. RISC CPUs are known for having a simplified instruction set compared to CISC CPUs. This includes, for instance, not featuring instructions that operate values directly from memory (as opposed to registers).</p><p>One of the advantages of RISC processors is that their simplistic approach enables its CPUs to be designed with a modular sense, which in turn can be exploited to improve performance with parallelism techniques. This is why we have seen CPUs like MIPS and PowerPC debuting pipelining, superscalar, out-of-order, branch prediction, etc. On the other side, ‘CISC’ processors were design many years before the RISC processors appeared and aimed to solve different needs. Consequently, their designs are not as flexible as RISC ones.</p><p>Back to the original question, the P6 is an interesting design, because while the CPU only understands a CISC instruction set (x86), it interprets the ISA using <strong>microcode</strong> (called ‘micro-operations’) and the unit that executes that code is built around the guidelines of RISC. All in all, this allows Intel to apply the optimisations of RISC processors while keeping a ‘CISC layer’ for compatibility with x86.</p><p>Microcode is already embedded in the silicon but it can be patched, allowing Intel to fix its CPUs after production whenever a bug or a security vulnerability is discovered. If you have read previous articles (i.e. N64 or PS2), bear in mind that Intel’s microcode is <strong>not publicly accessible</strong> (let alone documented) and Intel is its solely ‘maintainer’.</p></div><div id="tab-1-5-the-core"><h4>The Core</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox/cpu/core.63696b1d55e579495cbbb6e42a5ee66fe0ce7fee34e107f74c750a34546c309a.png"><picture>

Specifically, the Xbox includes one model called <strong>Coppermine</strong>. This was also released as the second revision of the Pentium III (replacing the ‘Katmai’ core) and includes the following components:</p><ul><li><strong>32 KiB L1</strong> cache: Divided between 16 KiB for instructions and 16 KiB for data.</li><li>Integrated <strong>128 KiB L2</strong> cache: This is <em>odd</em> since the off-the-shelf Coppermine has 256 KiB of L2. In fact, the Coppermine128 (found in the Intel ‘Celeron’ brand, the low-end Pentium alternative) has the same amount of L2. This is probably done to reduce manufacturing costs, and keep this console at a competitive price.</li><li>133 MHz <strong>Front-side bus</strong>: This is the bus that connects the L2 cache with the memory controller, we’ll see more about it later on.<ul><li>Intel names it ‘Front-side bus’ to distinguish it from another bus which connects the L2 (external cache) with the L1 (internal cache). The latter bus is called ‘Back-side bus’ and yes… It’s an unfortunate name to use from the UK.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Coppermine also features two ‘enhancements’ over their original implementation of L2 cache, these are the <strong>Advanced Transfer Cache</strong> and the <strong>Advanced System Buffering</strong>. To sum them up, L2 cache is on-chip and their buses are wider, which help to reduce possible bottlenecks found in the Front-side bus.</p><p>Finally, the chip uses the ‘Micro-PGA2’ socket to connect it to the motherboard, but like any other console, the Xbox has it soldered with a Ball Grid Array or ‘BGA’.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="p6-and-the-end-of-pentium-numbers">P6 and the end of Pentium numbers</h4><p>Here’s a bit more history: After the years of the P6, Intel planned to succeed it with the ‘Netburst’ microarchitecture (featured in the Pentium IV). However, the line of succession also ended there: The microarchitecture couldn’t be improved anymore. This prompted an Intel team in Israel to revisit the old P6 and develop a more efficient successor. The result was <strong>Pentium M</strong>, eventually extended to form the <strong>Core</strong> microarchitecture (and brand). ‘Core’ is the basis of present designs.</p><h4 id="motherboard-architecture">Motherboard architecture</h4><p>At some point in the history of the PC, motherboards grew so much in complexity that new designs had to be developed from the ground up to efficiently tackle new emerging needs.</p><div><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox/cpu/motherboard.8ddd164202ef59296b376029d383dac1a91e08eea715a6596e1eefe61af1a160.png"><picture>

Following is a <b>list of mispronunciation glitches</b> that have been found so far. Please keep this list in alphabetical order.
</p><p>Note: Many of the mispronunciations from Sam are not in the <a href="https://wiki.therofl98.co/wiki/Microsoft_Sam_(SAPI_4)" title="Microsoft Sam (SAPI 4)">Speakonia (SAPI 4) version</a> originally in Windows 2000, although there are some <a href="https://wiki.therofl98.co/wiki/Speakonia" title="Speakonia">Speakonia</a>–only bugs.
</p>

<h2><span id="Word_Mispronunciations">Word Mispronunciations</span></h2>
<p>Most famously, regardless of version, Sam cannot pronounce the word "soy" (also the spelling "soi"), but instead will make a sound "swurghf", resembling a <a href="https://wiki.therofl98.co/wiki/ROFLcopter" title="ROFLcopter">helicopter</a> blade. In <a href="https://wiki.therofl98.co/wiki/Speakonia" title="Speakonia">Speakonia</a> (SAPI 4), one can aid this mispronunciation by typing "soei", "s'hoy" or "Swoi" instead, and SAPI 5: "soe" or "ssoy". It doesn't happen in Mary and Mike, meaning this issue seems to be specific to the voice itself. However, he can say it correctly if you type a z after the S. He also says it correctly if a word is placed after it that begins with L or W, such as "soy like" or "soy wheat". Sticky Keys XP has also found an accurate way to make him say it correctly in Windows XP (SAPI 5). To do this, type "sse loi" (s'e loi in SAPI4). However, he says "soil" correctly.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>From time to time we want export filesystem from container and make image from it.<br>
Also sometimes there is need for giving someone our container image in single file without repository usage - on for example pendrive.</p>
<p>How to do this things?</p>
<h3 id="export-and-import-container-filesystem">Export and import container filesystem</h3>
<h5 id="export">Export</h5>
<p>To export container filesystem we use command <code>docker export</code>.<br>
This command will create output file with whole container filesystem - if we manually uncompress it - we will get directory structure like in <code>/</code> on Linux OS.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>lukas@docker-host ~<span>]</span><span># docker image ls</span>
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
alpine              latest              a187dde48cd2        <span>2</span> weeks ago         5.6MB
ubuntu              latest              4e5021d210f6        <span>3</span> weeks ago         64.2MB
</code></pre></div><p>In our example we have ubuntu image from which we will start container, there is no <code>testfolder</code> folder in <code>/</code> directory.<br>
So ubuntu official image not include such folder.</p>
<p>Let’s add it in our container, with some file in it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>lukas@docker-host ~<span>]</span><span># docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash</span>
root@86b609d88376:/# pwd
/
root@86b609d88376:/# ls testfolder
ls: cannot access <span>'testfolder'</span>: No such file or directory
root@86b609d88376:/# mkdir testfolder
root@86b609d88376:/# touch testfolder/file
root@86b609d88376:/# ls testfolder/
file
root@86b609d88376:/# exit
exit
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can check name of container and perform export from it with <code>docker export</code> and <code>-o</code> parameter for output tar file location.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>lukas@docker-host ~<span>]</span><span># docker container ls -a</span>
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Lessons learned building a profitable algorithmic trading system using Reinforcement Learning techniques.</p><div id="post-content"><p>About two years ago I wrote a <a href="http://www.wildml.com/2018/02/introduction-to-learning-to-trade-with-reinforcement-learning/">little piece</a> about applying Reinforcement Learning to the markets. It was a project I had worked on for a while in various forms. A few people asked me what became of it. So this post covers some high-level things I've learned. It's more of a rant than an organized post, really. If there is enough interest in this topic I'd be happy to go into more technical detail in future posts, but that's TBD. Please let me know in the comments or on <a href="https://twitter.com/dennybritz">Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Over the past few years I've built around four and a half trading systems. The first one was a pile of crap. The second one I never finished because I realized early on that it was also a pile of crap. The third one was abandoned for personal and political reasons. The fourth one worked extremely well for 12-18 months. Then, profits started decreasing and I decided to move on to other things and I lacked the motivation to go back into it. Some of the systems I worked on were for the financial markets, but the last one was applied to the crypto markets. So keep that in mind while reading.</p>  <p>If you've taken some economics classes your first thought is perhaps something like</p> <blockquote> <p>Ha, newbie! Efficient Market Hypothesis! E!M!H! You can't beat the market! It's all just luck!</p> </blockquote> <p>And I would say that most economic theories like the EMH are so far removed from the real world that they don't matter. This doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong. They are interesting academic models that can be useful in certain contexts, like for writing papers or getting prizes. But they don't survive confrontations with a messy real world and emotional human beings. If you have no idea what the Efficient Market Hypothesis says then you are in luck - sometimes ignorance truly is bliss. I won't get into it here because you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9bYOBuKF4">smarter people</a> arguing about this. Suffice to say, I strongly believe and have seen myself that you can build profitable systems that consistently beat the market. Will the market eventually adjust to take away that opportunity? Probably, but that's irrelevant, because the market may take months, years or decades to adjust (just look at HFT), and you are free to evolve your system over time, looking for new opportunities and adjusting to the adjusting market yourself. That was the case for me. The market seemed to have adjusted to my system as profits started decreasing, but it took more than 12 months, and with the right motivation I probably could have adjusted and improved the system to work again.</p> <p>Rather than thinking about markets from an economics perspective, I prefer to think about them from a Game Theory or Reinforcement Learning perspective. <strong><strong>The market does not exist.</strong></strong> What people call the market is an emergent property of many agents acting in an environment trying to maximize their own objective. The objective may be slightly different for everyone. Some want to sell shares they obtained through a stock options plan at a good price. Some engage in arbitrage for quick profits. Some try to predict short-term movements based on news or charting patterns. Some engage long-term speculation based on fundamentals. Some are designated market makers providing liquidity for a specific asset or exchange in return for a fee. Each could be a human acting on gut feeling and emotion, a human following some kind of implicit fuzzy algorithm (e.g. charting), or an automated system acting on data. The combined behavior of all these agents gives rise to this illusive thing that people call <em>the market</em>. Your goal isn't to beat the market, it's to beat some of the other players in the market over a time horizon you care about. The time horizon part is important. Not every trade has a clear winner and loser, because agents are optimizing over different time horizons, ranging from microseconds to decades.</p>  <p>If you come from a tech or startup background, transitioning to trading may require a change in thinking. Products and engineering are often about <strong><strong>absolutes</strong></strong>. If your website takes 100ms to load that's pretty good. Making it load in 99ms provides negligible benefit to the end-user. It'd be a waste of engineering resources. The same is true for startups. Paul Graham likes to say that startups are rarely killed by competitors. Rather, they commit suicide. They fail because they cannot find customers, don't have a solid business model, or because of founder issues. Being killed by competition with a slightly better product is quite rare.</p> <p>Trading is different. It's about <strong><strong>relatives</strong></strong>. It's fine if your website takes a horrible 10 seconds to load if your competitor needs 11 seconds. Having crappy data is fine if everyone else's data is even crappier. Paying high trading fees is fine if everyone is paying the same. This is pretty obvious if you look at the market as a multiplayer game. Even if you're a bad player on an absolute scale, you can win if your competition is worse. This has direct effects on how you build software to trade in the markets.</p>  <p>What a focus on relative performance means for engineering can be quite counterintuitive.</p> <p>When building infrastructure for a product-based company you would prefer using battle-tested, robust frameworks that minimize risk. Why re-invent the wheel if someone else has already built it? It's safe to use something that has been adopted by thousands of people. This is where open source shines. Using AWS for hosting your server? Postgres for storing your data? JSON for serialization? Python or Node for data collection? An open source library for calling APIs? Download Keras and train a NN on your data? Reasonable ideas, but when you are building trading infrastructure, you should think twice about these.</p> <p>Widely adopted technologies are commodities. If you use the same technologies as everyone else, where will your advantage come from? When building a product this doesn't matter because it's about absolute SLAs. But trading is about relatives. <strong><strong>Each commoditized technology you can specialize and build yourself is an opportunity</strong></strong> to beat the competition. By being hybrid cloud you can reduce latencies. By storing data in an efficient binary format you can save serialization time, leading to faster iteration during development, and faster predictions in production. By creating custom integrations with exchanges instead of using off-the-shelf APIs you may be able to use specific order types that are not available to others, or gain an informational advantage by processing exchange-specific information. And so on. Building highly-specialized non-generic systems is what engineers hate. We love generalization and abstraction. But specialization is often where your advantage in trading comes from.</p> <p>You don't need to start from scratch and implement your own programming language to start trading. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs you are making when adopting commoditized technologies. Make conscious decisions about it. Some of the things above seem minor - but a large number of tiny advantages can add up to a significant edge.</p>  <p>You may say, well, this makes sense, but I really don't want to compete on the infrastructure side. Instead, I want to build a smarter model that makes better predictions. That's my edge! I've heard this a LOT, and I've never seen it work.</p> <p>AI is pretty commoditized. I would say it's more commoditized than excellent infrastructure engineering, data collection, or inductive biases from domain knowledge. These days, you can easily download state-of-the-art models and run them on your data. Unless you are at the forefront of some extremely relevant research, it's unlikely that you can gain a significant edge just from training a better model.</p> <p>When people realize that their fancy AI model built on crappy infrastructure trained with crappy data (that's also used by everyone else) doesn't work, they give up. AI can give you an edge, but not an edge so huge that it allows you to ignore other factors. You still need to build good infrastructure, get good data, have decent latencies, and so on. Few people seem to be willing to spend time on these unsexy things. Think of each as a multiplier. If one is close to zero, it doesn't matter how good your AI model is.</p> <p>So, what are some these other things?</p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Market</strong></strong> - Pick the right market(s) to trade in. Don't go for the obvious choices that everyone is picking by default. The harder it is to get access to a market, both legally and technically, the more likely that you will find opportunities. Less liquid markets may be overlooked by sophisticated funds because they don't scale to their AUM. Again, this is often counterintuitive to engineers who go for "good APIs" - good APIs typically mean popular. Popular typically means commoditized.</li> <li><strong><strong>Data</strong></strong> - Think about data sources that others do not have access to, or are not willing to get. For example, there may be data that's difficult to crawl due to sophisticated rate restrictions IP bans. Most people will give up here. This is an opportunity for you. Be skeptical of popular APIs and open source software. It's the same data that everyone else uses.</li> <li><strong><strong>Latencies</strong></strong> - You're probably not planning to compete with HFT traders (bad idea), but that doesn't mean you can completely ignore latencies. Better latencies will probably lead to easier execution with less slippage. Be careful about where you host your systems, how you send data around, how you serialize data, and so on.</li> <li><strong><strong>Models</strong></strong> - In general, better data is more important than better models, but better models can also give you an edge. Note that you are often trading off model complexity with latencies.</li> <li><strong><strong>Execution</strong></strong> - A good model doesn't mean much if you can't execute. Historical data you collect may look quite different from what's actually happening on the exchange. You are not going to know until you start live trading.</li> </ul>  <p>More than two years after my <a href="http://www.wildml.com/2018/02/introduction-to-learning-to-trade-with-reinforcement-learning/">last post</a>, do I still believe that …</p></div></div>

<p>In 2019, if you were to ask anyone what drove Asheville’s economy, they’d tell you beer, arts and crafts, outdoor recreation, hotels and restaurants. In short, tourism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, with those businesses only just beginning to ramp back up and tourists staying home, talk of diversifying Asheville’s economy is picking up. Local technology businesses and the rise of technology-based work-from-home jobs may be part of the solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asheville already has a tech sector, albeit a small one with only 1% of the job market and approximately 1,900 jobs. But with an average salary of nearly $58,000 a year, according to ZipRecruiter, Western North Carolina tech jobs are good ones. And, more jobs are coming.</p>



<p><a href="https://charlesedwardind.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Edward Industries (CEI)</a>, a minority-owned electronics manufacturer, in concert with the Buncombe County Commission, Asheville City Council, and the Economic Development Coalition for Asheville-Buncombe County (EDC), has announced plans to move its headquarters to Asheville and invest $1.5 million over 3 years in a new manufacturing operation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this new factory, which will be next door to <a href="https://www.moogmusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moog Music</a> on Broadway, will come 60 new assembly and production, engineering, management, and administration jobs.&nbsp; These jobs will have an average wage of $46,925–roughly 110% that of the Buncombe County average wage.&nbsp; Hiring is expected to start in Fall of 2020.</p>



<p>Why Asheville? Tim Harmon, CEI President “We see great promise for our company in Asheville and view the community’s workforce as a key competitive advantage as we seek to grow the business to new heights.”</p>



<p>As good as this news is, the infrastructure for more tech jobs is there.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.immedion.com/locations/asheville-data-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Immedion Asheville</a>, a business data center in the Biltmore Park Town Square, has “helped many organizations transition to remote workforces” and bolster their computer-based systems since the pandemic, said Steve Newman, sales manager. “We see growth in our future for revenue or operations.”</p>



<p>Asheville is “fortunate to have several organizations like <a href="https://meetthegeeks.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meet the Geeks</a>, <a href="http://www.hatchavl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HATCH</a>, <a href="http://ventureasheville.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venture Asheville</a>, <a href="https://www.abtech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A-B Tech</a>, and <a href="https://www.montreat.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Montreat College</a> that are dedicated to helping promote and foster the technology industry in our area,” Newman said. “My hope is that those groups will continue to expand.”</p>



<p>For technology businesses to run anywhere requires broadband Internet. Thanks to the <a href="https://ercwnc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Education &amp; Research Consortium of the Western Carolinas (ERC)</a>, Western North Carolina has access to up to extremely high-speed<em> </em>100 Gigabit per second broadband Internet access primarily to the education, healthcare, and government sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The nonprofit ERC, which works with most broadband providers, has seen “a 10-15% overall increase in Internet traffic,” said CEO Hunter Goosmann.</p>



<p>“Some businesses have needed additional bandwidth, but the greater demand has been from homes,” Goosmann said. “You can imagine that whether it’s someone logging in for work or watching Netflix, Internet use has increased.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Charter/Spectrum, the area’s biggest Internet Service Provider, has met the demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We built our networks to exceed maximum capacity during peak evening usage, and even with the increased network activity we are seeing in the daytime, levels remain well below capacity and typical peak evening usage in most markets,” said Patti Braskie Michel, senior director of regional communications.</p>



<p>The ability of the Internet to hold up under the load opens other job possibilities for Asheville. The Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM) has found 17% of U.S. companies are adding permanent work-from-home policies for employees. This comes after major companies such as Google, Facebook, and Zillow announced their staff can work from home for the rest of 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies that once dismissed the idea of employees working from Asheville out of hand are now much more open to the idea of remote workers.</p>



<p>Asheville also has its own home-grown technology businesses. They’re experiencing rough times but are doing much better than the companies relying on tourism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Local company <a href="https://www.epsilon-inc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epsilon</a>, a Weaverville IT consultancy, is doing well and welcomes the telecommuting trend.</p>



<p>“We have been quite busy supporting customers that are getting used to working remotely,” said Matt Fraser, director of business development. “Over the years, Epsilon has stayed at the forefront of cloud technologies, which allow businesses to operate anywhere anytime, so many customers just needed a short learning curve to be able to work at home. In addition, we find that 70% to 80% of technical issues can be resolved remotely.”</p>



<p>Technology programs at AB-Tech and Montreat College as well as organizations like the Mountain Area Workforce Development Board, “continue to drive technology jobs in the area,” Fraser said.</p>



<p><a href="https://statusforward.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Status Forward</a>, a small Asheville-based web design, development, and marketing agency, has seen a rougher road.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have actually reduced our staff from 6 to 5 in the last two months,” said Leah Quintal, digital marketing strategist. “We have adapted by shifting the scope of our offerings…[We] developed and launched the <a href="https://supplyconnector.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Supply Connector</a>, a searchable directory site that connects manufacturers that have pivoted operations to provide PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] with the healthcare industry and essential providers that most need equipment. Should we get additional funding to support this effort, we will likely be able to hire additional staff.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s ahead for Asheville’s tech businesses? Trevor Lohrbeer, a local tech entrepreneur who has launched several start-ups, sees potential.&nbsp;</p>

</figcaption></figure>



<p>“I don’t see Asheville becoming a major tech player, though I do think the tech industry could be built up to the point where it contributes significantly to the local economy,” said Lohrbeer, who’s also the founder of Meet the Geeks, the local technology networking nonprofit. “What I think we’ve seen over the past 20 years is that startups can now be started anywhere in the world.”</p>



<p>It helps to be in a startup hub like San Francisco or Boston.</p>



<p>But “it used to be almost impossible to build a significant tech company outside Silicon Valley,” Lohrbeer said. “Now, it’s possible in many more places around the world, including Asheville.”</p>



<p>Asheville now has tech-savvy angel investors and “as we continue to build our entrepreneurial ecosystem through initiatives like <a href="http://ventureasheville.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venture Asheville</a>, I think we’ll see growth in the local tech industry,” Lohrbeer said.</p>



<p>Some Asheville-born tech start-ups, including <a href="https://www.homegauge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Home Gauge</a>, <a href="https://www.flexera.com/more/acquisitions/flexera-risc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RISC Networks</a>, and <a href="http://ventureasheville.com/doctor-directory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Directory</a>, have already grown and been acquired by national companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jeffrey Kaplan, director of entrepreneurship at Venture Asheville, is optimistic “that entrepreneurs will lead our recovery.” Venture Asheville and its partners have raised $25,000 in support of the<a href="http://ventureasheville.com/microgrant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Asheville Impact Micro Grant</a>.</p>



<p>“We’re thrilled to help jumpstart five new companies,” Kaplan said.</p>



<p>With working from home more of an option now, Asheville is attracting more employees from bigger markets.</p>



<p>“Several startup founders have told me that a majority of applicants to open positions are coming from New York, Boston, and the Bay Area,” Kaplan said. “We’re seeing something of an urban exodus from major metros with people choosing locations that offer more balance, amenities, and a better lifestyle overall.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asheville will become “a regional health care innovation powerhouse,” Kaplan said. “Our unique ‘weirdness’ is an asset for startups to bootstrap and solve problems creatively.” What that means is that there will be more local competitive jobs.”</p>



<p>Don’t expect Asheville to become Boulder or Seattle, “which I think we all were aiming for 10-15 years ago,” Lohrbeer said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But since we’re starting to see the downsides of unplanned growth in the tourism industry, perhaps that’s a good thing,” he said. “Building a tech industry here that supports work-life balance and the ‘good living’ culture that Asheville is known for would be a success in my eyes, regardless of its size.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/zoom-child.jpg" alt=""></p>

<section data-level="1" id="zoom-treats-you-like-a-child">
<p>Deeply ingrained in Zoom's defaults are choices that do not encourage us to expect the best from each other.  We spend such vast amounts of time in video meetings now that we should question what behaviors our platforms are driving us to, and how they affect our interactions with our friends, family, and colleagues at work.  </p>

<section data-level="3" id="-waiting-for-the-host-to-start-the-meeting-"><h3>"Waiting for the host to start the meeting"</h3>
<p>This message can be infuriating.  The host is on vacation, or they're in a car somewhere, or they're there but having trouble logging in.  Or worse, everyone wonders, who <em>is</em> the host of this meeting, anyway?  Is it me?  Am I holding us back at this moment?  For God's sake, when will we be able to get on with the actual work we have to do?</p>
<p>And really, why can't we just carry on without the host?  Of course if you go into all the right admin screens and click all the right buttons, you can turn this off, but since it is the default, this experience inevitably creeps in.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="may-i-please-share-my-screen-pretty-please-"><h3>May I please share my screen?  Pretty please?</h3>
<p>I have a thing on my screen that's relevant to our discussion right now.  Can I share my screen?  Oh, well, no because someone else is sharing <em>their</em> screen, and for some reason now I have to find a moment to interject and ask them if they would stop so that I could share my thing.  Or maybe it's not worth all of that so I'll just keep it to myself.  Yes, there is a setting again somewhere that can undo this constraint, but defaults are rarely changed.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="could-we-please-mute-this-person-making-a-ruckus-"><h3>Could we please mute this person making a ruckus?</h3>
<p>Try as we might to avoid it, we all at one point or another end up being this person making a ruckus.  If the host happens to be mid-sentence making a brilliant point, the last thing anybody wants is to derail the meeting so they can pause and find the right little mute button to click.  Shouldn't we all just be able to do it?</p>
<p>And really, why shouldn't it go the other way too -- if we see someone is muted and obviously meaning to speak to the group, do we all really need to figure out who is noticing this and who is going to yell "you're muted!" back at them?  And then they have to apologize, and figure out what they need to repeat, etc, etc.  More derailing.  What if anyone could just unmute anyone else and we all just trust each other to do the right thing?  That is the world I want to live in.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="-the-host-has-ended-the-call-"><h3>"The host has ended the call"</h3>
<p>In my younger days, at the bar, I used to get offended when last-call would come, and they'd kick everyone out.  Staff who had been friendly now changing course and telling everyone to please hurry up and GTFO.</p>
<p>These days, I can't help but see the parallel experience in leaving a zoom call.  I have to time my exit so that it's after the meeting is sure to be wrapping up, but before I get kicked out by the host.  Worst is when I'm reaching for that button to leave the call, but the host wins the race and I get booted before I can click.  Every time, I think, "Yeah, well, I was already leaving..."</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="how-about-something-different-"><h3>How about something different?</h3>
<p>We built Team.Video over the last while with some of these frustrations in mind.  Anyone can come and go as they please.  The group can collaboratively manage mute states.  Everyone can share their screens if they like.</p>
<p>And in those first moments joining a call, instead of making everyone wait on their own, we have a little game people can play together while everyone is getting settled.  I suppose that is also treating you like a child in a way -- prompting you to play a game.  But I'll happily choose that version where we use play to spur our imagination and make a tiny little bit of a connection before getting into the hard work at hand.</p>
<p>Check out what we've put together at <a href="https://team.video/">https://team.video</a></p>

It’s possible that some might not want to use their stormtrooper headshot in a professional setting.</li><li><strong>Discord’s design and copy is playful and gamer-centric</strong>, which could be confusing for community members who aren't familiar with Discord’s gaming roots.</li></ul><h3>Use <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> if…</h3><ul><li>Many community members will likely have similar questions or issues, and you’d like to point them to a library of common answers</li><li>You’d like community-generated content to be indexed (and thus findable in search engine results). This helps new members discover the community while reducing the core team’s support burden.</li><li>Moderation and fine-grained permissions are important.</li><li>You have enough community members for chat to be counterproductive.</li><li>Synchronous communication isn’t important, for example, if your community is distributed across many time zones.</li><li>You don’t mind paying to host the forum software, or are capable of hosting it yourself.</li><li>You want to use an open source platform.</li></ul><p><strong>But keep in mind…</strong></p><ul><li>There are many technical options for starting a community on Discourse, including deploying the open source code on your own servers, paying a third party for hosting, or paying Discourse.org for a fully hosted solution.</li><li><strong>For new members, starting a new thread in a forum can be perceived as a higher barrier of entry</strong>, versus simply saying “hello” in a chat channel.</li></ul><h3>Use <strong>both</strong> chat (Discord or Slack) + Discourse if…</h3><ul><li>You want indexed content (Discourse) along with realtime vibes (chat).</li><li>Have the bandwidth to manage multiple platforms.</li><li>Want separate spaces for distinct groups, for example a chat for your champions and a forum for everyone else.</li><li>Note: Discourse offers a <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/chatroom-integration-plugin-discourse-chat-integration/66522">plugin for integrating with chat platforms</a>.</li></ul><h2>Three key factors to consider when choosing a community platform</h2><p>When picking a platform, you’ll likely weigh some factors more heavily than others based on your situation. The factors here will provide you with a framework for assessing the options.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/c8ec6b9dd94ccc54bc9ba7e8520fa1cd89f69758-2440x784.png" alt="Image of a comparison grid" title="Three Key Factors"></p><h3>The size of your community</h3><p><strong>Starting from scratch (or close to it)</strong></p><p>In the early stages of a community’s life, it’s important for the organizers to build strong connections with the first handful of members, since early adopters are more likely to join discussions, answer questions, and contribute in ways that make the community seem active and vibrant. Chat is good for this. Scalability and governance are less of a concern at this stage.</p><p><strong>Hundreds of community members</strong></p><p>At this point, chat platforms can start to feel unmanageable for a few reasons. First, moderation becomes an issue, since it’s hard for a small group of community managers to keep up with the volume of conversations happening (Discord beats Slack on this point).</p><p>Second, most community members complain that, on chat platforms, they often answer the same question or address the same concern many times over. The conversations just disappear too quickly for others to easily find, and since they’re not indexed or perma-linked, it’s difficult to reference previously answered questions.</p><p><strong>Many thousands of community members</strong></p><p>For large, well-established communities, forums are often the right choice, since live chat is difficult to manage and large scales.</p><p>Discourse provides fine-grained permissions and moderation that large communities will appreciate. Additionally, since large communities create lots of content, they especially benefit from indexed and shareable content.</p><h3>The size of your team</h3><p>Your choice of community platform should take into account your team’s ability to manage multiple channels, their timezone availability, and the number of folks available to interact on your chosen platform—all of which are a function of the team’s size.</p><p><strong>Small teams</strong></p><p>Small teams tend to start with a single platform, since that’s what they can manage given their bandwidth. In general, teams of three or smaller should commit to a single platform to focus their time and keep overhead low.</p><p><strong>Medium teams</strong></p><p>These teams are more self-sufficient compared to small teams and won’t need to depend as much on other teams for support. They <em>may</em> be able to handle multiple platforms, but often choose to go deeper with a single platform, such as more clearly defining roles and responsibilities within the team, and designating team members to focus on specific parts of the platform.</p><p><strong>Large teams</strong></p><p>Larger teams can handle multiple platforms and different sub-communities, such as a Slack for your MVPs and a Discourse forum for everyone else—but doing so introduces substantial overhead in terms of process management, identity resolution, and governance. That said, larger teams inside bigger companies tend to be better equipped to plan for and manage these situations.</p><h3>Your community’s engagement model</h3><p>What are the behaviors and norms you want your community members to model? Are you hoping for a casual vibe where members can congregate, discuss, and debate? Or are you more interested in cultivating deep knowledge sharing and collaboration? Once you decide, <strong>you should factor your engagement model into your tool choice</strong>.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/People-Powered-Communities-Supercharge-Business/dp/1400214882"><em>People Powered</em></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonobacon">Jono Bacon</a> outlines three engagement models that we think are useful to consider when choosing a platform:</p><p><strong>Consumers</strong></p><p>These communities revolve around <strong>ephemeral and emergent discussions about common interests</strong>, and emphasize connection based on those topics. Examples include communities about art, gaming, or general technology trends.</p><p><strong>Champions</strong></p><p>In this engagement model, <strong>community members share knowledge and insights about a common tool or technology, with an emphasis on leveling-up one’s expertise and experience</strong>. Members often teach each other through demos and examples, driving further participation from other community members.</p><p>Examples include company-specific communities, like the <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> Slack group, where members share custom CSS and browser extensions as well as how-to videos to share their knowledge and help others excel.</p><p><strong>Collaborators</strong></p><p>In communities of collaborators, members work together on shared projects. <strong>The primary example is open source software</strong>, where diverse people from around the world work together to build and improve a common codebase.</p><h2>Comparing Slack, Discord, and Discourse</h2><p>In addition to the key factors above, it’s important to understand the actual feature set each platform offers. The grid below assumes features for the baseline plans for each platform, and includes call-outs when features are offered only on paid tiers.</p><p><strong><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/aff197588f79ad746695aefe4c436e90b1aa904b-1220x3044.png">›› View the full image</a><br><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dzello/image/upload/v1590534477/orbit/Slack-Discourse-Discord-Comparison-Primary-Orbit.pdf">›› Download the PDF</a></strong></p><p><a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/aff197588f79ad746695aefe4c436e90b1aa904b-1220x3044.png"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cad8jutx/production/f20e76ce60b8edd5151f05d8668c5df3e5efc971-1220x3044.png" title="Table Comparing Slack, Discord, and Discourse"></a></p><h2>Detailed Recommendations</h2><p>We’ll now look at detailed recommendations based on the key factors and the pros and cons of each platform.</p><p>Of all the factors to consider, <strong>we think a community’s engagement model should have the most influence over which platform is used</strong>, so we’ve organized this section along those lines with caveats for size of community and team.</p><h3>Consumer communities</h3><p><strong>Suggestion: </strong>Discord</p><p><strong>Rationale</strong></p><p>Casual communities should lower the barrier to involvement and focus on building close connections between users. For those reasons, we suggest using Discord. With Discord, new members can join with the click of a button (versus creating new accounts, as with Slack and Discord), which means they can get started quickly.</p><p>For servers managed by an official brand account, Discord also offers a <a href="https://discord.com/verification">verification program</a>, which unlocks additional features, like custom branding and short URLs, a verification check mark, and higher quality voice service.</p><p><strong>Tradeoffs</strong></p><p>Discord …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Building <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Lambdas in AWS</a> is one of the central aspects for building <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/">serverless systems in AWS</a>. However, as AWS Lambda removes a lot of problems for developers when building systems, it also introduces a number of new problems developers have never had to deal with before.</p><p><span>The Number One Complaint developers have when building AWS Lambdas with Java are "cold starts".</span> A cold start occurs the very first time a AWS Lambda is asked to handle a request. Now, depending on the size of your Lambda function, it could take 10 seconds or more just for the Java process to start. For some applications, this may be an acceptable trade-off for the benefits AWS Lambda brings, but for most serverless applications, or for Lambdas that handle a large number of requests, this is unacceptable, and often makes developers abandon AWS Lambda and/or Java and go back to the technologies they are most familiar with.</p><p>AWS has tried to address cold starts by introducing features like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-provisioned-concurrency-for-lambda-functions/">Provisioned Concurrency</a>. However, this defeats the goal of "serverless" computing because you are no longer just paying for requests, you are also reserving compute capacity, and when you exceed this capacity you will incur the same cold starts you would have had otherwise.</p><p>The only way to fix cold starts is to get Java to start faster. Luckily, Oracle has created a new project called <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>. GraalVM is a new Java VM that can be used to improve the performance and to reduce the startup time of applications.</p><h2>What You Need for this Tutorial</h2><h2>Full Source Code available on <a href="https://github.com/formkiq/tutorials/tree/master/java/graalvm-s3">GitHub</a></h2><h2>Create Project using SAM CLI</h2><p>AWS SAM CLI is a command line tool that makes it easy to create and deploy serverless applications. We are going to use the SAM CLI to first create a AWS Lambda function in Java, and then we will convert that Lambda function to use GraalVM. The last step will be to compare the performance of these two Lambda functions.</p><p>To create the project, run the following command in a terminal window (in a new) directory:</p><p>and answer the questions as follows:</p><p>You have now created a SAM project with a single Lambda function. In your current directory you should see a subdirectory called "graalvm-s3" that will contain the project generated by the SAM CLI.</p><h2>S3Java Lambda</h2><p>The Lambda function we will be creating is a simple function that writes a file to an S3 bucket. In the <span>graalvm-s3</span> directory, you will see a <span>HelloWorldFunction</span> subdirectory which is the default Lambda function that was generated from SAM. We are going to be creating our new Lambda function twice, once with Java and once with Java using GraalVM. The first one will be called <span>S3Java</span>, so our first step is to take over the sample function by renaming the <span>HelloWorldFunction</span> directory to <span>S3Java</span>.</p><p>We need to update the <span>template.yaml</span> to use the new Lambda name. We also need to add instructions into this template create the S3 bucket we will be writing our test file into, and to set the Lambda function permissions to allow read/write for this new bucket.</p><p>The Lambda function created by SAM comes with a few classes we will not need. You can delete the following files:</p><ul><li>S3Java/src/main/java/<span>helloworld/App.java</span></li><li>S3Java/src/main/java/<span>helloworld/GatewayResponse.java</span></li><li>S3Java/src/test/java/<span>helloworld/AppTest.java</span></li></ul><p>We will create a <strong>new Lambda function</strong> in this file:
<span>S3Java/src/main/java/<span>helloworld/S3Java.java</span></span></p><p>We need to add the official AWS S3 dependency to <span>S3Java/build.gradle</span> for the code to compile.</p><p>This Lambda function is very simple: it identifies an S3 Bucket by name from the environment, and then it creates a random file in that bucket with the message "This is a test".</p><p>To build and deploy this Lambda function by running the command in a terminal window, in the directory where the template.yaml file is:</p><p>Produces the following output:</p><p>To deploy this Lambda function by running the command in a terminal window, in the directory where the template.yaml file is:</p><p>Produces the following output:</p><p>SAM CLI will create and deploy a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> Stack to your AWS Account. This will take a few minutes, but at the end you should see this message:</p><p>You can confirm the CloudFormation Stack was created by visiting the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home">CloudFormation Console</a> or by using AWS CLI command: "aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name graalvm-s3 --region us-east-1"</p><p>A StackStatus "CREATE_COMPLETE" shows that the CloudFormation was successful. In the CloudFormation Outputs, you will see the ARN of the Lambda function we will use to run the Lambda function, as well as the S3 Bucket the files will be written to.</p><p>We can run the Lambda function by using AWS CLI with the command:</p><p>This will run the Lambda function and write the output of the function to a file called <span>output</span>. Viewing that file, you should see something similar to the following:</p><p>
<img src="https://blog.formkiq.com/img/graalvm-s3-newfile.png" alt="S3Java Created S3 File"></p><p>Now the last thing we need to know is how long this Lambda function takes to execute. The easiest way to see this is using the AWS CLI. Using the command <span>sam logs --name graalvm-s3-S3Java-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX --region us-east-1</span> will show the CloudWatch logs for the Lambda function. You can also visit the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home">CloudWatch Console</a>. The output should be similar as below. We are looking for the <span>Duration</span> time.</p><p>We can see that it took 10400 ms, or 10.4 seconds, to execute this Lambda function. That is not very good, but we now have a time baseline. Once we convert this Lambda to GraalVM, we'll be able to see if anything changes.</p><h2>S3GraalVM Lambda</h2><p>We are going to create a new Lambda function called <span>S3GraalVM</span> based on the existing <span>S3Java</span>. So, you should copy the <span>S3Java</span> folder and call it <span>S3GraalVM</span></p><p>Delete the file
<span>S3GraalVM/src/main/java/<span>helloworld/S3Java.java</span></span>
and create
<span>S3GraalVM/src/main/java/<span>helloworld/S3GraalVM.java</span></span>
using the code below:</p><p><span>From a code perspective, the only change is setting the System Property
<span>software.amazon.awssdk.http.</span></span><span>service.impl</span>.
The AWS SDK by default uses Apache &amp; Netty for its HTTP service calls. This adds a ton of extra classes, and for AWS Lambda, this means slower startup times. Luckily, as of AWS SDK 2.0, we can change the SDK to use Java's built-in URLConnection class instead.</p><p>We then need to update our build.gradle to add url-connection-client, and exclude the apache-client and netty-nio-client so they are not included in our final build.</p><h2>"FAT" Jar File</h2><p>GraalVM needs to be run against a "FAT" jar file, IE: a single jar file that contains all code and dependencies. We will use the <span>com.github.johnrengelman.shadow</span> gradle plugin to easy accomplish this. Also, we will be using Lambda's custom runtime, so we need to use FormKiQ's open source <a href="https://github.com/formkiq/lambda-runtime-graalvm">GraalVM Lambda Runtime</a> library. Add the following to build.gradle.</p><h2>Build GraalVM Script</h2><p>GraalVM works by taking the "FAT" jar file and creating a Linux executable file that AWS Lambda can run. Unfortunately, GraalVM does not support all the features of Java. This is not generally a big deal, but one important feature it does not support without modification is Reflection. Because the FormKiQ GraalVM Lambda Runtime needs reflection to find the Lambda function to run, we need to use GraalVM's ReflectionConfigurationFiles. In this file we can define any classes we will be calling using reflection, and GraalVM will automatically add support for these classes.</p><p><span>Create the file
<span>S3GraalVM/src/main/</span></span><span>resources/reflect.json</span>,
defining our Lambda class inside.</p><p>Create file <span>S3GraalVM/build_graalvm.sh</span>, a shell script which will use Docker to convert the S3GraalVM-all.jar to an executable called <span>server</span>. (Make sure you give the build_graalvm.sh execute permission)</p><p>Add a task to <span>build.gradle</span> that will build the GraalVM image automatically when the project is built.</p><p>Once we have the GraalVM image, AWS requires a <span>bootstrap</span> file to be able to execute the Lambda function.</p><p>Create the file <span>S3GraalVM/bootstrap</span>, a script which will be bundled with the Lambda function and that AWS will call to execute the Lambda function. (Make sure you give the build_graalvm.sh execute permission)</p><p>We are almost done, the last thing we have to do is configure AWS SAM Cli to build our custom runtime. This is done though a <span>Makefile</span>. The Makefile is pretty simple, it just builds the gradle project and copies the <span>server</span> and <span>bootstrap</span> files to the SAM build directory.</p><p>Create file <span>S3GraalVM/Makefile</span> with the following code. (If you get the error Makefile:4: *** missing separator, it's because Makefile need to use TABS and not spaces to indent.)</p><p>Lastly, update the <span>template.yaml</span> file to include our new Lambda function.</p><p>Build the Lambda function by running the command in a terminal window, in the directory where the template.yaml file is (it will take a few minutes for GraalVM to build the project):</p><p>Produces the following output:</p><p>Deploy the Lambda function by running the command in a terminal window, in the directory where the template.yaml file is:</p><p>Produces the following output:</p></div><p>Just like above, we can use the AWS CLI to run the GraalVM Lambda function.</p><p>The output of the Lambda function will be written to a file called "output", with content similar to:</p><p>Running: "sam logs --name graalvm-s3-S3GraalVM-XXXXXXXXXXXX --region us-east-1", you should see the following:</p><p>As you can see, switching our Java Lambda function to use GraalVM has brought the duration from over 10 seconds cold start to less than 1/2 second.</p><p>We built two Lambda functions, one using standard Java 11 and a second using GraalVM. We saw that using GraalVM the runtime for our Lambda function went from over 10 seconds down to less than 1/2 a second.</p><p>If you want to learn more in detail about why AWS Lambda written in Java are slow, watch this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddg1u5HLwg8">"Best practices for AWS Lambda and Java"</a>, which was a session from Reinvent 2019.</p></div>]]>

    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>Many websites deliver one-time codes over SMS. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-gsm-sms">[GSM-SMS]</a></p>
    <p>Without a standard format for such messages, programmatic extraction of codes from them has to rely on heuristics, which are often unreliable and error-prone. Additionally, without a mechanism for associating such codes with specific websites, users might be tricked into providing the code to malicious sites.</p>
    <p>This specification defines a format for the delivery of one-time codes over SMS. This format associates the one-time code with a specific <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-origin" id="ref-for-concept-url-origin">origin</a>.</p>

   <p>This specification attempts to mitigate the phishing risk associated with the delivery of one-time codes over SMS by enabling User Agents to know what website the one-time code is intended for.</p>
   <p>This specification does not attempt to mitigate other risks associated with the delivery of one-time codes over SMS, such as SMS spoofing, SIM swapping, SIM cloning, ISMI-catchers, or interception of the message by an untrusted party.</p>
   <p>Sites would do well to consider using non-SMS technologies such as <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-webauthn">[WEBAUTHN]</a> for authentication or verification.</p>

   <p>Any party which has access to a user’s SMS messages (such as the user’s cellular carrier, mobile operating system, or anyone who intercepted the message) can learn that the user has an account on the service identified in an <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#origin-bound-one-time-code-message" id="ref-for-origin-bound-one-time-code-message⑦">origin-bound one-time code message</a> delivered over SMS.</p>
   <p>On some platforms, User Agents might need access to all incoming SMS messages—even messages which are not <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#origin-bound-one-time-code-message" id="ref-for-origin-bound-one-time-code-message⑧">origin-bound one-time code messages</a>—in order to support the autofilling of <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#origin-bound-one-time-code" id="ref-for-origin-bound-one-time-code①⑥">origin-bound one-time codes</a> delivered over SMS in <a data-link-type="dfn" href="#origin-bound-one-time-code-message" id="ref-for-origin-bound-one-time-code-message⑨">origin-bound one-time code messages</a>.</p>

    <div>
        
        
        <p>Natively Cloud Native</p>
        <p><strong>Version:</strong> </p>
    </div>
    





<p>Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for Java, Kotlin and the Groovy language.</p>
<p>Micronaut is developed by the creators of the Grails framework and takes inspiration from lessons learnt over the years building real-world applications from monoliths to microservices using Spring, Spring Boot and Grails.</p>
<p>Micronaut aims to provide all the tools necessary to build JVM applications including:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensible Defaults and Auto-Configuration</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>With Micronaut you can build Message-Driven Applications, Command Line Applications, HTTP Servers and more whilst for Microservices in particular Micronaut also provides:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distributed Configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service Discovery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP Routing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client-Side Load Balancing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>At the same time Micronaut aims to avoid the downsides of frameworks like Spring, Spring Boot and Grails by providing:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fast startup time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced memory footprint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimal use of reflection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimal use of proxies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No runtime bytecode generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy Unit Testing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Historically, frameworks such as Spring and Grails were not designed to run in scenarios such as server-less functions, Android apps, or low memory-footprint microservices. In contrast, Micronaut is designed to be suitable for all of these scenarios.</p>
<p>This goal is achieved through the use of Java’s <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html">annotation processors</a>, which are usable on any JVM language that supports them, as well as an HTTP Server and Client built on <a href="https://netty.io/">Netty</a>. In order to provide a similar programming model to Spring and Grails, these annotation processors precompile the necessary metadata in order to perform DI, define AOP proxies and configure your application to run in a low-memory environment.</p>
<p>Many of the APIs within Micronaut are heavily inspired by Spring and Grails. This is by design, and aids in bringing developers up to speed quickly.</p>

<h2 id="whatsNew"><a href="#whatsNew"></a>1.1 What's New?</h2>




<p>Micronaut 2.0.0 includes the following changes:</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_core_features">Core Features</h3>
<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_jdk_14">Support for JDK 14</h4>
<p>Micronaut has been updated to support JDK 14.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_groovy_3">Groovy 3</h4>
<p>Micronaut now supports applications written in Groovy 3.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_startup_performance_improvements">Startup Performance Improvements</h4>
<p>Startup time has been further improved in this release with typical startup time for a new application around 20% faster.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_improvements_to_bean_introspections">Improvements to Bean Introspections</h4>
<p>Bean introspections have been improved to support static creator methods, interfaces and enums. This means you can define a bean introspection on an interface with a private implementation such as:</p>
<div>
<p>Introspections on interfaces</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">import io.micronaut.core.annotation.Creator;

@io.micronaut.core.annotation.Introspected
interface Example {
    String getName();

    @Creator
    static Example create(String name) {
        return () -&gt; name;
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_analyzing_the_injection_point">Support for Analyzing the Injection Point</h4>
<p>Micronaut’s Dependency Injection implementation has been improved such that you can now receive an <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/inject/InjectionPoint.html">InjectionPoint</a> instance to any <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Factory.html">@Factory</a> method. This makes it possible to customize how the bean is created based on the annotation metadata at the point at which the bean is injected.</p>
<p>For example consider the following definition:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">@Inject @Client("http://foo.com") RxHttpClient client;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>A factory method can receive the injection point and create a client based off of the value:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">@Bean
protected DefaultHttpClient httpClient(InjectionPoint&lt;?&gt; injectionPoint) {
    String url = metadata.stringValue(Client.class).orElse(null);
    if (url != null) {
        return new DefaultHttpClient(url);
    } else {
        return new DefaultHttpClient();
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_eager_initialization_of_beans">Support for Eager Initialization of Beans</h4>
<p>Eager initialization of beans is useful in certain cases, such as on AWS Lambda where more CPU resources are assigned to Lamdba construction than execution. Therefore as for Micronaut 2.0, you can specify whether you want to eager initialization configuration or all singletons using the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/context/ApplicationContextBuilder.html">ApplicationContextBuilder</a> interface:</p>
<div>
<p>Enabling Eager Initialization</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Micronaut.build(args)
            .eagerInitSingletons(true) <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
            .mainClass(Application.class)
            .start();
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>Setting eager init to true initializes all singletons</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>It is also possible to just eager init configuration using <code>eagerInitConfiguration</code> which will initialize all <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/context/annotation/ConfigurationProperties.html">@ConfigurationProperties</a> beans.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_spot_bugs_instead_of_jsr_305_nullable_nonnull_annotations">Spot Bugs Instead of JSR-305 Nullable/NonNull Annotations</h4>
<p>In Micronaut 1.x the Google distributed JSR-305 annotations library (<code>com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305</code>) was used to specify <code>@Nullable</code> and <code>@NonNull</code> on interfaces of the Micronaut API using the annotations contained within the <code>javax.annotation</code> package.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that JSR-305 has been cancelled and that this dependency has potential licensing issues (by using the <code>javax</code> namespace) as well as problems with the cross packages on Java 9+ with the module system Micronaut 2.x switches to the <code>spotbugs-annotations</code> module provided by the <a href="https://spotbugs.github.io/">SpotBugs project</a>.</p>
<p>It is recommended users of Micronaut use this API instead (although the <code>javax.annotation.Nullable</code> and <code>javax.annotation.NotNull</code> annotations continue to be supported).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_cli_features">CLI Features</h3>

<div>
<h4 id="_micronaut_launch">Micronaut Launch</h4>
<p>Create Micronaut 2.0 applications without having the CLI installed using <code>curl</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">$ curl https://launch.micronaut.io/demo.zip -o demo.zip
$ unzip demo.zip -d demo</code></pre>
</div>
</div>


</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_diff_command">Diff Command</h4>
<p>Run <code>mn feature-diff --features=[FEATURE NAME]</code> from the root of another Micronaut project to create a diff of the changes that need to be applied to enable the feature. For example:</p>
<div>
<p>Using <code>feature-diff</code></p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">$ mn feature-diff --features=azure-function

</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_threading_model_and_event_loop_group_improvements">Threading Model and Event Loop Group Improvements</h4>
<p>Micronaut 2.0 uses a new shared default Netty <code>EventLoopGroup</code> for server worker threads and client request threads. This reduces context switching and improves resource utilization.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#clientConfiguration">HTTP Client Configuration</a> section for information on how to configure the default <code>EventLoopGroup</code> and add additional `EventLoopGroup’s that are configured per client.</p>
<p>In addition, as of Micronaut 2.0 all operations are by default executed on the <code>EventLoop</code> and users can optionally use the new <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/scheduling/annotation/ExecuteOn.html">@ExecuteOn</a> annotation to specify a named executor to execute an operation on if required (for example to offload blocking operations such as interactions with JPA/JDBC to a specific thread pool).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_code_requestbean_code">Support for <code>@RequestBean</code></h4>
<p>It is now possible to bind the properties of a POJO argument to a <code>@Controller</code> to request parameters, headers and so on using the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/http/annotation/RequestBean.html">@RequestBean</a> annotation.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>When working on a website or a service, the development environment should imitate as much as possible the production one. And since most production websites and services are served on HTTPS, the same should happen for the development versions as well. This is exactly what <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert">mkcert</a> is trying to solve.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert">mkcert</a> is a tool that makes it easy to generate locally-trusted SSL certificates signed by a local CA (Certificate Authority).</p> <p>On macOS, you can use Homebrew to install the tool:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span># Install on macOS</span>
brew <span>install </span>mkcert
<span># Generate and install a local CA</span>
mkcert <span>-install</span>
<span># Create a new certificate</span>
mkcert <span>-key-file</span> key.pem <span>-cert-file</span> cert.pem localhost
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now you can use the SSL key and cert for your local server. For instance, if you have a Jekyll blog, you can use the following command to serve on HTTPS</p> <div><div><pre><code>jekyll server <span>--ssl-cert</span> ./cert.pem <span>--ssl-key</span> ./key.pem
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now, you can browse your local Jekyll site on <a href="https://localhost:4000/"><code>https://localhost:4000</code></a>! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p> </div></div>]]>

				<div>
				<div><div><p><span><strong><span>We, the signatories of this Manifesto to decarbonize Europe, call upon all European States to immediately implement policies aiming to achieve a level of greenhouse gas emissions close to zero by 2050!</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The Paris Climate Agreement urges Europe to completely reinvent its economy. Much – if not all – remains to be done. This challenge involves all sectors which remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels: industry and electricity generation, transport, building and agriculture, as well as (albeit more indirectly) the finance and insurance sectors and public policies.</span></p>
<p><span>Europe saw the birth of the first industrial revolution, which relied on coal and hydrocarbon. In 150 years, humanity has consumed nearly half of the amount of oil Nature took half a billion years to create. It is now imperative to build a future free of depletable energy sources, which are irrevocably degrading the climate.</span></p>
<p><span>Europe must lead the way to the next industrial revolution, the one that will take us beyond the era of fossil fuels. Europe stands to reap massive benefits from such a revolution. Coal and steel were at the heart of the European project when it was built after the Second World War. It can now regenerate itself to create a new world – one that is prosperous and sustainable. A world of peace.</span></p>
<p><span>Together we can create a post-carbon Europe. This fresh impetus can be a driving force for Europe itself and for the world, to prevent the living conditions on our planet from being ravaged forever.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>We call upon all European actors – individuals, businesses and public authorities – to implement concrete and coherent strategies which can meet the challenge posed by climate change and the limits of natural resources. </span></strong><span>The European Union can and must take the necessary steps to align its actions with the ambitious and vital objective set out by the Paris Agreement. Success will only be achieved by working together towards this common goal, while respecting our differences which are a source of both solidarity and synergies. This historic endeavour will take shape thanks to Europe’s founding strengths: reason, freedom and boldness.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The technical and organizational solutions for this transition already exist; all that is now required is the European will to formulate political responses accordingly. These responses can quickly lead to a new economy, source of new profits, job opportunities and well-being. We acknowledge the fact that those answers require us to change our ways of producing, consuming but above all, thinking.</span></p>
<p><span>Are we going to give up because of the magnitude of this task?</span></p>
<p><span>We have the moral duty to act. We also have the necessary ambition.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Once again, Europe has a rendezvous with History. The challenge is huge? Good. Anticipating the inevitable is a triumph over the future. The scale of the undertaking is equivalent to everything that Europe has done since its creation. This challenge is the path to modernity.&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>

              <p>Well, while others are using some of their time to hate, real developers continue to fix and improve. It's the custom in the software development ecosystem. You need to understand that no code wears out, It's eternal. but the man is not. That's why we need to decide well, focus, and be consistent in our decisions.</p>

<p>As a PHP developer for the past ten years, I know how it <a href="https://phpocean.com/blog/article/15-reasons-why-i-love-php/23">changed my life</a> and that of millions of others out there. That's why we keep on maintaining, using, and improving it to make sure it always satisfies the current market needs. This makes PHP to always be modern, I mean, the king.</p>

<p>So, the big news <s>today</s> yesterday is that the long-awaited <a href=""> PHP 8.0</a> is finally available in Alpha 1 with the freshest new feature — JIT(Just In Time) compilation. This is one of the newest features that the version 8 ships. It's promising to be a game-changer in terms of performance. Among other features you can also expect to have a support for union types, a new static return type, attributes,  str<em>contains(), str</em>starts<em>with, str</em>ends_with, and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/add-cms-support">Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)</a>. </p>

<p>Also, many more fixes have been applied to core features such as CURL, PDO, Date, FPM, GD, JSON, etc. And talking of JSON, the extension is now an integral part of PHP and cannot be disabled. This means you don't need to install the JSON extension manually after every installation of PHP like we use to do. It's particularly my favorite.</p>

<p>We can expect to have a final release by December this year. The next release, Alpha 2, is scheduled for Jul 09, 2020. Let's give it a try and have our own opinion.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is an excerpt from my upcoming course</em> <a href="https://michaelnthiessen.com/reusable-components">Reusable Components</a></p>
<!-- Put this wherever you would like your player to appear -->

<p>We all want to write less code, but get more done.</p>
<p>To make this happen, we build our components so they can be reused more than just once.</p>
<p>Some components only need basic reusability.</p>
<p>Others need far more complex techniques to get the most out of them.</p>
<p>I've identified 6 different levels of reusability, but there may be more that I've missed.</p>
<p>Here is a basic overview of the levels. My upcoming course, <em>Reusable Components</em>, explores each one and how to get the most out of them.</p>
<h2 id="1-templating">1. Templating</h2>
<p>Instead of copy + pasting code around everywhere, with this technique we wrap it up inside it's own component.</p>
<p>When we reuse the component —&nbsp;and not the code directly —&nbsp;it gives us two benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making changes in the future is much easier to do, since we only have to do it one place</li>
<li>We don't have to remember the dozens (or hundreds) of places we've copied that code to</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the most basic, and most often talked about form of reusability.</p>
<p>But the higher levels get a lot more interesting...</p>
<h2 id="2-configuration">2. Configuration</h2>
<p>With some components we'll need to have variations on how they work.</p>
<p>A <code>Button</code> component might have a primary version, as well as an icon-only version. But instead of creating entirely new components for each of these versions, we use props to switch between the different types.</p>
<p>Adding in these props doesn't usually add much to a component, but gives us far more flexibility in how that component can be used. Neat-o.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is different than using props for state or data, such as a <code>loading</code> prop or a <code>disabled</code> prop.</em></p>
<h2 id="3-adaptability">3. Adaptability</h2>
<p>The biggest problem with configuration is lack of foresight. You need to anticipate future needs and build them into the component by putting in those props.</p>
<p>But if you make your component <em>adaptable</em>, it can allow for use cases that were never even thought of — without needing to change the component.</p>
<p>We do this by passing a chunk of markup from the parent to the component using a slot.</p>
<p>For example, instead of using a <code>text</code> prop in a <code>Button</code> component, we can use the <code>default</code> slot:</p>
<pre>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span>
    <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>btn btn--default<span>"</span></span>
    <span>@click</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>$emit('click')<span>"</span></span>
  <span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>slot</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span></pre>
<p>Now we're not limited to just passing a <code>string</code> or <code>number</code> in.</p>
<p>If we wanted to add in a <code>loading</code> spinner without having to modify our <code>Button</code> component, we can do that:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>Button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span>
      <span>v-if</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>loading<span>"</span></span>
      <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>spinner.svg<span>"</span></span>
    <span>/&gt;</span></span>
    Click Me
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span></pre>
<h2 id="4-inversion">4. Inversion</h2>
<p>Instead of passing a complete chunk of markup to our child component, we can pass a set of instructions for <em>how</em> to render.</p>
<p>This is like following a recipe instead of ordering takeout. When you follow a recipe it's a little more work, but you have total control over what you're making. You can tweak things as you go, or throw out the recipe altogether.</p>
<p>We use scoped slots to add even more flexibility to our components.</p>
<h2 id="5-extension">5. Extension</h2>
<p>With Adaptability and Inversion we have the necessary techniques to maximize the reusability of our components.</p>
<p>The next step is to apply these techniques all throughout our component so we can more easily extend it's behaviour.</p>
<p>We use named slots to add in one or more extension points in our component. Where Adaptability and Inversion on their own only give us one option to extend behaviour, having multiple extension points gives us many different options.</p>
<p>Here we have a <code>Modal</code> component with a <code>header</code>, <code>default</code>, and a <code>footer</code>:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>&lt;</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>modal<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>slot</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>header<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
      <span><span><span>&lt;</span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span></span>{{ title }}<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>slot</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

    
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>slot</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>

    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>slot</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>footer<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
      <span><span><span>&lt;</span>Button</span> <span>@click</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>closeModal<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
        Close
      <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>slot</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></span></pre>
<p>This is a fairly simple example of Extension, but we already have several options for extending this component:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just override the <code>default</code> slot to add in our content</li>
<li>Add in content but also override the <code>header</code> slot</li>
<li>Content and just the <code>footer</code> slot to add different buttons</li>
<li>Content and both <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> slots for something more custom</li>
</ol>
<p>(We <em>could</em> add more if we didn't use the <code>default</code> slot, but that's unlikely here)</p>
<p>You don't have to extend the behaviour of this component, or you can extend parts of it. Either way, you get a lot of flexibility and a lot of code reuse.</p>
<h2 id="6-nesting">6. Nesting</h2>
<p>We'll take Extension to it's conclusion by passing these extension points through one or more layers of components.</p>
<p>It may sound crazy at first, but it's extremely useful, especially in medium to large applications.</p>
<p>You start with a base component that's fairly general in what it does. The next component is a little more specific, extending the base component in a few ways. Then on and on until you have the final component that does the real work.</p>
<p>It's exactly how we go from a very general <code>Animal</code> to a more specific <code>Mammal</code> and then <code>Dog</code> and eventually land on a <code>Poodle</code>. If all we need is a <code>Poodle</code> component, we're wasting our time here, but in large applications we need lots of variations on the same basic idea.</p>
<p>We can extend the <code>Dog</code> component to get a <code>Corgi</code> and a <code>Beagle</code> component. Or extend the <code>Mammal</code> component to get a <code>Cat</code> component, which lets us then add in <code>Tiger</code> and <code>Lion</code> components.</p>
<p>This is the most advanced application of reusability that I have come across. I use this technique <em>a lot</em> in my own work.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are the 6 levels of reusability that I've come across.</p>
<p>I might have missed some, and I certainly wouldn't say that this is an exhaustive list, but it's complete enough to be useful.</p>
<p>A short article like this doesn't do them justice, but I go into them in much more depth in my upcoming course, <a href="https://michaelnthiessen.com/reusable-components">Reusable Components</a>.</p>

June 26, 2020 | https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/hardcoded-secrets-unverified-tokens-and-other-common-jwt-mistakes/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/hardcoded-secrets-unverified-tokens-and-other-common-jwt-mistakes/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 7519)</a> that defines a way to provide information within a JSON object between two parties. This standard is intended to help transmit information securely, but no standard or technology will protect you when used improperly.</p>
<p>To identify what can go wrong when using JWT in Node.js, I performed a security review on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">npm</a> modules that use the most popular JWT libraries. Using static analysis tooling, I examined 2,000 npm modules for security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This post summarizes some common mistakes that were found during my research, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardcoded secrets</li>
<li>Allowing the <code>none</code> algorithm for signing</li>
<li>Missing or incorrect token validation</li>
<li>Sensitive data exposure</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to describing these issues so you can avoid them, this post includes open source rules that make it easier to either manually audit your code bases to detect them, or include in CI so these vulnerabilities never get merged into your code in the first place.</p>
<h2>Hardcoded secrets</h2>
<p>The most basic mistake is using hardcoded secrets for JWT generation/verification. This allows an attacker to forge the token if the source code (and JWT secret in it) is publicly exposed or leaked.</p>
<p>Not only does this introduce a vulnerability, it’s also considered a software anti-pattern. You should keep your JWT secrets apart from your code, for example, in separate configuration files or environment variables.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> secret <span>=</span> <span>"hardcoded-secret-here"</span><span>;</span> 

<span>class</span> <span>JwtAuthentication</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>static</span> <span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>obj</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>sign</span><span>(</span>obj<span>,</span> secret<span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that a popular way to use JWTs is within other libraries, e.g., through <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-jwt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passport</a>, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>var</span> JwtStrategy <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'passport-jwt'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>Strategy<span>,</span>
    ExtractJwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'passport-jwt'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>ExtractJwt<span>;</span>

<span>var</span> opts <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    secretOrKey<span>:</span><span>'hardcoded-secret-here'</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span>

passport<span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>JwtStrategy</span><span>(</span>opts<span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>jwt_payload<span>,</span> done</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even though this is a known and quite obvious issue, it’s still common to use hardcoded secrets while developing and then accidentally leave it in your codebase. Fortunately, it’s also very easy to find hardcoded secrets with SAST tools, especially with <a href="https://semgrep.live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep</a>, which helps to find complex code patterns with rules that are very simple to write.
Rules for detecting hardcoded secrets:</p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-hardcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-hardcode</a></p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.passport-jwt.security.passport-hardcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.passport-jwt.security.passport-hardcode</a></p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.express.security.express-jwt-hardcoded-secret" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.express.security.express-jwt-hardcoded-secret</a></p>
<h2>Allowing 'none' algorithm for signing</h2>
<p>Allowing tokens to have the 'none' algorithm was <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/#Meet-the%E2%80%94None%E2%80%94Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a critical vulnerability</a> some years ago. Nowadays, most popular JWT libraries do not allow decoding or verifying tokens with the None algorithm without explicitly enabling it. The same as with hardcoded secrets, it’s easy to leave ‘'none'` in your codebase after testing or debugging.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> secret <span>=</span> <span>"some-secret"</span><span>;</span>
jwt<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span><span>"token-here"</span><span>,</span> secret<span>,</span> <span>{</span> algorithms<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"RS256"</span><span>,</span> <span>"none"</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Anyway, if you forget to remove it after messing with code, it’s also very easy to catch it with Semgrep.
Rules for detecting ‘none’ algorithm allowed in your code:</p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jose.security.jwt-none-alg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jose.security.jwt-none-alg</a></p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-none-alg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-none-alg</a></p>
<h2>Not verifying tokens the right way</h2>
<p>Sometimes developers rely on their methods of token verification instead of using built-in API, or omit verification completely.
Small wonder that usually it introduces the opportunity for attackers to forge information inside the token.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>checkToken</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>token<span>,</span> refreshToken<span>,</span> key</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note: only <code>refreshToken</code> is verified in the example above, which gives an opportunity to attacker to manipulate function results. By changing value of <code>param</code> property stored inside <code>token</code> an attacker can force the result of <code>checkToken</code> function to be <code>true</code> and pass the verification.</p>
<p>On top of that, it’s very typical to get certain data from tokens before verifying it (issue date, id, etc.) and then use it as a verification context. Usually it’s harmless, but only if this data does not go any further. If the information from an unverified token is passed to other parts of the code it may introduce a vulnerability.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>function</span> <span>checkToken</span><span>(</span><span>token</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  database<span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span>iss<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(In the example above, the unverified <code>issuer</code> value is passed to another function before validating the token (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection</a>). If not used carefully it may end up in different kinds of injection vulnerabilities, especially if located in separate parts of the codebase.)</p>
<p>Also do not forget that even if a token is verified properly, the data stored in it should be treated as user input and be validated and sanitized according to the context.</p>
<p>Rule that helps identify lack of token verification:</p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.audit.jwt-decode-without-verify" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.audit.jwt-decode-without-verify</a></p>
<h2>Sensitive data exposure</h2>
<p>When an object is converted to a JWT token without explicitly breaking it down into parts, it’s very easy to lose control of what is inside the object and disclose some sensitive information.</p>
<p>This is a very widespread mistake while using ORM libraries like Mongoose, Sequelize, etc. ORM models do not include any sensitive data at the moment of creation, but when the situation changes it is very easy to forget that the ORM object is also passed to JWT token.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> mongoose <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'mongoose'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
Schema <span>=</span> mongoose<span>.</span>Schema<span>;</span>

        success<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
        message<span>:</span> <span>'Enjoy your token!'</span><span>,</span>
        token<span>:</span> token
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Needless to say, you should not keep sensitive data in JWT token intentionally.</p>
<p>Helpful Semgrep rules:</p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.audit.jwt-exposed-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.audit.jwt-exposed-data</a></p>

<p>These are the most common mistakes developers make when using JWT in their Node.js projects. Stay secure and don’t forget to automate security scans in your codebase.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The transition from Intel to Apple Silicon Macs is a huge deal, but some are
lamenting this shift as a loss to developers, especially those who rely on
virtualization such as Docker. The concern is that under x86 emulation instead
of hypervisor, the performance hit could be significant.</p>

<p>As the case may be, my take is the issue wouldn’t be that serious, while the
upside for developers is huge, especially for those who primarily develop
for Apple’s ecosystem. And if my hunch is correct, that ecosystem will expand
to server-side soon enough. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I’m a huge fan of Docker, and I’m a ML practitioner working
primarily on server-side within Linux, so I’m very familiar with the importance
of the development machines being consistent as server-side. Funnily enough,
I’d say this is the biggest rationale for Apple going ARM for Macs, which is to make
the development environment <em>exactly the same</em> as their deployment targets, namely
iOS, iPadOS, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and soon, MacOS.</p>

<p>That is to say, the current situation is that Xcode development is done on x86,
emulated in x86 simulators, and re-built for ARM for device deployment.
This has been the
state since the first iPhone and Apple has done a superb job maintaining the
seamlessness of this process ever since (as far as I know),
but more edge cases are beginning to crop up.</p>

<h3 id="edge-case-or-tentpole">Edge Case or Tentpole?</h3>

<p>From my narrow view of ML, the one I experience is the lack of emulation of
Apple’s Neural Engine (ANE) for accelerating model inferencing. Once a model
is compiled to Core ML, the emulator would execute the model on CPU and possibly
GPU, but its behavior is different on device when offloaded
to ANE. It’s not only a performance difference, but also floating point
differences and possibly quantization nuances.</p>

<p>What this means is to truly test a ML model’s behavior on Apple devices, one
has to deploy to actual devices, likely via a cable to enable debugging. As you
guessed it, this also means that you’d have to have multiple physical devices
if one is to test against different models. Multiply this with different iOS
versions to test against, it quickly gets out of hand. If Apple wants to
(and likely plans to) add more custom hardware, the situation is untenable
for both Apple and its developers.</p>

<h3 id="virtualized-apples">Virtualized Apples?</h3>

<p>With ARM (and other custom silicon) on the development machines,
we already know iOS apps will run
natively so there’s no need for emulators. I wouldn’t be surprised if these
apps are running within individual virtualized instances, to as closely as
possible create the same behavior as actual devices. Apple could go as far
as virtualize the hardware resources and capabilities so performance would
be emulated faithfully also, greatly simplifying the
development, testing, and debugging process for developers.</p>

<p>For ANE, this switch will be huge. People have had to deal with “numerical
differences” when running ML models on CPU compared to ANE, a process that
is slow to debug via tethered devices.
With the Mac having the same hardware as the target devices,
there’s consistency and no hidden surprises.
Whenever the development cycle is shortened and
opaque differences removed, it’s a good thing.</p>

<p>What about the downside of Docker becoming 2 to 5x slower without hypervisor?
While that is indeed a downside, I’d argue that for local Docker instances,
they are better used for functional testing and not part of
the core development cycle.
Coming from the Python world, I have had no problems developing software in native OS
and only use local Docker for validation prior to deployment. The other main
use case for Docker of bringing up server clusters locally would be slower, but again, shouldn’t be core
part of the development cycle. There’s always the option for remote Docker or
even better, deploy to sandbox and integration environments for testing.</p>

<h3 id="armed-cloud">ARMed Cloud?</h3>

<p>That brings me to the last point about the ARM transition for Macs, which is
the aspect of developing for server-side, not an area of focus for Apple.
However, if Docker and virtualization needs are primarily for server-side
development, and to be consistent of being consistent, the problem of x86
emulation can be dealt with if Apple offers ARM-based cloud servers. Having this
uniformity would truly enable developers to write code on their ARM Macs,
test across devices locally, and deploy to iOS devices and server-side, all from one code base,
without translation, emulation, or hidden gotchas. Pretty sweet landscape for
Apple developers if you ask me.</p>

<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>

<p>Ever since I bought my Titanium MacBook Pro many years ago, I have been a fan
of Apple’s combination of software and hardware, but more importantly, its
long term approach to their product developments. This ARM Mac transition
has been long in the making, and I, for one, am excited again to buy an
ARM MacBook and the future it’d usher in.</p>

I would be lucky if I got a hit and got 1,000 plays on one of my songs. It was labour intensive. </p><p>Now algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly send 1,000 new listeners every week without any work on my part. This is amazing. Cold outreach sucks. It sucks for the artist and it sucks for the bloggers. Spotify deserves a lot of credit for here. </p><h3>3. Songs Matter, Not Albums</h3><p>Spotify's algorithmic playlists rank songs— not albums. It's just like in SEO: Google indexes pages, not websites. </p><p>This has elevated the importance of songs and made albums more irrelevant than ever— especially for small artists like me. (Of course famous artists like Drake and Billie Eilish can still get massive press from an album release— but most artists are not at that level of fame.)</p><p>These days it’s almost always better to release individual songs rather than albums.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-22e1940a7b25c119a57a"><div><p>I get why the growing irrelevance of albums bums some people out. Albums are big statements. Some of the most iconic releases in popular music have been albums. </p><p>… But things change and that’s okay. Plus I think asking listeners to listen to a full-length album don’t make sense in our attention-starved world. Asking listeners to listen to a single song might just be a more realistic ask. </p><h3>4. Human Editors Still Matter— Just Not How You Think</h3><p>The secret to getting your music on algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly is to get on <em>human</em> playlists first. </p><p>It’s similar to SEO: playlists are like backlinks. When a song is added to a playlist it's a vote for the quality of the song. Not every playlist is equally authoritative though— just like how a link from The NY Times is more authoritative than other links in SEO.  </p><p>On Spotify, the most authoritative playlists are <em>editorial</em> playlists. These are  playlists curated by official Spotify editors. <strong>In my experience, it’s only when I get on an editorial playlist that my songs get heavily featured on algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly.</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-d2618bdb9eb6fca6fb0b"><div>

I've been on editorial playlists 16 times but I have no idea how to replicate that.  </p><p><em>Note: In my experience, major label artists have an easier time getting on editorial playlists. This is discouraging— if major label artists have an easier time getting on editorial playlists, they’ll also get better placement in algorithmic playlists… But major label artists also only typically get 13% - 20% of streaming royalties… so there are still plenty of reasons to stay indie! </em></p><h3>5. Algorithms Make For Looser Relationships Between Artists And Listeners</h3><blockquote><p><em>"Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity." - David Bowie</em></p></blockquote><p>My most popular song 'Circles' has been played 1,350,00 times. And every month about 65,000 people listen to my music on Spotify. </p><p>Guess how many people follow me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stevebenjamins/">on Instagram</a>? 480. </p><p>Just because people listen to me on Spotify, doesn’t mean they want a deep relationship. Most listeners just add 'Circles' to their library and move on with their life.</p><p>I’m definitely okay with this. I’d rather listeners follow me on Spotify rather than Instagram anyways. Plus only good things can come out of de-coupling fame from music. Make music because it’s what you love to do— not because you want to get famous. If you want to get famous I think you’re better off as a Youtuber or Tiktok influencer anyways! </p><p><strong>I think this is just the nature of algorithmic playlists— they lead to a high volume of listeners with a very loose connection to you as an artist:</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-a901b06fafc5a15411fa"><div>

The Deepest Relationships Happen When Listeners Share Music With Friends</h3><p>Listeners sharing music among their friends leads to the deepest connections in my experience. </p><p>For example: last month I was interviewed on a college radio station by three guys. I was blown away by how closely these guys  listened to the music. They knew it so well and had spotted lyrical themes that I’ve repeated throughout songs that I thought I only noticed. It was clear there was a very deep connection.  </p><p>Hearing from listeners like that is nourishing in a way that a graph on Spotify just can't be.  It can be a very moving experience.</p><p>I’ve had similar experiences when high school students reach out to tell me everyone in their circle is listening to the music. Somehow they seem to just care about the music more— like their shared interest draws them deeper. </p><p>When you spend most of your time in an algorithmic world of music streaming, it can feel like magic when you meet listeners who found your music through friends. Sharing music between friends can’t much algorithms in sheer volume but it is by far the deepest way to build connections. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-9ce321c7732a79bf3e5a"><div>

<p>In April/May of 2010, I spent four weeks as a freelance writer for The Onion News Network.</p>
<p>Besides looking great on a resume, it was an awesome gig and a huge learning experience. Not surprisingly, I get asked about it pretty often.</p>
<p>So here's everything I know about how to get a job writing for <a href="http://www.theonion.com/">The Onion</a>, and what I learned from my (short) time doing it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="howigotajobfreelancewritingfortheonion">How I Got a Job Freelance Writing for The Onion</h2>
<hr>
<p>Getting a job writing for The Onion is not easy. But there's no big secret to it, either.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/jobs">The Onion has a jobs page</a> on their website.</p>
<p>Yep. That's the big story behind how I got hired to write for The Onion: I went on their website and applied.</p>
<p>But here's the thing -- I did this at least twice with no luck before I got accepted.</p>
<p>Here's how it worked back then:</p>
<p>I would check the job listings frequently (obsessively), and every once in a blue moon, there'd be a position on there called Freelancer or Freelance Writer. You'd send in an email with your resume and samples, and they'd send back an application for you to complete. You had to return two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>A list of 20 headlines</strong> and concepts for video sketches. (All the job listings I ever saw were for The Onion News Network -- their video leg. I never saw anything for editorial positions.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A completed script</strong> for one of their news segment sketches based on ideas or concepts they provided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Like I said, I went through this process (the final product is often known in the industry as a "packet") at least twice with no success. It doesn't sound like much, but it is TOUGH. I labored over those 20 headlines like you wouldn't believe. Even the best ideas start to look like shit after you've stared at them for a week.</p>
<p>And the scripts. Man, those were hard. They never gave you blockbuster concepts to work with, and I think that was on purpose. It was always some kind of dry, subtle joke -- they wanted to see what you could do and how far you would take it.</p>
<p>But the third time I applied was a charm. I'll never forget opening my email and seeing these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Onion News Network would like to congratulate you on being selected as a Contributor for the IFC series. We had a huge number of applicants, and we are thrilled with how strong this group is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember texting my wife -- girlfriend at the time. She was in class and stepped into the hall to call me. We both basically screamed on the phone for a couple of minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Side Note:</strong> I haven't seen any writing positions listed on The Onion's website in years. Granted, I don't check as frequently anymore, but I think the only way to get in with them these days is to be recruited, know someone there, or come up through the ranks as an intern or writer's assistant.</p>
<p>If you REALLY want to get a job writing for The Onion; email them. I've heard stories of people that have done this. They say they won't take anything unsolicited, and there's a 99% chance they won't, but who knows? Serendipity just might strike for you.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whatitwasliketowritefortheonion">What It Was Like to Write for The Onion</h2>
<hr>
<p>They put us to work right away. This was back in 2010, and The Onion was going into pre-production on its very first TV show -- The Onion News Network on IFC (The Independent Film Channel).</p>
<p>It would be a lot like the Onion video content we knew and loved, except in a half hour format and with recurring anchors as characters.</p>
<p>We were required to turn in 25 ideas a week; an "idea" being a headline or concept along with a short explanation of the joke and how the segment would play out.</p>
<p>Some weeks, we'd get really brief feedback on our lists. Other weeks, not. Then, by mid week, they'd compile all the ideas they liked. Some would be marked down as "one liners", or jokes that would be pulled in to scroll across the bottom of the screen during the show. Others were segmented by where in the show they might fit in, with some of them designated to move to the scripting stage (where the staff writers would take over).</p>
<p>The process moved fast. My job, along with the other freelancers, was to come up with ideas. We weren't really consulted or informed about anything else surrounding the show. No meetings to discuss casting. No phone calls to brainstorm around our jokes. It was our job to pump out creativity and let the full time staff filter everything out. Everything was done over email.</p>
<p>In the end, only one of my ideas actually made it into the show -- unless I missed a one-liner somewhere along the line, which would be easy to do.</p>
<p>Funny enough, the idea of mine that made it to production was one from my submission packet -- I'm pretty sure it's the reason they hired me. And they actually chose to open the entire series with it, which was pretty cool.</p>

<p>I recorded the pilot when it aired and probably watched it a dozen times with my family. One of the coolest moments I've ever had as a writer.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whatilearnedwritingfortheonion">What I Learned Writing for The Onion</h2>
<hr>
<p>This was a huge learning experience for me in a very short amount of time. I could probably talk for days about everything I learned working as a writer for The Onion for four weeks, but if I had to boil it down, here's what I'd say:</p>
<h3 id="ideasarecheap">Ideas are cheap.</h3>
<p>Or, in their case, jokes. They made us come up with so many sketch ideas and headlines. Huge lists of them. And once they were dead, they were dead. There was no reusing ideas that didn't quite make the cut in previous weeks. No iterating on almost-there jokes. When an idea was rejected, it was time to move on. Always bigger and better jokes, or ideas, out there to be found.</p>
<p>I also learned how to really dig into an idea to see if it had any potential. They were constantly pushing us to see past the headline. Is it just a funny sentence or is there room to explore and expand this into a 3 minute sketch? Is there substance?</p>
<h3 id="creativityisamuscle">Creativity is a muscle.</h3>
<p>What I loved about The Onion's writing process was the sheer volume of it. 25 ideas a week. No excuses. Often times, I'd turn in more than 25, along with a big list of one-liners I knew weren't big enough for full sketches. For one thing, it forced me to dig deep and get past those first initial ideas that came easily. It also helped me learn The Onion's editorial voice through repetition, which is something that can't be overstated.</p>
<h3 id="iamnotthatfunny">I am not that funny.</h3>
<p>I had one great idea and I used it up in my application to get the job. I wrote a few other funny jokes throughout, but nowhere near the level of The Onion's top writers. I wish I could show you these lists of approved ideas I got in my inbox each week. Reading through them was an absolute blast; these guys and girls are so freaking talented and funny.</p>
<p>At the end of the project, they opted to keep a few of the freelance writers on -- alas, I was not one of them. And I didn't expect to be. To be a professional humor writer, you have to be insanely funny and creative. I'm a good writer, and I got their voice, and I have a few good ideas, but I was never going to make it as a full-time writer for The Onion. And that's okay.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="intheend">In The End</h2>
<hr>
<p>Writing for The Onion was one of the coolest experiences I've ever had, and I feel lucky to have gotten the opportunity.</p>
<p>I mean, I got to see an idea I had sitting in my living room acted out on TV with a real script, real actors, and real production value. That was awesome, and I'll never forget it. And to top it off, I actually got a paycheck. People paid me real money to come up with jokes. That was incredible.</p>
<p>And I'd like to think that, even though the gig was short lived, I learned a ton by being bold enough to jump into the deep end with pro comedy writers.</p>
<p>Even if I didn't really belong there.</p>

Considering the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/comparing-database-types">vast number of different databases</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/types/relational/comparing-sql-query-builders-and-orms">variety of tools</a> for working with them, this is an extremely ambitious goal!</p><p>We are thrilled to enter the next chapter of pursuing this goal with a <strong>$12M Series A</strong> funding round led by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://amplifypartners.com/">Amplify Partners</a>. We are especially excited about this partnership as Amplify is an experienced investor in the developer tooling ecosystem and has led investments for numerous companies, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gremlin.com/">Gremlin</a>.</p><hr><h3 id="our-mission-making-databases-easy"><a href="#our-mission-making-databases-easy" aria-label="our mission making databases easy permalink"></a>Our mission: Making databases easy</h3><h4 id="database-tools-are-stuck-with-legacy-paradigms"><a href="#database-tools-are-stuck-with-legacy-paradigms" aria-label="database tools are stuck with legacy paradigms permalink"></a>Database tools are stuck with legacy paradigms</h4><p>Despite having been developed in the 1970s, relational <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/what-are-databases">databases</a> are still the most commonly used databases today. While <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/comparing-database-types">other database types have been developed in the meantime</a>, from <em>document</em>, to <em>graph</em> , to <em>key-value</em> databases, working with databases remains one of the biggest challenges in application development.</p><p>While almost any other part of the development stack has been modernized, database tools have been stuck with the same paradigms for the last decades.</p><p><span><img src="https://imgur.com/WwMdROo.png"></span></p><p>When working with relational databases, developers have the choice of working directly with SQL or using a higher-level abstraction called ORMs. <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/why-prisma#problems-with-sql-orms-and-other-database-tools">None of these options is particularly compelling</a>.</p><p>Using SQL is very low-level resulting in reduced developer <em>productivity</em>. In contrast, ORMs are too high-level and developers sacrifice <em>control</em> over the executed database operations when using this approach. ORMs further suffer from a fundamentally misguided abstraction called the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">object-relational impedance mismatch</a>.</p><h4 id="prisma-modernizes-how-developers-work-with-databases"><a href="#prisma-modernizes-how-developers-work-with-databases" aria-label="prisma modernizes how developers work with databases permalink"></a>Prisma modernizes how developers work with databases</h4><p>Similar to how React.js modernized frontend development or how Serverless invented a new model for compute infrastructure, <strong>Prisma is here to bring a new and modern approach for working with databases</strong>!</p><p>Prisma's unique approach to solving database access with a <em>generated</em> query builder that's fully type-safe and can be tailored to any database schema sets it apart from previous attempts of solving the same problem.</p><p>A big part of the modernization comes from our <strong>major focus on developer experience</strong>. Database tools are often associated with friction, uncertainty, painful hours of debugging and costly performance bottlenecks.</p><div><p><strong>Developer experience is part of our DNA at Prisma.</strong> Working with databases is too often associated with friction and uncertainty when it should be fun, delightful and productive!</p></div><p>We want to make working with databases <em>fun</em>, <em>delightful</em> and <em>productive</em> while guiding developers towards proper patterns and best practices in their daily work with databases!</p><h4 id="learning-from-our-past-from-graphql-to-databases"><a href="#learning-from-our-past-from-graphql-to-databases" aria-label="learning from our past from graphql to databases permalink"></a>Learning from our past: From GraphQL to databases</h4><p>As a company we've gone through a number of major product iterations and pivots over the last years.</p><p><span><img src="https://imgur.com/4YPWyaW.png"></span></p><p>Our initial products, Graphcool and Prisma 1 were focused on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> as a technology. However, as we were running both tools in production, we realized they didn't address the <em>core</em> problems developers had.</p><p>We realized that a lot of the value we provided with both tools didn't necessarily lie in the quick provision of a GraphQL server, but rather in the fact that developers didn't need to manage their <em>database workflows</em> explicitly.</p><p>This realization led to a pivot which ultimately manifested in the rewrite to Prisma 2. With this new version of Prisma, we have found the right level of abstraction that ensures developers keep full control and flexibility about their development stack while not needing to worry about database workflows!</p><h4 id="inspired-by-the-data-layers-of-big-companies-twitter-facebook-"><a href="#inspired-by-the-data-layers-of-big-companies-twitter-facebook-" aria-label="inspired by the data layers of big companies twitter facebook  permalink"></a>Inspired by the data layers of big companies (Twitter, Facebook, ...)</h4><p>The approach Prisma takes for this modernization is inspired by big tech companies such as Twitter, Facebook, or Airbnb. </p><p>To ensure productivity of application developers, it is a common practice in these organizations to introduce a <em>unified data access layer</em> that abstracts away the database infrastructure and provides developers with a more familiar and convenient way of accessing data.</p><p>Facebook developed a system called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/tao-facebooks-distributed-database-for-social-graph-c2b45f5346ea">TAO</a> that fulfills the data needs of application developers. Twitter has built a "virtual database" called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/graphql/graphql-at-twitter#schema">Strato</a> which <em>brings together multiple data sources so that they can be queried and mutated uniformly</em>. Airbnb <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/reconciling-graphql-and-thrift-at-airbnb-a97e8d290712">combines GraphQL and Thrift</a> to abstract away the implementation details of querying data.</p><p><span><img src="https://imgur.com/Hb9VOWN.png"></span></p><p>Building these custom data access layers requires <em>a lot</em> of time and resources (as these are typically implemented by dedicated <em>infrastructure teams</em>) and thus is not a realistic approach for most companies and development teams.</p><p>Being based on the same core ideas and principles as these systems, <strong>Prisma democratizes the pattern of a uniform data access layer</strong> and makes it accessible as an open-source technology for development teams of all sizes.</p><hr><h3 id="where-we-are-today"><a href="#where-we-are-today" aria-label="where we are today permalink"></a>Where we are today</h3><h4 id="prisma-20-is-ready-for-production"><a href="#prisma-20-is-ready-for-production" aria-label="prisma 20 is ready for production permalink"></a>Prisma 2.0 is ready for production</h4><p>After running Preview and Beta versions for more than a year, we've recently <a href="https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-2-n0v98rzc8br1">launched Prisma 2.0 for production</a>. Having rewritten the core of Prisma from Scala to Rust for the transition, we've built a strong foundation to expand the Prisma toolkit to cover various database workflows in the future.</p><p>Prisma's main feature is <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client">Prisma Client</a>, an auto-generated and type-safe query builder which can be used to access a database in Node.js and TypeScript. Thanks to <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/introspection">introspection</a>, Prisma Client can be used to work with any existing database!</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Prisma currently supports <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>SQLite</strong> databases –&nbsp;with more planned. Please create <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/new">new GitHub issues</a> or subscribe to existing ones (e.g. for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+mongo">MongoDB</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1676">DynamoDB</a>) if you'd like to see support for specific databases.</p></blockquote><h4 id="next-generation-web-frameworks-are-built-on-prisma"><a href="#next-generation-web-frameworks-are-built-on-prisma" aria-label="next generation web frameworks are built on prisma permalink"></a>Next-generation web frameworks are built on Prisma</h4><p>The Node.js ecosystem is known for lots of different frameworks that try to streamline workflows and prescribe certain conventions. We are extremely humbled that many framework authors decide to use Prisma as their data layer of choice.</p><h5 id="redwoodjs-bringing-full-stack-to-the-jamstack"><a href="#redwoodjs-bringing-full-stack-to-the-jamstack" aria-label="redwoodjs bringing full stack to the jamstack permalink"></a>Redwood.js: Bringing full-stack to the Jamstack</h5><p>The new <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://redwoodjs.com/">RedwoodJS</a> framework by GitHub co-founder <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/mojombo">Tom Preston-Werner</a> seeks to become the "Ruby on Rails" equivalent for Node.js.

Blitz is build on top of Next.js and takes a fundamentally different approach compared to Redwood. Its goal is to completely eliminate the API server and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/blob/canary/rfc-docs/01-architecture.md#introduction">"bring back the simplicity of server rendered frameworks"</a>.</p><h5 id="nexus-a-delightful-graphql-application-framework"><a href="#nexus-a-delightful-graphql-application-framework" aria-label="nexus a delightful graphql application framework permalink"></a>Nexus: A delightful GraphQL application framework</h5><p>At Prisma, we're huge fans of GraphQL and believe in its bright future. That's why we founded the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma-labs/">Prisma Labs</a> team which dedicates its time to work on open source tools in the GraphQL ecosystem.</p><p>It is currently focused on building <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nexusjs.org/#/">Nexus</a>, a delightful application framework for developing GraphQL servers. As opposed to RedwoodJS, Nexus is a <em>backend-only</em> GraphQL framework and has no opinions on how you access the GraphQL API from the frontend.</p><h3 id="whats-next-for-prisma"><a href="#whats-next-for-prisma" aria-label="whats next for prisma permalink"></a>What's next for Prisma</h3><h4 id="database-migrations-with-prisma-migrate"><a href="#database-migrations-with-prisma-migrate" aria-label="database migrations with prisma migrate permalink"></a>Database migrations with Prisma Migrate</h4><p>Database migrations are a common pain point for many developers! Especially with applications running in production, it is often unclear what the best approach is to perform schema changes (e.g. in CI/CD environments). Many developers resort to manual migrations or custom scripts, making the process brittle and error-prone.</p><p><a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate">Prisma Migrate</a> is our solution to this problem. Prisma Migrate lets developers map the declarative <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema">Prisma schema</a> to their database. Under the hood, Prisma Migrate generates the required SQL statements to perform the migration.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Prisma Migrate is currently in an experimental state and should not be used in production environments.</p></blockquote><h4 id="prisma-studio-a-visual-editor-for-your-database-workflows"><a href="#prisma-studio-a-visual-editor-for-your-database-workflows" aria-label="prisma studio a visual editor for your database workflows permalink"></a>Prisma Studio: A visual editor for your database workflows</h4><p><a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-studio">Prisma Studio</a> is your visual companion for various database workflows. It provides a modern GUI that lets you view and edit the data in your database. You can switch between the <em>table</em> and the <em>tree</em> view, the latter is especially convenient to drill deeply into nested data (explore the two views using the tabs below or try out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://prisma.studio/">online demo</a>).</p><div><p><span><img src="https://imgur.com/Fc7BweP.png"></span></p></div><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Prisma Studio is currently in an experimental state and should not be used in production environments. .</p></blockquote><h4 id="beyond-nodejs--typescript-prisma-client-in-other-languages"><a href="#beyond-nodejs--typescript-prisma-client-in-other-languages" aria-label="beyond nodejs  typescript prisma client in other languages permalink"></a>Beyond Node.js &amp; TypeScript: Prisma Client in other languages</h4><p>Prisma Client is a thin, language-specific layer that delegates the heavy-lifting of query planning and execution to Prisma's <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/query-engine">query engine</a>. The query engine is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines">written in Rust</a> and runs as a standalone process alongside your main application.</p><p>This architecture enables us to expand Prisma Client to other languages and bring its benefits to developers beyond the Node.js community. We are already working on <strong>Prisma Client in Go</strong> with a first <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-go">alpha version</a> ready to try out!</p><h4 id="supporting-a-broad-spectrum-of-databases-and-other-data-sources"><a href="#supporting-a-broad-spectrum-of-databases-and-other-data-sources" aria-label="supporting a broad spectrum of databases and other data sources permalink"></a>Supporting a broad spectrum of databases and other data sources</h4><p>Prisma is designed in a way that it can potentially connect to <em>any</em> existing data source as long as there is the right <em>connector</em> for it!</p><p>As of today, we've built connectors for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite. A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1277">connector for MongoDB</a> is already in the works and more are planned for the future.</p><p><span><img src="https://imgur.com/PQSljF7.png"></span></p><h4 id="building-commercial-services-to-sustain-the-oss-tools"><a href="#building-commercial-services-to-sustain-the-oss-tools" aria-label="building commercial services to sustain the oss tools permalink"></a>Building commercial services to sustain the OSS tools</h4><p>We are commited to building world-class open-source tools to solve common database problems of application developers. To be able to sustain our open-source work, we're planning to build commercial services that will enable development teams and organizations to collaborate better in projects that are using Prisma.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: The plans for commercial services do not affect the open-source tools we are building, those will remain free forever.</p></blockquote><hr><p>We are incredibly grateful for everyone who has accompanied us on our journey!

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Safe to say that the past couple months have gone a lot different than many of us were expecting. In early March, as quarantine was starting and all of my projection design gigs were being cancelled, I hit up a couple close friends about building a non-linear theatre experience entirely online. A lot of folks have been trying to perform plays on Zoom (and have found a lot of interesting and clever ways of working with that medium), but I felt like we could make something really unique if we built our own custom video conferencing app.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/initial-google-doc.png">
<strong>The Google Doc that started it all</strong></p>

<p>Crazy? It definitely would’ve been 10 years ago. But advances in the web platform (as well as the quality of cameras and hardware in mobile devices) took this down into the realm of “possible-if-slightly-quixotic”.</p>

<p>Three months later, we’ve done it: Shattered Space is a piece of interactive theatre about a binary star system whose twin stars (“The Mothers”) have disappeared. You and your fellow audience members are Star Jockeys, and have been conscripted to fly around in spaceships to get to know the denizens of the Matra System and see what you can do to help.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iifZPEHJM6c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Here’s a trailer if you want a better idea of what’s going on</strong></p>

<p>If you watched that trailer, you’ve probably figured out that this show involved 3D graphics (WebGL), videoconferencing (WebRTC) and perhaps also some music and audio processing (Web Audio). These were all technologies that I’d worked with on some level in the past, but this show required me to think about them completely differently. All because of the following central problem:</p>

<h2 id="other-peoples-computers">Other People’s Computers</h2>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nGt8w9RbhvY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>This WebRTC-based monitoring system allowed the backstage band to see the stage in real time and take cues from actors. The onstage portal was rendered with WebGL. (<em>Welcome to Shakesville</em>, Baltimore Rock Opera Society 2019)</strong></p>

<p>I’ve used WebGL and WebRTC to build projection/video effects for a number of shows the past couple years, but in every case I was writing code that would only run on <strong>my</strong> computer. If I ran into a device-specific bug that affected my computer (or my iPhone, or my squad of Raspberry Pis) I had all the time and access I needed to either debug it or come up with a workaround. Not this time.</p>

<p>If someone pays us $15, receives the login link via email, tries to open it on a cheap 2014 laptop and it can’t load without crashing, that’s a refund. We weren’t just messing around with advanced web features, we needed to deploy them in the most battle-hardened and resilient way possible, while also capturing just enough data and logs to pinpoint who was having problems and ideally solve them before the show started.</p>

<p>This meant going beyond the kinds of code you see in introductory tutorials and really digging into how these APIs deal with memory management, how they respond to connection issues, how they can fail, and how to tweak things at runtime to ensure that framerates stay high and dropped packets are few. I learned a lot about productizing these features, and I’d like to share as much of that as I can, but first let’s talk basics.</p>

<h2 id="basic-platform-overview">Basic Platform Overview</h2>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/ship-in-flight.png">
<strong>A group of attendees interacting with a character in the show</strong></p>

<p>Attendees of Shattered Space are broken up into 6 groups of 5. Each group is assigned to a “ship” that flies around the system, and they interact with the characters in the show as a group. Attendees have the options to mute their microphone and turn off their camera if they wish (there is a text chat on the side they can use to communicate) although we encourage people to keep them on if they feel comfortable.</p>

<p>The Shattered Space platform consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An ExpressJS service that keeps track of the overall state of the show.</li>
  <li>7 Janus WebRTC media servers. One for each ship and a extra for broadcasting a livestream of the ending scene.</li>
  <li>The Admin App, a React/Redux webapp that handles scheduling shows, keeping track of which actor is talking to which ship, and has real-time dashboards with logs of client-side errors and connectivity issues.</li>
  <li>The Actor App, a React/Redux webapp used by actors to interact with the audience via audio, video, text, and the giving/taking of items from a ship’s inventory.</li>
  <li>The Attendee App, a React/Redux webapp where attendees view the show and interact with the actors and each other via audio, video and text.</li>
  <li>The Host App, used by me to perform the motion-captured ending scene.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I say that the Show Service “keeps track of the overall state of the show”, I mean <em>all</em> of the state. Most of the Redux actions (across all 3 apps) don’t mutate the state of the reducers, but instead hit an endpoint on the Show Service that changes the state kept in the database, then fetches <em>all</em> of the state from the database and sends it to <em>all</em> of the users as a WebSocket message which then overwrites most of the reducers’ state. This way, no client can end up with “orphan state” as a result of optimistically updating their reducer before their API call returns, and fetching the updated state for <em>all</em> users can be done with a single database call (this refresh-all-state-for-everyone method is debounced and implements a queueing mechanism to ensure we don’t have too many database calls at once).</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/redux-oops.jpg">
<strong>I basically took Dan Abramov’s simple and elegant system and did this to it. <br> Sorry Dan.</strong></p>

<p>(I’d note that this architecture emerged sort of organicly and there are probably cleaner or more optimal ways of achieving this “Redux-but-the-server-is-the-reducer” architecture. I’m open to feedback on whether something like Relay or Meteor would be a better fit for a V2)</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/admin-show-online.png"></p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/actor-screen.png">
<strong>The Admin app allows us to see who’s logged on and what’s happening in the show</strong></p>

<p>Of the 3 React/Redux apps, the Admin App uses the least of these shiny web technologies, and is pretty much just a dashboard for displaying what’s in the database. As admins, we can see which actors and attendees have logged on, which ships are currently visiting which actors, we can move attendees between ships if need be, and we can see a list of errors the actors and attendees have encountered (more on this later).</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/actor-app-normal.png">
<strong>The actor app allows performers to engage with the audience and view information about the ship they’re talking to</strong></p>

<p>The Actor App is more sophisticated, since it needs to handle WebRTC and media device concerns. It also has 3 modes: Normal, Mobile (used automatically if the window has a dimension less than 500px) and Headless (used if the querystring variable <code>headless</code> is set to <code>true</code>. The Normal mode is used by about half of the actors, and has the ability for them to see themselves, configure their audio/video devices, change any info about their user, character or planet, and view information about the ships they’re talking to (their chat, inventory, history of previous places, etc.).</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/actor-app-mobile.jpg">
<img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/actor-app-headless.png">
<strong>The mobile and headless modes of the actor app give our actors flexibility to use whatever devices they have available</strong></p>

<p>The Mobile mode uses a tab-based layout to try and accomplish all the same goals, but since only one tab can be on the screen at a time, it’s a bit of a pain to use on its own. We’ve got Headless mode, which doesn’t do any of the audio/video streaming, but shows all the information about the current ship and can run on any laptop. Many actors have opted for using the Mobile mode (since their phone has a good camera) but keeping Headless mode open on an old laptop to make it easier to use the other features.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/ship-in-flight.png">
<strong>A group of attendees interacting with a character in the show</strong></p>

<p>The Attendee app is about as complex as the actor app, but doesn’t have a Headless mode (which is really just a power-user feature for actors). This app has multiple screens corresponding to the different phases of the show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preshow - A lobby screen where attendees can meet the shipmates they’ll be flying with</li>
  <li>Intro - A tutorial video</li>
  <li>Freeplay - The bulk of the show, where attendees alternate between interacting with characters and choosing their next destination from the Navigation Screen</li>
  <li>Ending - A livestreamed 3D ending scene</li>
  <li>Ended - This just redirects attendees out of the app to <a href="https://shatteredspace.live/program.html" target="_blank">a static page with our casts’ bios</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/host-app.jpg">
<strong>My setup for performing the motion capture at the end of the show</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the show, I perform a scene as Colonel Panic, the AI commander of the Star Jockeys. In this scene I go around to each ship and review the items they’ve managed to collect. Then a “resolution” happens that I won’t spoil here.</p>

<p>This performance is rendered on my desktop PC (Intel 8700K + RTX 2080TI) with a special version of the Actor app that I’ve built just for this purpose. The three.js scene here involves at least 7 huge models with MeshPhysicalMaterials and a dozen moving PointLights, so rather than rendering on attendees’ computers, I render it on mine and stream it to them using an <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/cam-link-4k" target="_blank">Elgato Camlink 4K</a>, ffmpeg and the Janus (explained below) <a href="https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/docs/streaming.html" target="_blank">Streaming plugin</a>.</p>

<p>The motion capture work is done by taking a modified version of Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/tracking_and_visualizing_faces" target="_blank">TrackingAndVisualizingFaces</a> example from the ARKit docs and having it send each frame of mocap data over WebSockets to the server, which then forwards them to the Host app. It’s amazing that this works with sub-100ms latency, but it does.</p>

<p>I’m planning on open-sourcing all of this when the show is done, but I’d want to purge the git history in case there are any secrets lying around, and I’d warn any interested spelunkers that it will be more of an …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The top 3 question we receive from students are:</p><ul><li>How can I build a career in aerodynamics?</li><li>Do you have an open position at AirShaper / know of another company with open positions?</li><li>Can you support our Formula Student team?</li></ul><p>In this blog we'll zoom in on the first &amp; second question:
👣Which steps do you need to take to lang a job in the fascinating world of aerodynamics!</p><h2>Education 🎒</h2><p>Yes, this is important: if you're applying for a job, your education matters. Most (mechanical) engineering bachelor or master tracks will include at least an introduction to fluid mechanics, as it's crucial to many engineering problems (damper design, hydrodynamics, HVAC - heating, ventilation and air conditioning, ...). Or, you can follow a master really dedicated to the field of fluid dynamics, often with a choice between experimental (real-life testing) and/or computational (computer simulations). Of course, the choice of the institute is important: some, like the TUDelft in the Netherlands, have a superb reputation and that will help you shine on your CV. Finishing such a master is of course fantastic, but still, you will not be entirely unique (unless you were the only student to follow that course, in which case you may want to question the course itself 😎).</p><p><img alt="alt text" title="Courses on Aerodynamics at the TUDelft, Netherlands" src="https://airshaper.com/assets/images/tudelft.png"></p><p>There is something else which is, at least in my opinion, equally important:
self-study.
Companies will appreciate &amp; sometimes even demand the skills &amp; knowledge you gained through your studies, but they will in many cases look for something extra, something that sets you apart.
If you can talk at length about the go-kart you pimped aerodynamically in your backyard, or how you spent long evenings programming your own CFD (computational fluid dynamics) code, this can really set you apart.</p><h2>Exposure 🗣</h2><p>You can have plenty of skills, but you'll have to make them known to the world. Applying for open positions is an obvious way of doing so. But you could also build a network, even before you graduate, in the aerodynamics scene: write a blog, write stoties on Linkedin, post aero stuff on Twitter, ... let the world know you have a burning passion for aerodynamics.</p><p>It's not a straight path to success, and it's difficult to gauge the "return on investment", but you may be surprised by how you can sometimes end up talking to interesting people. And don't let anything hold you back: even if the people you want to talk to are senior people at respectable companies, just give it a try: add them on Linkedin, send them that interesting paper you did on your go-kart.</p><p><img alt="alt text" title="Willem Toet - Sauber" src="https://airshaper.com/assets/images/willem_toet.png"></p><p>Last but not least, don't underestimate the physical world:
Motorsport fairs for example (like the ones in Birmingham or Cologne) are a great place to find &amp; meet very interesting people. I've had multiple encounters with Willem Toet, for example. He's a legend in terms of aerodynamics, has worked at Sauber for years, but is one of the most charming &amp; accessible people in the entire racing scene. He &amp; others like him often give interesting (free) talks at such events. After the talk? Just walk up there and tell an interesting story that sticks! As to date, there is no app that will replace the quality of a face-to-face meeting 😇</p><h2>Dedicated channels⚡</h2><p>The first person ever to start working at AirShaper came to us via a job we had placed on <a href="https://www.cfd-online.com/Jobs/" target="_blank">CFD Online</a>, a specialist forum dedicated to computational fluid dynamics. In a similar way, but then dedicated to aerodynamics rather than CFD, we've created the <a href="https://www.airshaper.com/jobs/landing" target="_blank">AirShaper Job Board</a>. On this free &amp; open platform, people can create a profile to be discovered and companies can post vacancies.</p><h2>Indirect paths 🏎</h2><p>If you're dreaming of a job in Formula 1, don't over-focus on it.</p><p>First of all, being responsible for the aerodynamics of an entire car at a small company might be more rewarding than working on barge board number 3 on a Formula One car.</p><p>Second of all, an indirect path might actually be the more efficient &amp; interesting one. Even if you start out working on drones, you may still end up at a race team later on. They might even value your expertise from a different sector.</p><p>Just stay open to interesting things that cross your path, instead of focusing solely on that ultimate goal. For all you know, you may discover another domain you find even more interesting!</p><h2>Perspective 📷</h2><p>A cheesy one, but don't forget to live :)
Working on something you're passionate about is great, but please do balance work with other interesting things to do - it'll feed your creativy and keep you fresh!</p><h2>Conclusion 💡</h2><p>Besides proper education, applying your passion to private projects and talking about it to people around you and people in aerodynamics scene can really make a difference. Go beyond the text books that others have read as well and play around, experiment and enjoy aerodynamics - by doing so, you'll come across interesting people &amp; opportunities in life!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The finance world is quickly entering the mainstream —</p><p>Every month a notable company goes public. Every week a hot startup raises millions of dollars. And every day moms, pops, and teens check on their stocks. </p><p>Whether a company builds rocket engines or mobile apps, they tell their story using the same language —&nbsp;financial statements. Here's how they work.</p><p>Let's say you run a subscription t-shirt business.</p><p>It's going well — you have happy customers and healthy profit. You're thinking of buying your own factory to make more t-shirts, more quickly, and more cheaply.</p><p>There's just one problem — you can't afford a factory.</p><p>So, you ask the bank for a loan. Your company is profitable and the factory will pay for itself in 3 years, so you know you'll be able to pay it back. But while you know this, the bank doesn't — you'll need to convince them. The bank, however, doesn't know anything about the subscription clothing business.</p><p>To get on the same page, you need a shared language for talking about your business.</p><p><h4 id="heading-1">Double-entry Bookkeeping: The birth of accounting</h4></p><p>Double-entry bookkeeping was the first formalism in finance. The Middle East had it in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40697986" target="_blank">first century AD</a>, Korea independently got it in the <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/issn/1598-2661" target="_blank">11th century</a>, and by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627232023/http://130.74.92.202:82/record=b1000778" target="_blank">1500s</a>, it had been well-documented across Europe.</p><p>It's a simple concept designed to reduce errors when documenting transactions: every entry to an "account" requires an equal and opposite entry to another "account".</p><p>If you bought some cotton to turn into t-shirts, you might record the transaction like this:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-371c827e421c-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde0379b53032713cde77_bookkeeping.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>When you spend $100 on cotton, your "Cash" account gets debited (loses) $100, and your "Materials" account gets credited (gains) $100. The underlying principle is that <em>you can't create something out of nothing</em>.</p><p>This might seem contrived, but with more and more transactions, it can help you spot errors. Since every entry has an equal and opposite entry, the sum of all the debits should always equal the sum of all the credits. If not, you know you made a mistake, and you can look back through your transactions to find it.</p><p>A list of transactions is pretty interesting — it tells a very detailed story about what your company's been up to. Certainly enough to answer the bank's questions when you ask for loan.</p><p>But just as the bank doesn't have time to learn about subscription t-shirts businesses, they don't have time to go through thousands of transactions. To understand what's going on, they need a shorter summary.</p><p><h4 id="heading-2">Financial Statement #1: The Balance Sheet</h4></p><p>If you went through all your transactions and worked out the net value of each account, you'd be able to see things like</p><ul role="list"><li>How much cash you have in the bank</li><li>The total value of the cotton in your inventory</li><li>How much money you owe to your cotton suppliers</li></ul><p>This will give you a snapshot of the current state of your company, split up into "everything you own" (<strong>Assets</strong>) and "everything you owe" (<strong>Liabilities</strong>) — a <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>. These generally won't be equal — ideally your assets will be worth more than your liabilities.</p><p>The difference between the assets and the liabilities is what you, the owner of the company, can rightfully stake a claim to. Crudely, if you sold all your assets today and used that money to pay off all your debts, you'd be left with a pile of cash all to yourself.</p><p>This idea is usually expressed by the "accounting equation":</p><p><strong>Assets - Liabilities = Shareholders Equity</strong></p><p>This is where the "balance" comes in: both sides of the equation are equal. Note that this equation is actually a definition — it asserts that the value of the <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> is the difference between <strong>Assets</strong> and <strong>Liabilities</strong>. This is the same equation that underpins double-entry bookkeeping.</p><p>Here's what your balance sheet might look like:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-89b5b437bd58-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde1a11602b68a068a079_balance-sheet.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The bank will be interested in seeing this before giving you a loan. It's a quick 'n' dirty way for them to understand the big picture:</p><ul role="list"><li>The orders of magnitude involved — does this company operate in the thousands, millions, or billions?</li><li>An estimate for how much the company is "worth", based on the shareholders equity</li><li>An indication of company health — is the company drowning in debt?</li></ul><p>Financiers often calculate metrics based on the balance sheet, to further summarise the information and to compare numbers across companies.</p><p>The <strong>Debt/Equity Ratio</strong> is a big one, telling you how much a company relies on borrowing money. If it's too high then the company might be too dependent on loans, but if it's too low, this might indicate an inefficiency, since borrowing money to spend on growth can be quicker than earning it the hard way.</p><p>So — the balance sheet summarises a lot about your company, in a way that the bank can understand.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't answer a crucial question — "Do you make money?"</p><p><h4 id="heading-3">Financial Statement #2: The Income Statement (P&amp;L)</h4></p><p>The balance sheet is a snapshot of a single point in time. To understand whether a company makes money, you need see how things change over a period of time (e.g. every month).</p><p>The first thing you need to know is how much money you receive — your <strong>Revenue</strong>.

So even with 12 months' payment upfront, you only recognise 1/12th of that payment as revenue each month. The remaining 11/12th becomes <strong>Deferred Revenue.</strong> This is actually a liability on your balance sheet — your customers have essentially given you a loan which you must pay back each month, in the form of t-shirts.</p><p>The same principle applies for bulk orders — you recognise the revenue when you deliver the product, <em>not</em> when you get paid.</p><p>This is called <strong>Accrual Accounting</strong>, and it more accurately answers the question "Do you make money?".</p><p>So — you've got a balance sheet, showing your current financial state, and you've got a P&amp;L, showing how things change over time.

<h4 id="a-primer-on-the-cruel-tacit-laws-of-type-level-programming-in-haskell"><em>A primer on the cruel, tacit laws of type-level programming in Haskell</em></h4>

<p>Haskell programs are constructed at the junction of two worlds: one of types, and the other of values. Values are operational run-time entities that are denoted syntactically by <em>terms</em> in the code. To this end, types classify terms. They provide a powerful abstraction to organize data, determine how it should be stored in memory, passed through various operations, and more. On a superficial level, the difference between these worlds is simple: <em>types</em> refer to datatypes, which are either built-in (such as <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code>), or user-declared, for example:</p>

<pre><code>data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
</code></pre>

<p>By comparison, <em>values</em> are denoted by <em>terms</em> those types categorize (such as <code>1</code> and <code>"abc"</code> described by the standard library’s <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code> types, or <code>Cady</code> and <code>Regina</code> in the case of our user-declared type, <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>). Thus, the term <code>1</code> denotes a value that exists in memory only when the program is run.</p>

<p>In addition to these two worlds, a third, darker, and more elusive underworld of <em>kinds</em> also lurks in the shadows of Haskell programs. Haskell kinds can be as unpredictable and insidious as the soulless alpha-female of an elite high school clique. While daunting, understanding the coaction between these three worlds lays the foundation for type-level programming, a topic worth learning as it strengthens overall Haskell intuition.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/81239044-afe24580-8fd1-11ea-96b0-274cf839e834.png" alt="the haskell type system: a machine of constant, unforgiving judgement and rigid classification"></p>

<h3 id="kindness-is-a-virtue">Kindness is a virtue</h3>

<p>Much like counter-intuitive adolescent social dynamics, mastery of Haskell bears a steep learning curve because of its underlying complexity. It is difficult to wrap one’s head around the language’s typeclass hierarchies, category-theoretic roots, or the intricacies of compiler behavior. However, an intimate understanding of the type system lets programmers look beyond the chaos of code and apply a recognizable template by which to understand it.</p>

<h3 id="kindness-takes-patience">Kindness takes patience</h3>

<p>This topic is also difficult to master because it is both vast and subtle. Ideas underlying type-level programming are scattered across many disconnected resources focused on several corners of the Haskell ecosystem. Authoritative references on the topic (such as relevant library documentation) tend to assume familiarity with domain-specific terminology that may be unknown to non-experts. Due to the paucity of approachable materials on the subject, I’ve attempted to break down type-level programming into explanations of its constituent parts. While I don’t go into extensive depth on any individual section below, I hope to provide a valuable starting point with which readers can explore ideas in greater detail.</p>

<h3 id="types-vs-values">Types vs. Values</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, Haskell programs are divided into two worlds: the <em>type-level</em> and the <em>value-level</em>. The <em>type-level</em> refers to the part of a program analyzed by the static type-checking phase during compilation. Since every expression is assigned a type, code is checked against Haskell’s type system to ensure it fits <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>’s specified correctness criteria.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704534-fce9fd80-af27-11ea-9544-13961a56c444.png" alt="types classify terms, just like hostile teens with identity crises classify one another"></p>

<p>If the program is well-typed, the program will compile. However, this type-information evaporates once the compilation process terminates, leaving only <em>values</em> behind at run-time. In this way, types and values can be better distinguished by the phasing distinction, with types being compile-time entities and values being run-time entities.</p>

<p>For example, if a function takes a <code>String</code>, the type-checker doesn’t care if the <code>String</code> has a value denoted by <code>"abc"</code> or <code>"123"</code> or <code>"get in loser"</code>—so long as it’s a <code>String</code>. Type information gets discarded at run-time, leaving only the string’s value (ex.,<code>"get in loser"</code>). In some cases, however, we want the type system to care about what those values are and distinguish between them. The <code>DataKinds</code> extension, which we’ll explore below, lets us do that by allowing us to shove more information about our program into the type system. This lets us add meaning to the value of a <code>String</code> at the type-level, moving them from their usual, strictly run-time existence, into the compile-time phase. The technique allows us to use more information statically in the logical development and abstraction of the program’s behavior. We’re also able to add consequences that can halt compilation if the specific value of <code>String</code> doesn’t conform to the rules we’ve specified, or define classes over them.</p>

<h4 id="distinguishing-types-and-values-in-ghci">Distinguishing types and values in GHCi</h4>

<p>Let’s examine our aforementioned <code>SpringFlingQueen</code> datatype in GHCi. When we query the type of one of its constructors using <code>:t</code> (a handy shorthand for <code>:type</code>), we see that it is indeed of type <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
λ :t Cady
Cady :: SpringFlingQueen
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now consider literals <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>. These are <em>values</em> of a type that parameterizes the <code>Num</code> class:</p>



<p>Typing <code>:t 1</code> into GHCi gives us <code>Num p =&gt; p</code>, indicating that a literal such as <code>1</code> can be of any polymorphic type <code>p</code> as long as the <code>Num</code> type class has instances for that type (for example, <code>Integer</code> and <code>Float</code> both have <code>Num</code> instances and therefore are valid types that <code>p</code> could be instantiated with). This is possible due to <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Type_inference">type inference</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704346-ae3c6380-af27-11ea-8078-6f1ddfc7b238.png" alt="type inference can be used to deduce concrete types wherever they're obvious. If a type looks like a mouse, it's a mouse—duh!"></p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>Just like types classify terms, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.1.1">kinds</a> classify types, and therefore are frequently described as “types of types”, or referred to be “one level up.” The “star” syntax (i.e., <code>*</code>) denotes kinds. It is defiantly used in this post despite <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0143-remove-star-kind.rst">recent syntactic changes</a>. A prerequisite for understanding the kind system necessitates comprehending the differences between three pairs of ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data constructors vs. type constructors:</strong> data constructors create values, whereas type constructors create types. Type constructors take one or more type arguments and produce a datatype when enough arguments are provided. This means that through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Currying">currying</a>, a type constructor can be <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially applied</a>. For example, the list type constructor <code>[]</code> may take a single type argument (ex. <code>String</code>) to denote the elements of the list (i.e., <code>[String]</code>). <code>[String]</code> is simply syntactic sugar for <code>[] String</code>, where the type <code>[]</code> is applied to <code>String</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Full vs. partial application</strong> A partially-applied type, like a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially-applied function</a>, is one that is missing some of its data constructors. For instance, consider the list type <code>[]</code>. The kind of <code>[]</code> is <code>* -&gt; *</code>. A fully-applied list has data constructors, such as <code>[Int]</code>, and its kind is <code>*</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inhabited types vs. uninhabited types:</strong> An inhabitant of a type is precisely a value of that type. This means that <em>inhabited</em> types refer to the types that contain concrete values, such as the value denoted by the term <code>1 :: Int</code>. This suggests that the type <code>Int</code> is inhabited by value denoted by <code>1</code>. By contrast, <em>uninhabited</em> types refer to type constructors to which no values are abstracted. For instance, <code>Void</code> is uninhabited because it has no data constructors, and thus can not be used to construct a valid term. While <code>Void</code> may seem pointless at first, it can be a useful way to represent that a container is empty (ex., <code>[Void]</code>, which <em>is</em> inhabited by the term <code>[]</code> and the value this term denotes).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How do these ideas relate to the kind system? Well, all fully-applied runtime values are of kind <code>*</code> <em>and</em> they are inhabited. You can confirm this by typing <code>:k Int</code> and <code>:k String</code> in GHCi. However, this doesn’t work the other way around—just because a type is inhabited, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s fully-applied (ex., <code>[]</code> is not fully-applied but it <em>is</em> inhabited, and its kind signature is <code>* -&gt; *</code>). Conversely, all partially-applied types are uninhabited (since they don’t correspond to a value), but not all uninhabited types are partially applied. <code>Void</code> for instance is not partially-applied, but it is uninhabited.</p>

<p>To get the hang of this idea, consider the following examples:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Inhabited?</th>
      <th>Fully-applied?</th>
      <th>Kind</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Int</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>String</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[Int]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(,)</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Void</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either Void Void</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Kind signatures can be specified manually in GHCi using the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XKindSignatures"><code>XKindSignatures</code></a> extension. Try extending the above table by investigating the kind signatures of various types.</p>

<h3 id="higher-kinded-types">Higher-kinded types</h3>

<p>Just like there are higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), there are higher-kinded types (types constructors that take other type constructors as arguments). Type constructors such as <code>[]</code> are a first-class type, but also a higher-kinded type, given they take another type constructor to be reified:</p>



<p>Let’s consider <code>Functor</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :k Functor
Functor :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; Constraint
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> takes a type constructor <code>* -&gt; *</code> and returns a <code>Constraint</code>. Let’s use <code>:info</code> to examine <code>Functor</code> a bit more closely:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :info Functor
class Functor (f :: * -&gt; *) where
  fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
  (&lt;$) :: a -&gt; f b -&gt; f a
  {-# MINIMAL fmap #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor (Either a) -- Defined in ‘Data.Either’
instance Functor ((,,,) a b c) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor ((,,) a b) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor [] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor Maybe -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor IO -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((-&gt;) r) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> allows type constructors like <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> to have <code>Functor</code> instances, but not <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. This is because <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> are <code>* -&gt; *</code>, while <code>Int</code> has kind <code>*</code>. Similarly, <code>Either</code> has <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>, which is why its instance above is parameterized with a type parameter denoting something of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code>: <code>Either a</code>.</p>

<p><b>Creating Your Own Embedded Dynamic Web Site. Linux, Busybox, Httpd and Sqlite</b></p><p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Embedded Linux usually offers limited capabilities for web application programming. Disk space, available memory, processing speed put certain restrictions that may not allow installing and running de-facto standard LAMP bundle (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl).</p>
<p>At the same time by default any embedded Linux distribution contains software suitable for web programming. The first thing that comes to mind is Busybox.</p>
<p>Busybox is a single executable combining many standard Unix tools, much like the larger (but more capable) GNU Core Utilities. Busybox incorporates minimalist replacements of a variety of Unix utilities into a small single binary file, which makes it ideal for special purpose distributions and embedded devices. It is sometimes called "The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux".</p>
<p>Although Busybox is highly customizable and may contain more than 200 common Unix utilities, the most important for embedded web development among them are:</p>
<p>
(a) ash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Bourne compatible shell used in resource-constrained environments<br>
(b) httpd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a simple, lightweight http server<br>
(c) awk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an awk programming language interpreter<br>
(d) sed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a standard Unix utility for text transformation<br>
</p>

<p>These four Busybox applets combined can provide enough flexibility for creation of dynamic web site powered with CGI ash scripts.</p>
<p><b>Starting and Configuring Httpd</b></p>
<p>The full syntax of httpd server commands is available at Busybox web site. Here we will show some of its options omitting others:</p>

<p>
[busybox] httpd [-c conffile] [-p [ip:]port] [-u user[:grp]] [-r realm] [-h home]<br>
[busybox] httpd [-m pass]<br>
[busybox] httpd [-d/-e string]<br>
</p>

<p>
-c conffile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;configuration file to read. By default it is /etc/httpd.conf, although the server can start without any configuration file at all.<br>
-p [ip:]port&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;allows binding to another port. By default the port is 80.<br>
-u user[:grp]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;sets server's UID[/GID].<br>
-r realm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;sets authentication realm (a string appearing at web browser login/password prompt).<br>
-h home&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;home directory.<br>
-m pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;encrypts the pass string with MD5 algorithm.<br>
-d/-e string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;respectively decode URL string and encodes HTML string<br>
</p>


<p>For example the following command will start httpd server listening on 8080 port, with configured options and having nobody's privileges:</p>

<p>
busybox httpd -c /etc/httpd.conf -p 8080 -u nobody -r "Protected Area" -h /home/www
</p>

<p>A sample configuration file with detailed comments is available at Busybox website. It is relatively simple and easy to understand. To encrypt users' passwords one may use the following command that will append respective string to the configuration file:</p>

<p>
echo /directory/path:username:`Busybox httpd -m userpassword` &gt;&gt; /etc/httpd.conf
</p>

<p><b>Writing a Simple Calendar Script</b></p>
<p>Any URL starting by /cgi-bin/ is assumed to be a CGI script. Needless to say that in order to run properly scripts must have executable bit set. The server passes scripts to ash shell for execution after setting environment variables. All form's variables and their values are put into QUERY_STRING.</p>
<p>For demonstration purpose we will write a script that shows a month's calendar based on arguments submitted. A piece of html code for a form that posts the data to our script is shown below:</p>

<p>
&lt;form method="post" action="./cgi-bin/calendar.cgi"&gt;<br>
Enter MM/YYYY&lt;br&gt;<br>
&lt;input type="text" name="m" value="" style="width: 24px"&gt;<br>
&lt;input type="text" name="y" value="" style="width: 40px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br>
</p>

<p>Our calendar script has four distinctive parts (see below): html header code; query string processing; printing of calendar information; and closing html tags. The html code is primarily generated by awk.</p>

<div><p>
#!/bin/ash</p><p>
echo -e "Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n"<br>
echo "&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Calendar script&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;"</p><p>
read QUERY_STRING<br>
eval $(echo $QUERY_STRING|sed 's/&amp;/ /g')</p><p>
for i in $(echo $QUERY_STRING|awk -F'&amp;' '{for(;i++&lt;NF;) print $i}'|cut -d= -f1)<br>
do<br>
<span>eval $i='`busybox httpd -d $'$i'`' 2&gt;/dev/null<br></span>
done</p><p>
echo "&lt;table&gt;"<br>
busybox cal $m $y|<br>
awk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'{<br>
<span>if(NR&gt;1)<br></span>
<span>{<br></span>
<span>print "&lt;tr align=right&gt;"<br></span>
<span>for(i=1; i &lt; 21; i+=3) print "&lt;td&gt;" substr($0, i, 2) "&lt;/td&gt;"<br></span>
<span>print "&lt;/tr&gt;"<br></span>
<span>}<br></span>
<span>else print "&lt;tr align=center&gt;&lt;td colspan=7&gt;" $0 "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"<br></span>
<span>}'<br></span>
echo "&lt;/table&gt;"</p><p>
echo "&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"</p><p>
exit 0</p></div>

<p>Versions of Unix calendar utility (cal, gcal or ncal) have slightly different output format and may contain or omit leading and/or trailing empty strings or spaces. As a result it is recommended to check the difference and amend the code accordingly.</p>
<p>Obviously we can make query string processing code reusable by putting it into a separate resource file loadable at every execution of a script. For this purpose we create the following .httpd.rc file and place it into our CGI directory. One can also put there functions printing opening and closing html tags.</p>

<div><p>
header ()<br>
{<br>
echo -e "Content-type: text/html; charset=$1\n"<br>
echo "&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;$2&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;"<br>
}</p><p>
cgi ()<br>
{<br>
read QUERY_STRING<br>
eval $(echo $QUERY_STRING|sed 's/&amp;/ /g')<br>
for i in $(echo $QUERY_STRING|awk -F'&amp;' '{for(;i++</p><nf;) print="" $i}'|cut="" -d="-f1)<br">
do<br>
<span>eval $i='`busybox httpd -d $'$i'`' 2&gt;/dev/null<br></span>
done<br>
}<p>
end () { echo "&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"; }</p></nf;)></div>

<p>As a result our calendar script looks much more concise now:</p>

<div><p>
#!/bin/ash</p><p>
. ./.httpd.rc 2&gt;/dev/null || exit 1</p><p>
header UTF-8 "Calendar script"<br>
cgi</p><p>
echo "&lt;table&gt;"<br>
busybox cal $m $y|<br>
awk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'{<br>
<span>if(NR&gt;1)<br></span>
<span>{<br></span>
<span>print "&lt;tr align=right&gt;"<br></span>
<span>for(i=1; i &lt; 21; i+=3) print "&lt;td&gt;" substr($0, i, 2) "&lt;/td&gt;"<br></span>
<span>print "&lt;/tr&gt;"<br></span>
<span>}<br></span>
<span>else print "&lt;tr align=center&gt;&lt;td colspan=7&gt;" $0 "&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"<br></span>
<span>}'<br></span>
echo "&lt;/table&gt;"</p><p>
end</p><p>
exit 0</p></div>

<p><b>SQLite Web Interface</b></p>

<p>Due to its small footprint, extensive SQL syntax support and high speed, SQLite is a good choice for an embedded web site database.</p>
<p>SQLite can be compiled as a command-line executable utility to access and modify its databases. This utility reads lines of input from Linux shell and passes them on to the SQLite library for execution. To demonstrate how to access the data, we create a sample SQLite database ./emp.db with a single table containing the list of a company's employees and their respective salaries:</p>

<p>
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (name TEXT, salary INT);<br>
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('JANE DOE', 8500);<br>
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('JOHN DOE', 3500);<br>
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('RICHARD ROE', 2500);<br>
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('JOHN SMITH', 10500);<br>
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('WALTER JOHNSON', 10500);<br>
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('ANNE SMITH', 7500);<br>
</p>

<p>In our case we create a simple form containing two radio buttons allowing selection of (a) all employees or (b) just top 3 salaried ones (see below):</p>

<p>
&lt;form method="post" action="./cgi-bin/sqlite.cgi"&gt;<br>
&lt;input type="radio" name="limit" value="-1"&gt; All&lt;br&gt;<br>
&lt;input type="radio" name="limit" value="3"&gt; Top 3 only&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>
&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br>
</p>

<p>It is also possible to modify SQL query output format. A special dot-command .mode html passed to SQLite utility will make SQL query output html table coded data, a very useful feature especially for web applications.</p>
<p>The below script shows the table listing of employees (either all or top 3 salaried ones, depending on the form values submitted) and their average salary in the final row.</p>

<div><p>
#!/bin/ash</p><p>
. ./.httpd.rc 2&gt;/dev/null || exit 1</p><p>
header UTF-8 "Database script"<br>
cgi</p><p>
echo "&lt;table&gt;"<br>
echo "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Salary&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"<br>
echo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;".mode html<br>
<span>select * from employees order by salary desc limit $limit;<br></span>
<span>select \"Average salary:\", avg(salary) from employees;" | sqlite3 ./emp.db<br></span>
echo "&lt;/table&gt;"</p><p>
end</p><p>
exit 0</p></div>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Despite the fact that Busybox applets do not provide functionality comparable to that of Perl or PHP scripting and Apache or MySQL engines, users may find them suitable for special purpose projects that do not require high level of sophistication or heavy workload. This article was an attempt to show how one can use capabilities provided by Busybox and SQLite to build a minimalist interactive web service equipped with a database engine.</p>

But there are two moons many astronomers believe are even better&nbsp;bets: Saturn's moon Enceladus and Jupiter's moon Europa.</p>  <p>Now&nbsp;a new computer model by NASA scientists lends further support to the theory that, beneath the thick, icy crust of Europa, the Jovian moon's interior ocean could be habitable.</p>  <p>Europa is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system, smaller than the Earth's moon but larger than Pluto.</p>  <p>The scientists believe the moon's ocean may have formed after water-rich minerals released their water due to heating caused by the radioactive decay of&nbsp;the satellite's&nbsp;core. Due to its gravitational interactions with gas giant Jupiter&nbsp;and with other moons, the water is kept warm.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But not all water means life. Other important building blocks are needed, and&nbsp;researchers believe that was the case.</p>  <h2>'This ocean could be quite habitable'</h2>  <p>Billions of years ago, the ocean would have been mildly acidic, but with concentrations of carbon dioxide, calcium and sulfate too high for life as we know it.</p>  <p>"Our simulations, <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/6/eaaw7123" target="_blank">coupled with data from the Hubble Space Telescope</a>, showing chloride on Europa's surface, suggests that the water most likely became chloride-rich," said Mohit Melwani Daswani, a geochemist and planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who presented the recent findings at the virtual Goldschmidt conference this week.</p>  <p>"In other words, its composition became more like oceans on Earth. We believe that this ocean [now] could be quite habitable for life."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5626966.1593104515!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/hubble-spots-possible-venting-activity-on-europa.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5626966.1593104515!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/hubble-spots-possible-venting-activity-on-europa.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5626966.1593104515!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/hubble-spots-possible-venting-activity-on-europa.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5626966.1593104515!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/hubble-spots-possible-venting-activity-on-europa.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5626966.1593104515!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/hubble-spots-possible-venting-activity-on-europa.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5626966.1593104515!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/hubble-spots-possible-venting-activity-on-europa.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Observations of Europa by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope uncovered a probable plume of material erupting from the moon's surface at the same location where a similar plume was seen two years earlier by Hubble. Astronomers believe that this is more evidence of liquid water below its icy surface.<!-- --> <!-- -->(NASA/ESA)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Water and minerals aren't the only thing needed for life. Life needs energy.</p>  <p>"It's unlikely that any possible life forms in Europa's ocean would use sunlight as a source of energy, because Europa is really quite far from the sun, and the ocean would be under complete darkness beneath a really thick ice shell," Melwani Daswani said. "So we have to think about other sources of energy."</p>  <p>On Earth, life exists around hydrothermal vents, openings on the ocean floor that emit dissolved minerals, and there has been strong evidence that these may exist in Europa's subglacial ocean as well. That could be used as a source of energy for any potential life.</p>  <p>Melwani Daswani is cautious.</p>  <p>"We don't even know whether life as we know it would be happy over there or whether the energy available for that for life would be sufficient," he added.</p>  <h2>Mission to Europa</h2>  <p>Gordon Osinski, a professor in the department of Earth sciences at Western University in London, Ont., who was not involved in the study, said that this new research is another reason that missions to moons like Europa or Enceladus&nbsp;are&nbsp;so intriguing.</p>  <p>"I think the key take-home here is that these ocean worlds present the best likelihood for present-day habitable environments," he said. "So, life living on those planets at the present day. All the key ingredients are there."</p>    <p>NASA does have a mission in the works to visit the moon: the <a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/" target="_blank"><u>Europa Clipper</u></a>.</p>  <p>The mission — the first dedicated mission to a moon other than our own — won't be looking for signs of life, since it will only orbit, but it will look for increasing evidence of potential&nbsp;habitability by studying its geology, icy shell and composition.</p>  <p>Osinski said that it would be ideal for a future sample-return mission, where a spacecraft could even fly through and collect from plumes of water vapour that have&nbsp;been seen blown into space by both Europa and Enceladus through fissures in the ice.</p>  <p>"Because then we'll know," he said. "We'll have the unequivocal determination of whether there is life there or not."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>The previous post focused on JavaScript as the first library that we automated was our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/" target="_blank">generator</a>. It covered publishing to NPM and usage of the JavaScript community ecosystem. Now we have automation rolled out to all our libraries, Go-written too.</p>

<p>To automate a release efficiently, you need two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Machine-readable information that allows you to identify if a given commit should trigger a release or not.</li>
<li>Tooling that you can easily plug in and configure without the need to write everything from scratch.</li>
</ul>

<p>This automation is possible thanks to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/" target="_blank">Conventional Commits</a> specification. The purpose of Conventional Commits is to make commits machine-readable but also human-readable. It defines a set of commit prefixes that can be easily parsed and analyzed by tooling and looks good to the human eye too.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release" target="_blank">Semantic Release</a> package and related plugins that support Conventional Commits and publishing to different channels like GitHub, NPM, Slack, and others.</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog post is about the automation of releases for non-JavaScript projects. Let me be honest though, solutions I mentioned in the previous chapter come from the JavaScript community.</p>

<p>The problem is, there are people who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/9pwzpn/why_do_people_hate_javascript/" target="_blank">Hate JavaScript</a>, they truly <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-JavaScript-so-hated" target="_blank">hate it</a> like it is a living thing. Although, I’m personally proud to be an idiot that has a programming language that I can use.</p>

<p>Conventional Commits specification is heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format" target="_blank">Angular Commit Guidelines</a>. The Semantic Release package and its plugins ecosystem are all Node.js packages.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/10FHR5A4cXqVrO/giphy.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>If you have Java or Go project, you can still use these tools. You do not have to keep <code>package.json</code> in your repository, so don’t worry, you can keep your repository clean. The great folks from Semantic Release thought about you too.</p>

<p>One of the projects where we use this JavaScript tools is our parser for AsyncAPI documents. It is a <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-go" target="_blank">Go parser</a>.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-release-configuration">Semantic Release configuration<a href="#semantic-release-configuration" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>The Semantic Release package supports configuration files in different formats and file types. You are not bound to <code>package.json</code>. We chose to use <code>.releaserc</code> file in YAML format but there are <a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration-file" target="_blank">other options</a> too.</p>

<pre><code>---
branches:
- master
plugins:
- - "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
- - "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
- - "@semantic-release/github"
  - assets:
    - path: asyncapi-parser.darwin.amd64
      label: Binary - Darwin AMD64
    - path: asyncapi-parser.linux.amd64
      label: Binary - Linux AMD64
    - path: asyncapi-parser.windows.amd64.exe
      label: Binary - Windows AMD64
</code></pre>

<p>Our configuration uses plugins to:
- Analyze Git commits with Conventional Commits specification.
- Create a Git tag and generate changelog for release notes.
- Publish a release with additional assets. We compile our parser as binaries that are compatible with many platforms and we want to have them easily accessible with each release.</p>

<p>We place the configuration under <code>.github/workflows/</code>, next to our GitHub Action release workflow file: <code>release.yml</code>. It indicates that it is for release only, nothing else.</p>

<h3 id="release-workflow">Release workflow<a href="#release-workflow" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>Let us have a look at the differences between this workflow and the workflow I described for a typical JavaScript project <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/automated-releases/">here</a>.</p>

<p>First, you define a <code>test</code> job with the Go environment to trigger tests with different versions of Go.</p>

<pre><code>test:
  name: 'Testing'
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    matrix:
      go: 
        - '1.14'
        - '1.13'
        - '1.12' 
  steps:
    - name: Checkout repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
      with:
        go-version: '${{ matrix.go }}'
    - name: Invoking go test
      run: go test ./...
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is the <code>release</code> job, where you can differentiate two core steps. The first part is the generation of the binaries that you want to expose in the GitHub release.</p>

<pre><code>- name: Setup Go
  uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
  with:
    go-version: '1.14'
- name: Invoking go vet and binaries generation
  run: |
    go vet ./...
    GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.darwin.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.linux.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.windows.amd64.exe ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
</code></pre>

<p>So far, it is all Go-related operations. How about the release? For the release, you need to set up a Node.js environment to run Semantic Release. Node.js community has this excellent package, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx" target="_blank">npx</a>, that allows you to run a package without installing it, and this is what you can do here in the workflow.</p>

<pre><code>- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
  with:
    node-version: 13
- name: Add plugin for conventional commits
  run: npm install conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits
  working-directory: ./.github/workflows
- name: Release to GitHub
  working-directory: ./.github/workflows
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: asyncapi-bot
    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
    GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: asyncapi-bot
    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
  run: npx semantic-release
</code></pre>

<p>You only have to install <code>conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits</code> explicitly if you want to use <code>conventionalcommits</code> preset when analyzing Git commits and generating the changelog:</p>

<pre><code>plugins:
- - "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
- - "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
</code></pre>

<p>Take a look at full release workflow for reference:</p>

<pre><code>name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  test:
    name: 'Testing'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        go: 
          - '1.14'
          - '1.13'
          - '1.12' 
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
        with:
          go-version: '${{ matrix.go }}'
      - name: Invoking go test
        run: go test ./...
  
  release:
    name: 'Release to GitHub'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: 
      - test
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
        with:
          go-version: '1.14'
      - name: Invoking go vet and binaries generation
        run: |
          go vet ./...
          GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.darwin.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
          GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.linux.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
          GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.windows.amd64.exe ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 13
      - name: Add plugin for conventional commits
        run: npm install conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits
        working-directory: ./.github/workflows
      - name: Release to GitHub
        working-directory: ./.github/workflows
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: asyncapi-bot
          GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
          GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: asyncapi-bot
          GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
        run: npx semantic-release
</code></pre>

<p>You see, you can still have your project “clean” from any JavaScript-specific files and references. Everything you need for running your release with the JavaScript community tooling is only in the release-related configuration.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>I don’t think I can ever understand this “hate” towards JavaScript. I think, though, that you can “hate” the language, but if you see some amazing tooling built with it, that can increase your productivity, grit your teeth, put bias aside, and enjoy life. Especially, if in exchange you get this excellent feature, notification about release under the Issue and Pull Request:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/pr-indicator.webp" alt="pr info about release"></p>

<p>In case you want to have more explanation on the release automation subject, I recommend reading <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/automated-releases/">the first part of the automation story</a>. You can also <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite/" target="_blank">join our Slack</a> for further discussion.</p>

By using accessibility features in your app, you’re allowing your app to reach a wider audience.</p><p id="d948">Sticking with their commitment to accessibility, Apple has introduced several new features at WWDC20 which help developers make their apps easier and more entertaining for users with disabilities. By making apps more accessible, developers eliminate the need for users to purchase clunky, expensive devices in order to use their apps — everything they need to interact with the app is built right into the device.</p><p id="df0d">In this article, you’ll learn about some of the biggest and best upgrades to accessibility, announced at this year’s WWDC.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="ecb9">The first on the list is an interesting feature — which didn’t get talked about on stage. As the name suggests, Back Tap allows users to set single, double, or triple taps on the back of their iPhones and link them to certain tasks. For example, you could double tap on the back of your iPhone to open the weather app.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg?q=20" width="1200" height="732" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg" width="1200" height="732" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Setting up Back Tap on iOS 14.</figcaption></figure><p id="91c1">And since the tapping feature can be linked to Shortcuts, it opens up a whole range of possibilities with home automation and more! As seen in the example above, you could triple tap the back of your phone to quickly take notes, or you could use it to unlock your door when you’re about to enter the house. Easy, right?</p><p id="563c">For users with hearing impairments, Apple has added the ability to adjust sound frequencies on supported headphones. By doing this, users can now set their own preferences on what they want to hear more of and what they want to hear less of.</p><p id="dc81">The new feature also comes with pre-set profiles for specific outdoor situations, in case the user doesn’t want to manually configure the sound frequencies.</p><blockquote><p id="dba7">This new accessibility feature is designed to amplify soft sounds and adjust certain frequencies for an individual’s hearing, to help music, movies, phone calls, and podcasts sound more crisp and clear. Headphone Accommodations also supports Transparency mode on AirPods Pro, making quiet voices more audible and tuning the sounds of your environment to your hearing needs.</p><p id="8aab">— Apple Documentation</p></blockquote><p id="6a9f">Further, the new feature also supports Transparency Mode on AirPods Pro, which allows users to adjust how much of the surroundings they want to hear. If they want to amplify soft voices or listen to the environment in more detail, they now have that autonomy.</p><p id="d5d2">In the same vein, a new feature called <strong>Sound Recognition</strong> can pick up important sounds in the environment, such as Sirens, Fire Alarms, or Car Horns and alert the user of them. Through machine learning models built into the operating system, these sounds can be picked up and transmitted to the user in any way that they wish.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png?q=20" width="700" height="1110" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png" width="700" height="1110" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 500w" sizes="500px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Real-Time Text on the iPhone.</figcaption></figure><p id="2bf5">Group FaceTime calls have become more important than ever during the global pandemic, and Apple has added a small but important accessibility feature to them. Now, if a member of a group FaceTime call is using sign language to communicate, their video will be automatically pinned.</p><p id="ab6c">Using computer vision to detect this can be a boon to those with hearing loss, since reading sign language while the screen is moving around can be frustrating.</p><p id="43b4">In addition to this, Apple has made further improvements to its Real-Time Text feature, which is used for text based communication during phone calls. Previously, it was difficult for RTT users to multitask during phone calls, but it no longer requires the full screen.</p><p id="0458">When we think of accessibility on iOS, VoiceOver is often the first to come to mind. This year, VoiceOver received several significant updates, making it even more useful than before. If you aren’t familiar with it, VoiceOver is Apple’s screen reader, available on all platforms, including iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.</p><h2 id="ae54">VoiceOver Recognition</h2><p id="aa80">In the past, VoiceOver would require developers to adopt it inside their apps to work well on third-party apps.</p><blockquote><p id="210b">On-device intelligence recognizes key elements displayed on your screen to add VoiceOver support for app and web experiences that don’t have accessibility support built in. — Apple</p></blockquote><p id="2717">This year, Apple is tapping into their machine learning technology to semantically detect where and how to use VoiceOver on unsupported apps. This makes virtually all apps natively supported by VoiceOver and increases their accessibility for those with visual impairments.</p><h2 id="6119">Image Descriptions</h2><p id="6f0d">To make VoiceOver even more useful, Apple has used its computer vision library with <em>even more</em> machine learning to detect the contents of an image.</p><blockquote><p id="2f5f">VoiceOver reads complete-sentence descriptions of images and photos within apps and on the web. VoiceOver speaks the text it identifies within images and photos. — Apple</p></blockquote><p id="f5ed">Instead of simply stating that an image is present, VoiceOver can now provide detailed descriptions of what’s pictured in an image for more useful information to VoiceOver users. It can also detect text in an image through optical character recognition — another great way that machine learning is being used in the iOS 14 update!</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d6f7">Evidently, there have been plenty of great updates at WWDC20 in accessibility, with even more that weren’t listed here. By releasing a large number of small features, Apple has made their devices more accessible than ever. And, they’ve supercharged many of their flagship accessibility solutions by coupling machine learning technology with them.</p><p id="ab7f">Be sure to <strong>smash that “clap” button</strong> as many times as you can, <strong>share this tutorial</strong> on social media, and <strong>follow me on Twitter.</strong></p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="08a6"><em>Editor’s Note:</em><a href="http://heartbeat.fritz.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> </em><strong><em>Heartbeat</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>is a contributor-driven online publication and community dedicated to exploring the emerging intersection of mobile app development and machine learning.

Nearly two years in development, tonari is, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest-latency high resolution production-ready "teleconferencing" (we are truly not fond of that word) product available. </m></p><ul><li><b>130ms</b> glass-to-glass latency (the time from light hitting the camera to when it appears on-screen on the other side)</li><li><b>3K, 60fps</b> video transmission</li><li>High-bitrate 48kHz stereo audio</li></ul><p>Compare this to the typical <b>315-500ms</b> latency for Zoom and <m>WebRTC</m>, as measured between two laptops (X1 Carbon and MacBook Pro) on the same network at our office. It's a huge difference. It's the difference between constantly interrupting each other versus having a natural flow of conversation. It's the difference between a blurry face from a camera seemingly pointed up someone's nose versus a wide-view high fidelity image that smoothly transfers all the subtle body language of an in-person conversation.</p><div><picture><source srcset="https://blog.tonari.no/images/ea56c74d-a55d-4183-9a7b-d697954c5159-tonari-frontier-2.png.optimized.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://blog.tonari.no/images/ea56c74d-a55d-4183-9a7b-d697954c5159-tonari-frontier-2.png.optimized.jpg"><img src="https://blog.tonari.no/images/ea56c74d-a55d-4183-9a7b-d697954c5159-tonari-frontier-2.png.optimized.jpg"></picture></div><p>Since launching <a href="https://blog.tonari.no/changing-communication-and-culture-in-an-organization" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our first pilot</a> in February, we've experienced no software-related downtime (tripping over ethernet cables is a different story). A<m>nd as much as we would love to think we're infallible engineers, we truly don't believe we could have achieved these numbers with this level of stability without Rust.</m></p><a href="#in-the-beginning-(or-why-we're-not-webrtc)" id="in-the-beginning-(or-why-we're-not-webrtc)"><h2>In the beginning (or: why we're not WebRTC)</h2></a><p>The <m>very</m> first tonari proof-of-concept used a basic projector, bluetooth speakers, and a website running on top of vanilla WebRTC (JavaScript). We've come a long way since those days.</p><p>While that prototype (and our opinionated vision of the future) got us grant funding, we knew that tonari would be dead on arrival unless we could<m> achieve </m><i>significantly</i> lower latency and higher fidelity than <m>WebRTC</m>—two things that aren't currently associated with video chat in 2020.</p><p>We figured, “Okay<i>, so we can just </i><m><i>modify</i></m><i> WebRTC directly and wrap it up with a slick UI in C++ and launch it in no time</i>.”</p><p>A week of struggling with WebRTC’s nearly 750,000 LoC <i>behemoth</i> of a codebase revealed just how painful a single small change could be — how hard it was to test, and feel truly <i>safe,</i> with the code you were dealing with.</p><a href="#let-there-be-light...weight-code" id="let-there-be-light...weight-code"><h3>Let there be light...weight code</h3></a><p>So in a furious (read: calm and thoroughly-discussed) rage quit we decided it was easier to re-implement the whole stack from scratch. We wanted to <i>know and understand every line of code</i> being run on our hardware, and it should be designed for the <i>exact</i> hardware we wanted.</p><p>Thus began our journey to the depths beyond high-level interfaces like a browser or existing RTC project, and into the world of low-level systems and hardware interaction from scratch.</p><p>We needed it to <m>be inherently </m><b><m><i>secure</i></m></b><m> to </m>protect the privacy of those who use tonari.  We needed it to be <b><i>performant</i></b> to make it feel as human and real-time as possible.  And we needed it to be <b><i>maintainable</i></b> as the code becomes more mature, as new brains show up and have to learn our work and expand on it.</p><p><m>We discussed and ruled out a handful of alternative approaches:</m></p><ul><li><b><i>Security: </i></b>C and C++ are memory- and concurrency-unsafe, and their disparate and seemingly infinite build systems make it hard to have a consistent and simple development experience.</li><li><i><b>Performance: </b></i>Java, <m>C#, and Go'</m>s memory management is opaque and can be difficult to work with in latency-sensitive applications where you want full control over your memory.</li><li><i><b>Maintainability: </b></i>Haskell, Nim, D, and a handful of other more bespoke languages tend to be more limited in tooling, community, and hire-ability.</li></ul><p>Rust is really the only production-ready language that we found confidently satisfies these needs.</p><a href="#finding-beauty-in-rust" id="finding-beauty-in-rust"><h2>Finding beauty in Rust</h2></a><p>Rust's beauty lies in the countless decisions made by the development community that constantly make you feel like you <m>can have</m> ten cakes and eat all of them too.</p><ul><li>Its build system is opinionated, and cleanly designed. It is itself a complete ecosystem that makes introducing new engineers to your project and setting up dev environments remarkably simple.</li><li>The memory and concurrency safety guarantees cannot be over-appreciated. We're confident that we wouldn't have done our first deployment yet if we had continued this in C++ - we'd still probably be stuck on subtle snags.</li><li>Our ability to interact at the lowest level with hardware via APIs like CUDA, oftentimes through existing <a href="https://crates.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><m>crates</m></a> (Rust's term for a code library), has allowed us to have higher standards about the latency we want from our first production release.</li></ul><p>As tonari is getting more advanced, we're now choosing embedded microcontrollers whose firmware can be written in Rust so we don't have to leave our idyllic utopia into the old world of unsafe system programming.</p><a href="#crates-we-rely-on" id="crates-we-rely-on"><h2>Crates we rely on</h2></a><p>We're not going to <code>cat Cargo.toml</code> here, instead focusing on some select crates that have earned the prestigious award of a lifetime invitation to each of our birthday parties forever.</p><a href="#&quot;better-than-std&quot;-crates" id="&quot;better-than-std&quot;-crates"><h3>"Better-than-std" crates</h3></a><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><code>crossbeam</code></a> is better for inter-thread communication than <code>std::sync::mpsc</code> in almost every way, and may be merged into <code>std</code> eventually.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Amanieu/parking_lot" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><code>parking_lot</code></a> has a mutex implementation better than <code>std::sync::Mutex</code> in almost every way, and may be merged into the standard library (one day).

At its root we have a Cargo workspace with a <code>binaries</code> crate, and a number of supporting library crates.</p><p>Having our crates in one repo makes them easy to reference in our <code>binaries</code> crate without needing to publish to <a href="https://crates.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crates.io</a> or get too fancy with specifying git dependencies in our <code>Cargo.toml</code>.

For example, we’ve written our own actor framework fit for long-running high-throughput actors, as well as our own network protocol for reliable, high-bandwidth, low-latency media streaming.

We use separate binaries for different parts of the tonari system and each of these lives in <code>binaries</code>, a combination library/binary crate. Its library modules contains a set of reusable actors that combine our private API with our actor system, and then a collection of individual binaries that consume these actors and define the plumbing between them.</p><a href="#flags-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see" id="flags-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see"><h3>Flags as far as the eye can see</h3></a><p>We make extensive use of feature flags to allow development of our project on different OSes (like Brian's 1970s-era MacBook Pro) or different hardware configurations. This allows us to easily swap out camera hardware without extra runtime checks or using awful <code>sed</code> hacks.

For example, Linux uses <code>v4l2</code> (Video For Linux...2) to access most webcams, but other webcams might have their own SDK.  To compile for platforms that don't use <code>v4l2</code> or when an SDK isn't available for a particular OS, we can put those SDKs behind feature flags and export a common interface.

As a (simplified) concrete example, let's say we have a common camera interface defined as a trait:</p><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> Capture <span>{</span>
    
    <span>fn</span> <span>capture</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>u8<span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Let's also say we have three different camera interfaces - <code>v4l2</code>, <code>corevideo</code>, and <code>polaroid.</code> We can make our binaries work exclusively with this trait to be flexible, and we can swap in different implementations of <code>Capture</code> with feature flags.</p><pre><code><span>#[cfg(feature = "v4l2")]</span>
<span>mod</span> v4l2 <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> V4l2Capture <span>{</span>
        <span>...</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>impl</span> Capture <span>for</span> V4l2Capture <span>{</span>

        <span>...</span>
    <span>}</span>

        <span>fn</span> <span>capture</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>u8<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>...</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[cfg(feature = "v4l2")]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> VideoCapture <span>=</span> v4l2<span>::</span>V4l2Capture<span>;</span>

<span>#[cfg(feature = "corevideo")]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> VideoCapture <span>=</span> corevideo<span>::</span>CoreVideoCapture<span>;</span>

<span>#[cfg(feature = "polaroid")]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> VideoCapture <span>=</span> polaroid<span>::</span>PolaroidCapture<span>;</span></code></pre><p>If we make our code work with things which implement the <code>Capture</code> trait instead of concrete types, we can now compile on and target various platforms by simply toggling feature flags. For example, we can have a struct which has a field - <code>video_capture: Box&lt;dyn Capture&gt;</code> which will let us store any type which can <code>Capture</code> from a camera.

An example <code>Cargo.toml</code> file to support the capture implementations we wrote above might look something like …</p></div></div>

<h2>A multiplayer board game in Rust and WebAssembly</h2>
<p><a href="https://pont.mattkeeter.com/">
<img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/screenshot.png">
</a></p><p>
<a href="https://pont.mattkeeter.com/">Click to play!</a>
</p>
<p><em>Pont</em> is an online implementation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwirkle">Qwirkle, a board game by Mindware Games</a>.
It was written for my parents,
so they could play with friends and family during the COVID-19 stay-at-home era.</p>
<p>Play is split into <strong>rooms</strong>,
which are identified by a three-word code
(<code>size moody shape</code> in the image above).
Within each room,
the game distributes pieces,
enforces the game rules,
and provides a local chat window.</p>
<p>Unusually, it's a web-based multiplayer game <strong>without any Javascript</strong>:
both the client and server are written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>,
which is compiled into <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> to run on the browser.
(There's a Javascript shim to load the WebAssembly module, but I didn't have to write it myself)</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Keep in mind, I'm <em>not a web developer</em>,
so this is probably a weird <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art">outsider architecture</a>
for web applications.
Here's what the system looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/diagram.svg" alt="Diagram"></p>
<p>The system uses <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> for certificates:
both static assets and WebSocket communication are encrypted
between the client and the server.
The game server does not communicate securely with the NGINX proxy,
but if anyone is on the server watching,
I've got bigger problems.</p>
<p>The <code>wasm</code> bundle and <code>pont-server</code> executable are both
written in Rust and managed in the <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont"><code>pont</code> repository</a>.
They both depend on <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-common/src/lib.rs"><code>pont-common</code></a>,
which defines basic types and logic for gameplay
(e.g. so that both the client and server can check whether a move is legal).</p>
<p>The client and server communicate via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSockets</a>.
Messages are strongly typed as an <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-common/src/lib.rs#L7-L48"><code>enum</code> in <code>pont-common</code></a>,
serialized using <a href="https://serde.rs/">Serde</a>,
and packed into <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">bincode</a>
to be sent as binary WebSocket messages.</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>The game server using async Rust,
which was... exciting:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ej649l/a_summary_of_the_current_state_of_async_rust/fcw16a9/">"very polite cold war"</a>
going on between the two major (incompatible?) runtimes,
with packages that only work in one or the other</li>
<li>An <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/mpsc/index.html">infinite</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.21/tokio/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html">supply</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam-channel/0.4.2/crossbeam_channel/">of</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/oneshot/fn.channel.html">options</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-channel-preview/0.3.0-alpha.19/futures_channel/index.html">for</a>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/index.html">channels</a></li>
<li>General confusion between <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/"><code>futures</code></a>,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/index.html"><code>std::Future</code></a>, and
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-util/0.3.5/futures_util/"><code>futures_util</code></a>
(exacerbated by the fact that Googling for things will land you
into a random version of the docs)</li>
<li>Error messages that rival C++ in incomprehensibility</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, the Rust <code>async</code> ecosystem is relatively new,
so most of this can be ascribed to growing pains;
I'm sure that the ergonomics and library situation
will improve over time.</p>
<p>I ended up using the <a href="https://github.com/stjepang/smol"><code>smol</code> runtime</a>
because it's got relatively few dependencies,
and I appreciated that it wasn't trying to own the entire async universe
(unlike Tokio and <code>async-std</code>).</p>
<p>After getting over those hurdles,
the server architecture is relatively straightforward.
A bunch of independent tasks run asynchronously,
communicating to the outside world via WebSockets
and internally via <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/mpsc/fn.unbounded.html">unbounded MPSC queues</a>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of the server running one game (with two players),
plus one new client who has just connected.  Each rectangle
represents an async task:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/server.svg" alt="Server"></p>
<p>The system has <code>2 + n_players + n_games</code> async tasks running at one time:</p>
<ul>
<li>A top-level task which accepts incoming connections.</li>
<li>A top-level task which logs the number of active rooms, once per minute</li>
<li>One async task per client connection, which passes messages between the WebSocket connection
and the application's internal queues.</li>
<li>One async task per room, which handles game state</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks each map to a <a href="https://docs.rs/smol/0.1.10/smol/struct.Task.html"><code>smol::Task</code></a>.
(As a small optimization,
the first player's <code>Task</code> handles both the player communication
and running the room, which is why they're both blue in the diagram above)</p>
<p>The server compiles down to a 5 MB static binary.
The whole system is hosted on the smallest VM offered by
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>,
which is a $5/month machine.
I'm looking forward to the inevitable <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">DDOS</a>,
where I can see how well it scales!</p>
<h2>Client</h2>
<p>The client is <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/src/lib.rs">2000 lines of framework-less excitement</a>.
It uses a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state machine pattern</a>
to represent the flow of the game,
accepting messages from the server
and updating the state accordingly:
for example, top-level state flows from
<code>Connecting</code> to <code>CreateOrJoin</code> to <code>Playing</code>.</p>
<p>The game board is represented as an SVG;
everything else is standard HTML elements.
In fact, the whole UI is pre-constructed in
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/deploy/index.html"><code>index.html</code></a>
and revealed on demand.</p>
<p>The client has a bit of polish:
Pieces are animated as they move around the board,
and there's an optional color-blind mode,
which adds corner markings to indicate color.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/cb.png" alt="Color-blind mode"></p>
<p>I use direct DOM manipulation
(from the <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/"><code>web-sys</code></a> crate)
to control the system.
This exercise has left me appreciating the usefulness of virtual DOMs,
but I didn't want to bring in the complexity of a framework.
(Is there a Rust + <code>wasm</code> version of <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> yet?)</p>
<p>For deployment,
I'm using <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/"><code>wasm-pack</code></a>
and serving the resulting <code>wasm</code> blob from the same server as the other static assets.</p>
<p>The main challenges on the client side were
(of course) dealing with cross-browser compatibility:
Safari, in particular, supports fewer features
and has funky handling of touch events.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>After a bit of a learning curve,
this all worked surprisingly well!</p>
<p>The client side is still a bit messy,
with animations, UI inputs,
and server events all fighting to break the system's invariants.
For example,
there was a nasty bug where dragging the board while
an animation was running could drop the system into an invalid state.</p>
<p>This isn't surprising:
stateful UIs are hard,
which explains the popularity of declarative approaches.
At this point, the client is feature-complete
and hasn't quite collapsed under its own weight,
so I'm not inclined to do any dramatic refactorings.</p>
<p>Rust as a language continues to be great,
despite minor complaints.
I already discussed the async ecosystem above,
and won't dwell on that any further.
On the client side,
there are often impedance mismatches with WebAssembly:
for example, using Rust closures as callbacks
requires
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/src/lib.rs#L1189-L1211">cryptic boilerplate</a>.</p>
<p>Still, with all of the pieces in place,
making changes is pleasantly fast,
and I trust the compiler to check that I haven't broken anything.</p>
<p>I'm particularly happy with the combination of WebSockets, Serde, and bincode:
having both the client and server process a strongly-typed stream of events
makes things easy to reason about.</p>

 <p>
  As I am currently right in the middle of a far-reaching rework of Genode's
  low-level GUI stack, I'd like to share a bit of background behind this work:
  the Why, the What, and the How.
 </p>
 <h4>
 <a name="Current_state"></a>
 Current state</h4>
  <p>
   The current incarnation of Genode's low-level GUI-related interfaces is almost
   identical to the very first version that we originally created in 2006.
   Genode has a very strong asymmetric notion of the
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/20.05/architecture/Recursive_system_structure.html#Client-server_relationship">relationship</a>
   between client and server components. In this relationship, the client depends
   on the server but the server does not depend on the client.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the lowest level, the framebuffer driver and input driver(s) were
   envisioned as servers that provide the <i>Framebuffer</i> and <i>Input</i> session
   interfaces to higher-level GUI components. From our former academic view, this
   felt natural because those drivers <i>provide</i> <i>resources</i> to other components.
   Provide... serve... server! The nitpicker GUI server uses those low-level
   services to implement a higher level service that ultimately allows for the
   multiplexing of graphics and input.
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/20.05/components/Common_session_interfaces.html#Nitpicker_GUI">Nitpicker</a>
   virtualizes the low-level framebuffer and input interfaces while supplementing
   the notions of visible views and input focus. Such a system looks as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://genodians.org/nfeske/nitpicker_orig.png">
  </p>
  <p>
   The drivers and the nitpicker GUI server are displayed in red because they are
   servers. The GUI applications at the right are nitpicker clients. Nitpicker,
   in turn, is a client of the framebuffer and input drivers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The client interface of the nitpicker GUI server is success story. A few
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/15.11#GUI_stack">evolutionary tweaks</a>
   notwithstanding, the original design scales up to the windowed working
   environment of Sculpt OS while retaining the tiny complexity of the nitpicker
   GUI server.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the approach of modelling the framebuffer and input drivers as
   servers is a dead end, for the following reasons.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Drivers are sometimes extremely complex. When looking at the complexity of
     the Intel framebuffer driver (ported from the Linux kernel) for example, it
     feels foolish to trust that it won't fail. Because the nitpicker GUI server
     depends on the liveliness of the driver, however, the well-being of the
     driver is on the critical path for the entire GUI stack and all GUI
     applications.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     It is impossible to transparently restart or replace the driver at runtime
     without also restarting the GUI stack and - transitively - all GUI
     applications. This is because the nitpicker GUI server is connected as a
     client to the drivers. The connections are like a life supply for the GUI
     server. Cutting those would ultimately kill the GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Adding secondary displays is rather difficult because this would require
     nitpicker to know what framebuffer servers are out there and to request
     multiple framebuffer connections. Adding such a protocol would inflate
     the complexity of nitpicker.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <h4>
 <a name="Inverting_interfaces"></a>
 Inverting interfaces</h4>
  <p>
   To overcome these limitations, we must break the dependency of the GUI
   server from the drivers, like illustrated here:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://genodians.org/nfeske/nitpicker_next.png">
  </p>
  <p>
   In this scenario, the GUI server no longer <i>uses</i> the drivers, but the drivers
   use the GUI server. The relationship is reversed. Only the nitpicker GUI
   server remains red. Of course, the drivers cannot talk to nitpicker GUI
   server via nitpicker's regular client interface. Instead, two new interfaces
   enter the picture:
  </p>
  <div><dl>
   <dt>The <i>Capture</i> session interface</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     is like the inverse of the original
     <i>Framebuffer</i> session interface. It allows a client to obtain pixel data
     from the server. From the GUI server's perspective, a framebuffer driver
     is like a frame capturing device - which it is.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt>The <i>Event</i> session interface</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     is like the inverse of the original
     <i>Input</i> session interface. In contrast to a input session, which allows
     a client to obtain input events, an event session allows a client to
     induce input events. Nitpicker is an event server that consumes the input
     events from the driver(s).
    </p>
   </dd>
  </dl></div>
  <p>
   The benefits of this approach are manifold:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     The low-complexity GUI server remains as the only component that must never
     fail, which makes the GUI stack much more resilient compared to today.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Since the nitpicker GUI server no longer depends on the drivers, it can be
     started before the drivers are running, speeding up the boot time of
     graphical scenarios. In scenarios with rigid power management, we can remove
     the graphics driver - and switch off the graphics device - all while the GUI
     server and all GUI applications stay intact.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Drivers can be restarted anytime. From the perspective of the nitpicker
     GUI server, this looks like a client disconnect and connect. Drivers
     can also be replaced at runtime, e.g., swapping out the VESA and Intel
     drivers.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Connecting more than one driver to the nitpicker GUI server becomes
     conceptually simple. This clears the path towards multi-head support.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     The new capture session interface of the nitpicker GUI server would be
     the right hook for implementing screenshot/screencast applications, or a
     remote desktop server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Analogously to capture devices, input devices can enter and leave the
     system at any time without disruption, which will allow for the fine-grained
     management of USB HID devices. Think of plugging a new HID device to
     your Sculpt system. A new USB device would show up.
     The user can deploy the matching HID driver with the option of routing the
     event session of the driver to the system GUI server. Isn't that wonderful?
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   What is the downside? <i>It is a lot of work!</i> This leads us the following
   section.
  </p>
 <h4>
 <a name="The_plan"></a>
 The plan</h4>
  <p>
   Turning the low-level session interfaces upside down is an invasive operation
   that must be carried out in several steps, each yielding an intermediate
   consistent state.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>
     We start off with some low-risk <b>cosmetic</b> changes, namely the renaming
     of the "Nitpicker" session interface to "Gui" session. The strange
     branding of the session interface after a particular implementation is a
     relic from the early days. This
     <a href="https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/3778">change</a> has already
     entered Genode's master branch.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Consistently use <b>32-bit RGB</b> as pixel format by all drivers and
     applications. This is a long-standing feature request that eliminates
     the need for color-space conversions and generally improves the output
     quality.
     It is quite labor-intensive because it requires me testing many
     different hardware platforms covering the drivers vesa_fb_drv, fb_sdl,
     intel_fb_drv, imx53_fb_drv, imx8_fb_drv, rpi_fb_drv, boot_fb_drv,
     omap4_fb_drv, exynos5_fb_drv.
     This <a href="https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/3784">change</a> has already
     progressed well.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introducing the new <b>Capture</b> session <b>interface</b>.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Implementing the <b>capture service</b> in the nitpicker GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introduce a <b>nitpicker</b> option to choose the framebuffer <b>back end</b> between
     the use of a requested framebuffer session (as done today), the use of a
     capture client for the pixel output, or the use of another GUI server
     (for stacking multiple instance of nitpicker).
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Turn "Framebuffer" <b>drivers</b> into "Capture" clients, covering all the
     drivers mentioned above. Shoveling code. Adjusting all existing
     scenarios to use nitpicker's capture service.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Pruning</b> the remaining use of the <b>framebuffer client</b> interface.
     In fact, when done, I want to remove the <tt>Framebuffer::Connection</tt>
     completely. This will require the reworking of the terminal, MESA back end,
     several tests, and the liquid_framebuffer. In the process, I hope to largely
     eliminate the use cases of the nit_fb (now called gui_fb) component so
     that this component can be removed in the end.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Turning</b> a few other <b>framebuffer clients</b> into "Capture" servers, in
     particular test-framebuffer, fb_bench, and test-driver_manager.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Removal</b> of the "Framebuffer" <b>session interface</b>, retaining the interface
     merely as a part of the GUI session.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introducing the new <b>Event</b> session <b>interface</b> and adding its implementation
     to the nitpicker GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Adding a new <b>event_filter component</b> taking the place of the input_filter.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     With the structural changes done, it would be time for optimizations.
     As a prerequisite for tear-free animations, the <b>frame buffering</b> will be
     moved from the clients into the nitpicker GUI server. At first, this will be
     transparent to most clients. The subsequent removal of client-side buffering
     is second independent step. As another optimization, I plan to go though all
     places that employed the dithering of pixels.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Of those topics, the rework of the framebuffer drivers is certainly the most
   elaborate one. I'm considering to drop the Exynos5 and OMAP4 drivers.
   Even though I strive for replacing the input session interface by the new
   event session interface, the scope of the task of reworking the input drivers
   is not yet completely tangible to me.

<p>The last couple of days I picked up on my ELK Stack a couple thousands of SSH Brute Force Attacks, so I decided I will just revisit my SSH Server configuration, and change my SSH Port to something else for the interim. The dashboard that showed me the results at that point in time:</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rbekker/image/upload/v1539292443/kibana-failed-ssh-auth_udkxkl.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then I decided I actually would like to setup a SSH Honeypot to listen on Port 22 and change my SSH Server to listen on 222 and capture their IP Addresses, Usernames and Passwords that they are trying to use and dump it all in a file so that I can build up my own password dictionary :D</p>
<h2 id="sshconfiguration">SSH Configuration:</h2>
<p>Changing the SSH Port:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</code></pre>
<p>Change the port to 222:</p>
<pre><code>Port 222
</code></pre>
<p>Restart the SSH Server:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
</code></pre>
<p>Verify that the SSH Server is running on the new port:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo netstat -tulpn | grep sshd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:222            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      28838/sshd
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/random-robbie/docker-ssh-honey">random-robbie</a>, as he had everything I was looking for on Github.</p>
<p>Setup the SSH Honeypot:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/random-robbie/docker-ssh-honey
$ cd docker-ssh-honey/
$ docker build . -t local:ssh-honepot
$ docker run -itd --name ssh-honeypot -p 22:22 local:ssh-honepot
</code></pre>
<p>Once people attempt to ssh, you will get the output to stdout:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker logs -f $(docker ps -f name=ssh-honeypot -q) | grep -v 'Error exchanging' | head -10

<p>Detach from your screen session:</p>
<pre><code>Ctrl + a; d

<p>Leaving this running for a couple of months, and I have a massive password database:</p>
<pre><code>$ wc -l /var/log/honeypot/ssh.log
54184260 /var/log/honeypot/ssh.log
</code></pre>
<p>That is correct, 54 million password attempts. 5372 Unique IPs, 4082 Unique Usernames, 88829 Unique Passwords.</p>

    <p>You’ve likely experienced it: “You’re above and beyond everything we’re asking. There’s no promotion this round but all you need to do is <strong>__</strong>_”. Insert a semi-important but not absolutely necessary thing. Even worse if it’s something you’re really not good at.</p>

<p>One of the most demotivating things that an organization or manager can do is requiring “perfection” for a promotion. It’s a problem with two main dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s incommensurate with the value being added to the business.</li>
  <li>Perfection is subjective.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="incommensurate-with-value-add">Incommensurate with Value-Add</h2>

<p>Ultimately all performance comes down to one thing: how much value are you adding to the business? Examples of where forcing perfection gets things out of whack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I coded up a feature that brought in $10M to the business this year. I wasn’t promoted because they said I don’t speak enough in meetings.</li>
  <li>I saved the company from collapse because I was the only one who knew how to debug the system when it was melting. I wasn’t promoted because they said I show up too late every day.</li>
  <li>I identified a winning strategy for the entire business that drove us to another echelon of success. I wasn’t promoted because my design docs have typos.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that matters is the value being added to the business. There are nuances where behavior can set bad examples or cause issues for others, but that detracts from value added to the business and should be considered. The unfortunate and unbelievably common case is that some sort of benign missing strength is held against people.</p>

<h2 id="perfection-is-subjective">Perfection is Subjective</h2>

<p>When managers go down the rabbit whole of chasing perfect promotions they’re much more likely to be biased. In reality, most people’s internal picture of a perfect candidate for a promotion is something like “what did I look like when I got promoted?” That’s often the closest image a manager has of what a promotion at that level looks like.</p>

<p>In mild cases you get things like “when I got promoted I had to walk in the snow to work, uphill both ways.”</p>

<p>In more severe cases you get things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Men who don’t promote women because they’re not “aggressive enough” or they “don’t speak up enough”</li>
  <li>Extroverts who don’t promote introverts because they don’t like public speaking.</li>
  <li>Non-parents who don’t promote parents because they don’t work until midnight in the office.</li>
</ul>

<p>Promote people based on impact to the business, not their style of delivery.  Don’t hold people down because they deliver value in a way that isn’t comfortable, known, or practiced by you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In promotions and growth, focus more on amplifying strengths than fixing “weaknesses”.  You’ll find it’s much easier and much more fruitful to have people play to their strengths.</p>

<p>Promote imperfect people - that’s all you’ve got.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>                                
                                    <div> 
                                        <p>As someone who grew up throughout the 90's and 00's, some of my fondest memories stem from progressive advancements in internet and computing technologies.  Upgrading from Dial-Up internet to DSL was a grand event in our house.  I remember my brother and I fighting over the computer day in and day out to play games like Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory, which was released in 2003. (I'm convinced that this will be the all-time best FPS game ever created.)  At around the same time, we upgraded to one of the best Dell computer's available at the time. It had 512MB of RAM and a Pentium 4 processor.  This was a major upgrade from our Compaq Celeron, which had something like 64MB of RAM. <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/MV5BOGFmNjMzZTktNDg2ZS00ZjllLTlkMTAtZTAzMzBkN2UyMzk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU3MzI1NzI@._V1_.jpg" alt="Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory"></p>

<p>Eventually, the grandeur of DSL faded as the rest of the world began to adopt Cable and Fiber internet.  It wasn't until I briefly moved to Philadelphia that I was finally able to experienced what I had been missing out on.  In college I lived in a neighborhood that was one of Verizon's first Fios builds.  I was absolutely blown away by the 25 Mbps connection.  This was in 2009. I'm amazed that over a decade later, in 2020, some households still don't have access to cable or fiber internet yet.</p>

<p>Like many of our customers do now, I could never figure out why it was so difficult to get us fiber service.  The cable is cheap, just throw it up on a pole and give me internet! Right?  Well, not so fast... <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/1849761.jpg" alt="Fiber Spaghetti"></p>

<p>A quick overview of how utility services are run and the challenges involved...</p>

<p>As most people know, there are primarily two ways to deliver utility services to a home or business.  Aerial and underground.  Water, gas, and sewer are always serviced underground for obvious reasons.  Electric, telephone, cable, and fiber have the ability to either be above or below ground.</p>

<h3 id="aerial">Aerial.</h3>

<p>As with anything else, aerial has pro's and con's.</p>

<p>The pro's are primarily upfront costs (this is debatable) and speed of deployment (this is also debatable).</p>

<p>The con's are that contrary to it being cheaper to physically deploy, the pole owners generally charge up-front make ready fee's.  These fees can range from $0 to upwards of $50,000/mile.  It's essentially pay to play.  If we want to attach to 50 poles, the pole owner might determine that 10 of those poles are old and need to be replaced before we can attach to them.  Rather than fork up the cash themselves, they'll force us to pay to replace their poles in order to approve the attachment.</p>

<p>In addition to that, there are the annual pole fee's.  Depending on your agreement, we've seen pole fee's ranging anywhere from $7/pole per year all the way up to $43/pole per year with 10% annual increases (I'm looking at you PPL.  This ridiculous rate was purely intended to keep us from attaching to their poles, IMO.  It's impossible to make money with these rates). <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-10-22.04.34.png" alt="Pole Rates"></p>

<p>Another con is that even though installing the cable on poles is faster, it usually takes the pole owner around 6 months just to review applications and to determine make ready requirements and costs.  As an example, if we have fiber on a pole that's 1 pole short from being able to service your house, it would take at least 6 months just to run fiber to that one additional pole. So close, yet so far.</p>

<h3 id="underground">Underground.</h3>

<p>Like aerial, underground has its own list of pro's and con's.</p>

<p>When you install a service underground, you own it for life.  There are no annual fee's.  You pay one time to install it and you're set for life.  This sounds like a pro, but it's also a con.  When we run metro conduit, it generally costs us between $15-25/ft (not including customer drops).  For the sake of argument, let's assume we're at the high-end of our costs.  If we install 1,000ft of conduit, that's $25,000 that we need to pay out of pocket upfront.  Some blocks have upwards of 30 customers, but others have as little as 5.  Let's average it out at 20 customers per block, that's $1,250 upfront per customer, assuming we get every single customer.  Conservatively, we're initially looking at a 50% take rate.  This could grow to 100% overtime, but we never make that assumption. So that's $2,500/customer.  Imagine spending $2,500 per house/building and then have them tell you that your $69/m service is too expensive.  Generally speaking, we won't do a street unless our numbers look better than this, but this is a realistic scenario as we scale and get access to cheaper capital, etc.</p>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>

<p>Cost issues aside, there are a number of other hurdles one needs to get past just to begin the process of building out a network.  You'd think that risking everything you have in an effort to bring your local economy into the 21st Century would be a welcome sight.  That's what I thought too; was I wrong.  While there are plenty of supporters (I truly appreciate you all), there are just as many, if not more, critics.</p>

<p>We've been fortunate enough to have had a handful of people get behind us overtime and give us a shot.  I'm sure others haven't had it so easy.  I know this because even after we've become an established player in our city throughout the past 4 years, neighboring townships and municipalities haven't been as opened armed to welcome us into their communities as I had anticipated or would have liked.</p>

<p>I'll go into more detail on small government policies that really hamper our ability to deploy underground later below.</p>

<h3 id="toomanyopinions">Too Many Opinions</h3>

<p>I'm generally a big fan of individual citizens trying to make an impact in their communities.  However, in too many cases these contributions seem to be made in the form of unproductive complaints rather than productive feedback or action.  Far too many people have a say in things that they probably shouldn't.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case A.</em></strong></p>

<p>A new customer had recently signed an agreement with us to run fiber into their building.  This is a non-profit who's members are selflessly donating their time to restore a landmark in the community.  Upon receiving their signature, I notified the city that we would be pulling a permit to connect the building in question to our underground network.  They said okay; that was that.  Our nearest existing hand hole is approximately 90ft to the right of the new customer's property; in front of another property.  As a courtesy, I notified the manager of that establishment to let her know that we would be performing work over the weekend, from Friday into Saturday.  They're closed Saturday and Sunday so I had assumed they would appreciate the notice and possibly even sign up with us.  The project would involve removing 90ft of sidewalk, running conduit, and then restoring the sidewalk with brand spankin' new concrete.  The total timespan that this would occur, from when our shovel hit the ground to having new sidewalks in place, would be 48 hrs.  The response that I received from a member of their organization made me facepalm.</p>

<p><img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-10-18.53.55-copy.png" alt="Sidewalk Issues"></p>

<p>Not long after receiving this email, I became aware that they didn't even own the building in question, nevermind the sidewalk.  They lease it.  This was eventually "resolved" after a series of negotiations between the non-profit's president and the establishment in question.  Often times we aren't as lucky.</p>

<p>We initially planned to have this new customer installed within a week of them signing the contract.  Now it will end up being around 2 months from start to finish.  Long story short, I learned my lesson in trying to be courteous.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case B.</em></strong></p>

<p>Last year we were installing conduit for our fiber optic network.  There were countless instances where people would literally stop their cars, roll down their windows, and yell profanities at us.  In what world is that acceptable behavior for an adult? I can't imagine being so far off my rocker that I would feel the need to yell at a bunch of construction workers trying to build a fiber optic network (not that they had any idea what we were doing).  If these are the types of people influencing decisions, there's something wrong.</p>

<p>City workers have a tough job fielding complaints from people like this and I commend them for it.  It shouldn't affect policy though.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case C.</em></strong></p>

<p>In another incident that took place not long, maybe a day or two, after <em>Case B</em> above.  A local store owner came back to us as we're swinging pick axes in 95 degree heat telling us we need to hurry up and we should hire more workers.  "My customers keep calling saying there's no where to park."  Mind you, we're standing right next to a massive parking lot that is approximately 1/3rd full.  I made my best attempt to kindly explain that paying 3 guys to stand around a hole to watch one person hand-dig to expose a utility isn't going to make our work go any faster.  I don't think he liked my response.</p>

<h3 id="theconsequences">The Consequences</h3>

<p>In many cases, resident complaints are justified.  Utility providers need to be held accountable for shitty restoration work.  However, the way in which bad restoration work is being combated is counter productive.  There has been a huge increase in curb-to-curb restoration requirements by local governments.  Essentially what these rules state is that anytime a utility cuts asphalt beyond a predetermined length, say 100ft, they are then responsible for replacing the entire road surface from the curb on the left side of the street to the curb on the right side of the street.  I believe some municipalities are also trying to introduce these measures to offload the costs of repaving roads themselves, similar to how pole owners force you to replace their aging utility poles under their make-ready requirements.  (One municipality told me as much when I attended a local council meeting in an effort to get them to waive this ridiculous ordinance for us.)</p>

<p>These policies will ultimately do more harm than good.  For us, these are the one and only thing preventing us from providing superior fiber internet services in these areas.  Forcing curb-to-curb asphalt …</p></div></div></div>

<hr>

<p><strong>It has been a long journey!</strong> I was silent for a while, haven’t posted regularly on my blog. But don’t worry, I’m fine. Instead, I took this situation around coronavirus and focused on writing a book “<em>Performance Analysis and Tuning on Modern CPU</em>”. I started writing this book almost a year ago, so I’m happy I finally can show something to the people. Right now, the <strong>early draft is ready and I’m welcoming everybody to review the book and maybe even add something to it</strong>. I know a lot of people are struggling right now, so I decided to make the book <strong>FREE</strong> for all. Eventually, everyone will be able to download PDF version of it.</p>

<p><strong>Why I started it?</strong> I started this book with one simple goal in mind: educate developers to better understand performance of their applications running on modern HW. Most of developers are used to look no further than the source code of their application without trying to understand performance implications of the changes they make. I know for many of us what happens under the hood is sort of black matter. I know it’s hard, but hopefully with this book, performance world of modern HW will become more accessible.</p>

<p><strong>What is the book about?</strong> Have you ever debated with a coworker about performance of a certain piece of code? Then you probably know how hard it is to predict which version is going to work best. With so many moving parts inside the modern processors even a small tweak to the code can trigger significant performance change. Besides all its complexity, HW has many features that support performance analysis. That’s right, CPUs are capable of telling us what performance bottlenecks are and where they occur. Thus, the book focuses on how your code looks like from the CPU perspective and provides recipes for HW specific optimizations. The core of the book is centered around how to find the right place in the code to improve performance.</p>

<p>Below I present the sweetest parts of the book contents:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>1. Introduction
2. Measuring Performance
3. CPU Microarchitecture 101
4. Terminology And Metrics In Performance Analysis
5. Performance Analysis Approaches
  5.1. Code Instrumentation
  5.2. Tracing
  5.3. Workload Characterization
  5.4. Sampling
  5.5. Static Performance Analysis
  5.6. Compiler Optimization Reports
6. CPU Features For Performance Analysis
  6.1. Top-Down Microarchitecture Analysis (TMAM)
  6.2. Last Branch Record (LBR)
  6.3. Processor Event-Based Sampling (PEBS)
  6.4. Intel Processor Traces (PT)
7. Source Code Tuning For CPU
  7.1. Data-Driven Optimizations
  7.2. CPU Front-End Optimizations
  7.3. CPU Back-End Optimizations
  7.4. Optimizing Bad Speculation
  7.5. Other Tuning Areas
8. Optimizing Multithreaded Applications
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Who is this book for?</strong> Primarily, this book is written for developers working in performance critical projects. This includes the following areas: High performance computing (HPC), High Frequency Trading (HFT), GameDev, Data Centers (Facebook, Google, etc), and other areas. But I hope it will be useful for any C++ developer: you can use this book to learn performance analysis which will stack up nicely with other skills you might have. All examples in the book are written in C/C++, but to the large extent they are applicable to any native programming language (like C, C++, Rust, Go and even Fortran). While this book is fairly low-level, I hope, it will be accessible even to developers that are just starting performance related work.</p>

<p>I gave this book all my knowledge and experience and I’m eager to share it with community. I decided to make this book open to everyone and <strong>I welcome everyone to review and contribute to the book</strong>. I hope, this way we can combine best performance practices and expertise from people in different areas.</p>

<![CDATA[Use ProxyJump with SSH for VMs with No Public IPs]]>

<p>I have a dedicated server with LXD installed where I have a bunch of system containers running to host a lot of my playground services, and to access the operating system of those lxc containers, I need to SSH to the LXD host, then exec or ssh into that LXC container.</p>

<p>This became tedious and wanted a way to directly ssh to them, as they don’t have public ip addresses, it’s not possible but found its possible to access them using proxyjump.</p>

<figure><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>[you] -&gt; [hypervisor] -&gt; [vm on hypervisor]</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>First step is to create our ssh key:</p>

<figure><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Add the created public key (<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>) on the hypervisor and the target vm’s <code>~/.ssh/authorized_key</code> files.</p>

<p>Then create the SSH Config on your local workstation (<code>~/.ssh/config</code>):</p>

<figure><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>

<p>Now accessing our lxc container ctr1, is possible by doing:</p>

<figure><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>

    <p>It all started on an Thursday afternoon in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks, as we were ramping up to Starburst Enterprise
Presto 332-e release. Karol discovered what seemed to be a serious regression, and turned out to be even more
serious Cloud environment issue.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>At the Presto project, we take serious care of stability and efficiency, so releases undergo
rigorous performance benchmarks. The intention is to safe guard against any performance regressions
or stability problems. Usually, the performance improvements are benchmarked separately when they
are being added to the codebase. At Starburst, those benchmarks are even more important, especially
for the Starburst Enterprise Presto LTS releases.</p>

<p>On a side note, we use <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/benchto/">Benchto</a> for organizing
<a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/tree/master/presto-benchto-benchmarks">Presto benchmark suites</a>,
executing them and collecting the results. We use managed <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> in a public
cloud for provisioning Presto clusters, along with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-on-kubernetes/">Starburst Enterprise Presto Kubernetes</a>.
We use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for producing result reports in HTML and PDF formats.</p>



<p>It all started in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks for the Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e release.
On one Thursday afternoon he reported stability problems, with few benchmark runs failing with
exceptions similar to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200326_150852_00338_dj225): Unknown block encoding:
LONG_ARRAY� � �� � @@@���� �@  @ � �@@@ @@� @�@D�� @@��@ `� @@� @#�@ � 0�
... (9550 more bytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Presto, a block encoding is a way of encoding a particular Block type (here, a <code>LongArrayBlock</code>).
They are used when exchanging blocks of data between Presto nodes, or in spill to disk.
Blocks form a polymorphic class hierarchy, so every time a block is encoded, we need
to also store the encoding identifier. The encoding identifier (here, the <code>LONG_ARRAY</code> string)
is written as <code>&lt;string length&gt;</code> (4-byte, signed integer in little-endian) followed by
<code>&lt;string bytes&gt;</code> containing the UTF-8 representation of the encoding id. Clearly, in the case above,
the receiver read the <code>&lt;encoding id length&gt;</code> as 9623 instead of 10! How could that be ever possible?</p>

<p>Presto 332 brought a lot of good changes and upgrade to Java 11 was one of them.
Therefore, Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e was the first Starburst release using Java 11 by default.
For earlier releases, we ran benchmarks using AWS EC2 machines orchestrated with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">Starburst’s Presto
CloudFormation Template (CFT)</a>. This was also the first time we did
Presto release benchmarks running on Kubernetes clusters, with AWS EKS. We could suspect many different factors
as being the cause. We started to sift through the code, search team’s “collective brain” and
the Internet for any ideas. One of the important sources was Vijay Pandurangan’s writeup on <a href="https://tech.vijayp.ca/linux-kernel-bug-delivers-corrupt-tcp-ip-data-to-mesos-kubernetes-docker-containers-4986f88f7a19">data
corruption bug discovered by Twitter in 2015</a>. Of course, we also repeated benchmark runs. Seeing is believing.</p>



<p>On the next day, a customer reported similar problems with their Presto cluster. Of course, they
were not running a yet-to-be-released version that we were still benchmarking. They run into what seemed to
be a very serious regression in a Starburst Enterprise Presto 323-e release line. The customer was also using
the AWS cloud, but not the Kubernetes deployment. They were using <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">CFT-based deployment</a>
– the same stack we were using for all our release benchmarks so far – and we had never run into issues like this before.
As the customer was using a fresh-off-press latest minor release, we decided (in spirit of global health care trend)
to “quarantine” that release and roll back the customer installation to the previous version.</p>

<p>However, the fact that a small bug fix release triggered data problems was unnerving. The fact that we
did not discover any of these problems before, was even more unnerving.</p>



<p>As we were running more and more, and even more test runs, we discovered new failure modes.
For example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200327_001931_00020_8di4r): Cannot cast DECIMAL(7, 2) '18734974449861284.67' to DECIMAL(12, 2)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, this message is not <em>wrong</em>. It’s not possible to cast <code>18734974449861284.67</code> to <code>DECIMAL(12, 2)</code>.
Except that it is <em>also</em> not possible to have a <code>DECIMAL(7, 2)</code> with such value. Something wrong happened to the
data. At that moment, we realized the problem was very serious, because data could become corrupted.
This corrupted data could lead to a failure (like above), but it could also lead to incorrect query results,
or incorrect data being persisted (in case of <code>INSERT</code> or <code>CREATE TABLE AS</code> queries). We created
a virtual War Room (that is, a Slack channel), got together all Presto experts and our experienced field team
to discuss potential causes, further diagnostics and mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>Since the problem was affecting data exchanges between Presto nodes, we listed the following strategies
to try to dissect the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determining which query (queries) is (are) causing failures,</li>
  <li>running with HTTP/2,</li>
  <li>reverting to running on Java 8,</li>
  <li>enabling exchange compression (as decompression is very sensitive to data corruption),</li>
  <li>trying to upgrade Jetty,</li>
  <li>determining whether failures correlate with JVM GC activity,</li>
  <li>inspecting the source code.</li>
</ul>



<p>We were able to quickly prototype and verify some of the ideas. Switching to HTTP/2 or
upgrading Jetty to the latest version did not help. Nor did downgrading to Jetty version
that had been using for a long time. We also verified that problem was reproducible with Java 8,
so we concluded Java 11 was not the cause of it.</p>



<p>We identified the problem occurs somewhere within exchanges, between one Presto worker
node serializing a <code>Page</code> object (basic unit of data processing in Presto) and another node
deserializing it.</p>

<p>While decimal cast failure didn’t directly point at the data corruption problem (there could
be many other reasons for it), there was no other explanation for the <code>Unknown block encoding</code> exceptions.
The serialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.serialize</code> (used by <code>TaskOutputOperator</code>, the data sender) and
deserialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.deserialize</code> (used by <code>ExchangeOperator</code>, the
receiver of the data). As the logic is nicely encapsulated in <code>PagesSerde</code> class, we
added checksums to the serialized data: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
This felt like a smart move – except that it gave us nothing more than a confirmation that
there is a problem (“checksum failure”).
This we already knew.</p>

<p>We considered adding logging to capture data going out from one node and going in on
another node, but that would be huge amount of logs. One run of benchmarks transfers
hundreds of terabytes of data between the nodes.</p>

<p>We went ahead and created a Presto build that added data redundancy to be able to reconstruct
the data on the receiving side.
There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code">well-known error-correction codes</a>
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed–Solomon error correction</a>
available in Hadoop 3). In our case, speed of <em>implementation</em> (a.k.a. simplicity) was a deciding factor,
so we added data mirroring: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
In order to avoid logging of all the data exchanges, we added the deserialized pages (both copies)
to the exceptions being raised.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>java.sql.SQLException: Query failed (#20200401_113622_00676_p7qp7): Hash mismatch, read: 1251072184702746109, calculated: 7591448164918409110
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, first half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, secnd half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The exception told us the first part was changed, since read checksum did not match the calculated
checksum (it was calculated based on the first copy of the data and was different than the checksum
calculated on the sending side).
Having the encoded data in the exception like that, it was easy to extract the actual data and compare,
so now we could see <em>how</em> the data was changed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, first half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; changed
cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, secnd half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; original
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Comparing binary files is fun, but in practice it can be more convenient to compare <code>hexdump</code> output.
The output below was created with <code>vimdiff &lt;(hexdump -Cv original) &lt;(hexdump -Cv changed)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png" alt="Foam kitchen sink, showing a few of the key features"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace</a> for all your knowledge and research.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation" title="Graph visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: This documentation was researched, written and published using <strong>Foam</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a GitHub repository from foam-template</a>. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.</li>
  <li>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/.vscode/settings.json">.vscode/settings.json</a> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to use <strong>Foam</strong>, read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>].</p>

<p>There are [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/known-issues" title="Known Issues">known-issues</a>], and I’m sure, many unknown issues! Please <a href="http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">report them on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<h2 id="call-to-adventure">Call To Adventure</h2>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s is currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

    <p><em>Writing assembly code that runs on multiple architectures.</em></p>
    <p>A few years back, while I worked as a Solaris engineer at Oracle,
I posted an april fools joke to one of our internal mailing lists.
Do you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)">Solaris</a>?
<a href="https://vojtechkral.github.io/blag/polyglot-assembly/pepperidge-farm.jpg">Pepperidge farm remembers</a>.
Unfortunatelly Solaris 12 was
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/oracle-sort-of-confirms-demise-of-solaris-12-effort/">never released</a>
(not as such, anyway) and many of the devs were laid off shortly afterwards,
but that's a different story... The april fools e-mail read as follows:</p>
<pre><span>Hi all,
   can I please get a codereview for my new Hello World program?
The purpose of the program is to output a greeting.
As the code is very short, I'm inlining it at the end of this email.
The code has been tested on sparc and x86.
Only 64 bit arch is supported - please compile with cc -m64.
cstyle reports no issues.

Thanks!
Vojtech

<p>I expect <code>main()</code> not being a function and instead being an array of numbers
won't be news to many people, this
<a href="http://jroweboy.github.io/c/asm/2015/01/26/when-is-main-not-a-function.html">has been done before</a>.
(If you've never seen this before, have a look at that blogpost, it's pretty good!)</p>
<p>The focus of this post instead is this line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The code has been tested on sparc and x86.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any code that a Solaris dev looked to push to the core repository
had to be rigorously tested on both architectures targeted by Solaris: x86 and SPARC.
And this code doesn't really look like it could run on multiple architectures, right? ...
But it does. And it does that with a trick I call a <em>polyglot assembly</em> code.
Maybe that's a little too pompous a name for a silly joke, but I didn't know what else to call it...</p>
<h2 id="linux-x86-64-arm">Linux, x86-64 &amp; ARM</h2>
<p>I recently decided to revive the idea and, since both Solaris and SPARC
are fairly obscure nowadays, to port the code over to Linux on x86-64 and ARM.</p>
<p>Here's the new code:</p>
<pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdint.h&gt;

</span><span>const </span><span>uint64_t</span><span> _start[] </span><span>__attribute__</span><span>((section(</span><span>".text"</span><span>))) </span><span>= </span><span>{
    0xe3a00001909032eb, 0xe3a0200ce28f1014,
    0xef000000e3a07004, 0xe3a07001e3a00000,
    0x6c6c6548ef000000, 0x0a214d5241202c6f,
    0x18ec834800000000, 0x4800000045058b48,
    0xa20fc03148240489, 0x0c24548908245c89,

    0x6c654820050fff31, 0x00000000202c6f6c,
};
</span></pre>
<p>It's still just a <em>Hello, World!</em> program.</p>
<p>To build it, I recommend <code>gcc -static -nostdlib</code>.
I found out the special section attribute is necessary for gcc to put the code in the right section.</p>
<p>You can also get pre built binaries <a href="https://github.com/vojtechkral/asm-polyglot/releases/tag/0.1">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the resulting binaries are <strong>still platform-specific</strong>.
The polyglot trick's purpose is to make it possible to build for x86-64 and ARM from the same source file.
While the executable code inside the ELF file is the same bit by bit for both platforms,
the ELF header and section layout is somewhat different and unfortunatelly there seems to be no way around this
(at minimum, the kernel checks the ELF architecture byte and won't load the program unless it matches).</p>
<p>So anyway, how does it work?</p>
<p><img src="https://vojtechkral.github.io/blag/polyglot-assembly/diagram.png#right" alt="diagram"></p>
<p>The basic idea is pretty simple: The code starts with a magical snippet
that gets interpreted by both architectures and basically performs
a conditional jump based on which architecture is runing the code.</p>
<p><em>Architecture #1</em> decodes this bit as a an effective no-op instruction
(in my example it's actually an ALU instruction whose output is ignored)
and simply continues to the area marked blue in the diagram.
<em>Arch-#1</em>-specific code is stored there.</p>
<p><em>Architecture #2</em> decodes the initial part as a jump and proceeds
to jump over to the yellow area where the code for <em>arch #2</em> follows.</p>
<p>How do you come up with the magical architecture-selecting prolog?</p>
<p>It turns out x86 is actually a pretty good choice for <em>arch #2</em>, because it has
a short near-jump instruction, just 2 bytes. Together with 2 <code>NOP</code>s (1 byte each)
this makes up the length of one regular (non-Thumb) ARM instruction.</p>
<p>The three x86 instructions, a <code>JMP</code> and two <code>NOP</code>s, can be arbitrarily reordered
and also the jump distance can be adjusted, and as I found out this is
enough degrees of freedom to find a valid nop-like ARM instruction.</p>
<h2 id="searching-the-instruction-space">Searching the instruction space</h2>
<p>The original Solaris code was a result of basically just hokus-pokus.
In the Linux rewrite I tried to come up with a somewhat more automated way of finding the right combo.
There's a hackish <a href="https://github.com/vojtechkral/asm-polyglot/blob/master/jmps.py">python script</a>
and a Makefile rule that generate <a href="https://vojtechkral.github.io/blag/polyglot-assembly/jmps.txt">a big plaintext list</a> of all <code>NOP</code>/<code>NOP</code>/2-byte <code>JMP</code>
permutations along with their ARM representations.</p>
<p>From the list it's apparent that the <code>JMP</code>, <code>NOP</code>, <code>NOP</code> ordering yields a safe
ARM <code>addsls</code> instruction most of the time, at least as long as the jump distance is small enough
for the <code>addsls</code> to not touch the <code>sp</code> or <code>pc</code> registers...</p>
<p>In my case I only need to <code>JMP</code> 52 bytes ahead. This results in <code>addsls r3, r0, r11, ror #5</code> on ARM,
which is a perfectly harmless instruction. Maybe a bit too complex (a conditional add with a bit rotation), but harmless.</p>
<p>In summary, the magical bytes that make an x86 CPU jump ahead and
an ARM CPU continue are:</p>
<pre><span>eb 32 90 90
</span></pre><h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>
<p>The source code for this mini-project can be found <a href="https://github.com/vojtechkral/asm-polyglot">on my github</a>.</p>
<p>The C file quoted above effectively contains the following two code paths for x86-64 and ARM, respectively:</p>

<p>I decided to automate the whole process of generating the C file and the binaries for x86-64 and ARM.
There's a big <code>Makefile</code> that goes through the arduous process of first generating ARM code from the source ARM asm file,
dumping the compiled ARM, feeding that to a Python script with a template of the x86 + compiled ARM code,
compiling that, generating the C source from that, and finally compiling the C source for both x86 and ARM.</p>
<p>Running the Makefile requires having an arm cross-compiling gcc installed along with a matching gdb.</p>
<h2 id="practical-applications">Practical applications</h2>
<p>There are none :-)</p>
<p>At least as far as I know.
As stated earlier, the resulting binary is still platform-specific,
Which means the trick can't be used to make multi-platform ELFs :-|</p>
<p>In theory it could be used to create a multi-platform shellcode,
but I find it unlikely that it would actually be useful in practice.</p>
<p>Multi-platform kernels maybe? But then again boot procedures differ quite a lot
between architectures, so again it's probably not very practical...</p>
<p>So yeah, it's really just a joke done for fun and to perhaps learn something new...</p>

        <p>Knowing how to use containers in application development is a must for a modern-day developer. One reason for the recent demand for containers has been the emergence of Docker. Docker has not only increased the use of containers, it has had a great impact on the way we approach application development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a developer who is yet to find a proper introduction to this popular technology, you are in the right place. In this article, we are going to introduce you to the concept of Docker and get a hands-on approach to learning Docker by dockerizing a simple application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, let’s clarify what Docker is and why it has become this important.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-docker">What is Docker?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Docker is a tool developers use to create, deploy, and run applications in an isolated environment through containers.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is again, containers. Though this term is used a few times since the beginning of the article, you may not have an idea what a container is. In order to fully understand the above statement, we have to first understand what a container is.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-a-container-and-why-do-we-need-it">What is a Container and Why Do We Need It?</h2>
<p>A container is a software unit that packs application code and all the dependencies used in the application into a single package. Packaging allows the container to isolate the application from the host environment it is running in. The application sees the container as its environment instead of the host device. This abstraction guarantees that an application running in a development environment is able to run in a production environment without going through significant changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if several applications are running on the host device, the container isolates the containerized application from interfering with the operation of other applications and sharing their resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before containers, virtual machines were used to isolate applications from the host environment. In virtual machines, each machine uses a separate operating system to run the application. Though this approach also achieves the purpose of isolating the applications, it has a downside of adding too much overhead on top of the application. Containers, on the other hand, share the OS kernel of the host device instead of using an OS of its own, which removes the overhead added by the virtual machines. This makes containers more lightweight and resource-efficient compared to virtual machines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though containers have been in use long before Docker, it’s safe to say that Docker is the biggest reason for the extreme popularity of containers in the modern programming world. Other than being open-source, Docker’s ease of use, reliability, and efficiency made the programming world instantly fall in love with this technology.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-are-the-dockerfile-docker-image-and-docker-engine">What are the Dockerfile, Docker Image, and Docker Engine?</h2>
<p>Docker comes with its special language. Dockerfile, Docker image, and Docker engine are 3 words commonly used among Docker users. These are also the 3 most important components used when building Docker containers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h3>
<p>Dockerfile contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image, which we are going to discuss next. These instructions will be run one after the other when creating the Docker image. Instructions in the Dockerfile contain information such as the host device’s OS, the programming language of the application, application directory location, network ports, and environment variables.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h3>
<p>Docker image is a template that is used to create the final Docker container for the application. We can generate the Docker image of an application by running the docker build command with the Dockerfile as a parameter. To create the Docker container, we use the docker run command and the Docker image.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="docker-engine">Docker Engine</h3>
<p>Docker engine is where all the Docker containers are running on. Both Windows and Linux based applications can run on Docker engines.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-to-dockerize-a-simple-application">How to Dockerize a Simple Application</h2>
<p>Now we have got to the most interesting part of this tutorial. We are going to dockerize a simple application to get hands-on Docker experience. First, we will create a simple Node.js application and then, create the Dockerfile, Docker image, and finally the Docker container for the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before continuing, however, make sure you have Docker installed on your device. You can follow the official documentation to install Docker on your <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/">Windows</a> or <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">Ubuntu OS</a>. Check out the docs for other OS.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-simple-nodejs-application">Create a Simple Node.js Application</h3>
<p>We are going to create a simple Node application that sends a “Hello World” message when we visit the root route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to set up your application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">npm init
npm install express --save
</code></pre></div><p>Inside the directory, <code>app.js</code> file contains our main application code.&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>express</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>require</span>(<span>'express'</span>)
<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>app</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>express</span>()
&nbsp;
<span>app</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>'/'</span>,&nbsp;(<span>req</span>,&nbsp;<span>res</span>)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>res</span>.<span>send</span>(<span>"Hello&nbsp;World!"</span>)
})
&nbsp;
<span>app</span>.<span>listen</span>(<span>process</span>.<span>env</span>.<span>PORT</span>,&nbsp;()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"Node&nbsp;server&nbsp;has&nbsp;started&nbsp;running"</span>)
})
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="create-the-dockerfile-for-the-application">Create the Dockerfile for the Application</h3>
<p>Now we can create the Dockerfile with the information that is needed to create the Docker image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a file named <code>Dockerfile</code> inside the application directory. To create the Docker Image for our application, the Dockerfile should contain a set of commands like this.&nbsp;</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span>FROM</span><span> node:latest</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>WORKDIR</span><span> /docker-tutorial</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> . .<span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>ENV</span> PORT <span>3000</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>RUN</span> npm install<span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>EXPOSE</span><span> $PORT</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>ENTRYPOINT</span> [<span>"node"</span>, <span>"app.js"</span>]<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now we will go through what each of these commands means.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>FROM—This command sets the base image and the new image of the application is built on top of this. In our case, we use an image that contains npm and the latest Node.js version. This image is pulled from Docker Hub which is a public repository of Docker images.&nbsp;</li>
<li>WORKDIR—This command sets the working directory for the application that will be running inside the container.&nbsp;</li>
<li>COPY—This command copies the files in the application directory to the working directory which we set with the previous command. You can pass the path to a specific file name or do as above to copy all the files in the application directory to the Docker image. In the latter case, make sure you have navigated to the application directory on the command line when running the docker build command.</li>
<li>ENV—In the Node application, note how we passed the environment variable, PORT (process.env.PORT), to the app.listen function instead of directly passing the port number the application should listen to. Therefore, we have to set the PORT environment variable in the application environment. For our application that is going to the Docker container. So, we use the ENV command to pass the variables that we want to set as environment variables inside the Docker container.&nbsp;</li>
<li>RUN—This command runs npm install to install the dependencies used in our application, which are saved to package.json file.&nbsp;</li>
<li>EXPOSE—This command exposes the application to listen to the given port. Since we have already set the port number as an environment variable, we pass the variable name, $PORT, &nbsp;in place of the actual port number. However, remember that the application is exposed to the port 3000 inside the container’s environment and not the host device’s environment.&nbsp;</li>
<li>ENTRYPOINT—This command sets how to enter, or how to start, our application. Docker joins the array we pass to create a single command that starts the application, which is node app.js.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="build-the-docker-image">Build the Docker Image</h3>
<p>We use docker build command to build the Docker image from the Dockerfile. Here is how it works:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">docker build -t &lt;image-name&gt; &lt;dockerfile-location&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure you have navigated to the application directory on your command-line before running the command. You can pass a dot (.) in place of the Dockerfile location to indicate that the Dockerfile is in the current directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For our example we will run:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">docker build -t docker-tutorial .
</code></pre></div><p>Output:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.008MB

      <section>
        <p>Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS was created by <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com/">Dave Liepmann</a> and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from <a href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/">Tufte-<span>L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span></a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format</a>. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.</p>
        <p>If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. Please note the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css#contributing">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say “websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte’s books” but rather “here are some techniques Tufte developed that we’ve found useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web”. Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design goal, because any project should present their information as best suits their particular circumstances.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To use Tufte CSS, copy <code>tufte.css</code> and the <code>et-book</code> directory of font files to your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document’s <code>head</code> block:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3 id="fundamentals--sections-and-headers">Sections and Headings</h3>
        <p>Organize your document with an <code>article</code> element inside your <code>body</code> tag. Inside that, use <code>section</code> tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS uses <code>h1</code> for the document title, <code>p</code> with class <code>subtitle</code> for the document subtitle, <code>h2</code> for section headings, and <code>h3</code> for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
          <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct HTML using <code>blockquote</code> and <code>footer</code> elements. See page 20 of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> for an example in print.</p>
        <p><span>In his later books<label for="sn-in-his-later-books"></label></span><span><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be"><em>Beautiful Evidence</em></a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <code>newthought</code>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical spacing is accomplished separately through <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags. Be consistent: though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the <code>newthought</code> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>

        <h3 id="fundamentals--text">Text</h3>
        <p>Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS uses <code>#fffff8</code> and <code>#111111</code> because they are nearly indistinguishable from their ‘pure’ cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and images.</p>
        <p>In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo<label for="sn-proprietary-monotype-bembo"></label><span>See Tufte’s comment in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte book fonts</a> thread.</span> font. A similar effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book">ETBook</a>, which Tufte CSS supplies with a <code>@font-face</code> reference to a .ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn’t work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.</p>
        <p>Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform the text. This is typographic best practice.</p>
        <p>If you prefer sans-serifs, use the <code>sans</code> class. It relies on Gill Sans, Tufte’s sans-serif font of choice.</p>
        <p>Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover or when clicked. Here is a <a href="#">dummy example</a> that goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable text. <label for="mn-blue-links">⊕</label><span>Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of underlining.</span> However, because most browsers’ default underlining does not clear descenders and is so thick and distracting, the underline effect is instead achieved using CSS trickery involving background gradients instead of standard <code>text-decoration</code>. Credit goes to Adam Schwartz for that technique.</p>
        <p>As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides by default. Other approaches can also be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web users.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="epigraphs">Epigraphs</h2>
        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>), these are <code>blockquote</code> elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a <code>footer</code> element inside the <code>blockquote</code>. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper class.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes</h2>
        <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"></label><span>This is a sidenote.</span> Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations <em>as close as possible</em> to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle"/&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>You must manually assign a reference <code>id</code> to each side or margin note, replacing “sn-demo” in the <code>for</code> and the <code>id</code> attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like <code>sn-</code> for sidenotes and <code>mn-</code> for margin notes.</p>
        <p>Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a <code>span</code> with class <code>sidenote</code>. This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.</p>
        <p>If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin note.
          <label for="mn-demo">⊕</label>
          
          <span>
            This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
          </span> On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol ⊕ (<code>&amp;#8853;</code>), but it’s up to you.</p>
        <p>Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the <code>marginnote</code> class for the content and the <code>margin-toggle</code> class for the label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous paragraph:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"&gt;&amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/&gt;
&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;
  This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    <p>Previous: Part 9 - <a href="https://techplanet.today/post/machine-learning-foundations-part-9-using-the-sequencing-apis" rel="nofollow noopener">Using the Sequencing APIs</a></p>
<p>Over the last few parts, we haven't done much machine learning. Instead, we looked at how you can preprocess text data to get it ready for training machine learning models. In this part, you're going to put that knowledge to use in training a text classifier, a model, which, when given a piece of text, will understand the contents of that text.</p>
<p>You'll be working with the Sarcasm in News Headlines data set by Rishabh Misra, which is available on his website <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection/home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. This is a really fun data set, which collects news headlines from normal news sources, as well as some more comedic ones from spoof news sites.</p>
<p>The data set is a JSON file with three columns. The <code>is_sarcastic</code> one is 1 if the record is sarcastic. Otherwise, it's 0. The <code>headline</code> is the headline of the article, and the <code>article_link</code> is a URL to the text of the article. We're just going to deal with the headlines here. So we have a super easy data set to work with. The headline is our feature, and the <code>is_sarcastic</code> is our label.</p>
<p>The data in JSON looks a bit like this.</p>
<pre>{
    "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/versace-black-code_us_5861fbefe4b0de3a08f600d5",
    "headline": "former versace store clerk sues over secret 'black code' for minority shoppers",
    "is_sarcastic": 0
}</pre>
<p>Each entry is a JSON field with the name-value pairs showing the column and associated data.</p>
<p>Here's the code to load it in Python when it's structured like that.</p>
<pre>import json

with open("sarcasm.json", 'r') as f:
    datastore = json.load(f)<br>
sentences = [] 
labels = []
urls = []
for item in datastore:
    sentences.append(item['headline'])
    labels.append(item['is_sarcastic'])
    urls.append(item['article_link'])</pre>
<p>I'll go through this piece by piece. First, we'll <code>import json</code> so that we can use the json parsers in Python. Then we'll open the <code>sarcasm.json</code> file.&nbsp; Using <code>json.load()</code>, we can load and parse the entire thing. I'll initialize arrays for the sentences, labels, and URLs. And I can now simply iterate through the datastore. And, for each item, I can append its headline, the sarcasm label, and URL to the appropriate array.</p>
<p>And that's it for loading the data. In previous parts, you may recall that we had hard-coded sentences into an array of strings. We now have exactly the same data structure for the headline sentences, despite that there are now over 25,000 of them. So, for the next code, despite us using this real data set, it will look very familiar. So let's dive in.</p>
<p>So here's the code to tokenize and sequence the sarcasm data set.</p>
<pre>from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
tokenizer = Tokenizer(oov_token="")
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)
word_index = tokenizer.word_index<br>
print(len(word_index))
print(word_index)<br>
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences)
padded = pad_sequences(sequences, padding='post')<br>
print(padded[0])
print(padded.shape)</pre>
<p>We create a tokenizer and fit it on the sentences. In this case, the sentences are the large array of 25,000-plus sentences that we read from the sarcasm data set. We can use the tokenizer to show us the <code>word_index</code> so we can see what words it learned from the data set.&nbsp;And here's an example of some of the words.</p>
<pre>... 'blowing': 4064, 'packed': 4065, 'deficit': 4066, 'essential': 4067, 'explaining': 4068, 'pollution': 4069, 'braces': 4070, 'protester': 4071, 'uncle': 4072 ...</pre>
<p>Remember from earlier that the words with the lower number tokens are the ones that are more common, and the ones with the higher numbers, was less commonly used in the data set. So, of all of the words here, hurting is the one that was found most often.</p>
<p>We can now turn all of our sentences into sequences where, instead of words, we have the tokens representing those words. We'll pad them post, which means that all of the sentences will be the length of whatever the longest one is. And anything shorter than that will be padded with zeros at the end of the sentences in order to keep them all the same length. If we want to inspect them, we can then print out one of them, and we can print out the shape of the entire padded data structure. You'll see output like this.</p>
<pre>[  308 15115   679  3337  2298    48   382  2576 15116     6  2577  8434
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0]<p>(26709, 40)</p></pre>
<p>This is the first sentence in our corpus after tokenizing and padding. It's a shorter sentence. So it ends with a bunch of zeros. And this is the shape of the data structure for the padding. This tells us that we have 26,709 padded sentences, and each of these is 40 values long.</p>
<p>With just a few lines of code, you've loaded the data from sarcasm into sentence arrays, tokenized, and padded them.</p>
<p>First, in the code, you'll see a number of commonly used variables. Each of these will be used throughout the code. You've seen many of them so far, but others, like the embedding dimension, will be clear later. The <code>training_size</code> of 20,000 will be used next.</p>
<pre>vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 16
max_length = 100
trunc_type='post'
padding_type='post'
oov_tok = ""
training_size = 20000</pre>
<p>We have a corpus of many thousands of sentences and labels. And, moments ago, we specified 20,000 as the <code>training_size</code>. So that many sentences and labels will be the training set. And we'll hold back the other 6,000 or so as a validation set.</p>
<p>So our <code>training_sentences</code> will be the complete corpus from 0 to the <code>training_size</code>. And our <code>testing_sentences</code> will be from the <code>training_size</code> to the end of the set. We can do similar with the labels. The training will be the first batch, and the testing will be the last ones.</p>
<pre>training_sentences = sentences[0:training_size]
testing_sentences = sentences[training_size:]
training_labels = labels[0:training_size]
testing_labels = labels[training_size:]</pre>
<p>As we've split the data into training and testing sets, we should do the same for the padded sets, instead of having that one large master one that we had earlier on.</p>
<pre>tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=vocab_size, oov_token=oov_tok)
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(training_sentences)

word_index = tokenizer.word_index

training_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(training_sentences)
training_padded = pad_sequences(training_sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding=padding_type, truncating=trunc_type)

testing_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(testing_sentences)
testing_padded = pad_sequences(testing_sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding=padding_type, truncating=trunc_type)</pre>
<p>First, we'll create a tokenizer, and we'll specify the number of words that we want and what the out-of-vocabulary token should be. We'll fit the tokenizer to just the training_sentence corpus. This will help us accurately reflect any real-world usage. Our testing_sentences can be tested against the vocab that was learned from the training set. Now we can create a set of <code>training_sequences</code> from just the <code>training_sentences</code>. And we can pad these to get a set of padded training sentences. And then we can just do the same thing for the <code>testing_sentences</code> and for all the labels.</p>
<p>So before we can train a model with this, let's take a look at the concept of embeddings, which help us turn the sentiment of a word into a number in much the same way as we tokenized words earlier. In this case, an embedding is a vector pointing in a direction, and we can use those directions to establish meanings in words. I know this is all very vague. So let me explain it visually.</p>
<p>For example, consider the words <strong>bad</strong> and <strong>good</strong>. Now we know they have opposite meanings. So we could draw them as arrows pointing in opposite directions.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f49f02367.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f49f02367.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="826" height="91"> We could then describe the word <strong>meh</strong> as being sort of bad, but not really that bad. So it might be an arrow like this. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f4c9ea586.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f4c9ea586.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="797" height="349">And then the phrase not bad, it's not as strong as good, but it's more or less in the same direction as good. So we could draw it with an arrow like this.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f501a791f.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f501a791f.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="800" height="343"> If we then plot these on a chart, we could then get coordinates for these arrows. These coordinates could then be seen as embeddings for the sentiment of those words. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f5343248c.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f5343248c.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="969" height="491">There's no absolute meaning, but, relative to each other, we can establish sentiment.</p>
<p>To do this in code, we can simply use a Keras layer called an Embedding.</p>
<pre>model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(24, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',optimizer='adam',metrics=['accuracy'])</pre>
<p>Our Embedding should be defined as a vector for every word. So we're going to take vocab-sized words and then specify how many dimensions we want the arrow direction to use.&nbsp; In this case, it's 16 that we created earlier. So the Embedding layer will learn 10,016 dimension vectors where the direction of the vector establishes the sentiment of the word. By matching the words to the labels, it'll have a direction that it can then start learning from.</p>
<p>Once we've defined the model, we can then train it like this.</p>
<pre>num_epochs = 30
history = model.fit(training_padded, training_labels, epochs=num_epochs, validation_data=(testing_padded, testing_labels), verbose=2)</pre>
<p>We simply specify the training_padded features and labels, as well as the validation ones.</p>
<p>Now you can try it for yourself. Here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gle%2F3d6sIJY&amp;redir_token=ONe-_plC_prURgXQYxiQIX-HJVJ8MTU5MzE4OTQ0OEAxNTkzMTAzMDQ4&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=-8XmD2zsFBI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">URL</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully that was an interesting exploration for you into the beginnings of NLP with TensorFlow. And that brings us to the end of this 10-part series on foundations of machine learning. I hope you've enjoyed these series, and I hope you've been able to learn from them.</p>

<p>But there was one fad I remember that not only took our school by storm, but schools all across the country as well. It grew so feverish that after a few months, schools had to actually ban this activity because too many students were getting obsessed with it.</p>
<p>If you were an ‘80s or ‘90s kid, chances are you’ll remember it too.</p>
<p>I’m referring to the infamous world of pogs:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>For those that didn’t get to experience this craze, I’ll briefly break it down for you.</p>
<p>Pogs were these thin, circular discs that were largely made from one of three materials: paper, aluminum, or plastic.<span title="Some kids had crazy titanium ones, but for those of us that weren’t born into extreme wealth, it wasn’t an option.">1</span> Each pog had a “face” side that had some sort of cool, colorful design on it, and a “back” side that was left blank.</p>

<p>The game itself was super simple, which made it ideal for 2nd graders across the world.</p>
<p>Each round, the players would contribute a few paper pogs, put them face down, and stack them up into one long cylinder. This is the “ante,” or the prize that the players are looking to win.</p>
<p>Then using a special, denser pog that was either made from aluminum or plastic (known as a “slammer” and “pounder,” respectively), each player would try to slam it on the stack, and flip over as many paper pogs as possible. Whichever pogs are successfully turned over would be the prizes they win.</p>

<p>That’s the whole game in a nutshell. Essentially, it’s slapping dense discs onto a stack of lesser dense discs, hoping to turn over as much of them as possible before the recess bell rings. Seems pretty harmless, right?</p>
<p>Well… there was one component to the game that made it a bit problematic for child psychology.</p>
<p>Before any game starts, you have to declare whether you’re playing “for fun” or “for keeps.” “For fun” means that you’re not actually keeping the pogs you turn over, and are returning them back to their original owners at the end of each match. “For keeps,” of course, means that you now own the pogs you turn over successfully, meaning that someone must lose something if another person wins.</p>
<p>Basically, a nice little gambling ring was growing amongst us starry-eyed 2nd graders.</p>

<p>Pogs originally started off as a little recess activity, but began morphing into something far greater.</p>
<p>Kids began comparing each other to how many pogs they had, and started forming groups based on the types of pogs that were owned and won. The kids with gold-plated, shiny pounders kept winning, so they needed to up the stakes and play for higher prizes. The kids that only had paper discs would be off in the sandbox being peasants.</p>
<p>Pogs became the shared currency of the school. Kids were trading their fruit rollups for slammers, their Lunchables for pounders. Kids were literally getting into fist fights over them. And of course, if you didn’t play pogs at all, you might as well be an invisible node of society. All that mattered was how many of them you had, and if you had the right equipment to win even more.</p>

<p>Eventually, the school staff saw enough crazed, disc-slamming kids in the hallways and put an end to the whole thing. They justified the ban by saying it was a form of gambling, but they probably just wanted to see things come back to normal for a bit.</p>
<p>The irony, of course, was that those adults were playing a very similar game in their own lives as well.</p>
<p>It’s interesting how money is accepted as an inevitable force in our lives, yet when we take out the concept and wrap it in unfamiliar packaging, it seems weird and dumb.</p>
<p>To the school staff, the whole pogs phenomenon probably seemed silly because they couldn’t understand what could be so compelling about flipping over paper and metal discs. But they wouldn’t think twice at the thought of coming into an office everyday, flipping over documents, and depositing a bi-weekly paper check in a metal machine.</p>
<p>In essence, the kids were doing the same thing the adults were doing: they were accumulating value in the form of a communal good. But because it took the form of something unrecognizable, it was considered dumb rather than profound. In the eyes of the adults, pogs were shittily constructed paper discs that had no intrinsic value, and only held importance because the kids themselves thought they were.</p>
<p>Well, those kids could say the same thing about the way we regard our own currency as well.</p>

<p>The most fascinating thing about the pogs phenomenon is how closely it mirrors the story of money, and how that concept naturally manifested in children.</p>
<p>On one side you have paper, aluminum, and plastic discs that have no inherent value – they can’t be eaten, worn, or slept on. On their own, they’re useless.</p>
<p>On the other side you have paper bills, metal coins, and digits on a screen that can’t be used as ends in themselves either. They’re just as useless.</p>
<p>Yet in both scenarios, a united story emerged that turned an intrinsically useless thing into the distributor of status, value, and prestige.</p>
<p>How in the world does this happen?</p>
<p>How does something with no intrinsic value become the universal determinant of value? And what are the implications this has on human behavior as a whole?</p>
<p>Discussions of money usually come with the implicit understanding that money is valuable, so they revolve around how one could accumulate more of it, or why it introduces <a href="https://moretothat.com/money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all kinds of strange behaviors</a>. But in this post, we’re going to take one step back and actually look at the concept of money itself: why we need it to represent value, how it impacts our goals, and how it reconstructs our idea of individuality.</p>
<p>This is a dive into the philosophy of money. It’s a look into humanity’s greatest idea, its greatest paradox, and the story that forever changed human behavior.</p>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<h3>Money and The Great Abstraction</h3>
<p>Everything starts with the fact that money has no intrinsic value.</p>
<p>I’m going to explain why this is, but in order to do so, I need to first introduce my favorite game show ever:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>The Price Is Right is a brilliant TV show where hyped-up contestants play a series of pricing estimation games. Essentially, whoever can guess the price of random shit better than the next person will find their way to a final showcase, where they can win a combination of a potted plant, a trip to Detroit, and a brand… new…. CAR!!!</p>

<p>One of my favorite mini-games on the show was the Bonus Game, where the contestant must guess whether or not the real price of an item is higher or lower than what is displayed to the public.</p>
<p>And the best part?</p>
<p>The audience also gets to chime in and scream their opinions at the contestant, who then has to sort through a blend of aggressive commands to get to her final answer.</p>
<p>Here’s an amazing clip of the game in action:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/429124077" width="650" height="406" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>First off, Bob Barker had jokes for days.</p>
<p>But second, and more important:</p>
<p>This game is a perfect example of the discrepancy between subjective value and objective reality.</p>
<p>When people in the audience are <em>screaming</em> their opinions of what the price of an alarm clock is, what they are doing is making a <span><strong>value assessment</strong></span> about the object in question. Each person’s idea of that clock’s value is anchored to a personal experience one has with that item, and that could be based on a host of factors.</p>
<p><em>Am I using that alarm clock now? If not, how much is the one I’m currently using? Does that featured clock look like it’d be of better quality? Wait… why do I even care about this damn clock in the first place?</em></p>
<p>From the contestant’s point of view, the audience members sound like this:</p>

<p>Throughout all this, however, the clock simply exists. It is a collection of atoms and molecules that have been assembled to take this form, and there’s no value that is inherent in its chemical makeup. The only function it has is the one we assign it. We would primarily use it to wake up in the morning, but if there was a scary cockroach nearby that we wanted to get rid of, we could use the clock as an anvil too.</p>
<p>This creates a scenario where reality simply is, but the value we assign it will vary based upon the individual that interacts with it. And as illustrated in The Price Is Right, that value is spread across <span><strong>a spectrum of infinite wants and experiences</strong></span>, where one person would be willing to give up more than her neighbor, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For any one item of reality, there will be all kinds of value assessments attached to it, none of which are expected to be the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>So we need to form an intermediary between reality and value that could bridge the gap between the two. A way to standardize infinite value assessments into something understandable and transferable.</p>
<p>That third-party, of course, is money.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>Money’s greatest achievement is its ability to standardize value across otherwise incomparable realities. For example, there’s no way I could tell you how many clocks I’d give for your car, or how many clocks I’d give for your house. But communicate those objects of desire through the language of money, and I’ll be able to calculate some relationship between the two.</p>
<p>This ability to create value relationships between every object or service is what allowed money to build a web through every corner of life. Before money, goods stood on their own because they were simply bartered for another object of desire. But after money, the value of goods were always calculated based on a third-party: some currency that was agreed upon by all the members of that society.</p>
<p>The question here then becomes: <em>how was that currency determined?</em></p>
<p>In money’s early history, it needed to have some sort of value inherent in it for people to trust it as an intermediary.</p>
<p>Its first iteration appeared in Sumer around 3,000 BC, where it manifested in the …</p></div></div>

			<section>
				<p>Laura Deming is a biologist and founder of The Longevity Fund, the first VC firm to focus on companies that work on extending healthy human lifespan and addressing age-related diseases through biotechnology. She grew her roots in biology as a homeschooling student in New Zealand, and moved to the US to work in a <a href="https://hillblomcenter.ucsf.edu/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20Hillblom,diseases%20have%20similar%20molecular%20causes.">UCSF biology lab</a> at age 12. By age 14, she was a student at MIT, then became a <a href="https://thielfellowship.org/">Thiel Fellow</a>. We asked Laura to share how her education prepared her to lead and build today.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/2020/06/Frame-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Frame-2.png 600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Frame-2.png 1000w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Frame-2.png 1600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1754/2020/06/Frame-2.png 1754w"><figcaption>Laura Deming. Illustration by <a href="https://www.ne-oh.com/">Annie Oh</a>.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="what-are-you-working-on-and-thinking-about-this-week">What are you working on and thinking about this week?</h3><p>How long do you have? I normally have a few key focuses at work (right now, immune aging from a bunch of different angles), and then a billion other small ideas that float in and out of my cranium. My most persistent focus is something that I can’t talk about yet because it would sound slightly insane, but right now, I’m pursuing these more coherent questions: &nbsp;<br></p><ol><li>Is there a flywheel effect with biological tools? Will biological discoveries become the tools for next-generation discovery? How might we predict progress in biology?</li><li>Why does it normally take about a year for the best proto-entrepreneurs I know to reach full conviction about starting a company? What are ways to accelerate that process?</li><li>Is there an immortal cell that doesn’t replicate anywhere on earth? (We presumably wouldn’t see it if there was.)</li></ol><p>I’m really obsessed with <a href="http://book.bionumbers.org/">Cell Biology by the Numbers</a>. I think quantitative intuitive models of biology are the best thing ever. Also <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/video/nima-arkani-hamed-morality-fundamental-physics">this Nima Arkani-Hamed</a> video is literally the best thing ever.</p><h3 id="what-was-your-education-like">What was your education like?</h3><p>I grew up homeschooled in NZ with a hilariously small amount of context for what the real world was like. In retrospect, it was totally ideal. I had two strong memes deeply implanted in my cranium early in life - <em>I love science </em>and <em>it’s my job to do something really important </em>and<em> I can do it, too. </em>I have no clue who I’d be without those memes, and I’m also not sure that the latter was actually true! My dad just always told me that I was exceptional and could work out a way whatever I wanted to do in the world and I believed him. I still do, in a funny way, despite about a decade of evidence to the contrary and realizing how actually hard it is to make drugs for complex diseases. It’s extraordinarily sad how many otherwise brilliant kids might not do things they could because they don’t have a similarly supportive environment — I’m really excited for things like <a href="https://dcgross.com/">Daniel Gross</a>’s <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> for that reason. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/2020/06/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/image.png 600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/image.png 1000w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/image.png 1600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w2000/2020/06/image.png 2000w"><figcaption>Laura as a child, drawing DNA on the pavement outside of her house in chalk, an anecdote from a talk that she gave for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwslKJut8eM">TedxYouth@Tallinn</a>. Illustration by <a href="https://www.ne-oh.com/">Annie Oh</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>I feel like it was a lot of puzzle solving and doing obvious stuff. And then starting to think more independently in college, and to try to figure out what problems I wanted to work on. But I had this moment around that time where a friend and I were driving to a camping site, and I was trying to explain a math concept to him, and he abruptly turned to me and said “I’m feeling very frustrated right now because you honestly have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.”<em> </em></p><p>It’s really hard to explain without context how actually useful that comment was. As he explained it, I was just parroting off the definition of something. The real way to understand things is to be able to see, explore, feel the concept from a bunch of different angles, and to be able to rigorously prove things about it. I still struggle with the latter, but having an intuition for what <em>real, deep </em>understanding of a concept looks like has been a great guidepost. For example, I realized I didn’t understand what entropy was, and now kind of do, after a summer of being in near tears with frustration about it. </p><h3 id="where-and-when-did-your-mission-to-improve-longevity-originate">Where and when did your mission to improve longevity originate?</h3><p>It’s funny, because I get asked that question a lot. I think of it like this: if you were to watch a million people jump off a bridge every day and just suffer in a really extreme way throughout all of it, How would we respond as a society? An overwhelming number of people would be inspired to take action and help. When you think of it in acute, immediate terms, viscerally shocking and moving. But with longevity and other deeply existential problems, the horror of what’s happening has been tragically normalized.</p><p>I really just wanted to work on the biggest problem possible. At first I thought that was cancer, but after a variety of experiences, aging just seemed like a bigger deal.</p><p>I have a much less antagonistic relationship with death now than I did when I was a kid. I understand more that we are a species, that there’s something beyond us as individuals — but despite that, I absolutely cannot square the idea of sobbing when a relative gets cancer and then being totally fine with another debilitating degenerative disease also caused by aging that we somehow have collectively decided is natural and normal.</p><h3 id="how-has-the-way-you-learned-as-a-kid-shaped-the-way-you-learn-and-make-decisions-at-the-helm-of-the-longevity-fund">How has the way you learned as a kid shaped the way you learn and make decisions at the helm of The Longevity Fund?</h3><p>I’ve had to un-learn a bunch of stuff I learned when I first came to the professional world. As a kid, I was deeply joyous about science. I loved it directly and with a passion, and I absolutely believed I was going to grow up to be like Michael Faraday (his story about <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/people-of-science-michael-faraday-the-royal-society/HQLyLIo6MWpoKw?hl=en">getting an apprenticeship with Humphrey Davy</a> is amazing, by the way). When I entered the world of finance with my fund, I was totally scared to seem like I didn’t know what I was doing, and I felt like it was really important to hide who I was to seem more ‘adult’. Now, in retrospect, I think that was both understandable and a bit of a mistake.</p><p>One thing I learned as a kid that I keep on forgetting so easily is how not to care about what anyone else thinks (with a few close exceptions). It’s funny - even in Silicon Valley, hypothetically the vanguard of independent thought, I feel like that’s extremely hard to do. In part, because what other people think constrains your access to resources. So it’s an interesting balance. </p><h3 id="i-ve-heard-you-talk-about-your-dad-telling-you-at-12-years-old-to-make-sure-that-everyone-was-a-little-bit-happier-because-you-were-in-the-lab-each-day-what-role-did-your-parents-play-in-your-life-and-education">I’ve heard you talk about your dad telling you at 12 years old to make sure that everyone was a little bit happier because you were in the lab each day. What role did your parents play in your life and education?</h3><p>Oh, man. My Dad had so much good advice as a kid — I really felt like I got a cheat code to life early on. It was like being Ben Franklin’s daughter or something. I’m probably exaggerating, but it felt that way. </p><p>One thing he told me was ‘action comes before motivation’ - that’s always been an incredibly powerful thing in my life. He taught me a lot about putting your head down and working hard and not believing anyone who tells you you are great, having that come mostly from your own self-judgment. Being extremely humble around people who know more, finding any way on earth to help them. </p><p>My dad also taught me a lot about humor and how ridiculous the world was in so many different ways. Almost too much - I think I take things more seriously now. But it’s kind of the Mark Twain effect - the world and everyone in it is a hilarious, self-sabotaging, foolhardy place that is also one of the most deeply joyous and interesting things going on in the galaxy. He used to say you can either look at what’s going on in the world and cry or laugh. Why not pick the latter?</p><p>My mom taught me about kindness and empathy and wanting to help others. She’s probably the most giving person I know. </p><p>When I first met Cynthia Kenyon, who literally changed my and many other lives – she’s amazing – I had this very extreme mental conceit that I would beg her to scrub floors in her lab and somehow work my way up on the academic ladder. I was 12. She very kindly offered for me to just work in her lab as a normal intern, which was so kind in retrospect. It changed my life, to be taken seriously like that at a young age. </p><h3 id="i-love-how-you-describe-the-way-the-longevity-fund-removes-limits-on-who-can-participate-in-biomedical-entrepreneurship-how-can-we-translate-some-of-what-you-ve-learned-about-diverse-participation-in-science-to-the-way-that-kids-learn">I love how you describe the way The Longevity Fund removes limits on who can participate in biomedical entrepreneurship. How can we translate some of what you’ve learned about diverse participation in science to the way that kids learn?</h3><p>I think there’s something about being absolutely delighted when you meet someone who doesn’t know something. That feeling is the best thing in the world because <em>you get to be the first person to tell them about some incredibly cool natural phenomenon</em>. That’s pretty great. I still remember being a preteen in Cynthia’s lab when Marc McCormick described how SVMs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Support Vector Machines</a>) worked for handwriting recognition in the postal system. He was just so good at explaining things, and that really stuck. Encourage people to own ideas, be skeptical of them, and learn to delight in poking holes in things.<br></p><p>When thinking about diverse participation, it’s funny – before I came to the Valley, I had absolutely no idea that being a girl was in any way a handicap. To me, it was an obvious advantage – in a sea of people who all looked the same way, I’d stick out like a sore thumb! If I could make it, wouldn’t I obviously be an amazing role model? Being in the valley for a while, it kind of wore off, and the more articles I read about how much it sucked to be a girl in science, the more I believed it. I’m not sure what to think about all of that, really. </p><h3 id="what-s-something-you-believe-that-most-people-don-t">What’s something you believe that most people don’t?</h3><p>I can give you a few!</p><ol><li>That we will see the first drug to measurably affect <a href="https://publichealth.wustl.edu/heatlhspan-is-more-important-than-lifespan-so-why-dont-more-people-know-about-it/">human healthspan</a> tested in the next decade, and that this is one of the biggest deals in how we thinking about disease. It’s not just hype and rhetoric.</li><li>That original thinkers are so darn much more rare to find than I thought they’d be growing up. <br></li></ol><hr><p><em>Primer is a new education company whose goal is to help kids engage in limitless learning, starting with homeschoolers. </em><strong>Homeschooled:</strong><em> is a regular series about homeschooling alumni who have gone on to do amazing things.

        <p>Note: This is an old post originally from the documentation of the <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixten">Sixten</a> programming language, that I've touched up and fleshed out. After the time that it was written I've found out about <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">Salsa</a>, a Rust library with very similar goals to my Rock library, which is definitely worth checking out as well!</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Compilers are no longer just black boxes that take a bunch of source files and produce assembly code. We expect them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be incremental, meaning that if we recompile a project after having made a few changes we only recompile what is affected by the changes.</li>
<li>Provide editor tooling, e.g. through a <a href="https://langserver.org/">language server</a>, supporting functionality like going to definition, finding the type of the expression at a specific location, and showing error messages on the fly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what Anders Hejlsberg talks about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSdV1M7n4gQ">his video on modern compiler construction</a> that some of you might have seen.</p>
<p>In this post I will cover how this is achieved in <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixten">Sixten</a> by building the compiler around a query system.</p>
<p>For those of you that don't know, Sixten is an experimental functional programming language created to give the programmer more control over memory layout and boxing than most other high-level languages do. The most recent development of Sixten is being done in the <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixty">Sixty</a> repository, and is completely query-based. Here's a little video giving a taste of what its language server can do, showing type-based completions:</p>

<h2 id="traditional-pipeline-based-compiler-architectures">Traditional pipeline-based compiler architectures</h2>
<p>A traditional compiler pipeline might look a bit like this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a>+-----------+            +-----+                +--------+               +--------+</span>

<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a>+-----------+            +-----+       |        +--------+               +---------</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6"></a>                                       |</span>

<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9"></a>                                       |</span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10"></a>                                       v</span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11"></a>                                  +----------+</span>
<span id="cb1-12"><a href="#cb1-12"></a>                                  |          |</span>
<span id="cb1-13"><a href="#cb1-13"></a>                                  |type table|</span>
<span id="cb1-14"><a href="#cb1-14"></a>                                  |          |</span>
<span id="cb1-15"><a href="#cb1-15"></a>                                  +----------+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are many variations, and often more steps and intermediate representations than in the illustration, but the idea stays the same:</p>
<p>We push source text down a pipeline and run a fixed set of transformations until we finally output assembly code or some other target language. Along the way we often need to read and update some state. For example, we might update a type table during type checking so we can later look up the type of entities that the code refers to.</p>
<p>Traditional compiler pipelines are probably quite familiar to many of us, but how query-based compilers should be architected might not be as well-known. Here I will describe one way to do it.</p>
<h2 id="going-from-pipeline-to-queries">Going from pipeline to queries</h2>
<p>What does it take to get the type of a qualified name, such as <code>"Data.List.map"</code>? In a pipeline-based architecture we would just look it up in the type table. With queries, we have to think differently. Instead of relying on having updated some piece of state, we do it as if it was done from scratch.</p>
<p>As a first iteration, we do it <em>completely</em> from scratch. It might look a little bit like this:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>fetchType ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>fetchType (<span>QualifiedName</span> moduleName name) <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>  fileName <span>&lt;-</span> moduleFileName moduleName</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>  sourceCode <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> fileName</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>  parsedModule <span>&lt;-</span> parseModule sourceCode</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>  resolvedModule <span>&lt;-</span> resolveNames parsedModule</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>  <span>let</span> definition <span>=</span> <span>lookup</span> name resolvedModule</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a>  inferDefinitionType definition</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We first find out what file the name comes from, which might be <code>Data/List.vix</code> for <code>Data.List</code>, then read the contents of the file, parse it, perhaps we do name resolution to find out what the names in the code refer to given what is imported, and last we look up the name-resolved definition and type check it, returning its type.</p>
<p>All this for just for getting the type of an identifier? It seems ridiculous because looking up the type of a name is something we'll do loads of times during the type checking of a module. Luckily we're not done yet.</p>
<p>Let's first refactor the code into smaller functions:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>fetchParsedModule ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>ParsedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>fetchParsedModule moduleName <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a>  fileName <span>&lt;-</span> moduleFileName moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a>  sourceCode <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> fileName</span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a>  parseModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span>fetchResolvedModule ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>ResolvedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a>fetchResolvedModule moduleName <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9"><a href="#cb3-9"></a>  parsedModule <span>&lt;-</span> fetchParsedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-10"><a href="#cb3-10"></a>  resolveNames parsedModule</span>
<span id="cb3-11"><a href="#cb3-11"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-12"><a href="#cb3-12"></a><span>fetchType ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-13"><a href="#cb3-13"></a>fetchType (<span>QualifiedName</span> moduleName name) <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-14"><a href="#cb3-14"></a>  resolvedModule <span>&lt;-</span> fetchResolvedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-15"><a href="#cb3-15"></a>  <span>let</span> definition <span>=</span> <span>lookup</span> name resolvedModule</span>
<span id="cb3-16"><a href="#cb3-16"></a>  inferDefinitionType definition</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that each of the functions do everything from scratch on their own, i.e. they're each doing a (longer and longer) prefix of the work you'd do in a pipeline. I've found this to be a common pattern in my query-based compilers.</p>
<p>One way to make this efficient would be to add a memoisation layer around each function. That way, we do some expensive work the first time we invoke a function with a specific argument, but subsequent calls are cheap as they can return the cached result.</p>
<p>This is essentially what we'll do, but we won't use a separate cache per function, but instead have a central cache, indexed by the query. This functionality is provided by <a href="https://github.com/ollef/rock">Rock</a>, a library that packages up some functionality for creating query-based compilers.</p>
<h2 id="the-rock-library">The Rock library</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ollef/rock">Rock</a> is an experimental library heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/shake">Shake</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/build-systems-la-carte/">Build systems à la carte paper</a>. It essentially implements a build system framework, like <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>Build systems have a lot in common with modern compilers since we want them to be incremental, i.e. to take advantage of previous build results when building anew with few changes. But there's also a difference: Most build systems don't care about the <em>types</em> of their queries since they work at the level of files and file systems.</p>
<p><em>Build systems à la carte</em> is closer to what we want. There the user writes a bunch of computations, <em>tasks</em>, choosing a suitable type for keys and a type for values. The tasks are formulated assuming they're run in an environment where there is a function <code>fetch</code> of type <code>Key -&gt; Task Value</code>, where <code>Task</code> is a type for describing build system rules, that can be used to fetch the value of a dependency with a specific key. In our above example, the key type might look like this:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Key</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>  <span>=</span> <span>ParsedModuleKey</span> <span>ModuleName</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>ResolvedModuleKey</span> <span>ModuleName</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>TypeKey</span> <span>QualifiedName</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The build system has control over what code runs when we do a <code>fetch</code>, so by varying that it can do fine-grained dependency tracking, memoisation, and incremental updates.</p>
<p><em>Build systems à la carte</em> is also about exploring what kind of build systems we get when we vary what <code>Task</code> is allowed to do, e.g. if it's a <code>Monad</code> or <code>Applicative</code>. In Rock, we're not exploring <em>that</em>, so our <code>Task</code> is a thin layer on top of <code>IO</code>.</p>
<p>A problem that pops up now, however, is that there's no satisfactory type for <code>Value</code>. We want <code>fetch (ParsedModuleKey "Data.List")</code> to return a <code>ParsedModule</code>, while <code>fetch (TypeKey "Data.List.map")</code> should return something of type <code>Type</code>.</p>
<h3 id="indexed-queries">Indexed queries</h3>
<p>Rock allows us to index the key type by the return type of the query. The <code>Key</code> type in our running example becomes the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_type">GADT</a>:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Key</span> a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>  <span>ParsedModuleKey</span><span> ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Key</span> <span>ParsedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a>  <span>ResolvedModuleKey</span><span> ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Key</span> <span>ResolvedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>  <span>TypeKey</span><span> ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Key</span> <span>Type</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>fetch</code> function gets the type <code>forall a. Key a -&gt; Task a</code>, so we get a <code>ParsedModule</code> when we run <code>fetch (ParsedModuleKey "Data.List")</code>, like we wanted, because the return type depends on the key we use.</p>
<p>Now that we know what <code>fetch</code> should look like, it's also worth revealing what the <code>Task</code> type looks like in Rock, more concretely. As mentioned, it's a thin layer around <code>IO</code>, providing a way to <code>fetch</code> <code>key</code>s (like <code>Key</code> above):</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>newtype</span> <span>Task</span> key a <span>=</span> <span>Task</span> {<span> unTask ::</span> <span>ReaderT</span> (<span>Fetch</span> key) <span>IO</span> a }</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>newtype</span> <span>Fetch</span> key <span>=</span> <span>Fetch</span> (<span>forall</span> a<span>.</span> key a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rules of our compiler, i.e. its "Makefile", then becomes the following function, reusing the functions from above:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>rules ::</span> <span>Key</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> a</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>rules key <span>=</span> <span>case</span> key <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>  <span>ParsedModuleKey</span> moduleName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>    fetchParsedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>  <span>ResolvedModuleKey</span> moduleName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a>    fetchResolvedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-9"><a href="#cb7-9"></a>  <span>TypeKey</span> qualifiedName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-10"><a href="#cb7-10"></a>    fetchType qualifiedName</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>
<p>The most basic way to run a <code>Task</code> in Rock is to directly call the <code>rules</code> function when a <code>Task</code> fetches a key. This results in an inefficient build system that recomputes every query from scratch.</p>
<p>But the <code>Rock</code> library lets us layer more functionality onto our <code>rules</code> function, and one thing that we can add is memoisation. If we do that Rock caches the result of each fetched key by storing the key-value pairs of already performed fetches in a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dependent-hashmap">dependent hashmap</a>. This way, we perform each query at most once during a single run of the compiler.</p>
<h3 id="verifying-dependencies-and-reusing-state">Verifying dependencies and reusing state</h3>
<p>Another kind of functionality that can be layered onto the <code>rules</code> function is incremental updates. When it's used, Rock keeps track of what dependencies a task used when it was executed (much like Shake) in a table, i.e. what keys it fetched and what the values were. Using this information it's able to determine when it's safe to reuse the cache <em>from a previous run of the compiler</em> even though there might be changes in other parts of the dependency graph.</p>
<p>This fine-grained dependency tracking also allows reusing the cache when a dependency of a task changes in a way that has no effect. For example, whitespace changes might trigger a re-parse, but since the AST is the same, the cache can be reused in queries that depend on the …</p></article></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>The first time I used <a href="https://asgi.readthedocs.io/">ASGI</a>(<em>Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface</em>) was through <a href="https://github.com/django/channels">Channels</a> 1.0 when ASGI spec was still a draft. It was my first interview project which helped me get my current job at <a href="https://fellow.app/">Fellow</a>. It felt magical at that time how easy it is to add WebSocket functionality to my Django app and handles authentication and other Django related things for me seamlessly.</p>

<p>ASGI specification is now at version 3 at the time of writing and both ASGI and Channels became part of Django Software Foundation. Compared to the draft version, it has matured a lot with added lifecycle calls and better application format, etc. Most excitingly, a healthy and fast-growing community is forming and we are seeing more and more ASGI servers running in production environments. At my company, we are serving a few million requests per day through ASGI running on <a href="https://github.com/django/daphne">Daphne</a>, Netflix’s <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072">Dispatch</a> is based on <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, a popular ASGI web application framework, and apparently, Microsoft is <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/26">using it</a> too.</p>

<p>I would humbly advise anyone building web services in Python to learn about ASGI. And the best way to learn something is to built things with it, so in this blog post, I’ll walk through the steps to build a micro web application framework that speaks ASGI. I hope it can help explain how ASGI works.</p>


<p>Before writing the first line of code, we need to have a basic understanding of what ASGI is and what we are building towards.</p>
<h2 id="how-asgi-works">How ASGI works</h2>
<p>Here’s a simple diagram showing how ASGI works at a high level.</p>
<pre><code>graph TD
	A[Client] --&gt;|HTTP, WebSocket, ...| B(ASGI Server)
	B --&gt; |scope, send, receive| C(ASGI application)
</code></pre>
<p>To put it in simple words, A browser(client), establishes a connection to ASGI server with a certain type of request (HTTP or WebSocket), the ASGI server then calls ASGI  application with information about the connection, encapsulated in a python dictionary called <code>scope</code>, and two callbacks, named <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>, that the application can use to send and receive messages between server and client.</p>

<p>Here’s an example HTTP request scope</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"http_version"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1.1"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"server"</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>"127.0.0.1"</span><span>,</span> <span>8000</span><span>),</span>
    <span>"client"</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>"127.0.0.1"</span><span>,</span> <span>60457</span><span>),</span>
    <span>"scheme"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"method"</span><span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"root_path"</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"path"</span><span>:</span> <span>"/hello/a"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"raw_path"</span><span>:</span> <span>b"/hello/a"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"query_string"</span><span>:</span> <span>b""</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"headers"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>(</span><span>b"host"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"localhost:8000"</span><span>),</span>
        <span>(</span><span>b"connection"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"keep-alive"</span><span>),</span>
        <span>(</span>
            <span>b"user-agent"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>b"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.106 Safari/537.36"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>),</span>
        <span>(</span>
            <span>b"accept"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>b"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>),</span>
        <span>(</span><span>b"accept-encoding"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"gzip, deflate, br"</span><span>),</span>
        <span>(</span><span>b"accept-language"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"en-US,en;q=0.9"</span><span>),</span>
        <span>(</span>
            <span>b"cookie"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>b'csrftoken=dDA2IAPrvgPc7hkyBSyctxDk78KmhHAzUqR0LUpjXI3Xgki0QrGEWazE3RGZuLGl'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>),</span>
    <span>],</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might notice that <code>scope</code> is not too different from a WSGI <code>environ</code>. In fact, ASGI interface is very similar to WSGI interface, but instead of getting a <code>environ</code> and <code>start_response</code> to send headers and using the return value of WSGI application as the response body, ASGI interfaces with the connection and allows us to receive and send messages multiple times during the lifecycle of the connection <strong>asynchronously</strong> until the connection is closed.  This allows a nice interface for both WebSocket and HTTP.</p>

<p>It’s also totally possible to wrap a WSGI application inside an ASGI application, just prepare a WSGI <code>environ</code> and <code>start_response</code> based on <code>scope</code>, <code>receive</code>, and <code>send</code> then call the WSGI application and it would work. If you delegate that call into a thread pool or something similar, you just made your WSGI application asynchronous. This is roughly how Channels wraps around Django.</p>

<h2 id="define-asgi-framework">Define ASGI framework</h2>
<p>When I say ASGI framework I refer it as a framework that makes building ASGI application easier and this does not include the ASGI server part. I’m mentioning this because some of the earlier Python asynchronous web frameworks have their own server implementation that also takes over tasks such as parsing  HTTP requests, handles network connections, etc. We are not doing those in ASGI web framework. As a spiritual successor to WSGI, where web servers, such as Gunicorn and uwsgi, and web frameworks, such as Flask and Django, are separated, ASGI has this separation too.</p>

<p>So, what does an ASGI application look like?</p>

<h3 id="asgi-hello-world">ASGI Hello World</h3>
<p>A simple ASGI hello world application can be written as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>application</span><span>(</span><span>scope</span><span>,</span> <span>receive</span><span>,</span> <span>send</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>scope</span><span>[</span><span>"path"</span><span>].</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>or</span> <span>"world"</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>send</span><span>(</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http.response.start"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"status"</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"headers"</span><span>:</span> <span>[[</span><span>b"content-type"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"text/plain"</span><span>],],</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>send</span><span>(</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http.response.body"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"body"</span><span>:</span> <span>f"Hello, </span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!"</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>(),</span>
            <span>"more_body"</span><span>:</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code>http.response.start</code> starts an HTTP response sending status code and response headers. In this example, it responds with the 200 OK status code and  has <code>content-type</code> set to <code>text/plain</code> in the headers.  <code>http.response.body</code> sends the response body, the <code>more_body</code> key tells the server if the response is finished. ASGI server might use this to know if a connection should be closed or automatically decide between a <code>content-length</code> header or a chunked encoding.</p>

<p>We can run the application with <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/">uvicorn</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>uvicorn asgi-hello:application
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And you should be able to visit <code>http://localhost:8000/</code> and get <code>Hello, world</code>.Visiting <code>http://localhost:8000/tom</code> would get you <code>Hello, tom</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way, uvicorn is pretty fast, a simple benchmark with <code>wrk -d10s http://localhost:8000/hi</code> on a 2018 lowest spec MacBook Air yields <code>Requests/sec:  27857.87</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although this approach works with a simple hello world example, it’s not exactly convenient to write a more complex application this way. For one, it doesn’t do routing, if you want to respond differently for different paths, you’ll probably end up with a huge  <code>if ... else if ... else</code> clause. Secondly, having to write the ASGI message every time in the form of a python dict is quite arduous. Third, in a complex application, it gets harder to track the status of the connection, such as is the response started, is the response ended, should I start the response here, etc.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>With the new framework, I hope to be able to write an ASGI application like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>
<span>from</span> <span>aaf</span> <span>import</span> <span>aaf</span> <span># Another ASGI framework
</span><span>from</span> <span>aaf.routing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Router</span>
<span>from</span> <span>aaf.response</span> <span>import</span> <span>HttpResponse</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>HttpResponse</span><span>(</span><span>f"Hello, </span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

	<span>await</span> <span>connection</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>body</span><span>,</span> <span>finish</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>


<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>aaf</span><span>([</span><span>router</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I hope this snippet of how I want the framework to look like is self-explanatory. But here are some of the key things I want to achieve:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It should be able to handle HTTP response declaratively and imperatively.</li>
  <li>It should support Flask style routing with parameter parsing.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="connection-class">Connection class</h2>
<p>The <code>Connection</code> class will represent an ASGI HTTP or WebSocket connection. It’s a class that encapsulates the three basic elements in ASGI, namely <code>scope</code>, <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>, and expose some convenient methods and properties so that users don’t need to verbosely write out all the ASGI messages and parse everything, such as cookies and headers, from <code>scope</code>. But it should allow users to access the original <code>scope</code>, <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> when they want to, so that the composability of ASGI applications is maintained. For example, it should allow user to delegate certain <code>connection</code>s to another ASGI application by calling <code>another_asgi_app(connection.scope, connectionn.asgi_send, connection.asgi_receive)</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple implementation of the <code>Connection</code> class.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>enum</span> <span>import</span> <span>Enum</span>

        <blockquote><p>Test-driven development was supposed to eliminate the need for independent testing. Alas, it doesn’t go far enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Test-driven development (TDD) earned a reputation of making software more robust. Does that mean you can fire all the testers? Spoiler: No.</p>
<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test-driven development</a> is a method for writing software in small chunks. You start with a test, then write functional code to make the test pass, and finally refactor the functional code to clean it up. The idea of TDD was proposed by <a href="https://amzn.to/3doabIA" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kent Beck</a> in the early 1990s, as part of Extreme Programming, an Agile software development methodology.</p>
<p>TDD is sometimes summarized as “Red, Green, Refactor.” The interfaces on many testing harnesses, such as JUnit (for Java) and NUnit (for .NET), show red lights when tests fail and green lights when tests pass. There’s another step to consider, however. You need to think about the desired behavior and carve out a small chunk of code – typically five lines – to implement next.</p>
<p>As proposed by Beck, in TDD you never write functional code until you have a failing test. Yet, it takes practice to learn to write the tests first (rather than after the fact); developers often have trouble shifting their habitual way of working. Writing the tests before the functional code just feels <em>wrong.</em> You do get used to it, though it may take months; by then it starts feeling <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-is-test-driven-development-tdd/">biggest benefit of TDD</a> is that it removes the fear of breaking your code. As you add unit tests and functional code, you also build <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/dont-fail-your-next-interview-know-what-differentiates-regression-testing-from-retesting/">a library of regression tests</a> that you run frequently. When you add a new feature, fix a bug, or refactor to clean up your code, running the tests again reassures you that you didn’t break anything. Or at least it confirms that you didn’t break any of the tests that <em>you</em> wrote.</p>
<h3>What do testers bring to the table?</h3>
<p>Software managers are sometimes tempted to eliminate or reduce software QA departments when the coders adopt TDD, on the grounds that the programmers are also writing tests. That decision usually is a mistake, because <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">testers provide value</a> outside of the developers’ unit tests.</p>
<p>Unit tests are only one of the kinds of tests needed to adequately cover modern code. TDD developers rarely write end-to-end integration tests. They may avoid writing unit tests that require significant setup or that rely on other software components, such as a populated database.</p>
<p>Dedicated testers are more likely than coders to take the time to perform exploratory (ad-hoc) testing, which can find bugs that weren’t imagined during the development of the code. Testers also come to the product with fresh eyes compared to the coders who have been immersed in the software for long hours.</p>
<p>Additionally, software developers often are not interested in setting up CI/CD tooling or in organizing the team’s tests into a master regression test. Testers consider all of that to be part of the job. Developers may not be involved in implementing shift left testing beyond TDD. &nbsp;For shift left testing, testers can gather information, help with requirements management, and help to define the acceptance criteria, before a single test or line of functional code is complete.</p>
<h3>What bugs do testers find that TDD doesn’t?</h3>
<p>Security is one large, important testing area that isn’t normally addressed by writing unit tests. Testers look for security flaws with automated vulnerability testing tools, manual security assessments, penetration tests, security audits, and security reviews.</p>
<p>It’s difficult for developers to write <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-challenges-of-testing-guis/">unit tests to test GUIs</a>. Instead, testers use automation tools specific to the supported application environments, such as browsers, desktop applications, and mobile apps.</p>
<p>Developers can have a hard time with hardware-dependent bugs, as the dominant way of working is for a coder to work on a single machine. QA departments often collect rooms full of varied computers and devices, as well as images of many operating system versions. An alternative way of testing on many different model devices is to use a crowd-sourced testing service.</p>
<p>While TDD can theoretically catch bugs in edge cases, they are called “edge cases” for a good reason. When a coder designs the tests for a function point, obscure edge cases may escape notice in the heat of the moment. Testers are more likely to find these than are the coders who wrote the software.</p>
<p>Similarly, cross-module flaws can sometimes escape scrutiny in unit tests. They can easily arise when one programmer misunderstands the interface or boundary conditions of another programmer’s module. Cross-module bugs are often found during end-to-end testing and ad-hoc testing.</p>
<p>In summary, while there’s a lot to be said for TDD as a development practice, it doesn’t usually provide complete test coverage of your code. For that, you still need testers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whoever writes the test cases, it makes sense to follow established guidelines. <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/best-practices-for-effective-test-case-writing/">These</a> might help.</p></blockquote>

<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p>Anyone who has written more than a hello world program should have used a debugger at some point (if you haven’t, drop what you’re doing and learn how to use one). However, although these tools are in such widespread use, there aren’t a lot of resources which tell you how they work and how to write one<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, especially when compared to other toolchain technologies like compilers. In this post series we’ll learn what makes debuggers tick and write one for debugging Linux programs.</p>
<p>We’ll support the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch, halt, and continue execution</li>
<li>Set breakpoints on
<ul>
<li>Memory addresses</li>
<li>Source code lines</li>
<li>Function entry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read and write registers and memory</li>
<li>Single stepping
<ul>
<li>Instruction</li>
<li>Step in</li>
<li>Step out</li>
<li>Step over</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print current source location</li>
<li>Print backtrace</li>
<li>Print values of simple variables</li>
</ul>
<p>In the final part I’ll also outline how you could add the following to your debugger:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote debugging</li>
<li>Shared library and dynamic loading support</li>
<li>Expression evaluation</li>
<li>Multi-threaded debugging support</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll be focusing on C and C++ for this project, but it should work just as well with any language which compiles down to machine code and outputs standard DWARF debug information (if you don’t know what that is yet, don’t worry, this will be covered soon). Additionally, my focus will be on just getting something up and running which works most of the time, so things like robust error handling will be eschewed in favour of simplicity.</p>

<h3 id="getting-set-up">Getting set up</h3>
<p>Before we jump into things, let’s get our environment set up. I’ll be using two dependencies in this tutorial: <a href="https://github.com/antirez/linenoise">Linenoise</a> for handling our command line input, and <a href="https://github.com/TartanLlama/libelfin/tree/fbreg">libelfin</a> for parsing the debug information. You could use the more traditional libdwarf instead of libelfin, but the interface is nowhere near as nice, and libelfin also provides a mostly complete DWARF expression evaluator, which will save you a lot of time if you want to read variables. Make sure that you use the fbreg branch of my fork of libelfin, as it hacks on some extra support for reading variables on x86.</p>
<p>Once you’ve either installed these on your system, or got them building as dependencies with whatever build system you prefer, it’s time to get started. I just set them to build along with the rest of my code in my CMake files.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="launching-the-executable">Launching the executable</h3>
<p>Before we actually debug anything, we’ll need to launch the debugee program. We’ll do this with the classic fork/exec pattern.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>argv</span><span>[])</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>argc</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cerr</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Program name not specified"</span><span>;</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>prog</span> <span>=</span> <span>argv</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>

    <span>auto</span> <span>pid</span> <span>=</span> <span>fork</span><span>();</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pid</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>//we're in the child process
</span>        <span>//execute debugee
</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pid</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>  <span>{</span>
        <span>//we're in the parent process
</span>        <span>//execute debugger
</span>    <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>We call <code>fork</code> and this causes our program to split into two processes. If we are in the child process, <code>fork</code> returns <code>0</code>, and if we are in the parent process, it returns the process ID of the child process.</p>
<p>If we’re in the child process, we want to replace whatever we’re currently executing with the program we want to debug.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp">   <span>ptrace</span><span>(</span><span>PTRACE_TRACEME</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>,</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>);</span>
   <span>execl</span><span>(</span><span>prog</span><span>,</span> <span>prog</span><span>,</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Here we have our first encounter with <code>ptrace</code>, which is going to become our best friend when writing our debugger. <code>ptrace</code> allows us to observe and control the execution of another process by reading registers, reading memory, single stepping and more. The API is very ugly; it’s a single function which you provide with an enumerator value for what you want to do, and then some arguments which will either be used or ignored depending on which value you supply. The signature looks like this:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>long</span> <span>ptrace</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span> <span>__ptrace_request</span> <span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>pid_t</span> <span>pid</span><span>,</span>
            <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>addr</span><span>,</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>data</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p><code>request</code> is what we would like to do to the traced process; <code>pid</code> is the process ID of the traced process; <code>addr</code> is a memory address, which is used in some calls to designate an address in the tracee; and <code>data</code> is some request-specific resource. The return value often gives error information, so you probably want to check that in your real code; I’m just omitting it for brevity. You can have a look at the man pages for more information.</p>
<p>The request we send in the above code, <code>PTRACE_TRACEME</code>, indicates that this process should allow its parent to trace it. All of the other arguments are ignored, because API design isn’t important /s.</p>
<p>Next, we call <code>execl</code>, which is one of the many <code>exec</code> flavours. We execute the given program, passing the name of it as a command-line argument and a <code>nullptr</code> to terminate the list. You can pass any other arguments needed to execute your program here if you like.</p>
<p>After we’ve done this, we’re finished with the child process; we’ll just let it keep running until we’re finished with it.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="adding-our-debugger-loop">Adding our debugger loop</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve launched the child process, we want to be able to interact with it. For this, we’ll create a <code>debugger</code> class, give it a loop for listening to user input, and launch that from our parent fork of our <code>main</code> function.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pid</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>  <span>{</span>
    <span>//parent
</span>    <span>debugger</span> <span>dbg</span><span>{</span><span>prog</span><span>,</span> <span>pid</span><span>};</span>
    <span>dbg</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>class</span> <span>debugger</span> <span>{</span>
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>debugger</span> <span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>prog_name</span><span>,</span> <span>pid_t</span> <span>pid</span><span>)</span>
        <span>:</span> <span>m_prog_name</span><span>{</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>move</span><span>(</span><span>prog_name</span><span>)},</span> <span>m_pid</span><span>{</span><span>pid</span><span>}</span> <span>{}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>run</span><span>();</span>

<span>private</span><span>:</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>m_prog_name</span><span>;</span>
    <span>pid_t</span> <span>m_pid</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>In our <code>run</code> function, we need to wait until the child process has finished launching, then just keep on getting input from linenoise until we get an EOF (ctrl+d).</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>debugger</span><span>::</span><span>run</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>wait_status</span><span>;</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>options</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>waitpid</span><span>(</span><span>m_pid</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>wait_status</span><span>,</span> <span>options</span><span>);</span>

    <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>;</span>
    <span>while</span><span>((</span><span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>linenoise</span><span>(</span><span>"minidbg&gt; "</span><span>))</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>handle_command</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
        <span>linenoiseHistoryAdd</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
        <span>linenoiseFree</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>When the traced process is launched, it will be sent a <code>SIGTRAP</code> signal, which is a trace or breakpoint trap. We can wait until this signal is sent using the <code>waitpid</code> function.</p>
<p>After we know the process is ready to be debugged, we listen for user input. The <code>linenoise</code> function takes a prompt to display and handles user input by itself. This means we get a nice command line with history and navigation commands without doing much work at all. When we get the input, we give the command to a <code>handle_command</code> function which we’ll write shortly, then we add this command to the linenoise history and free the resource.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="handling-input">Handling input</h3>
<p>Our commands will follow a similar format to gdb and lldb. To continue the program, a user will type <code>continue</code> or <code>cont</code> or even just <code>c</code>. If they want to set a breakpoint on an address, they’ll write <code>break 0xDEADBEEF</code>, where <code>0xDEADBEEF</code> is the desired address in hexadecimal format. Let’s add support for these commands.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>debugger</span><span>::</span><span>handle_command</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>line</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

June 25, 2020 | https://www.4alltech.com/2020/05/a-closer-look-at-frame-times-why-fps.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.4alltech.com/2020/05/a-closer-look-at-frame-times-why-fps.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><span><span>So FPS is, as it were, a total score, the number of images&nbsp;<em>per second.</em></span>&nbsp;<span>Since this does not say anything about the distribution of the images&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;that second, the fps score is unable to say anything about how smooth the experience actually is for the player.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span>
<p><span>It is therefore more interesting to look at the time it takes to render each frame (image).</span>&nbsp;<span>These are also known as&nbsp;<em>frame times</em>&nbsp;, and they are measured in milliseconds.</span>&nbsp;<span>A millisecond is one thousandth of a second and is often shortened to&nbsp;<em>ms</em>&nbsp;.</span>&nbsp;<span>Because the images follow each other very quickly in an animation, this unit makes more sense than noting&nbsp;<em>0.001 seconds.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>If you want 60 fps without stutters at all times, no frame should take longer than 16.67 milliseconds to calculate and be displayed on your screen.</em></span><span>For 30 fps, your system can take it easy;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>there is a whopping 33.3 milliseconds.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If you want to get 100 fps, that's just 10 milliseconds - less than a third of the time!</span></p>
<h2>
<span>The Achilles heel of the mean</span></h2>

<p><span>For frame times we therefore measure&nbsp;<em>per frame</em>&nbsp;the time it took to render that frame.</span>&nbsp;<span>Since each benchmark quickly takes a few minutes, we are talking about thousands of 'scores' (values).</span>&nbsp;<span>It would be very easy to calculate an average from all this data, but then we are effectively no further than with an FPS score;</span>&nbsp;<span>after all, an average says very little about the consistency and outliers within the series.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jrEKYSAaOqI/XsLi8DYjE4I/AAAAAAAAAOM/JzG4Z13P6_8xOitnBnqLcQL_Ekg1C-6pgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082182_grafiek_ms2.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="361" data-original-width="600" height="384" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jrEKYSAaOqI/XsLi8DYjE4I/AAAAAAAAAOM/JzG4Z13P6_8xOitnBnqLcQL_Ekg1C-6pgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082182_grafiek_ms2.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span>Which system is performing better now?</span>&nbsp;<span>If we look at the averages, both systems arrive at 30 fps.</span>&nbsp;<span>On this basis, we therefore see no difference.</span>&nbsp;<span>If we look at the graph, it is immediately clear that system B with its two outliers does not offer such a smooth experience as system A.</span></p>

<p><span>Now that we know that we should not focus on an average (fps), the question arises: what can be used?</span>&nbsp;<span>If we measure the frame times in a benchmark or test, and thereby collect&nbsp;<em>tens of thousands of</em>&nbsp;scores, how can these be made transparent?</span>&nbsp;<span>Making a graph for each second tested as above is a lot of work, and you probably already quit after ten pieces.</span>&nbsp;<span>To do this in a compact and efficient way, we use percentiles.</span></p>
<h2>
<span>Percentiles</span></h2>
<p><span>A percentile is a term from the statistic, and is calculated by ordering all frame times from lowest to highest and dividing it into 100 parts of equal size.</span>&nbsp;<span>That way you will get a better overview of the distribution of all data.</span>&nbsp;<span>For example, if it is the 60th percentile, then 60 percent of all frame times is equal to or less than this number, and 40 percent higher.</span>&nbsp;<span>If a test shows that the 90th percentile is 13.3 ms, 90 percent of all measured frames are ready in 13.3 ms or faster.</span></p>

<p><span>Do you remember the previous graph ?</span>&nbsp;<span>Below are a similar chart with again one second of test data on two systems.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2N2NpGtN7Y/XsLjkzlz_fI/AAAAAAAAAOU/EphYXha3z80OskdkHMGyj0RnSz3fKuUkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082184_grafiek_pt4.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="300" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2N2NpGtN7Y/XsLjkzlz_fI/AAAAAAAAAOU/EphYXha3z80OskdkHMGyj0RnSz3fKuUkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082184_grafiek_pt4.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span>The average of these two systems is again not that interesting, because they both achieve an average frame time of 33.3 ms which means 30 fps.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>We get a better overview if we sort all scores in the chart from low to high as below.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu-6E-Pl064/XsLj3NTlsuI/AAAAAAAAAOc/DsCHPBElmeEXKTbwNTKx_2b77dGY1URfACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082183_grafiek_pt3.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="301" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu-6E-Pl064/XsLj3NTlsuI/AAAAAAAAAOc/DsCHPBElmeEXKTbwNTKx_2b77dGY1URfACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082183_grafiek_pt3.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>With the increasing frame times in this graph, the picture is a bit less chaotic than the previous graph.</span>&nbsp;<span>In the order from low to high, the best (lowest) frame times are therefore on the left, and the worst (which cause the annoying stutters) on the right.</span>&nbsp;<span>This is also how a percentile graph works, only percentiles are used for the horizontal axis.</span>&nbsp;<span>A line graph is also used instead of a bar chart (the 'bars').</span>&nbsp;<span>Then the graph will look like this:</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcVt3TaKBZ8/XsLkL28ON2I/AAAAAAAAAOk/owWLIe0h7IwuEYous2S02ImQK40ZuWBWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082481_ms_perc1.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="323" data-original-width="600" height="344" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcVt3TaKBZ8/XsLkL28ON2I/AAAAAAAAAOk/owWLIe0h7IwuEYous2S02ImQK40ZuWBWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082481_ms_perc1.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We know that frame times are preferably as low as possible, but especially that we want to see as few high frame times as possible.</span>&nbsp;<span>That sounds like the same thing, but there is a difference.</span>&nbsp;<span>In the example above, the game runs at 30 fps and the monitor shows 30 images per second, so there is 33.3 ms time to prepare per frame.</span>&nbsp;<span>In that case, the frames that are ready in less time have no extra value, they are not shown before.</span>&nbsp;<span>If you want your game to run as fast as possible, low frame times are desirable, but even then consistency is also important for the best experience.</span>&nbsp;<span>The higher frame times on the right of the graph are the cases that disrupt the smooth experience.</span></span></span></span></p>
<h2>
<span>Low frame times, high percentiles</span></h2>
<p><span>When discussing frame times, the 95th, 99th and 99.9th percentile are commonly used values.</span>&nbsp;<span>Why?</span>&nbsp;<span>Because with this data, we can make a solid statement about how well a game or benchmark is running for most of the time.</span>&nbsp;<span>We are not just looking for the worst frame time, we want to know how consistent the experience is across the board.</span>&nbsp;<span>An incidental stutter is almost inevitable and often not fully predictable - and sometimes just a measurement error.</span></p>

<p><span>The 99th and 99.9th percentile is also regularly indicated with&nbsp;<em>1%</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>0.1%</em>&nbsp;<em>lows</em>&nbsp;at frame times&nbsp;<em>,</em>&nbsp;which is effectively the same (the 1 and 0.1 percent worst frame times) - it just rolls a bit easier.</span>&nbsp;<span>In addition, some publications convert the percentiles in frame times back to fps, in order to make the information more accessible.</span>&nbsp;<span>Many readers can usually imagine better at&nbsp;<em>75 fps</em>&nbsp;than at&nbsp;<em>13.3 ms</em>&nbsp;.</span>&nbsp;<span>In itself we understand that choice, but it should be kept in mind that 'in' 75 fps (a second with 75 frames) an inconsistent follow-up of frames can still take place.</span>&nbsp;<span>This mainly depends on which percentile it concerns: converted 75 fps as 99th percentile is much more consistent than as 90th percentile.</span></p>
<h2>
<span>Finally</span></h2>
<p><span>For those who examine frame times, a world of detailed information opens up.</span>&nbsp;<span>Compared to the&nbsp;<em>frames per second</em>&nbsp;measure, it is much more accurate to measure how smooth the animation is and how pleasant the gaming experience will be.</span>&nbsp;<span>Moreover, there are a variety of options for comparisons;</span>&nbsp;<span>not only determine what the better video card is, but also, for example, which processor is suitable for gaming, how much an overclocking on your cores or your memory makes, the difference between different driver versions and so on.</span></p>

<p><span>That the importance of frame times has been underlined with this article does not mean that the fps benchmark can be trashed.</span>&nbsp;<span>As long as frame times remain consistent, the proportions in relevant equations will remain the same</span></p>
<p><span><span>In this article we have talked about what exactly frame times mean, how they relate to fps, how the calculations are made, what the percentiles mean and how you can read and interpret all these test data.</span>&nbsp;<span>If you also want to get started and do these measurements on your own PC, programs such as&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/ocat/&amp;usg=ALkJrhh7ywfCE3ogo8D8QpExdhs-ba5knw">OCAT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://www.nvidia.com/nl-nl/geforce/technologies/frameview/&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-nC6YtO_Hj4jx-GwmEb9dFzOe0g">FrameView are</a>&nbsp;good options for logging in, but especially&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://github.com/DevTechProfile/CapFrameX&amp;usg=ALkJrhj4raip_SAYtm11y0fc40AjzmlyRA">CapFrameX</a>&nbsp;is recommended to provide insight into the large amounts of data in an instant.</span></span></p>

                    <p>API keys, passwords, and customer data are accidentally posted to GitHub every day. </p><p>Hackers use these keys to login to servers, steal personal information, and rack up absurd AWS charges. GitHub leaks can cost a company thousands–or even millions–of dollars in damages. Open-source intelligence gathering on GitHub has become a powerful arrow in every security researcher's quiver: researchers from NC State even wrote an <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ndss2019_04B-3_Meli_paper.pdf">academic paper</a> on the subject. </p><p>This article, written for both bug bounty hunters and enterprise infosec teams, demonstrates common types of sensitive information (secrets) that users post to public GitHub repositories as well as heuristics for finding them. The techniques in this article can be applied to <a href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub Gist</a> snippets, too.</p><p>In the last year, I've earned nearly $10,000 from bug bounty programs on <a href="https://hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a> without even visiting programs' websites thanks to these techniques. I've submitted over 30 Coordinated Disclosure reports to vulnerable corporations, including eight Fortune 500 companies. </p><p><strong>I've also released <a href="https://github.com/tillson/git-hound">GitHound</a>, an open-source tool designed to automate the process of finding keys across GitHub.</strong> GitHound isn't limited to a single user or organization: it sifts through all of GitHub, using Code Search queries as an entrypoint into repositories and then using context, regexes, and some other neat tricks to find secrets.</p><h2 id="github-code-search">GitHub Code Search</h2><p>Before we get into the automated tools and bug bounty strategies, let's talk about Code Search. </p><p>GitHub provides <a href="https://github.com/search">rich code searching</a> that scans public GitHub repositories (some content is omitted, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-code#considerations-for-code-search">like forks and non-default branches</a>). Queries can be simple like <code>uberinternal.com</code> or can contain multi-word strings like &nbsp;<code>"Authorization: Bearer"</code>. Searches can even target specific files (<code>filename: vim_settings.xml</code>) or specific languages (<code>language:SQL</code>). Searches can also contain certain <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax">boolean qualifiers</a> like <code>NOT</code> and <code>&gt;</code>. </p><p>Knowing the rules of GitHub code search enables us to craft search dorks: queries that are designed to find sensitive information. GitHub dorks can be found online, but the best dorks are the ones that you create yourself.</p><p>For example, <code>filename: vim_settings.xml</code> (<a href="https://github.com/search?q=filename%3Avim_settings.xml&amp;type=Code">try it!</a>) targets <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-tools-settings-repository.html">IntelliJ settings files</a><a>.</a> Interestingly, the <code>vim_settings.xml</code> file contains recent <strong>copy-pasted strings encoded in Base64</strong>. I recently made $2400 from a bug bounty with this dork: SaaS API keys and customer information were exposed in <code>vim_settings.xml</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://tillsongalloway.com/content/images/2020/05/vim_settings.png"></figure><p><code>vim_settings.xml</code> only contains recently copy-pasted strings, but we can exploit the repository's commit history to find the <strong>entire copy-paste history.</strong> Just clone the repository and run <a href="https://gist.github.com/tillson/620e8ef87bc057f25b0a27c423433fda">this 14-line script</a>, and the user's activity will be at your fingertips. GitHound also finds and scans base64 encoded strings for secrets, even in commit history.</p><p>By the way: with <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22vim_settings.xml%22&amp;type=Commits">a GitHub commit search dork</a>, we can quickly scan all 500,000 of commits that edit <code>vim_settings.xml</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://tillsongalloway.com/content/images/2020/05/commits.png"></figure><h2 id="search-heuristics-for-bug-bounty-hunters">Search Heuristics for Bug Bounty Hunters</h2><p>GitHub dorks broadly find sensitive information, but<strong> what if we want to look for information about a specific company?</strong> GitHub has millions of repositories and even more files, so we'll need some heuristics to narrow down the search space. </p><p>To start finding sensitive information, identify a target. </p><p>I've found that the best way to start is to <strong>find domains or subdomains that identify corporate infrastructure.</strong> </p><p>Searching for <code>company.com</code> probably won't provide useful results: many companies release audited open-source projects that aren't likely to contain secrets. Less-used domains and subdomains are more interesting. This includes specific hosts like <code>jira.company.com</code> as well as more general second-level and lower-level domains. It's more efficient to find a pattern than a single domain: <code>corp.somecompany.com</code>, <code>somecompany.net</code>, or <code>companycorp.com</code> are more likely to appear only in an employee's configuration files. </p><p>The usual suspects for open-source intelligence and domain reconnaissance help here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute">Subbrute</a> - Python tool for brute-forcing subdomains</li><li><a href="https://www.threatcrowd.org/">ThreatCrowd</a> - Given a domain, find associated domains through multiple OSINT techniques</li><li><a href="https://censys.io/">Censys.io</a> - Given a domain, find SSL certificates using it</li></ul><p>GitHound can help with subdomain discovery too: add a custom regex <code>\.company\.com</code> and run GitHound with the <code>--regex-file</code> flag.</p><p>After finding a host or pattern to search, play around on GitHub search with it (I always do this before using automated tools). There are a few questions I like to ask myself here:</p><ol><li><strong>How many results came up?</strong> If there are over 100 pages, I'll likely need to find a better query to start with (GitHub limits code search results to 100 pages).</li><li><strong>What kind of results came up?</strong> If the results are mostly (intentionally) open-source projects and people using public APIs, then I may be able to refine the search to eliminate those.</li><li><strong>What happens if I change the language?</strong> <code>language:Shell</code> and <code>language:SQL</code> may have interesting results.</li><li><strong>Do these results reveal any other domains or hosts?</strong> Results in the first few pages will often include a reference to another domain (e.g. searching for <code>jira.uber.com</code> may reveal the existence of another domain entirely, like <code>uberinternal.com</code>).</li></ol><p>I spend most of my time in this step.</p><p>It's crucial that the search space is well-defined and accurate. Automated tools and manual searching will be faster and more accurate with the proper query.</p><p>Once I find results that seem interesting based on the criteria above, I run it through <a href="https://github.com/tillson/git-hound">GitHound</a><a> </a>with <code>--dig-files</code> and <code>--dig-commits</code> to look the entire repository and its history. </p><p><code>echo "uberinternal.com" | ./git-hound --dig-files --dig-commits</code></p><p><code>echo "uber.com" | ./git-hound --dig-files --language-file languages.txt --dig-commits</code></p><p><code>echo "uber.box.net" | ./git-hound --dig-files --dig-commits</code></p><p>GitHound also locates interesting files that simply searching won't find, like <code>.zip</code> or <code>.xlsx</code> files. Importantly, I also manually go through results since automated tools often miss customer information, sensitive code, and username/password combinations. Oftentimes, this will reveal more subdomains or other interesting patterns that will give me ideas for more search queries. It's important to remember that open-source intelligence is a recursive process.</p><p>This process almost always finds results. Leaks usually fall into one of these categories (ranked from most to least impactful):</p><ol><li><strong>SaaS API keys</strong> - Companies rarely impose IP restrictions on APIs. AWS, Slack, Google, and other API keys are liquid gold. These are usually found in config files, bash history files, and scripts.</li><li><strong>Server/database credentials</strong> - These are usually behind a firewall, so they're less impactful. Usually found in config files, bash history files, and scripts.</li><li><strong>Customer/employee information</strong> - These hide in XLSX, CSV, and XML files and range from emails all the way to billing information and employee performance reviews.</li><li><strong>Data science scripts</strong> - SQL queries, R scripts, and Jupyter projects can reveal sensitive information. These repos also tend to have "test data" files hanging around.</li><li><strong>Hostnames/metadata</strong> - The most common result. Most companies don't consider this a vulnerability, but they can help refine future searches</li></ol><h2 id="workflow-for-specific-api-providers">Workflow for Specific API Providers</h2><p>Dorks can also be created to target specific API providers and their endpoints. This is especially useful for companies creating automated checks for their users' API keys. With knowledge of an API key's <strong>context</strong> and <strong>syntax</strong>, the search space can be significantly reduced. </p><p>With knowledge of the specific API provider, we can obtain all of the keys that match the API provider's regex and are in an API call context and then we can check them for validity using an internal database or an API endpoint. </p><figure><img src="https://tillsongalloway.com/content/images/2020/05/graph.png"><figcaption>A workflow for finding secrets for a single API provider</figcaption></figure><p>For example, suppose a company (HalCorp) provides an API for users to read and write to their account. By making our own HalCorp account, we discover that API keys are in the form <code>[a-f]{4}-[a-f]{4}-[a-f]{4}</code>. </p><pre><code># Python

</code></pre><p>Armed with this information, we can compose our own GitHub dorks for HalCorp API responses: </p><pre><code># Python
"authenticate_by_key" "halapi" language:python

# REST API
"HALCorp-Key"
</code></pre><p>With a tool like <a href="https://github.com/tillson/git-hound">GitHound</a><a>,</a> we can use regex matching to find strings that match the API key's regex and output them to a file:</p><p><code>echo "HALCorp-Key" | git-hound --dig-files --dig-commits --many-results --regex-file halcorp-api-keys.txt --results-only &gt; api_tokens.txt </code></p><p>Now that we have a file containing potential &nbsp;API tokens, and we can check these against a database for validity (<strong>do not do this if you don't have written permission from the API provider</strong>).</p><p>In the case of HalCorp, we can write a bash script that reads from stdin, checks the <code>api.halcorp.biz/userinfo</code> endpoint, and outputs the response.</p><p><code>cat api_tokens.txt | bash checktoken.bash</code></p><p>Although awareness of secret exposure on GitHub has increased, more and more sensitive data are published each day. </p><p>Amazon Web Services have begun <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-receive-notifications-when-your-aws-accounts-root-access-keys-are-used/">notifying users if their API keys are posted online</a>. GitHub has added <a href="https://github.com/features/security">security features</a> that scan public repositories for common keys. These solutions are merely bandaids, however. To limit secret leaks from source code, we must update API frameworks and DevOps methodologies to prevent API keys from being stored in Git/SVN repositories entirely. Software like <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a> safely stores production keys and some API providers, like Google Cloud Platform, have updated their libraries to force API keys to be stored in a file by default.</p><p>Fully eradicating exposure of sensitive information is a more difficult problem: how can customer information be fully detected? What if it's in a Word, Excel, or compiled file? More research must be conducted in this field to study the extent of the problem and its solution.</p>

				<p>You've probably heard of a Lean Startup approach to building a business, but what about a Lean DevOps approach to scaling your development team?</p><p>To explain the difference between traditional DevOps and Lean DevOps, let's start at a cloud's eye view and work our way down.</p><p>The definition of traditional DevOps, as defined by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/#:~:text=DevOps%20is%20the%20combination%20of,development%20and%20infrastructure%20management%20processes.">AWS</a>, is:</p><blockquote>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/traditional-devopscycle-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Lean DevOps makes a key distinction in the fact that it aims to not just bring velocity to the surface, but also simplicity. As such, Lean DevOps is defined as:</p><blockquote><em>Lean DevOps is a development philosophy that focuses on both velocity and simplicity via a combination of culture, best practices, and workflow automation tools.</em></blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/lean-devops-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Not only is traditional DevOps a major challenge for small companies trying to compete for skilled people, but those same startups also have the most promising opportunity to scale DevOps as part of their organizational structure and culture. In doing so, DevOps can be optimized using a lattice-style team philosophy where generalists and specialists are both leveraged and nurtured.</p><p>And Lean DevOps works. The <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/report/state-of-devops-report/">2019 State of DevOps Report</a> showed that companies who have high performing DevOps programs deploy software not only <strong>200 times more frequently</strong>, but also have <strong>2,555 times faster lead times</strong> for their projects. In addition, they also <strong>recover 24 times faster from failed changes</strong>, with <strong>three times lower change fail rates</strong>.</p><p>That equates to not just faster development, but faster business. You’ll reach milestones, OKRs, and goals earlier, and before your competition does. Thus, bringing developer tools into the realm of revenue generation and not just cost savings.</p><h2 id="-300b-in-lost-developer-productivity">$300B in Lost Developer Productivity</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/dev-productivity_cto.ai-2.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Currently, DevOps is fragmented across innumerable tools and technologies. Developers have also been tasked with workflow automation, but this burns valuable time that could be used to build features for paying customers.</p><h3 id="often-you-ll-see-two-main-devops-challenges-">Often you’ll see two main DevOps challenges:</h3><ol><li><strong>Many companies struggle to adopt DevOps practices.</strong></li><li><strong>DevOps tools are far more complex than ever before.</strong></li></ol><p>That’s why <a href="https://stripe.com/reports/developer-coefficient-2018">$300 billion in developer productivity is lost every single year</a> within growing development teams.</p><p>Technical leaders know that, as their teams grow, it is critical to invest in the workflows that their teams require to work. However, it can be too time-consuming to allocate their critical internal resources.</p><p>That’s why a Lean DevOps approach is so important. It allows teams to remain lean, automate repeated workflows, and use tools and behaviors that increase simplicity and velocity.</p><h2 id="the-10x-engineer-is-dead">The 10X Engineer Is Dead</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/10x-engineer-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>And that’s why the 10X engineer is dead. Or, more appropriately, they never existed. However, a team’s ability to have a 10X impact is still very much alive.</p><p>Taking a Lean DevOps philosophy can work the same magic, but instead, focus on making a team of five engineers 2X as productive.</p><p>All they need to do is build the right culture, utilize industry best practices, and implement the best tools.</p><p>You can also consider building an organizational structure that unblocks your team like a lattice formation (pictured above) or holocracy-style team makeup that promotes a flat organization with limited bureaucracy and decentralized management.</p><p>These are frameworks for encoding autonomy, agility, and purpose-alignment into your organization's DNA.</p><h2 id="5-ways-to-build-a-culture-of-delivery">5 Ways to Build a Culture of Delivery</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/teamvelocity-process-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>So, how do I move to the Lean DevOps light, you ask? Well, here are five steps to follow while implementing and scaling your lean culture.</p><ol><li><strong>Stick with lean process for as long as possible.</strong> Don’t give in until it’s the right moment. Stay lean allows you to move quickly in the early stages of a company.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Choose boring technology, invest wisely. </strong></strong></strong>Take time to pick the tools that increase simplicity in your workflows.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Onboarding sets expectations. </strong></strong></strong>Don’t just drop a new tool at your team’s feet. Implement a rollout plan and lay out the education with it.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Create a platform for success. </strong></strong></strong>Lead by example to live and breath your new-found Lean DevOps philosophy.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>ICE: Impact + Confidence / Effort. </strong></strong></strong>Balance your workload by debating with data and leveraging your highest value initiatives.</li></ol><p>Take the time necessary to get buy-in for a culture shift from your team. It's never easy, but if you do it right in the beginning the effects will become much more ingrained in your sprints.</p><h2 id="scaling-with-lean-devops">Scaling with Lean DevOps</h2><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/devops-over-time-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Remember, as your team scales you’ll move from a flatter organization to an Agile matrix one.</p><p>This will also affect your team velocity as process complexity increases.</p><p>So, as you scale, here are ways to stay within the Lean DevOps methodology:</p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Stay flat, fewer managers. </strong></strong></strong>Maintain accountability through transparency via tools like Slack and its companion app marketplace.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Strategic vertical workstreams. </strong></strong></strong>Track product milestones in tools like Jira to provide visibility and a longer-term vision.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Holistic horizontal specialization. </strong></strong></strong>Think about research and development, security, and codebase specialization as wide thoughts that span business functions.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Don’t lose the ability to build a generalist culture. </strong></strong></strong>A team of polymaths will aide your problem solving and creative thinking.</li></ul><p>At the end of the day, there is no perfect process, but a combination of assets.</p><p>Tools with bottom-up adoption, a flat organizational structure to speed things up, adaptability, and a balance between velocity and stability are your targets.</p><p>Welcome to the delivery culture of Lean DevOps.

		<p><strong>Note:</strong> This post is about the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp"><code>mellium.im/xmpp</code></a> project, an XMPP library
for <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>.
Some parts of this post may apply exclusively to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp@v0.16.0">v0.16.0</a>.

<p>Go is a great language if you need to get a project off the ground quickly. It
has its confusing aspects, and its type system allows for lots of abuse thanks
to <a href="https://blog.samwhited.com/2017/08/the-case-for-interface/">optional dynamic typing</a>, but overall it’s easy to read and easy to quickly
build projects that require clear code over absolute type safety.
Similarly, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XMPP<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> has its warts, but overall is the best choice to get a
chat product off the ground quickly if you want a system that’s well understood
and has a robust ecosystem and sustainable standards body.</p>
<p>Since Go shines at handling I/O bound services (like asynchronous network
protocols used for instant messaging), an XMPP library in Go seems like a great
fit.
There are a handful of libraries to handle XMPP already in existence, but most
of them are small high-level libraries designed only to work with the legacy
version of XMPP that was supported by Google Talk, or don’t follow Go idioms and
best practices.
When I started looking into a Go XMPP implementation around 5 years ago, there
wasn’t a low-level library meant to act as a building block from which higher
level systems could be created, and that’s what I wanted: the equivalent of the
standard libraries <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>net/http</code></a> but for XMPP.
This is why I created <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp"><code>mellium.im/xmpp</code></a>.
This post will be about some of the design decisions I made while building the
library, and about some of the trade offs made along the way.</p>
<h2 id="stream-features">Stream Features</h2>
<p>Let’s start by talking about feature negotiation.
An XMPP session can broadly be divided up into two parts: the synchronous
initial handshake, and the actual asynchronous session.
Within this initial handshake, a series of common features are negotiated in a
certain order.
For example, if TLS isn’t already in use, opportunistic TLS (StartTLS) might be
negotiated, followed by authentication.
This ends up being a loop where the server sends any features it wants to
advertise at the current moment (eg. just TLS) then the client chooses one to
negotiate and proceeds with that features specific negotiation steps.
Then the server sends another list (possibly with new features, eg. now that we
have TLS negotiated the server might advertise that authentication is now ready
to proceed) and the client selects one and moves forward.
This loop is easy enough to write in Go, but representing the features
themselves was tricky.
Features need to be able to encode the name they go by when the server lists
them and any information that should be included in that listing, they need to
be able to parse that payload from the clients side, and the actual negotiation
from the server and clients side needs to happen.
To handle this a struct containing three functions for listing features, parsing
the features list, and negotiating the features was created.
This means less boilerplate and more type safety than using an interface to
represent a stream feature.
It also makes it less likely that a user of this API will get confused and write
stateful stream features, but if necessary the functions can still close over
external state or resources (but don’t do this, you may think you need it, but
you’re almost certainly wrong).</p>
<pre><code>type StreamFeature struct {
	Name xml.Name

	Necessary SessionState
	Prohibited SessionState

	List func(ctx context.Context, e xmlstream.TokenWriter, start xml.StartElement) (req bool, err error)
	Parse func(ctx context.Context, r xml.TokenReader, start *xml.StartElement) (req bool, data interface{}, err error)
	Negotiate func(ctx context.Context, session *Session, data interface{}) (mask SessionState, rw io.ReadWriter, err error)
}
</code></pre><p>We also need to have a way to encode the order features should appear in (eg.
auth should not be attempted before TLS).
I decided that features would order themselves based on the state of the
session at the moment when feature negotiation happens.
The feature would say what properties of the session are or are not allowed, and
the thing doing negotiation can determine whether the session currently meets
those criteria.
Session state information only has 4 properties that are useful for session
negotiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a security layer in place (eg. TLS),</li>
<li>has authentication been performed,</li>
<li>is feature negotiation complete, and</li>
<li>was the session initiated by a remote entity?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are part of the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#SessionState"><code>SessionState</code></a> bits, so in the stream features we can
encode what bits are <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#StreamFeature.Necessary">necessary</a> and what bits are <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#StreamFeature.Necessary">prohibited</a> and the state
machine that handles session negotiation will be able to figure out when to
advertise or negotiate the feature using simple bit math.</p>
<pre><code>const (
	// Secure indicates that the underlying connection has been secured. For
	// instance, after STARTTLS has been performed or if a pre-secured connection
	// is being used such as websockets over HTTPS.
	Secure SessionState = 1 &lt;&lt; iota

	// Authn indicates that the session has been authenticated (probably with
	// SASL).
	Authn

	// Ready indicates that the session is fully negotiated and that XMPP stanzas
	// may be sent and received.
	Ready

	// Received indicates that the session was initiated by a foreign entity.
	Received

	…
)
</code></pre><h2 id="session-negotiation">Session Negotiation</h2>
<p>Once we have a set of features that we can negotiate, we need to do the actual
session negotiation.
Normally, XMPP negotiates a session over TCP using the features loop that we
already described, however, sometimes an alternative mechanism might be required
for negotiation such as the websocket subprotocol defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7395">RFC 7395</a> or the
legacy <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html">XEP-0114: Jabber Component Protocol</a>.
Generalizing session negotiation meant allowing the user to provide a special
negotiator function and writing a default one for the basic XMPP stream
negotiation protocol.</p>
<pre><code>type Negotiator func(ctx context.Context, session *Session, data interface{})
  (mask SessionState, rw io.ReadWriter, cache interface{}, err error)
</code></pre><p>Because the negotiator can’t change the session state if it’s written in another
package (since the session state bits aren’t exported), it returns any changes
it wants to be made to the session such as the new session state mask, or any
changes to the underlying reader and writer (eg. if we negotiate StartTLS it
might return a new reader and writer that speak TLS).
The internal code that calls the negotiator function can then create a new
session with the requested changes.</p>
<p>The builtin negotiator can be created with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#NewNegotiator"><code>NewNegotiator</code></a> and supports
various options such as setting the stream language and copying the input and
output streams somewhere else (such as an XML console):</p>
<pre><code>// StreamConfig contains options for configuring the default Negotiator. 
type StreamConfig struct {
	// The native language of the stream.
	Lang string

	// S2S causes the negotiator to negotiate a server-to-server (s2s) connection.
	S2S bool

	// A list of stream features to attempt to negotiate.
	Features []StreamFeature

	// If set a copy of any reads from the session will be written to TeeIn and
	// any writes to the session will be written to TeeOut (similar to the tee(1)
	// command).
	// This can be used to build an "XML console", but users should be careful
	// since this bypasses TLS and could expose passwords and other sensitve data.
	TeeIn, TeeOut io.Writer
}

// NewNegotiator creates a Negotiator that uses a collection of StreamFeatures
// to negotiate an XMPP client-to-server (c2s) or server-to-server (s2s)
// session.
// If StartTLS is one of the supported stream features, the Negotiator attempts
// to negotiate it whether the server advertises support or not.
func NewNegotiator(cfg StreamConfig) Negotiator
</code></pre><p>It uses stream features as discussed in the previous
section, but custom negotiators could be written that use a different type for
stream features, making session negotiation and stream features entirely
modular.
You could replace them with your own implementations, and still use the <code>xmpp</code>
package to handle the lower level XMPP protocol.</p>
<p>An example of a custom stream negotiator can be found in the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/component"><code>xmpp/component</code></a>
package which negotiates a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html">XEP-0114: Jabber Component Protocol</a>
connection.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-data">Receiving Data</h2>
<p>Once the session is negotiated, we need to be able to receive stanzas (the
primitive types of XMPP) and other top level XML elements over the session.
Because the main <code>xmpp</code> package is meant to be lower level than many other XMPP
libraries written for Go, it does not contain callbacks or any way to register
handlers for different types of top level XML element.</p>
<p>Instead, it contains a single <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#Session.Serve"><code>Session.Serve</code></a> method that decodes all incoming
XML tokens and delegates handling them to a single <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#Handler"><code>Handler</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>// A Handler triggers events or responds to incoming elements in an XML stream.
type Handler interface {
	HandleXMPP(t xmlstream.TokenReadEncoder, start *xml.StartElement) error
}
</code></pre><p>The <code>Serve</code> method also handles stanza semantics such as always responding to
IQs as required to be compliant with the XMPP protocol.
Because the handler is provided with a stream to use when writing back to the
session, the underlying library can man-in-the-middle the token stream and check
if an IQ response was written and automatically send one if not, or add required
IDs to stanzas that are missing them.</p>
<p>This design also keeps the number of methods on the session relatively low and
keeps the entire library more modular because we can delegate multiplexing
elements to more specific handlers to other packages such as the builtin
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/mux"><code>xmpp/mux</code></a> package.
If a user wants a more advanced multiplexer that buffers the stream and matches
stream elements based on <a href="https://relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200320131503/http://www.jclark.com/xml/xmlns.htm">Clark notation</a>, or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/all/">XPath</a>, they could
write it themselves and it would have all the same powers and access as the
built in muxer!

<section data-level="1" id="camera-on-or-off-a-ux-approach-to-video-meeting-fatigue">

<section data-level="3" id="video-conferencing-is-the-new-office-living-room-dinner-table-doctors-office-"><h3>Video conferencing is the new office / living room / dinner table / doctors office...</h3>
<p>As the spaces of our social lives have transitioned to a limited number of software interfaces, fatigue and burnout has skyrocketed taxing our mental health and productivity. While video conferencing apps are keeping us employed and connected, they are not prepared to handle this mass shift in our daily routines and social interactions. </p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="what-makes-video-conferencing-so-different-"><h3>What makes video conferencing so different?</h3>
<p>When we spend our days sitting in our makeshift offices and personal spaces staring at our coworkers, friends, doctors, teachers and families (and don’t forget ourselves!) in little boxes on our screens we miss so much of the social experience of real face to face interactions. We’re unable to read body language, engage in normal social rituals, have serendipitous conversations—to move!</p>
<p>We’re also responding to a unending amount of new information that our brains need to process—our personal lives surrounding us at home, the apartments and houses of our coworkers and their personal lives happening around them, the host of distractions on our desktops and the lure of almost unnoticeable multitasking. </p>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/camera-ui.jpg" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="can-the-design-of-our-meeting-software-help-"><h3>Can the design of our meeting software help?</h3>
<p>As a UX designer working to build a video conferencing platform, it’s been crucial to acknowledge the limitations of the medium in hopes of easing some of the fatigue with features designed not to replicate in person communication but to uncover and build on the strengths of a relatively new space.    </p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="improving-our-new-space-the-meeting-room"><h3>Improving our new space - The meeting room</h3>
<p>We spend so much care and effort creating the physical spaces we occupy, and these spaces have a known effect on our mental health as well as our productivity, creativity and sociablility. A black box filled with poor quality images littered with icons can feel like spending all day in a messy room with no windows—of course we’re exhausted after a day of video meetings! But what can we do to make these new rooms feel like  sleek, light filled rooms with all the personal touches that we invest so much thought into? </p>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/camera-meetingroom.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The furniture, if you will, of these new spaces is entirely different. Instead of tables, whiteboards and light switches we have new furniture that has to replicate everything else missing from in person interaction—all those icons littered about. Unmute is the desk of a virtual meeting room.</p>
<p>Designing meetings rooms for Team.video has strived to take into account interior design principles as well as UX best practices. Does a glaring red mute icon create more stress and visual clutter than it provides important functional information? Our process has been one of many iterations, focusing on light colors, subtle gradients and subdued accents.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="camera-on-or-off-"><h3>Camera on or off?</h3>
<p>We’ve never been more aware of the green light at the top of our screens. In almost daily research sessions over the past few months I've yet to encounter a team that has found the golden solution to the camera on or off question. </p>
<p>Companies that had a camera on policy have switched to camera optional and those with a camera optional approach have switched to camera on. Some teams use cameras only for smaller meetings or only require those speaking to use video. </p>
<p>Camera off can feel less personal but also removes the need to process so many different faces and backgrounds at once. While being on camera for the majority of a day is incredibly exhausting and not always necessary for productive work meetings. </p>
<ul>
<li>There is probably no golden solution, but some design attention can greatly improve both sides of the coin. </li>
<li>A more aesthetically pleasing camera off view that still includes the face of a coworker and a signal when/that they are speaking. </li>
<li>Flexible layouts for different scenarios—one speaker, a handful of speakers, screenshare brainstorm etc. </li>
<li>The option to hide or minimize your own video. </li>
<li>Blurred or custom backgrounds for camera on mode—which can be a lot of fun and also a potential new distraction. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/cameraonoroff.png" alt=""></p>

</section>

<section data-level="3" id="meetings-start-very-abruptly"><h3>Meetings start VERY abruptly</h3>
<p>All of a sudden you’re face to face with an unfamiliar coworker, from your bedroom...and the person who called the meeting is running late. This scenario is unique to telecommuting. Maybe you regularly walk to the conference room with a coworker, or you introduce yourself politely and take the first few minutes of a meeting to fill your water bottle while everyone else arrives. </p>
<p>All of this is much more awkward over video. Small talk is less natural with mute/unmute issues, lack of non verbal cues and often bandwidth time delays. Widespread goals to keep meetings efficient encourage us to get straight to the point, which can be jarring. </p>
<p>How can UX help those first few meeting minutes? </p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to know who is already in the meeting before you join so you can decide if you want to be one on one with a C level you’ve never met. </li>
<li>Arrive looking (and sounding!) your best with a pre-meeting ‘haircheck’ where meeting goers can check their audio/video before entering the meeting</li>
<li>Low effort social interaction built in to the welcome minutes. At team.video we’ve implemented an optional word game that early arrivers can play against each other in lieu of or in addition to any amount of small talk. </li>
</ul>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="keep-trying-new-things-"><h3>Keep trying new things!</h3>
<p>Design is always about observing, trying and testing. With team.video we’ve been able to explore some ideas larger companies have not and we’d love to hear any thoughts or issues that you’ve encountered in our software or others! </p>

In my experience doing software consulting, I’ve seen and worked on some projects where the founders take 2 - 3 months to launch the first version of their product. That’s too much time and effort sunk into a project that may not work.</p><h2>Why you need to get your Minimum Viable Product out ASAP</h2><p>The problem is that most people are not comfortable with launching a minimum viable product. Founders are often creative people who love to explore and dive into “wouldn’t it be cool if”s. This habit can result in a continuous loop of adding features, even before the first version of your product is released.</p><p>Perfectionism can often get in the way of execution, and I’ve fallen for this trap many times. My first product (SideQuest) took me four months to build and launch. To continue developing an untested product is, to put it bluntly, arrogant. Here’s why: it assumes that what you are making is vital for your customer. It assumes that you know what’s best for your user. You don’t.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>No founder knows until they launch their startup and get feedback from people. Your first version is likely going to suck; it might even miss the mark or be utterly irrelevant to the market. You need to get any negative and positive signals from your target market as soon as possible.</p><p>That was what we tried to do with MeetButter. Everyone on our team has had experience getting burnt by wasting time, runway, effort, and emotion building products or features that were inconsequential in the larger picture.</p><p>Here’s the story of how we managed to build and ship MeetButter in three weeks.</p><h3>Step 1 - Identification</h3><figure>

    <figcaption>It started with a thread</figcaption>
  </figure><p>The first spark for MeetButter was a Slack thread discussing the pains teachers and educators were dealing with transitioning their classrooms from offline to online. We found that there was a very human problem with online video conferencing - they only allowed the focus to one speaker at a time. It was awkward interrupting the speaker, and this caused some participants to feel reluctant to engage. The discussion thread grew, with more anecdotes and feedback from our friends and family.</p><p>Identifying the problem is the first step. It’s crucial to figure out the groups of people that are facing the same issues and gathering feedback from them. </p><h3>Step 2 - Investigation</h3><p>We decided to take this asynchronous discussion and organize a synchronous brainstorm session. During this particular session, we discussed three significant problems that we had identified and were interested in solving. On the list was the aforementioned “video conferencing” - which eventually became MeetButter.</p><figure>

    <figcaption>Breaking down the current video conferencing experience</figcaption>
  </figure><p>Some significant points were brought up by everyone on the team, and we found that these were problems that each one of us had faced while doing online video conferencing:</p><ol><li>It’s difficult to indicate an interest in speaking, reply to the current conversation, or add to the discussion without feeling like you’re interrupting the current speaker.</li><li>It’s impossible to transition smoothly between one speaker to the next. Sometimes mid-sentence pauses are met with several speakers trying to enter into the conversation at once. Combined with lag, this can get quite awkward.</li><li>The avoidance of awkwardness causes some people to remain quiet.</li><li>The loudest voice in the room problem - some people naturally dominated discussions.</li><li>Social cues are almost non-existent when your entire team gets boxed into tiny windows on-screen and are only visible from their shoulder up.</li></ol><p>The purpose of this brainstorm was not to narrow down into solutions, but it was to dive deep into the problems.</p><div><p>Adam is typing something... (Click to reveal)</p><p><img src="https://adamthewan.com/static/adam-head-0b2b466e69071c2bd52efa9911165bc6.png"></p></div><h3>Step 3 - Sketching</h3><p>After the brainstorm session, we discussed some ideas on how to tackle the problem. Solutions can seem pretty vague, and usually, what happens is that several keywords get thrown around. For us, it was “queue,” “overlay,” and “polls.” It’s good to note that people often visualize keywords differently and form very different concepts in their heads. </p><p>A picture is worth a thousand words. Sketching is an essential skill to learn for any founder, as it’s the best medium to transfer your ideas with a low signal-noise ratio. People often misunderstand your words. If you’re not good at drawing, it’s good to learn how to sketch out a prototype digitally using free tools like Figma. I have even used Google Slides to build a low fidelity prototype for a client once! Sometimes I even screenshot parts of other apps and combine them into a Frankenstein of an image - anything to help bridge the gap between your vision and their imagination.</p><figure>

    <figcaption>Sketch of the app that turned into MeetButter</figcaption>
  </figure><p>Based on the feedback and ideas from the team, this was the very first sketch for MeetButter that I built using Figma. After sharing it on our team Slack, we held a meeting to discuss the steps moving forward. We decided to cut out some features and instead focus on the queuing functionality as we were able to test it internally during our daily standup calls.</p><h3>Step 4 - Prototyping</h3><p>I won’t go into too much detail about how we built the prototype. This step will be different for every team: some teams will opt to do a no-code prototype using tools like AirTable and Google Forms; some will choose to do a “simulated” prototype using Figma or Zeplin; some will opt to build a fully functioning albeit minimal prototype using code. We decided to do the latter as it was the fastest for me to code something quickly.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>Once you have your prototype, you need to get it in front of some test users. Finding test users can be tricky.  Ideally, the test users should be from within your team; this was the case for us with MeetButter. It meant that we were building a product for ourselves, that we were part of our target market. Building a product to solve your problems has some apparent benefits: </p><ol><li>It creates a shorter and more efficient feedback loop.</li><li>It’s easier to innovate on issues you face</li><li>It somewhat validates your market.</li></ol><p>If you are building a product that’s not for yourself, I’d suggest finding at least ten people within your networks who can become your loyal test users.</p><p>MeetButter was also super easy to integrate into our daily workflow. All we had to do was open up the web app during our regular standup calls. It’s essential to build some sort of feedback loop. I sent a Google Form to the participants of the meeting to gather initial feedback as soon as the meeting ended - it’s best to strike while the iron is hot. We also had several Slack threads discussing additional ideas that came up as we continued testing.</p><h3>Step 6 - Reiteration</h3><p>After testing our prototype, we collected the feedback and went back to the drawing board. At this point, you have to make a clear decision with your prototype - do you continue to reiterate, or do you kill the project? We found that our prototype worked quite well, and although we were skeptical, there was a sense that we were onto something. We started using the prototype in every meeting, so it was hard to deny that our team internally found it useful.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>We repeated the process of designing, reiterating, and receiving feedback several times. Our testing group grew from our internal team of five people out to our friends within our social circles.</p><h3>Final Step - Launch</h3><p>After a few rounds of iterations, our prototype slowly shed its pieces and morphed into something resembling a product. As soon as we exhausted our immediate networks, we knew that the next step was to launch MeetButter beyond internal test users.</p><p>I began to lay the groundwork for a codebase that could grow into a scalable project. Our tech stack ended up being the following:</p><ul><li>Frontend - NextJS with Redux and GraphQL</li><li>Backend - A mix of Firebase and an Express server that’s powered by Apollo GraphQL and Sequelize</li><li>Infrastructure - We used Netlify and AWS to deployment</li></ul><figure>

  </figure><p>Several factors allowed us to build and ship MeetButter quickly.</p><p>Firstly, we were fortunate to have had the experience and the skills to execute quickly. We didn’t run into many technical limitations, as each one of us had filled the significant roles that were needed. These roles include design/UI UX, software development, and marketing/networking.</p><p>Secondly, we tried to follow the best practices for idea generation. The brainstorm that led to MeetButter wasn’t the first one that we had together. It was probably our fifth brainstorm session after getting together as a team as Project Phoenix.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            
<p><em>Hi, I’m Edurne (Eddie), writer &amp; support intern here at Datawrapper and aspiring data journalist. Today’s Weekly Chart is about a question I’ve frequently asked myself in the last few years: can civil resistance foster social change and revolution?</em></p>
<p>Between 2017 and 2019, I had the opportunity to work as a foreign correspondent in Kenya, Japan, and Spain. It was not always easy, but I was lucky to learn many interesting things along the way. I was also constantly on the ‘wire’, reading stories from many countries and learning about their past, culture, and daily lives.</p>
<p>Even before that, while I was studying journalism, I  found myself reading and writing a lot about protests, like the <em>Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong</em> or the <em>Yellow Vests</em> (<em>Gilets Jaunes</em>) movement in France. The images from the Arab spring in 2010 stuck with me the most. And it’s not a coincidence that I read about protests so much: <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/03/10/political-protests-have-become-more-widespread-and-more-frequent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the last few decades have seen an increase in campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>But not all protests are the same: There are violent and peaceful ones. I was wondering: Which of them are successful? To find out, I used data from The Non-violent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (<a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/navco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAVCO</a>) project by Harvard University, the first of its kind to collect systematic data on violent insurgencies and non-violent civil resistance around the world:</p>





<p>NAVCO gathered data on 622 campaigns between 1900 and 2019. As we can see in the chart, in this time, half of the <strong>321 non-violent campaigns succeeded, while only a quarter of their 301 violent counterparts</strong> did. 56% of violent campaigns failed, compared to 30% of non-violent ones.</p>
<p>Erica Chenoweth, a researcher on violence and co-author of the NAVCO Data Project, found even more evidence that non-violent protests are more successful: “Countries in which there were nonviolent campaigns were about 10 times likelier to transition to democracies within a five-year period compared to countries in which there were violent campaigns – whether the campaigns succeeded or failed”, she explained to <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/02/why-nonviolent-resistance-beats-violent-force-in-effecting-social-political-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Harvard Gazette</a>.</p>
<p>You can search through all the 622 campaigns that the NAVCO data set contains here:</p>





<h2 id="Data-concerns">Data concerns</h2>
<p>Because it’s a data set collected by hand instead of measured, it’s important to understand the decisions behind it better.</p>
<p>Launched by Harvard University, the NAVCO Data Project covers different aspects of civil resistance and insurgencies through time. For this article, I decided to analyze the 4th iteration of the project: the <strong><a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ON9XND" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAVCO 1.3 data set</a></strong>, released on March 17 of this year.</p>
<p>While making statements like “non-violent campaigns are more successful”, we need to bear in mind that this data set might not include all campaigns, suffering a so-called <strong>underreporting bias</strong>. The authors of the NAVCO data set also note in their codebook that the included <strong>non-violent campaigns</strong> are <strong>biased toward success:</strong> the large, mature campaigns are most commonly reported. Some non-violent campaigns are crushed in their infancy (and therefore fail) and are not included in this data set.</p>
<p>This bias has, however, been mitigated by looking only at major campaigns with at least 1,000 people participating in the protest. The dataset also only includes protests with a maximalist objective, such as bringing down a government. Despite not being perfect, the NAVCO Data Project is still a reference <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-01/hu-imo012420.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for many researchers and journalists</a> to analyze the effects of both violent and non-violent protests in global politics.</p>
<h2 id="The-process">The process</h2>
<p>One thing I like about data visualization (although it can be daunting) is the amount of trial and error that it requires to come up with the right chart type. The table I finally created was not close to my first idea (at the beginning I wanted to create a scatterplot or even a map!), which shows that visualization can be really rich in variety as well!</p>
<p>Before looking at the data set, I started with a blank piece of paper and wrote down my initial questions. I believe this step comes from my journalistic background: <strong>I treat data sets as interviewees</strong>. The main question – are non-violent protests more or less successful than violent ones? – was easily answered with a pivot table in Google Sheets.</p>
<p>The main work needed to be done on the Datawrapper table. To help readers navigate this big amount of data, I opted for the use of <strong>emojis</strong> in the <strong>“Success”</strong> column. Now you just need a glance to know how the campaign ended. I also decided to bring ongoing campaigns to the front of the table, since those are the insurgencies and protests that are happening at the moment and people have likely been reading about them in the last few years. Finally, I decided to <strong>highlight the non-violent campaigns that ended up in success</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="References">References</h2>

<b>Abstract.</b> ACM's 2018 A.M. Turing Award was about
<em>deep learning</em> in artificial neural networks.
ACM lauds the awardees for work based on algorithms
and conceptual foundations first published by other researchers 
whom the awardees failed to cite
(see </a><a href="#exec">Executive Summary</a>
and Sec. 
<a href="#I">I</a>,
<a href="#V">V</a>, 
<a href="#II">II</a>,
<a href="#XII">XII</a>,
<a href="#XIX">XIX</a>, 
<a href="#XXI">XXI</a>,
<a href="#XIII">XIII</a>, 
<a href="#XIV">XIV</a>,  
<a href="#XX">XX</a>, 
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>).
ACM explicitly mentions "astonishing" deep learning breakthroughs in 4 fields:
<a href="#A"> (A) speech recognition</a>, 
<a href="#B">(B) natural language processing</a>, 
<a href="#C">(C) robotics</a>, 
<a href="#D">(D) computer vision</a>,
as well as "powerful" new deep learning tools in 3 fields: 
<a href="#VII">(VII) medicine, astronomy, materials science</a>.
Most of these breakthroughs and tools, however, were directly based on 
the results of my own labs in the past 3 decades 
 (e.g., Sec.  
<a href="#A">A</a>,
<a href="#B">B</a>,
<a href="#C">C</a>,
<a href="#D">D</a>,
<a href="#VII">VII</a>,
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>,
<a href="#VI">VI</a>,
<a href="#XVI">XVI</a>). 
I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history (e.g., Sec. 
<a href="#II">II</a>,  
<a href="#V">V</a>, 
<a href="#XX">XX</a>,
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>) 
and also 
mention 8 of our direct priority disputes 
with Bengio &amp; Hinton (Sec.  <a href="#XVII">XVII</a>, <a href="#I">I</a>).

<p>We must stop crediting the wrong people for inventions made by others.
Instead let's heed the recent call in the journal <em>Nature</em>:
<b>"Let 2020 be the year in which we value those who ensure that 
science is self-correcting"</b> <a href="#SV20">[SV20]</a>.
Like those who know me can testify, finding and citing original sources of scientific and technological innovations is important to me, whether they are mine or other people's <a href="#DL1">[DL1]</a> <a href="#DL2">[DL2]</a> <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a> <a href="#NASC1">[NASC1-9]</a>. The present page is offered as a resource for computer scientists who share this inclination. 
By grounding research in its true intellectual foundations and crediting the original inventors, 
I am not diminishing important contributions made by popularizers of those inventions. 
My goal is to encourage the entire community to be more scholarly in its efforts, to recognize the foundational work that sometimes gets lost in the frenzy of modern AI and machine learning,
and to fight plagiarism in all of its more or less subtle forms. 
I am also inviting others to contribute additional relevant 
references (send them to <em>juergen@idsia.ch</em>).

<b>I'll point out 
that  highly cited publications of the awardees ignored fundamental 
relevant prior work—this may be the reason for some of  ACM's misattributions.</b>
Since ACM's text is a bit repetitive and redundant, so are the partially overlapping
sections of  my critique.

While Drs. LeCun &amp; Bengio &amp; Hinton (<b>LBH for short</b>)  
have made  useful improvements of algorithms for 
artificial neural networks (<b>NNs</b>) 
and deep learning (e.g., </a><a href="#I">Sec.  I</a>), ACM lauds
them for more visible 
work based on fundamental methods whose inventors they did not cite,
not even in later surveys
(this may actually explain some of  ACM's misattributions). I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history.
Numerous <a href="#References">references</a> can be found under the relevant section links I-XXI 
which adhere to the sequential order of ACM's text <a href="#T19">[T19]</a>
(while this summary groups related sections together).


</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#II">II</a>:</b> 
In contrast to ACM's claims, 
NNs for pattern recognition etc. were introduced long before the 1980s. 
 <b>Deep learning with multilayer perceptrons started in 1965</b> through Ivakhnenko &amp; Lapa
long before LBH who have never cited them, not even in recent work.
<b>In the 1980s,</b> "modern" gradient-based learning 
worked only for rather shallow NNs,
<b>but it became really deep in 1991 in my lab,</b>
first through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201">unsupervised pre-training of NNs</a>, 
then through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">supervised LSTM</a>.
<b>Sec.  <a href="#I">I</a></b> contains 4 subsections 
<b><a href="#A">A</a>, <a href="#B">B</a>, <a href="#C">C</a>, <a href="#D">D</a></b>
on <b>the  4 deep learning "breakthroughs" explicitly 
mentioned by ACM</b>. ACM does not mention that they were 
mostly based on deep learning techniques of my team:

</p><p>
<b>Sec.
<a href="#A">A: Speech Recognition</a></b> (see also <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp; <a href="#XV">XV</a>): The first superior end-to-end neural speech recognition 
combines two methods from my lab: <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a> (1990s-2005) and CTC (2006), applied to speech in 2007. 
Hinton (2012) and Bengio (<a href="#XV">XV</a>)
still used an old hybrid approach of the 1980s and 90s;
Hinton et al. (2012) did not compare it to 
our revolutionary CTC-LSTM (<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">which was soon on most smartphones</a>).

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#B">B: Natural Language Processing</a></b> (see also  <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp;  <a href="#XVI">XVI</a>): 
The first superior end-to-end neural machine translation  
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">soon used for several billions of
translations each day by the big platform companies</a>)
was also based on our <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#C">C: Robotics</a></b>.
Our LSTM trained by <b>Reinforcement Learning</b> (RL) was also the core of the 
most visible breakthroughs in robotics and video games.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#D">D: Computer Vision</a></b>
(see also   
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a> &amp; <a href="#XIV">XIV</a>  &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a>  &amp;  <a href="#VI">VI</a>)
was revolutionized by <b>convolutional NNs</b> (CNNs).
The basic CNN architecture is due to Fukushima (1979). 
NNs with convolutions were later (1987) combined by Waibel with backpropagation and weight sharing, 
and applied to speech. <b>All before</b> LeCun's CNN work  (<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>).
We showed twice (1991-95 and 2006-10) that 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">deep NNs 
don't need unsupervised 
pre-training</a> (in contrast to Hinton's claims). Our team (Ciresan et al.)  
made CNNs fast &amp; deep enough for  
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html">superior computer vision  in 2011</a>,
<b>winning 4 image recognition contests in a row
before Hinton's team won one</b>. ResNet (ImageNet 2015 winner)
is a special case of our earlier <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/highway-networks.html">Highway Nets</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec.  <a href="#XIV">XIV:</a></b>
Again ACM recognizes work that failed to cite the pioneers.
Long before Hinton (2012), Hanson (1990) had a variant of <b>dropout</b>, 
and v. d. Malsburg (1973) had <b>rectified linear neurons</b>; Hinton did not cite them.
Already in 2011,
our deep &amp; fast CNN  more than <b>"halved the error rate for object recognition"</b> (ACM's wording) 
in a computer vision contest 
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/superhumanpatternrecognition.html">where LeCun participated</a>), 
long before Hinton's similar CNN (2012). 
<b>Sec. <a href="#XI">XI</a>:</b>  ACM mentions GPU-accelerated NNs  
pioneered by Jung &amp; Oh (2004). LBH
did not cite them.
Our deep GPU-NN of 2010 debunked <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">unsupervised pre-training (introduced by myself in 1991 and later championed by Hinton)</a>, 
and our GPU-CNN of 2011 was the first  
to win contests in <b>computer 
vision</b> (explicitly mentioned by ACM).
 

</p><p>
<b>Sec.  
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a></b>:
ACM credits LeCun for developing CNNs. However, the foundations of CNNs were laid earlier by 
Fukushima and Waibel  (Sec. <a href="#D">D</a>).
 ACM also explicitly mentions <b>autonomous driving</b> and <b>medical image analysis</b>.
The first team to win relevant international contests in these fields 
through deep CNNs was ours (2011, 2012, 2013).
<b>Sec.  
<a href="#VII">VII</a>:</b> ACM explicitly mentions  <b>medicine</b> and
 <b>materials science</b>. Our deep NNs were the 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/first-time-deep-learning-won-medical-imaging-contest-september-2012.html">first to win medical imaging competitions</a>
 in 2012 and 2013, and the first to apply deep NNs to material defect detection in industry (since 2010).


</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#XII">XII</a> &amp; <a href="#XIX">XIX</a> &amp; <a href="#XXI">XXI</a>:</b> Modern 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html">backpropagation</a>
was first published by Linnainmaa (1970), 
not by LeCun or Hinton or their collaborators (1985) who did not cite Linnainmaa, 
not even in later surveys. 
<b>Sec. 
<a href="#XIII">XIII</a>  &amp; 
<a href="#II">II</a> &amp; 
<a href="#V">V</a> 
</b>
(&amp; 
<a href="#III">III</a> &amp; 
<a href="#IX">IX</a> &amp;
<a href="#X">X</a> &amp;
<a href="#XX">XX</a>):
Ivakhnenko's deep feedforward nets (since 1965) <b>learned 
internal representations</b> long before Hinton's shallower ones (1980s).
Hinton has never cited him.
<b>Sec. <a href="#XX">XX</a>:</b> ACM credits LeCun for work on
<b>hierarchical feature representation</b> which did not cite Ivakhnenko's much earlier work
on this (since 1965).
<b>Sec. <a href="#XXI">XXI</a>:</b> ACM credits LeCun for work on
<b>automatic differentiation</b> which did not cite its inventor Linnainmaa (1970). 
And also for work on
<b>deep learning for graphs</b> that failed to cite 
the earlier work  by Sperduti &amp; Goller &amp; Küchler &amp; Pollack.



</p><p>
<b>Sec. 
<a href="#XV">XV</a>:</b> ACM credits Bengio for hybrids of NNs and  probabilistic models of sequences. 
His work
was not the first on this topic, and is 
not important for <b>modern deep learning speech recognition systems</b> (mentioned by ACM) based on our CTC-LSTM
 (Sec.  
<a href="#A">A</a> &amp; 
<a href="#B">B</a>).
<b>Sec.
<a href="#XVI">XVI</a>:</b> ACM 
credits Bengio for neural probabilistic language models.
Our 1995 neural probabilistic text model greatly predates Bengio's.
ACM mentions NNs that learn
 sequential <b>attention</b>. <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%209">We started this in 1990-93 long before LBH</a> who did not cite this.




</p><p>
<b>Sec.  <a href="#XVII">XVII</a>:</b>
ACM mentions
<b>Generative Adversarial Networks</b> (GANs, 2010-14) of Bengio's team, a special case of
my  Adversarial  
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%205"><b>Artificial Curiosity</b></a>
(1990) which he did not cite. 
I list 7 of 
our <b>additional priority disputes</b> with Bengio &amp; Hinton (more than can be explained by chance),  
on 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%203">vanishing gradients</a> (1991),
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/metalearner.html">meta-learning</a> (1987),

and other topics <a href="#R2">[R2-R6]</a>.








</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#IV">IV</a></b> is on <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/turing.html">Turing</a> (1936) and his predecessors
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/goedel.html">Gödel</a> (1931) and Church (1935).

<b>Sec. <a href="#conclusion">Conclusion:</a></b>
 In the recent <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">decade of deep learning</a>,
most major AI applications mentioned by ACM 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">(speech recognition, language translation, etc.) on billions of devices</a>  (also healthcare applications)
heavily depended on our deep learning techniques and conceptual foundations,

 		<p>“Use managed services.”</p>
<p>If there was one piece of advice I wish I could shout from the mountains to all cloud engineers, this would be it.</p>
<p>Operations, especially operations at scale, are a hard problem. Edge cases become commonplace. Failure is rampant. Automation and standardization are crucial. People with experience running software and hardware at this scale tend to be rare and expensive. The mistakes they’ve made and situations they’ve learned from aren’t easy to pick up.</p>
<p>When you use a managed service from one of the major cloud vendors, you’re getting access to all the wisdom of their teams and the power of their automation and systems, for the low price of their software.</p>
<p>A managed service is a service like AWS relational database service, Google Cloud SQL or Azure SQL Database. With all three of these services, you’re getting best of breed configuration and management for a relational database system. There’s configuration needed on your part, but hard or tedious tasks like setting up replication or backups can be done quickly and easily (take this from someone who fed and cared for a mysql replication system for years). Depending on your cloud vendor and needs, you can get managed services for key components of modern software systems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>File storage</li>
<li>Object caches</li>
<li>Message queues</li>
<li>Stream processing software</li>
<li>ETL tools</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note that these are all components of your application, and will still require developer time to thread together.)</p>
<p>You should use managed services for three reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s going to be operated well. The expertise that the cloud providers can provide and the automation they can afford to implement will likely surpass what you can do, especially across multiple services.</li>
<li>It’s going to be cheaper. Especially when you consider employee costs. The most expensive AWS RDS instance is approximately $100k/year (full price). It’s not an apples to apples comparison, but in many countries you can’t get a database architect for that salary.</li>
<li>It’s going to be faster for development. Developers can focus on connecting these pieces of infrastructure rather than learning how to set them up and run them.</li>
</ul>
<p>A managed service doesn’t work for everyone. If you need to be able to tweak every setting, a managed service won’t let you. You may have stringent performance or security requirements that a managed service can’t meet. You may also start out with a managed service and grow out of it. (Congrats!)</p>
<p>Another important consideration is lock-in. Some managed services are compatible with alternatives (kubernetes services are a good example). If that is the case, you can move clouds. Others are proprietary and will require substantial reworking of your application if you need to migrate.</p>
<p>If you are working in the cloud and you need a building block for your application like a relational database or a message queue, start with a managed service (and self host if it doesn’t meet your needs). Leverage the operational excellence of the cloud vendors, and you’ll be able to build more, faster.</p>

They can't run x86_64 Linux.</p><p>What will happen instead? These tools will fall back on <strong>emulators</strong>.

Note that the emulator is over 6x slower. On an ARM Mac, the amd64 image will instead be 6x slower.</p></div><p>Why can't you update the Docker image to also support ARM? You theoretically could switch your backend to run ARM Linux. However, this would take months - renting out ARM instances, re-building all repositories, and a tense switch over. What if your hosting provider doesn't offer ARM instances with the same system requirements as x86_64? What if you complete this migration and find it runs at half the speed?</p><p>Worse, it might be impossible if your images include files downloaded off the internet, as those are often only compiled for x86_64.</p><div><p><img src="https://bmalehorn.com/static/phantomjs-615e9c8bc9d2deb5ca62a4533c1299d6.png"></p><p>An example of a Docker command that will only work on x86_64. PhantomJS does not release an arm build.</p></div><p>While moving your backend to ARM is far from impossible, it's a serious migration that you shouldn't take lightly. Getting a new laptop isn't enough justification to switch your backend architecture.</p><p>Another option is to <strong>run Docker remotely</strong>. You set up an x86_64 Linux server, then allow Docker to connect to it remotely. From then on, all Docker commands instead run on the server. This is also supported in Docker, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-a-remote-docker-server-to-speed-up-your-workflow">here</a> is a tutorial on setting it up. This is what heavy Docker users will want to do.</p><h2>VirtualBox</h2><p><img src="https://bmalehorn.com/static/virtualbox-c37e4cc82b13d3c1c080f7ced273ae45.png" width="150"></p><p><strong>VirtualBox won't work.</strong></p><p>VirtualBox is a <strong>hypervisor</strong>. Therefore, <strong>it won't be able to run x86 Windows or x86 Linux</strong>.</p><p>You could use VirtualBox to run ARM Windows. Windows already supports ARM, and has a similar binary translation system to Apple's, so it can run x86 binaries. However, VirtualBox only supports x86 hosts and guests and is <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=98742">unlikely to be ported by ARM</a>.</p><p>VMWare Fusion similarly is a hypervisor that only support x86, but <a href="https://twitter.com/VMwareFusion/status/1275483803536908288?s=20">they're thinking about supporting ARM</a>.</p><p>Instead of VirtualBox you might use QEMU, an emulator. However, QEMU is pretty low level and not often used to emulate Windows.</p><h2>Boot Camp</h2><p><img src="https://bmalehorn.com/static/boot-camp-f05493e57b0fe815dbc1d989ada98dd0.png" width="150"></p><p><strong>Boot Camp won't work.</strong></p><p><a href="https://support.apple.com/boot-camp">Boot Camp</a> is an Apple-approved way to dual-boot Mac OS and Windows. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">Boot Camp will definitely not be available on ARM Macs</a>. It might be added later with the ability to run ARM Windows, though Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp">would have to approve</a>.</p><h2>Should I get an ARM Mac?</h2><p>The point of this post isn't to say that ARM Mac is a bad idea, but to give a realistic idea of what developing on one would look like assuming nothing changes. It's possible Apple could release more virtualization tools before the ARM Mac launches.</p><p>Should you get an ARM Mac if you're a developer? If you work largely on frontend, mobile, or native apps, you'll probably be fine. But if you use virtualization often, I wouldn't recommend it. There will be a lot of problems early on, and not all of them will have solutions. My biggest concern is getting an ARM Mac and realizing I simply can't run an essential application on it.</p><p>However if you like troubleshooting these issues and are excited about ARM Mac, go for it! My plan is for those kinds of people to fix these issues.</p><p>Know something I don't? Have questions? Email me at <a href="mailto:bmalehorn@gmail.com">bmalehorn@gmail.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

              <p>Gatsby is one of the most popular JavaScript static site generators available. While static sites offer excellent performance, they only store state locally in the user’s browser, so they can’t provide features like user authentication natively. If you want to add authentication to your Gatsby site, FusionAuth is an excellent solution.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In this blog post, you’ll learn how to create a Gatsby site that uses FusionAuth to allow users to log in and access their profile securely. This application will use an <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/oauth/definitive-guide-to-oauth-2#52-code-flow--pkce">OAuth Authorization Code workflow and the PKCE extension</a> to log users in and a Node application to store your access token securely. PKCE stands for Proof Key for Code Exchange, and is often pronounced “pixie”.</p>

<p>At a high level, the authorization process looks like this:</p>

        <figcaption>Diagram of the OAuth Authorization Code flow with PKCE extension using FusionAuth and Gatsby.</figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll walk through the process step-by-step, but if you want to download the code, it is <a href="https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-gatsby">available on Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-well-cover">What we’ll cover</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Setting up FusionAuth</li>
  <li>Creating a new user</li>
  <li>Creating a Node proxy application</li>
  <li>Creating a Gatsby site</li>
  <li>Conclusion and next steps</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-youll-need">What you’ll need</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://fusionauth.io/download">FusionAuth</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node JS</a> (10+ preferred)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> package manager</li>
  <li>Web browser</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setting-up-fusionauth">Setting up FusionAuth</h2>
<p>Before you start writing any code, download FusionAuth and get it running on your local machine. FusionAuth is available <a href="https://fusionauth.io/download">for all major operating systems</a> or it can be <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/docker">run in Docker</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have FusionAuth running, log into the admin panel and create a new Application. This process <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide">is outlined here</a>, but you’ll need to add your application’s URLs to the OAuth configuration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add <code>http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback</code> to the “Authorized redirect URLs”.</li>
  <li>Add <code>http://localhost:9000</code> to the “Authorized request origin URLs”.</li>
  <li>Enter <code>http://localhost:8000</code> in the “Logout URL” field.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also want to save the “Client Id” and “Client secret” values as you’ll need them later.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-gatsby/application-setup.png" alt="FusionAuth configuration options for a Gatsby static site."></p>

<p>You’ll also need to create an API key. Go to “Settings”, then to “API Keys”. You may create one with adminstrative privileges for the purposes of this tutorial. For a production application, please follow the principle of least privilege and limit the endpoints available to the key. Save the API key off as you’ll need it later.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-user">Creating a new user</h2>
<p>To test your Gatsby-based login, you’ll need to add a new user and register them for your application in FusionAuth. From the Users page in FusionAuth, click “+” to add a user. Enter an email address and password for your new user and click the save button.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-gatsby/create-user.png" alt="Creating a new user in FusionAuth."></p>

<p>Next, click “Add registration” to link this user to the application you created in Step 1. Click the save button when you’re finished.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-gatsby/register-user.png" alt="Registering a user in FusionAuth."></p>

<p>Now that a user is registered for your application, you can start building the Node app.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-node-proxy-application">Creating a Node proxy application</h2>
<p>This project will use two separate applications: a Node app to securely store your access token and make calls to the FusionAuth API, and a Gatsby site to present information to the user. The Node app will have four endpoints:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/login</code> - Generates the FusionAuth login URL with a PKCE challenge</li>
  <li><code>/oauth-callback</code> - Trades the one-time authorization code and PKCE verifier for an access token which is added to session storage</li>
  <li><code>/user</code> - Uses the access token and the FusionAuth <code>introspect</code> endpoint to get information about the current user</li>
  <li><code>/logout</code> - Logs the user out and destroys the session</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll create all the endpoints first, and then you’ll see how to call them from Gatsby.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-node-app">Setting up the Node app</h3>
<p>Before you get started, you need to create a new subdirectory and initialize an Express app. Use a <a href="https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/03/10/securely-implement-oauth-in-react">similar structure to the one outlined here</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>fusionauth-gatsby
├─gatsby
├─server
└─config.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your <code>config.js</code> file should contain all your FusionAuth information. Add the following to the file with your FusionAuth application’s ID, client ID, and ports:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>module.exports = {
  // FusionAuth info (copied from the FusionAuth admin panel)
  clientID: '5eb76e67-c65e-474d-ba23-4cb61b0c8414',
  clientSecret: 'BVS1NIgID3HWE5U38HYSb4DOie3UbIySOsJKLT41WWg',
  redirectURI: 'http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback',
  applicationID: '5eb76e67-c65e-474d-ba23-4cb61b0c8414',

  // Your FusionAuth api key
  apiKey: 'skAHV4mOEhz2zYQcG_5l4BkhsCzmtYTU8VGOi8Y40zo',

  // Ports
  clientPort: 8000,
  serverPort: 9000,
  fusionAuthPort: 9011
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Within the <code>./server</code> directory, create a new <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> app and install the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors">cors</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session">session</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">request</a> packages.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>npm init
<span># Complete all the questions as appropriate</span>
npm <span>install </span>express cors express-session request <span>--save</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, open up your <code>package.json</code> file and add a <code>"start"</code> script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span>
</span><span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"start"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"node index.js"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>//</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, create a new file in the <code>./server</code> directory called <code>index.js</code> that will initialize your Express app:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>session</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express-session</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>cors</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>cors</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>../config</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>// configure Express app and install the JSON middleware for parsing JSON bodies</span>
<span>const</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>();</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>express</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>());</span>

<span>// configure sessions</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>session</span><span>(</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>secret</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>1234567890</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>resave</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>

<p>In the following sections, you’ll create the route files listed in the code above.</p>

<h3 id="creating-the-login-route">Creating the login route</h3>
<p>To generate a login URL, your application will need to create a PKCE verifier and challenge. It will send the challenge to FusionAuth via query string parameters along with your client ID and a redirect URL.</p>

<p>Using PKCE adds an additional layer of security, as it is a one time use and guarantees that the Node application that generated the challenge is the same one that sent the verifier. Normally, PKCE is used where the client cannot keep a secret, such as a single page application.</p>

<p>To generate a <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/">PKCE challenge and verifier</a>, you’ll need to use some of the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html">Node crypto functions</a>. Create a new folder in the <code>./server</code> directory called <code>helpers</code>. Add a new file called <code>pkce.js</code> to the folder. You will generate a verifier and challenge in this file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>crypto</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>crypto</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>function</span> <span>base64URLEncode</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>base64</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>/</span><span>\+</span><span>/g</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>-</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>/</span><span>\/</span><span>/g</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>_</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>/=/g</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>sha256</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>crypto</span><span>.</span><span>createHash</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>sha256</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>).</span><span>digest</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>generateVerifier</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>base64URLEncode</span><span>(</span><span>crypto</span><span>.</span><span>randomBytes</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>generateChallenge</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>verifier</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>base64URLEncode</span><span>(</span><span>sha256</span><span>(</span><span>verifier</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two exported functions, <code>generateVerifier</code> and <code>generateChallenge</code>, will be used in your login route to create a PKCE verifier. Create a new directory called <code>routes</code> in your <code>./server</code> directory and add a new file called <code>login.js</code> to it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>router</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>.</span><span>Router</span><span>();</span>
<span>const</span> <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>../../config</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>pkce</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>../helpers/pkce</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>router</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Generate and store the PKCE verifier</span>
  <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>session</span><span>.</span><span>verifier</span> <span>=</span> <span>pkce</span><span>.</span><span>generateVerifier</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// Generate the PKCE challenge</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>challenge</span> <span>=</span> <span>pkce</span><span>.</span><span>generateChallenge</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>.</span><span>session</span><span>.</span><span>verifier</span><span>);</span>

  <span>// Redirect the user to log in via FusionAuth</span>
  <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>redirect</span><span>(</span><span>`http://localhost:</span><span>${</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>fusionAuthPort</span><span>}</span><span>/oauth2/authorize?`</span><span>+</span>
    <span>`client_id=</span><span>${</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>clientID</span><span>}</span><span>&amp;redirect_uri=</span><span>${</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>redirectURI</span><span>}</span><span>&amp;response_type=code`</span><span>+</span>
    <span>`&amp;code_challenge=</span><span>${</span><span>challenge</span><span>}</span><span>&amp;code_challenge_method=S256`</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>router</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when users visit <code>localhost:9000/login</code> the Node app will generate a PKCE verifier and challenge, save the verifier to session storage, and redirect the user to FusionAuth with the challenge in the URL. The FusionAuth app will store this challenge and make sure that the verifier sent in the OAuth callback is valid.</p>

<h3 id="creating-the-oauth-callback">Creating the OAuth callback</h3>
<p>Once the user has entered their username and password, the FusionAuth server will check their credentials and redirect them to your Node app’s OAuth callback endpoint with an authorization code. Your app will use that code and the PKCE verifier generated in the previous step to request a <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/oauth/tokens">long-lived access token</a>.</p>

<p>Again, adding PKCE adds another layer of security by proving that the entity which sent the challenge is now requesting an access token. Your Node app will store the access token returned by FusionAuth in session storage and redirect the user to the Gatsby profile page we’ll create in the next step.</p>

<p>Create a new route called <code>oauth-callback.js</code> and add the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

A few organizations have even experienced a permanent move towards work from home (WFH) practices. While many are satisfied with the change for different reasons, others can’t seem to wait to get back to the way that work used to be. At this time, employers have to contend to the short and long-term ramifications of new working conditions and its impacts to productivity, communication, culture, cybersecurity and several other issues that have emerged as a result.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As considerations are made, organizations will need to take a holistic approach to ensure a successful transition to a new normal.

Further deliberation regarding the safety of the workforce need to be taken into account. At this time, companies need to be proactive by revisiting internal policies such as Health and Safety policies, WFH policies, Code of Conduct policies, and Cybersecurity policies. As such, it is essential that senior executives work in tandem with officers on the ground to understand the current atmosphere of their organization, its impact on policies and expectations, as well as ensure that enacted policies reach their desired outcomes.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="7c67953" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="360" height="240" src="https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w" data-sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"></p></div></div><div data-id="651f2b8" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Sanitary and Hygiene Practices</h2></p></div><div data-id="24e74cd" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an office environment, organizations have to consider how and whether to shoulder the costs of PPE supplies and training for its employees and customers. If that is not an option, leaders have to contend with personally owned PPE which may be inadequate or non-existent. This may pose unintended consequences that may challenge return to the office efforts and increase customer and employee exposure, potentially leading to disruptions in operations. (<span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/technology/amazon-coronavirus-workers.html">‘Way Too Late’: Inside Amazon’s Biggest Outbreak</a></span>, NY Times).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good personal hygiene such as hand washing and social distancing remains a major part of the fight against COVID-19. To ensure good office practices and training, well positioned pamphlets, workshops, adequate infrastructure, supporting policies, and a culture of cleanliness are just a few of the major drivers of change.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Office cleanliness will remain a priority to both the organization and employees. Even if it is believed that employees are following sanitary and hygiene practices, the organization will likely need to increase the rate of commercial cleaning services throughout its establishment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a pandemic environment, sanitary and hygiene practices are not isolated factors that are bound to stay within the secrecy of a company. For example, a <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-in-germany-meat-packing-plant-covid-19-outbreak-cases-r-reproduction-rate-up-today-2020-06-22/">single meat packing plant in Germany</a></span> is believed to be behind over 1,000 confirmed cases.

Nowadays, there are concerns that these areas will often involve interactions in close proximity, which can further exacerbate pandemic related risks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To lower said risks, organizations need to consider implementing physical distancing and hygiene measures and protocols. At this time, many governmental bodies have stipulated guidelines that can be used to support organizational procedures and help organizations navigate through the reopening of their workplace. The <span><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/">State of California</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-businesses-and-facilities.page">New York City</a></span>, and the <span><a href="https://www.toronto.ca/home/covid-19/covid-19-protect-yourself-others/community-settings-workplaces/">City of Toronto</a></span> are just a few examples of such guidelines being extended to organizations. It is important to follow local guidelines, but whenever possible, borrow additional innovative takes from other jurisdictions.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="776149d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Back to the Office Employee Prioritization</h2></p></div><div data-id="16083af" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teams or roles that demand a higher amount of physical interaction and can’t perform their duties well via online means should be considered as front-runners of back to the office policies. Simultaneously, leaders should critically assess if individuals whose roles are well suited for remote working, should only make the return to the office at the later phase of the pandemic reopening. Such efforts can help reduce health risks to employees and customers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IT department for example, may return back to the office on a rotational basis or in batches (team by team). Employees involved in the preparation and maintenance of physical technology (e.g. servers and hardware support) are likely to be prioritized while most of the software cast may be held back to later phases since their work may be accomplished remotely.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As leadership determines how to prioritize the return to the office, there are a few questions that should always be asked:</p><ul><li>Are there feasible technological or procedural options that can be taken to limit X role’s exposure? If so, would their work be impacted and how?</li><li>How big of a priority would it be to bring certain individuals back to the office under these circumstances?</li><li>Would the solution help potential future disruptions such as a 2<sup>nd</sup> COVID-19 wave?”</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-id="94b69f1" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meeting rooms can follow similar protocols stipulated to shared spaces and common areas, given the limited square footage that such spaces traditionally have which can make it harder to enforce distancing rules and lead to an <span><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-evidence-to-support-the-2-metre-social-distancing-rule-to-reduce-covid-19-transmission/">increased risk of transmission</a></span>. In said cases, organizations may benefit from setting a threshold on the number of employees permitted per meeting and the distances that are expected. Office administrators may want to set delimitators such as a sign to stipulate social distancing and remove excess chairs to help set the precedent. Reminder mechanisms such as pamphlets to clean spaces before and once they have been used can also beneficial.</p></div></div><div data-id="40674cf" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Rotational Work Schedules</h2></p></div><div data-id="0e4000c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To diminish contact, some organizations may benefit from building rotational work schedules where a department or group alternates every couple of weeks. This can help set better social distancing in offices that do not have the capacity to handle prior numbers of employees and clients. Some organizations have already started a two week in office and off office rotation, in which the workforce is divided into 2 groups (or more) which rotate the office space – as seen in the case of <span><a href="https://webstercity.com/2020/03/24/city-staff-to-rotate-on-shifts-in-response-to-covid-19/">Webster City</a></span>, Iowa.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also allows teams to regain some of the interactions and experience that the office can provide while still having work from home flexibility. Organizations may find this to be the right mix of home comfort and office experience. Once COVID-19 related issues subside, organizations may find further operational efficiency in having a mixed policy, allowing it to move into smaller offices with lower costs.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="4111b59" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="360" height="240" src="https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 1080w" data-sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"></p></div></div><div data-id="547cd1e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, most offices are not set-up to accommodate for COVID-19 related concerns such as social distancing.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>BLEU is a standard algorithm for evaluating the machine translations against the human translations. At first I thought it should be very straightforward to use. However, it turns out that there are a lot of caveats.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to show the BLEU algorithm in detail and talk about the caveats.</p>

<h3 id="english-translation-example">English Translation Example</h3>

<p>We will use the following examples to illustrate how to compute the BLEU scores.</p>

<h4 id="example-1">Example 1</h4>

<p>Chinese: 猫坐在垫子上</p>

<p>Reference 1: the cat is on the mat</p>

<p>Reference 2: there is a cat on the mat</p>

<p>Candidate: the cat the cat on the mat</p>

<h4 id="example-2">Example 2</h4>

<p>Chinese: 猫坐在垫子上</p>

<p>Reference 1: the cat is on the mat</p>

<p>Reference 2: there is a cat on the mat</p>

<p>Candidate: the the the the the the the the</p>

<h3 id="precision">Precision</h3>

<p>We count each of the ngram in the candidate sentence whether it has shown in any of the reference sentences, gather the total counts for each of the unique ngram, sum up the total counts for each of the unique ngram, and divided by the number of ngrams in the candidate sentence.</p>

<h4 id="example-1-1">Example 1</h4>

<p>We first compute the unigram precision for example 1. All the unigrams in the candidate sentences have shown in the reference sentences.</p>

<p>The total number of counts for the unique unigrams in the candidate sentence is 7, and the total number of unigrams in the candidate sentence is 7. The unigram precision is 7/7 = 1.0 for example 1.</p>



<p>We then try to compute the bigram precision for example 1.</p>

<p>The total number of counts for the unique bigrams in the candidate sentence is 5, and the total number of bigrams in the candidate sentence is 6. The bigram precision is 5/6 = 0.833 for example 1.</p>

<h4 id="example-2-1">Example 2</h4>

<p>We first compute the unigram precision for example 2. All the unigrams in the candidate sentences have shown in the reference sentences.</p>

<p>The total number of counts for the unique unigrams in the candidate sentence is 8, and the total number of unigrams in the candidate sentence is 8. The unigram precision is 8/8 = 1.0 for example 2.</p>

<h4 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h4>

<p>We can see from example 1 and 2 that unigram precision is very easy to be over-confident about the quality of the machine translation. To overcome this, clipped count and modified precision were proposed.</p>

<h3 id="modified-precision">Modified Precision</h3>

<p>For each unique ngram, we count its maximum frequency in each of the reference sentences. The minimum of this special count and the original count is called the clipped the count. That is to say, the clipped count is no greater than the original count. We then use this clipped count, in place of the original count, for computing the modified precision.</p>

<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>

<p>Compared to precision, we found that modified precision is a better metric, at least for unigrams.</p>

<h3 id="bleu">BLEU</h3>

<h4 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h4>

<p>BLEU is computed using a couple of ngram modified precisions. Specifically,</p>



<p>where $p_n$ is the modified precision for $n$gram, the base of $\log$ is the natural base $e$, $w_n$ is weight between 0 and 1 for $\log p_n$ and $\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n = 1$, and BP is the brevity penalty to penalize short machine translations.</p>



<p>where $c$ is the number of unigrams (length) in all the candidate sentences, and $r$ is the best match lengths for each candidate sentence in the corpus. Here the best match length is the closest reference sentence length to the candidate sentences. For example, if there are three references with lengths 12, 14, and 17 words and the candidate translation is a terse 13 words, ideally the best match length could be either 12 or 14, but we arbitrary choose the shorter one which is 12.</p>



<p>Usually, the BLEU is evaluated on corpus where there are many candidate sentences translated from different source texts and each of them has several reference sentences. Then $c$ is the total number of unigrams (length) in all the candidate sentences, and $r$ is the sum of the best match lengths for each candidate sentence in the corpus.</p>



<p>It is not hard to find that BLEU is always a value between 0 and 1. It is because BP, $w_n$, and $p_n$ are always between 0 and 1, and</p>



<p>Usually, BLEU uses $N = 4$ and $w_n = \frac{1}{N}$.</p>

<h4 id="example-1-3">Example 1</h4>

<p>We have computed the modified precision for some of the ngrams. It is not hard to compute the others. Concretely, we have</p>





<p>Because the corpus only has one translation set and thus $c = 7$ and $r = 7$</p>



<p>We plugin these values to the BLEU equation, the BLEU is</p>



<p>We further compare the BLEU to the BLEU computed using <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>nltk</span>

<span>0.4671379777282001</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The value of <code>bleu</code> is 0.467 which is exactly matching to the BLEU we computed manually.</p>

<h4 id="example-2-3">Example 2</h4>

<p>Similarly,</p>





<p>Because the corpus only has one translation set and thus $c = 8$ and $r = 7$</p>



<p>When we plugin these values to the BLEU equation, actually we would need to compute $\log 0$ which is not mathematically defined. We use a small number $10^{-100}$ instead of $0$ for $p_2$, $p_3$ and $p_4$. The BLEU is</p>



<p>We further also compare the BLEU to the BLEU computed using <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>.</p>

<span>1.2882297539194154e-231</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The value of <code>bleu</code> is 0 which is exactly matching to the BLEU we computed manually.</p>

<p>Note that in the above two examples, due to the candidate sentence is long and we only have one translation in the corpus, thus $\text{BP} = 1$. In practice, there could be scenarios where $\text{BP} &lt; 1$.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In some scenarios, BLEU does not score the translation very well, especially for those short translations with few reference sentences. For example,</p>



<p>Chinese: 你准备好了吗？</p>

<p>Reference 1: are you ready ?</p>

<p>Candidate: you are ready ?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>nltk</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>=</span> <span>"you are ready ?"</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>bleu</span> <span>=</span> <span>nltk</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>.</span><span>bleu_score</span><span>.</span><span>sentence_bleu</span><span>(</span><span>references</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>reference_1</span><span>],</span> <span>hypothesis</span><span>=</span><span>candidate</span><span>,</span> <span>weights</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>])</span>

<span>1.133422688662942e-154</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is actually a very good machine translation to me. However, the BLEU score is 0, which means that the machine translation is totally wrong.</p>



<p>In NLTK, you are allowed to provide <a href="https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.translate.html#nltk.translate.bleu_score.SmoothingFunction">smoothing functions</a>. For example,</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>nltk</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>reference_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"are you ready ?"</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>=</span> <span>"you are ready ?"</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>bleu</span> <span>=</span> <span>nltk</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>.</span><span>bleu_score</span><span>.</span><span>sentence_bleu</span><span>(</span><span>references</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>reference_1</span><span>],</span> <span>hypothesis</span><span>=</span><span>candidate</span><span>,</span> <span>weights</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>],</span> <span>smoothing_function</span><span>=</span><span>nltk</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>.</span><span>bleu_score</span><span>.</span><span>SmoothingFunction</span><span>().</span><span>method7</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>bleu</span><span>)</span>
<span>0.4002926439114545</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time, the value of <code>bleu</code> is 0.4, which is magically higher than the vanilla one we computed without using smoothing functions.</p>



<p>However, one should be always cautious about the smoothing function used in BLEU computation. At least we have to make sure that the BLEU scores we are comparing against are using no smoothing function or the exact same smoothing function.</p>

By using accessibility features in your app, you’re allowing your app to reach a wider audience.</p><p id="d948">Sticking with their commitment to accessibility, Apple has introduced several new features at WWDC20 which help developers make their apps easier and more entertaining for users with disabilities. By making apps more accessible, developers eliminate the need for users to purchase clunky, expensive devices in order to use their apps — everything they need to interact with the app is built right into the device.</p><p id="df0d">In this article, you’ll learn about some of the biggest and best upgrades to accessibility, announced at this year’s WWDC.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="ecb9">The first on the list is an interesting feature — which didn’t get talked about on stage. As the name suggests, Back Tap allows users to set single, double, or triple taps on the back of their iPhones and link them to certain tasks. For example, you could double tap on the back of your iPhone to open the weather app.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg?q=20" width="1200" height="732" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg" width="1200" height="732" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Setting up Back Tap on iOS 14.</figcaption></figure><p id="91c1">And since the tapping feature can be linked to Shortcuts, it opens up a whole range of possibilities with home automation and more! As seen in the example above, you could triple tap the back of your phone to quickly take notes, or you could use it to unlock your door when you’re about to enter the house. Easy, right?</p><p id="563c">For users with hearing impairments, Apple has added the ability to adjust sound frequencies on supported headphones. By doing this, users can now set their own preferences on what they want to hear more of and what they want to hear less of.</p><p id="dc81">The new feature also comes with pre-set profiles for specific outdoor situations, in case the user doesn’t want to manually configure the sound frequencies.</p><blockquote><p id="dba7">This new accessibility feature is designed to amplify soft sounds and adjust certain frequencies for an individual’s hearing, to help music, movies, phone calls, and podcasts sound more crisp and clear. Headphone Accommodations also supports Transparency mode on AirPods Pro, making quiet voices more audible and tuning the sounds of your environment to your hearing needs.</p><p id="8aab">— Apple Documentation</p></blockquote><p id="6a9f">Further, the new feature also supports Transparency Mode on AirPods Pro, which allows users to adjust how much of the surroundings they want to hear. If they want to amplify soft voices or listen to the environment in more detail, they now have that autonomy.</p><p id="d5d2">In the same vein, a new feature called <strong>Sound Recognition</strong> can pick up important sounds in the environment, such as Sirens, Fire Alarms, or Car Horns and alert the user of them. Through machine learning models built into the operating system, these sounds can be picked up and transmitted to the user in any way that they wish.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png?q=20" width="700" height="1110" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png" width="700" height="1110" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 500w" sizes="500px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Real-Time Text on the iPhone.</figcaption></figure><p id="2bf5">Group FaceTime calls have become more important than ever during the global pandemic, and Apple has added a small but important accessibility feature to them. Now, if a member of a group FaceTime call is using sign language to communicate, their video will be automatically pinned.</p><p id="ab6c">Using computer vision to detect this can be a boon to those with hearing loss, since reading sign language while the screen is moving around can be frustrating.</p><p id="43b4">In addition to this, Apple has made further improvements to its Real-Time Text feature, which is used for text based communication during phone calls. Previously, it was difficult for RTT users to multitask during phone calls, but it no longer requires the full screen.</p><p id="0458">When we think of accessibility on iOS, VoiceOver is often the first to come to mind. This year, VoiceOver received several significant updates, making it even more useful than before. If you aren’t familiar with it, VoiceOver is Apple’s screen reader, available on all platforms, including iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.</p><h2 id="ae54">VoiceOver Recognition</h2><p id="aa80">In the past, VoiceOver would require developers to adopt it inside their apps to work well on third-party apps.</p><blockquote><p id="210b">On-device intelligence recognizes key elements displayed on your screen to add VoiceOver support for app and web experiences that don’t have accessibility support built in. — Apple</p></blockquote><p id="2717">This year, Apple is tapping into their machine learning technology to semantically detect where and how to use VoiceOver on unsupported apps. This makes virtually all apps natively supported by VoiceOver and increases their accessibility for those with visual impairments.</p><h2 id="6119">Image Descriptions</h2><p id="6f0d">To make VoiceOver even more useful, Apple has used its computer vision library with <em>even more</em> machine learning to detect the contents of an image.</p><blockquote><p id="2f5f">VoiceOver reads complete-sentence descriptions of images and photos within apps and on the web. VoiceOver speaks the text it identifies within images and photos. — Apple</p></blockquote><p id="f5ed">Instead of simply stating that an image is present, VoiceOver can now provide detailed descriptions of what’s pictured in an image for more useful information to VoiceOver users. It can also detect text in an image through optical character recognition — another great way that machine learning is being used in the iOS 14 update!</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d6f7">Evidently, there have been plenty of great updates at WWDC20 in accessibility, with even more that weren’t listed here. By releasing a large number of small features, Apple has made their devices more accessible than ever. And, they’ve supercharged many of their flagship accessibility solutions by coupling machine learning technology with them.</p><p id="ab7f">Be sure to <strong>smash that “clap” button</strong> as many times as you can, <strong>share this tutorial</strong> on social media, and <strong>follow me on Twitter.</strong></p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="08a6"><em>Editor’s Note:</em><a href="http://heartbeat.fritz.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> </em><strong><em>Heartbeat</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>is a contributor-driven online publication and community dedicated to exploring the emerging intersection of mobile app development and machine learning.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>This is a collection of random thoughts regarding the application of
permacultural ideas to the computer world.</p>

<p>Some have tried to connect these worlds before (<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?PermaCulture">WikiWikiWeb's Permaculture
article</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent
Beck</a>'s short-lived idea of <a href="https://www.softwarequotes.com/showquotes.aspx?id=559&amp;name=Kent%20Beck">Permaprogramming</a>),
but these have mostly concentrated on enhancing software engineering
practices with some ideas from gardening. I am more interested in the aspect
of cultural and ecological permanence. That is, how to give computers a
meaningful and sustainable place in a human civilization that has a
meaningful and sustainable place in the planetary biosphere.</p>

<h2>1. Problem</h2>

<p>Over the last few hundred years of human civilization, there has been a
dramatic increase in the consumption of artificially produced energy. In the
overarching story, this is often equated with "progress".</p>

<p>In the computer world, this phenomenon gets multiplied by itself:
"progress" facilitates ever greater densities of data storage and digital
logic, thus dramatically exploding the availability of computing resources.
However, the abundance has also caused an equivalent explosion in
wastefulness, which shows in things like mindblowingly ridiculous hardware
requirements for even quite trivial tasks.</p>

<p>At the same time, computers have been failing their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines">utopian
expectations</a>. Instead of amplifying the users' intelligence, they rather
amplify their stupidity. Instead of making it possible to scale down the
resource requirements of the material world, they have instead become a
major part of the problem. Instead of making the world more comprehensible,
they rather add to its incomprehensibility. And they often even manage to
become slower despite becoming faster.</p>

<p>In both computing and agriculture, a major issue is that problems are too
often "solved" by increasing controllability and resource use. Permaculture
takes another way, advocating methods that "let nature do the work" and thus
minimize the dependence on artificial energy input. Localness and
decentralization are also major themes in the thought.</p>

<p>What makes permacultural philosophy particularly appealing (to me) is
that it does not advocate "going back in time" despite advocating a dramatic
decrease in use of artificial energy. Instead, it trusts in human ingenunity
in finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions, competition
into co-operation, waste into resources. Very much the same kind of creative
thinking I appreciate in computer hacking.</p>

<p>The presence of intelligent life in an ecosystem can be justified by its
strengthening effect. Ideally, humans could make ecosystems more flexible
and more resilient because of their ability to take leaps that are difficult
or impossible for "unintelligent" natural processes. The existence of
computers in a human civilization can be justified by their ability to
augment this potential.</p>

<h2>2. Physical resources</h2>

<h3>2.1. Energy</h3>

<p>Permaculture emphasizes resource-sensitivity. Computers primarily use
electricity, so to them resource-sensitivity primarily means 1) adapting to
changes in energy conditions and 2) using the available energy wisely.
Today's computers, even mobile ones, are surprisingly bad at this. This is
partially due to their legacy as "calculation factories" that are constantly
guaranteed all the resources they "need".</p>

<p>Intense non-urgent computation (such as long machine learning batches)
would take place only when a lot of surplus energy is being produced or
there is a need for electricity-to-heat conversion. This requires that the
computer is aware of the state of the surrounding energy system.</p>

<p>At times of low energy, both hardware and software would prefer to scale
down: background processes would freeze, user interfaces would become more
rudimentary, clock frequencies would decrease, unneeded processors and
memory banks would power off. At these times, people would prefer to do
something else than interact with computers.</p>

<p>It is often wise to store energy for later use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage">Flywheels</a>
are a potential alternative to chemical batteries. They have similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density">energy densities</a>
(MJ/kg) but require no rare-earth materials and last for decades or
centuries instead of mere years.</p>

<h3>2.2. Silicon</h3>

<p>IC fabrication requires large amounts of energy, highly refined machinery
and poisonous substances. Because of this sacrifice, the resulting
microchips should be treasured like gems or rare exotic spices. Their active
lifespans would be maximized, and they would never be reduced to their raw
materials until they are thoroughly unusable.</p>

<p>Instead of planned obsolescence, there should be planned longevity.</p>

<p>Broken devices would be repaired. If the community needs a kind of device
that does not exist, it should preferrably be built from existing components
that have fallen out of use. Chips should be designed open and flexible, so
that they can be reappropriated even for purposes they were never intended
for.</p>

<p>Complex chips should have enough redundancy and bypass mechanisms to keep
them working even after some of their internals wear out. (In a multicore
CPU, for instance, many partially functioning cores could combine into one
fully functioning one.)</p>

<p>Chips that work but whose practical use cannot be justified can find
artistic and other psychologically meaningful use. They may also be stored
away until they are needed again (especially if the fabrication quality and
the storage conditions allow for decades or centuries of "shelf life").</p>

<p>Use what is available. Even chips that do "evil" things are worth
considering if there's a landfill full of them. Crack their DRM locks,
reverse-engineer their black boxes, deconstruct their philosophies. It might
even be possible to reappropriate something like Bitcoin-mining ASICs for
something artistically interesting or even useful.</p>

<p>Minimized on-chip feature size makes it possible to do more computation
with less energy but it often also means increased fragility and shorter
lifespans. Therefore, the densest chips should be primarily used for
purposes where more computation actually yields more. (In entertainment use,
for example, a large use of resources is nothing more than a decadent
esthetic preference.)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_computing">Alternatives
to semiconductors</a> should be actively researched. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328395242_Towards_fungal_computer">Living
cells</a> might be able to replace microchips in some tasks sometime in the
future.</p>

<p>Once perfectly clean ways of producing microchip equivalents have been
taken to use, the need for "junk fetishism" will probably diminish.</p>

<h3>2.3. Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>Whenever bright external light is available, displays should be able to
use it instead of competing against it with their own backlight. (See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transflective_liquid-crystal_display">Transflective
LCD</a>)</p>

<p>Personally-owned computers are primarily for those who dedicate
themselves to the technology and thus spend considerable amounts of time
with it. Most other people would be perfectly happy with shared hardware.
Even if the culture and society embraced computers more than anything else,
requiring everyone to own one would be an overkill.</p>

<h2>3. Observation and interaction</h2>

<p>The first item in many lists of permacultural principles is "Observe and
interact." I interpret this as primarily referring to a bidirectional and
co-operative relationship with natural systems: you should not expect your
garden to be easily top-down controllable like an army unit but accept its
quirkiness and adapt to it.</p><h3>3.1. Observation</h3>

<p>Observation is among the most important human skills computers can augment.
Things that are difficult or impossible for humans to observe can be brought
within human cognitive capacity by various computational processes. Gathered
information can be visualized, slight changes and pattern deviances
emphasized, slow processes sped up, forecasts calculated. In Bill Mollison's
words, "Information is <em>the</em> critical potential resource. It becomes
a resource only when obtained and acted upon."</p>

<p>Computer systems should also make their own inner workings as observable as
possible. If the computer produces visual output, it would use a fraction of
its resources to visualize its own intro- and extrospection. A computer that
communicates with radio waves, for example, would visualize its own view of
the surrounding radio landscape.</p>

<p>Current consumer-oriented computing systems often go to ridiculous
lengths to actually prevent the user from knowing what is going on. Even
error messages have become unfashionable; many websites and apps just
pretend everything is fine even if it isn't. This kind of extreme
unobservability is a major source of technological alienation among computer
users.</p>

<p>The visualizations intended for casual and passive observation would be
pleasant and tranquil while making it easy to see the big picture and notice
the small changes. Tapping into the inborn human tendency to observe the
natural environment may be a good idea when designing visualizers. When the
user wants to observe something more closely, however, there is no limit in
how flashy, technical and "non-natural" the presentation can be, as long as
the observer prefers it that way.</p>

<h3>3.2. Yin and yang hacking</h3>

<p>Traditional computer hacking is often very "yang". A total understanding and
control of the target system is valued. Changing a system's behavior is
often an end in itself. There are predefined goals the system is pushed
towards. Optimization tends to focus on a single measurable parameter.
Finding a system's absolute limits is more important than finding its
individual strengths or essence.</p>

<p>In contrast, "yin" hacking accepts the aspects that are beyond rational
control and comprehension. Rationality gets supported by intuition. The
relationship with the system is more bidirectional, emphasizing
experimentation and observation. The "personality" that stems from
system-specific peculiarities gets more attention than the measurable specs.
It is also increasingly important to understand when to hack and when just
to observe without hacking.</p>

<p>The difference between yin and yang hacking is similar to the difference
between permaculture and …</p></div>

<h2>ResolutionKit</h2>
<p>
A framework for change.
</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the longest time, I've been afraid to speak up about my story with App Review, fearing I'd put my popular app at risk. I've now decided that being transparent and sharing my experience to help others is worth it, so here it goes:👇</p>— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1274356729224892416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>
I admire Apple, and I believe the world is a better place because of them. As a developer, I’ve made my career on their platform and I’m grateful for it.
But I have some criticism. I’m&nbsp;<b>not</b>&nbsp;here to talk about my story, the 30% Apple developer cut, the App Review process, or to challenge any of their guidelines.
I want to talk about&nbsp;<em>transparency</em>, and <em>accountability</em>.
</p>
<p>
For far too long, developers have been discouraged from being able to share their rejection stories with the world.
"If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps", used to be the official guidance.
The risk too great for most, the fear of retribution overwhelming.
And so the stories have largely remained in the shadows, with only a few exceptions.
But there’s another, critical reason why such stories rarely see the light of day, one that hasn’t received enough attention:
</p>
<blockquote><b>Apple is systematically erasing our stories.</b></blockquote>

<p>
Unless we’re talking about your most recent submission, all communication you have <em>ever</em> sent or received through the "Resolution Center" is inaccessible to you.
Rejection notices, appeal results, anything you might want to reference to better understand previous about your product - it's all gone.
Unless you have meticulously and manually kept copies of all correspondence, what happened in the past will forever stay in the past. But why should it?
</p>
<p>
It’s not hard to see why Apple is doing this.
It <em>is</em> hard, however, to see a reason that benefits anyone but Apple.
In doing so, they gain more peace of mind, less worry about consistency and correctness in applying the public guidelines.
The appeal mechanism helps them improve, but only to the extent that Apple deems necessary.
If we ever wanted to know how well Apple is enforcing the guidelines, we have to take their word for it.
But who guards the guardians, when App Review’s accountability to the world has been intentionally reduced to the bare minimum?
</p>
<p>
Transparency is not always the solution.
We can’t expect Apple to be open about their future product plans, for example.
But when they communicate with developers, they should do so like everyone is watching - every time.
And to get there, the <em>possibility</em> that everyone might find out needs to always be on the table.
</p>
<p>
So Apple, please help us see App Review as a reliable ally.
Let us access our past communications with you - including phone call records if we choose to.
Show us that you want to be accountable for what you communicate to developers. There may be some legal challenges, but transparency is a prerequisite to accountability.
It’s only then that we can begin to have a fair and honest discussion with you about the actual process and guidelines.
Because until then, we’re in the shadows.

This release includes an update to both the open source and enterprise versions of Gloo.</span></p><p><b>Highlights of the release include:</b></p><ul><li><span>Improvements to system scalability</span></li><li><span>Expanded support for Kubernetes Ingress&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Support for the latest Istio 1.6 release</span></li><li>Security enhancements</li><li><span>User experience enhancements for Dev and Ops</span></li><li><span>Plus more options for configuring Gloo&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>Join us for a webinar on </span><b>July 16th</b><span> to learn more about this latest release, get a deep dive into the features and demos – </span><a href="https://solo.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_1w-yxlabQD6L9GkzP01eww"><span>Register today to save your seat.</span></a><span> Meanwhile, keep reading to get an overview of the new release.</span></p><h2><span>Improvements to System Scalability&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>In this release we’ve made updates to improve the scalability of Gloo including managing multiple data planes with the </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2257"><span>ability set granular per gateway level external authentication and rate limiting policies</span></a><span> along with improved status reporting between the multiple instances, and the </span><span>ability to use </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3047"><span>multiple instances of Gloo to partition Ingress objects</span></a><span> within a single cluster.</span></p><h2><span>Expanded Support for the Kubernetes Ingress&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>In addition to API Gateway, Gloo can be deployed as a Kubernetes Ingress Controller and in this release we’ve added configuration options including</span> <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3050"><span>support for named ports on Kubernetes Ingress </span></a><span>objects, ability to use </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3047"><span>multiple Gloo controllers to partition Ingress objects</span></a><span> within a single cluster using the customIngressClass variable to the Gloo Helm Chart, and a </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3051"><span>fix to keep the&nbsp; Ingress Controller</span></a><span> (ingress pod) processing Ingress updates even when a Ingress backend is incorrectly referencing a service port.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Support for Istio 1.6&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Gloo seamlessly integrates with service mesh environments and provides mTLS between the ingress traffic to the rest of the cluster. In this release, Gloo has been tested and validated to work with the latest </span><a href="https://istio.io/latest/"><span>Istio 1.6</span></a><span> release. Additionally, </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2703"><span>Gloo now supports ALPN on the upstream</span></a><span> for more granular control on defining which protocol to use and helps with the integration to the latest version of Istio. Try the Gloo and Istio integration tutorial </span><a href="https://docs.solo.io/gloo/latest/guides/integrations/service_mesh/gloo_istio_mtls/"><span>here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Security Enhancements&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>In this release we expanded security capabilities to protect the Gloo system and applications in the environment including </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2929"><span>supporting TLS in the external auth service</span></a><span>&nbsp; instead of through an envoy sidecar to handle the TLS termination, the addition of </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/1525"><span>audit logs for the Modsecurity Web Application Filter</span></a><span> (WAF) as part of the access logs to assist debugging and auditing purposes, encrypted communication is now possible with </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2134"><span>mTLS between Gloo and Envoy instances</span></a><span> for when these components are deployed to separate environments, and an </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3084"><span>update to the Gloo permissions</span></a><span> reduces the surface area for risk by enabling it to run in a fully restricted Kubernetes environment.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>User Experience Improvements for Developers and Operations</span></h2><p><span>Across the CLI and Admin UI we’ve made a number of improvements to expand the functionality of glooctl, expand observability capabilities and error handling to resolve system issues.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><b>glooctl</b><b> updates include</b><span> extending the timeout period for port forwarding from 3 to 30 seconds before a</span> <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2771"><span>connection refused errors is displayed</span></a><span> improves how commands like </span><span>glooctl check</span><span> or </span><span>glooctl proxy dump</span> <span>work in high latency environments with more time to finish, the </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2715"><span>glooctl add route</span></a><span> command no longer creates a route table or virtual service with the</span><span> –dry-run </span><span>flag, and </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2581"><span>glooctl check</span><span> now uses the default namespace</span></a><span> if a specific namespace flag is not provided.</span></li><li><span>The Admin UI has</span> <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2812"><span>new tags in the Granfana dashboards</span></a><span> for Envoy and Kubernetes and supports </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2804"><span>additional observailiby use case</span></a><span>s with gRPC access logging service metrics.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Better error handling by </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2905"><span>logging a clear message</span></a><span> when the upstream port does not match the underlying Kubernetes service, </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2660"><span>report a status</span></a><span> when an upstream points to a non-existent service, and an </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2880"><span>update to the error message display to only show the issue </span></a><span>vs. the entire message.</span></li></ul><h2><span>Expanded Configuration Options for Gloo&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>As a flexible control plane to Envoy Proxy, Gloo is built to support a wide range of deployment scenarios and use cases. In this release we’ve added a number of new options for the admins to customize the behavior of the Gloo environment and traffic handling.</span></p><ul><li><b>New Buffer Filter Improves Request Handling:</b> <span>Gloo now supports enabling the </span><a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/buffer/v3/buffer.proto#extensions-filters-http-buffer-v3-buffer"><span>Envoy buffer filter</span></a><span> which buffers the entire request before routing it to the service to process the request. This is important because it helps the system understand how big the request is (in case the request size is too big), which avoids having to deal with partial requests and high network latency. </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2444"><span>The buffer filter can be set </span></a><span>by configuring </span><span>spec.httpGateway.options.buffer </span><span>of the desired gateway and can optionally </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2835"><span>configure the bytes limit on the upstream connection</span></a><span> (default is 1MiB).&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>Update to validation webhook: </b><span>Now </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2114"><span>validates inja compilation syntax</span></a><span> before accepting/rejecting virtual services that use transformations, allowing users to properly validate whether configurations are valid against live clusters before applying them&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>SSL Configuration Update: </b><span>Now allows for </span><span>specifying </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2871"><span>empty SSL configurations for clients</span></a><span> depending on the use case.</span></li><li><b>Helm Chart Updates Expand Available Settings: </b><span>They include two enhancements for Knative including the ability to </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2778"><span>assign a static IP to the Knative external proxy</span></a><span> and to </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/pull/2683"><span>override the Service type</span></a><span> as an alternative to Load Balancer for Ingress Proxy and Knative. Additionally, the nodeport numbers for the gateway proxy service can now&nbsp; </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2899"><span>be predefined in the values.yml</span></a><span>. We also added a </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3016"><span>new value to disable the validation admission webhook</span></a><span> for users who cannot use webhooks but still want to use the Gloo validation API, this value makes it more straightforward to implement.&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>Improved heading formatting:</b><span> The Envoy </span><span>core.Http1ProtocolOptions.HeaderKeyFormat</span><span> is available in the Gloo API as </span><span>httpConnectionManager.http_protocol_options.proper_case_header_key_format</span><span> which</span> <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2940"><span>formats the header by proper casing</span></a> <span>which helps with validating the headers.</span></li></ul><ul><li><b>Upstream reference by name: </b><span>This allows virtual services, route tables, and upstreams to </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2730"><span>refer to an upstream by name only</span></a><span>, </span><span>without causing an error.

server, and your server responds with some HTML potentially linked to some JS and CSS.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>How and when you generate those HTML, CSS and JS content is however an entirely different thing. You might want
to prepare them all in advance and have your server just serve them (pre-rendering), 
you might have your server generate them on the fly (SSR),

You might even generate requested content on the server and ship it with the code that 
would generate subsequently requested content on the browser (isomorphic).</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>There is one particular approach pretty suitable for blogs: you prepare most of the content before hand, then
serve it alongside code that would wire-in interactive bits and generate fully dynamic components. This is called
the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a>, and it is the approach used by <a href="https://coding.blog/"><code>coding.blog</code></a> and

delivery method, and allows you to simply use a CDN instead of writing a server for serving your content.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/pre-rendering-dark.svg" alt="Pre-Rendering"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/pre-rendering.svg" alt="Pre-Rendering"></p></div><p>Server Side Rendering (SSR)</p><p>Instead of preparing the content, you can generate them on-the fly on your server, in response to each request.
This is perhaps useful when your content needs to change based on incoming requests, and perhaps you need to
get some data from some API to be able to create the content. However, this approach is obviously much slower
than pre-rendering.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/ssr-dark.svg" alt="SSR"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/ssr.svg" alt="SSR"></p></div><p>Client-Side Rendering and SPAs</p><p>Highly interactive and dynamic content means you need to generate content on the client-side. To avoid having
content-generation code in multiple places (which is hard to maintain / scale), you could instead conduct all
content generation on the client browser, having your server just ship the content generation code.</p><p>To avoid shipping the content generation code for each page of your site, you can also take control of the 
navigation on the client side, which leads to a <em>Single Page Application</em> (SPA for short). This is the basis
of all modern front-end frameworks.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/csr-dark.svg" alt="CSR &amp; SPA"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/csr.svg" alt="CSR &amp; SPA"></p></div><p>Client-side rendering means the user should wait extra time for being able to see the content, since typically
servers are faster at generating content. It also messes up with SEO, since crawlers might not be able to even
get the content in its full form (since they are not browsers) and so might not be able to properly index it.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>Isomorphic Apps</p><p>To overcome these issues without spreading the content generation code in multiple places, the concept of <em>isomorphic apps</em>
was introduced. The idea is to basically run the same code both on the server and on the client, while also shipping
the code itself to the client alongside content rendered on the server.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/isomorphic-dark.svg" alt="Isomorphic Apps"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/isomorphic.svg" alt="Isomorphic Apps"></p></div><p>The complexity of isomorphic apps inevitably brings extra constraints and overheads. For example, you need to re-hydrate
the content on client-side, which means you are limited on how you manipulate that content (e.g. for React SSR, React needs
to maintain full control of the DOM tree). These complexities also make it harder to optimize performance since many more
components and their interactions are affecting it.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>JAMStack Apps</p><p>Another approach would be to pre-render all your static content and then ship the code for filling in dynamic/interactive
parts to the client. This would allow for the same delivery speed of pre-rendering without sacrificing interactivity
of the content. It also implies a clear separation in the code-base as opposed to isomorphic apps: there is code that
pre-renders stuff, and there is code that goes to client and makes stuff interactive.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/jamstack-dark.svg" alt="JAMStack"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/jamstack.svg" alt="JAMStack"></p></div><p>The JAMStack architecture is specifically suitable for mostly static content, which makes it a perfect choice
for likes of <strong>CODEDOC</strong> (which is for documentation / guides about codes) and <code>coding.blog</code> (which is for blogs about
coding / programming). The simplicity of the workflow allows for easy optimization and high degrees of interoperability
and extensibility.</p><hr><p>While the JAMStack architecture was the most suitable for <a href="https://codedoc.cc/"><strong>CODEDOC</strong></a> and <a href="https://coding.blog/"><code>coding.blog</code></a>,
it mandates a split of content generation code into bits that are executed at build stage and bits that are
shipped to the client. This can quickly add a lot of complexity/overhead for any growing project, so we had to
find a solution that addressed this particular issue.</p><p>In other words, we needed to:</p><ul><li>have a shared component system</li><li>easily mark client-side components so that they are not pre-rendered</li><li>seamlessly where these components were to be rendered in the DOM tree</li><li>conveniently and efficiently collect and bundle the code of these clients</li><li>conveniently attach these bundles to pre-rendered content</li></ul><marker><br>

</marker><p>Additionally, we wanted a minimal toolchain and stack with maximum extensibility and interoperability. Generally
we wanted knowledge of HTML/JS/CSS to suffice for serious customization, which made a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>-based 
syntax an optimal choice for our component system (specifically as Typescript supports it out of the box).</p><p>However, we couldn't use a library like React (or any VirtualDOM based solution) since its sensitivity to external changes to 
the DOM tree meant limitations on how the DOM is manipulated by extensions, either during pre-rendering or on the client.
Besides, we needed our content to be as light-weight as possible, which simply prohibited relatively heavy-weight
operations such as VirtualDOM diffing.</p><hr><p>To satisfy our design goals, we created a JSX-based rendering tool which directly sits on top of DOM APIs.
This is called <a href="https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/connective-html">CONNECTIVE HTML</a>, and on a basic level
is merely a wrapper of DOM APIs that allows using them via JSX:</p><pre><code tabindex="0"><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span><p><span>1</span><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Renderer <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@connectv/html'</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>2</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>const</span> renderer <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Renderer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>4</span>renderer<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Hellow World!</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span>body<span>)</span><span>;</span></p><br></code></pre><p>For more dynamic/reactive content, we simply added plugins to allow rendering 
<a href="https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/observable">RxJS Observables</a>:</p><pre><code tabindex="0"><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span><p><span>1</span><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Renderer <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@connectv/html'</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>import</span> <span>{</span> timer <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'rxjs'</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>3</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>const</span> renderer <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Renderer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>5</span>renderer<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>You have been here for </span><span>{</span><span>timer</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1000</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span> second(s).</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>)</span></p><p><span>6</span>        <span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span>body<span>)</span><span>;</span></p><br></code></pre><p>This of course meant that for interactive components familiarity with <a href="https://www.learnrxjs.io/">RxJS</a> was required, 
however, you generally do require familiarity with some reactive state management library to be able to 
properly create interactive components. RxJS might not be the easiest such library for people to dive in, but
considering its widespread usage and the overall performance gain, we felt this was a compromise well worth it.</p><blockquote><p>Fun fact: Historically CONNECTIVE HTML was developed first and CODEDOC as a tool to document it. However
as a result of popularity of CODEDOC and subsequently <code>coding.blog</code>, I haven't found the time to use it 
for its original purpose yet.</p></blockquote><hr><p>To meet the remainder of our design goals, we created a tool named <a href="https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/connective-sdh">CONNECTIVE SDH</a>. 
SDH stands for <em>Static/Dynamic HTML</em>, which means this library allowed us to seamlessly create both static (pre-rendered) 
and dynamic (rendered on client-side) HTML content.</p><p>This is how CONNECTIVE SDH works:</p><marker><br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apache Kafka has gained traction as one of the most widely adopted technologies for building streaming applications - but introducing it (and scaling it) into your business can be a struggle.</p><p>The problem isn’t with Kafka itself so much as the different components you need to learn and different tools required to operate it.</p><p>For those motivated enough, you can invest money, effort and long Friday nights into learning, fixing and streamlining Kafka - and you’ll get there.&nbsp;</p><p>But for those that prefer to spend time focusing on the data and would rather master Kafka’s value than its inner-workings, fear not.&nbsp;</p><p>When we started Lenses.io, we experienced first-hand how difficult it can be to set up a Kafka development environment; so we decided to follow an anti-pattern and create a docker image with a full-fledged Kafka installation: the<a href="https://github.com/lensesio/fast-data-dev"> fast-data-dev docker</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/dH7CDIWIgsRCvAqBzqE31/90912a877cfab5860632ea82905ed00d/kafka_docker.PNG" alt="Lenses Kafka docker"></span></p><p>
The community loved it and we are grateful for this.&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward and we created Lenses.io, understanding that now the challenge was operating Kafka and real-time applications and data. So we wanted to create a tool to provide the best developer experience for Kafka: Lenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is only natural that we had to add it to fast-data-dev and make it free for developers, the people to whom we owe our success.</p><p>Hence, enter the Lenses Box; our most popular download!</p><h3>A complete Kafka-in-a-box</h3><p>To start with, the Box gives you an environment including:
</p><ul><li><p><b>1-node Kafka and Zookeeper</b>: your Kafka service, ready to receive data.</p></li><li><p><b>Kafka Connect</b>: use it to bring data in and out of Kafka, from DBs for example.</p></li><li><p><b>Schema Registry</b>: safely control the structure of your data in Kafka, powered by Avro.</p></li><li><p><b>Elasticsearch</b>: ship your streaming results here for powerful search.</p></li></ul><p>All in a single docker container.</p><p>That’s already quite a lot of time off your plate. Then we package....</p><h3>... A DataOps workspace</h3><p>
In the same container, you’ll get a Lenses.io workspace fully integrated with the Kafka environment.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re not familiar with Lenses.io, it’s an engineering portal for building &amp; operating real-time applications on Apache Kafka.</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/7DWv3Bt0Hktaxp0wffQrPV/5732afddba639697e37f3342beafbe0d/Portal_blog_copy.jpg" alt="Lenses.io Box Apache Kafka docker container for localhost development"></span></p><h3>How does Box help me develop real-time applications?</h3><p>
As a docker container that unifies all these different technologies into a single developer experience, Box is a perfect solution to learn Kafka or to develop real-time applications on a local instance before promoting to another Kafka environment.&nbsp;</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/sXmd6nQXmkgivJ9ejXxhh/5d6cc3687660dd1ac5655348bf1bf240/Portal_blog2.jpg" alt="Portal blog2"></span></p><p>So, if you’re a developer, you can <code>docker&nbsp;run</code> Lenses.io Box on your machine and try out the following use cases.</p><h3>Connect custom applications &amp; explore data in streams</h3><p>Connect your custom application, written in whatever framework you choose, to the Kafka broker just like you would with any other Kafka environment. Once you’ve done this, you’ll have full visibility into your custom application within a workspace. This includes being able to explore data in the streams using SQL, viewing and alerting on lag. If you use the <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/dev/topology/index.html">Topology client</a>, you’ll be able to even see the full topology of your pipelines.&nbsp;
</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/56OrFbezKepp4RQZEqz7Xn/27a231c4ae58faddbd8e2f0025f74832/image.png" alt="IntelliJ - Connecting consumer or producer client to Lenses.io Box localhost Apache Kafka broker"></span></p><h3>Build &amp; evolve schemas</h3><p>
Your gateway into streaming structured data. With support for multiple standard serialization formats, custom formats, and Schema Registry, you can use Box to understand your data and experiment with schemas and evolution. Lenses SQL gives you a perfect playground to iterate and verify your schema changes.

If so, use it to create schemas directly. For example the following statement will create a topic with an AVRO schema for the value of the topic.&nbsp;
</p><pre>CREATE&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;customers&nbsp;(id&nbsp;string,&nbsp;name&nbsp;string,&nbsp;postcode&nbsp;string,&nbsp;city&nbsp;string)</pre><pre></pre><pre>FORMAT&nbsp;(string,&nbsp;avro)</pre><pre></pre><pre>PROPERTIES&nbsp;(partitions=3,&nbsp;compacted=false);&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>You can run these statements from the browser or from a CLI</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/nObbLUdN7CVPbGKWxf4n8/30e14ad7dbc9797d690238f2817fdcba/image.png" alt="Lenses.io CLI - create Apache Kafka topic and AVRO schema from command line with SQL"></span></p><h3>Test a microservice by injecting data into a stream using SQL</h3><p>
If you’re developing a streaming application that will be read from Kafka, you are effectively making a <b>Kafka consumer.</b> You will be connecting it to the Broker and you might want to test how it behaves when actually consuming data from a stream.
</p><p>That same SQL Engine I mentioned earlier, also extends to injecting data into a topic. For example:&nbsp;</p><pre>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;customers&nbsp;(id,&nbsp;name,&nbsp;postcode,&nbsp;city)&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>VALUES&nbsp;('23423','Xavier',&nbsp;'75009',&nbsp;'Paris'),&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>('56456','Anne',&nbsp;'E24',&nbsp;'London'),&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>('8734','Todd',&nbsp;'10175',&nbsp;'New&nbsp;York'),&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>('6735463','Denise',&nbsp;'3207',&nbsp;'Melbourne');</pre><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/40FjAJMM5z8Apl3dv0kG7z/56918c58b7a96945dffe8e99539fcbad/image.png" alt="Insert data into an Apache Kafka topic via the Lenses.io CLI client and SQL statement"></span></p><h3>Configure Kafka Connect connectors</h3><p>The easiest way to bring data in and out of Kafka is with the Kafka Connect connectors. They are standard patterns of moving data between Kafka and other data systems.</p><p>
The environment is packaged with a number of popular connectors such as Mongo, Elastic 6, Influx but you can also import others.</p><p>
Want to bring in data from a database? Want to ship your results to Influx? No problem. Just a few clicks and Lenses will get those connectors running for you.</p><p>
This is perfect for testing out the Kafka Connect configuration and connection to those source and target systems. You benefit from the feedback loop: from error handling if you’ve mis-configured anything to seeing the performance of the flow. Not to mention being able to explore the data you are sourcing or sinking with SQL.&nbsp;</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3bO29ixv0ZCEzQ9ugBBjId/9b6ddfec459225940cdb8897e88a794e/image.png" alt="View and manage Kafka Connect connectors from the Lenses.io Box"></span></p><h3>Build SQL Streaming applications</h3><p>
Last but not least, Box is an environment to build stream processing applications with SQL.&nbsp;</p><p>The Streaming SQL engine allows you to define real-time data processing applications that enrich, filter, aggregate or reshape data streams. Ask things like:
</p><ul><li><p><i>What’s my total number sales up-till-now? Real-time.</i></p></li><li><p><i>How many clients are on my website checking out my new product right now?</i></p></li></ul><p>The answer is in the data. And all it takes is a bit of SQL. No frameworks, no code, no rocket-science engineering.</p><p>Here's an example<i>

</i></p><pre>SET&nbsp;autocreate=true;</pre><pre></pre><pre>SET&nbsp;`auto.offset.reset`='earliest';</pre><pre></pre><pre>SET&nbsp;`commit.interval.ms`='10000';</pre><pre></pre><pre>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;frauds_detection</pre><pre></pre><pre>WITH&nbsp;tableCards&nbsp;AS&nbsp;(</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT&nbsp;ccNumber,&nbsp;provider,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expiry,&nbsp;accountEnabled</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;credit_cards_data</pre><pre></pre><pre>)</pre><pre></pre><pre>SELECT&nbsp;STREAM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.provider,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.ccNumber,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.transaction.currency,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count(*)&nbsp;attempts</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM&nbsp;credit_cards_payments&nbsp;AS&nbsp;p</pre><pre></pre><pre>INNER&nbsp;JOIN&nbsp;tableCards&nbsp;AS&nbsp;c&nbsp;ON&nbsp;p.ccNumber&nbsp;=&nbsp;c.ccNumber</pre><pre></pre><pre>WHERE&nbsp;c.accountEnabled&nbsp;=&nbsp;'no'</pre><pre></pre><pre>GROUP&nbsp;BY&nbsp;tumble(5,s),&nbsp;p.provider</pre><p>You don’t need extra services either.. The workload will run locally in your environment for Box. Of course with the full Lenses.io workspace, you can choose to deploy it over your existing Kubernetes infrastructure and run it at scale.</p><h3>“The Cloud”, you said?
</h3><p>As it’s next evolution, yes, Box is now available as a Cloud service!&nbsp; A full Lenses-Kafka developer environment with zero setup.&nbsp;</p><p>Sign up for free on our new <a href="http://portal.lenses.io/register">Lenses.io Portal.</a></p><p>Or if you prefer to run the Docker container yourself, get access to it from <a href="https://lenses.io/downloads/lenses/?path=wizard-form">here</a> <a href="https://lenses.io/downloads/lenses/?path=wizard-form"></a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>You’ve likely experienced it: “You’re above and beyond everything we’re asking. There’s no promotion this round but all you need to do is <strong>__</strong>_”. Insert a semi-important but not absolutely necessary thing. Even worse if it’s something you’re really not good at.</p>

<p>One of the most demotivating things that an organization or manager can do is requiring “perfection” for a promotion. It’s a problem with two main dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s incommensurate with the value being added to the business.</li>
  <li>Perfection is subjective.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="incommensurate-with-value-add">Incommensurate with Value-Add</h2>

<p>Ultimately all performance comes down to one thing: how much value are you adding to the business? Examples of where forcing perfection gets things out of whack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I coded up a feature that brought in $10M to the business this year. I wasn’t promoted because they said I don’t speak enough in meetings.</li>
  <li>I saved the company from collapse because I was the only one who knew how to debug the system when it was melting. I wasn’t promoted because they said I show up too late every day.</li>
  <li>I identified a winning strategy for the entire business that drove us to another echelon of success. I wasn’t promoted because my design docs have typos.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that matters is the value being added to the business. There are nuances where behavior can set bad examples or cause issues for others, but that detracts from value added to the business and should be considered. The unfortunate and unbelievably common case is that some sort of benign missing strength is held against people.</p>

<h2 id="perfection-is-subjective">Perfection is Subjective</h2>

<p>When managers go down the rabbit whole of chasing perfect promotions they’re much more likely to be biased. In reality, most people’s internal picture of a perfect candidate for a promotion is something like “what did I look like when I got promoted?” That’s often the closest image a manager has of what a promotion at that level looks like.</p>

<p>In mild cases you get things like “when I got promoted I had to walk in the snow to work, uphill both ways.”</p>

<p>In more severe cases you get things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Men who don’t promote women because they’re not “aggressive enough” or they “don’t speak up enough”</li>
  <li>Extroverts who don’t promote introverts because they don’t like public speaking.</li>
  <li>Non-parents who don’t promote parents because they don’t work until midnight in the office.</li>
</ul>

<p>Promote people based on impact to the business, not their style of delivery.  Don’t hold people down because they deliver value in a way that isn’t comfortable, known, or practiced by you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In promotions and growth, focus more on amplifying strengths than fixing “weaknesses”.  You’ll find it’s much easier and much more fruitful to have people play to their strengths.</p>

<p>Promote imperfect people - that’s all you’ve got.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>You can find working code examples (including this one) in my <a href="https://github.com/pmuens/lab">lab repository</a> on <a href="https://github.com/pmuens">GitHub</a>.</p><p>Sometimes it's necessary to split existing data into several classes in order to predict new, unseen data. This problem is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification</a> and one of the algorithms which can be used to learn those classes from data is called Logistic Regression.</p><p>In this article we'll take a deep dive into the Logistic Regression model to learn how it differs from other regression models such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">Linear-</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a>, how to think about it from an intuitive perspective and how we can translate our learnings into code while implementing it from scratch.</p><h2 id="linear-regression-vs-logistic-regression">Linear Regression vs. Logistic Regression</h2><p>If you've read the post about <a href="https://philippmuens.com/linear-and-multiple-regression-from-scratch/">Linear- and Multiple Linear Regression</a> you might remember that the main objective of our algorithm was to find a best fitting line or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplane</a> respectively.</p><p>To recap real quick, a line can be represented via the slop-intercept form as follows:</p><p>\[ y = mx + b \]</p><p>Here, \(m\) represents the slope and \(b\) the y-intercept.</p><p>In Linear Regression we've used the existing data to find a line in slope-intercept form (a \(m\) and \(b\) combination) which "best-fitted through" such data.</p><p>Extending the slope-intercept form slightly to support multiple \(x\) values and multiple slopes (we'll use \(\beta_n\) instead of \(m_n\)) yields the following:</p><p>\[ y = &nbsp;\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b \]</p><p>This "scaled-up" slope-intercept formula was used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a> model to find the \(\beta\) and \(b\) values for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplane</a> which "best-fitted" the data. Once found we were able to use it for predictions by plugging in \(x\) values to get respective \(y\) values.</p><p>Linear Regression models always map a set of \(x\) values to a resulting \(y\) value on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function">continuous</a> scale. This means that the \(y\) value can e.g. be \(0\), \(42\) or \(5.023.212\). How would we use such a Regression model if our \(y\) value is categorical such as a binary value which is either \(0\) or \(1\)? Is there a way to define a threshold so that a value such as \(42\) is assigned to the category \(1\) while a small value such as \(0.002\) gets assigned to the category \(0\)?</p><p>That's where Logistic Regression comes into play. With Logistic Regression we can map any resulting \(y\) value, no matter its magnitude to a value between \(0\) and \(1\).</p><p>Let's take a closer look into the modifications we need to make to turn a Linear Regression model into a Logistic Regression model.</p><h2 id="sigmoid-functions">Sigmoid functions</h2><p>At the very heart of Logistic Regression is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">Sigmoid function</a>. A Sigmoid function is a class of functions which follows an S-shape when plotted.</p><p>The most prominent Sigmoid function is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">Logistic function</a> which was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fran%C3%A7ois_Verhulst">Pierre Francois Verhulst</a> to model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth">population grown</a>. It's mathematically described via this formula:</p><p>\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \]</p><p>Don't be intimidated by the math! Right now all you need to know is that this function takes any \(x\) value and maps it to a \(y\) value which ranges from \(0\) to \(1\).</p><p>Plotting the function for a range of \(x\) values proofs this claim and results in the aforementioned S-shape curve:</p><figure><img src="https://philippmuens.com/content/images/2020/06/zsigmoid_result.png"></figure><p>Note that the function gets closer and closer to the \(y\) value \(0\) or \(1\) as the \(x\) values get smaller or larger respectively. Also note that the \(x\) value \(0\) results in the \(y\) value \(0.5\).</p><p>This is exactly what we need. with this function we're able to "squish" any number, no matter its magnitude into a value ranging from \(0\) to \(1\). This makes the function outcome predictable which is useful when we later on define threshold values to associate function outputs with classes.</p><p>Let's turn the function into code:</p><pre><code>def sigmoid(x: float) -&gt; float:
    return 1 / (1 + exp(-x))

assert sigmoid(0) == 0.5</code></pre><p><strong><u>Note</u></strong>: Although there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function#Examples">different Sigmoid functions</a> to choose from, a lot of people use the name "Sigmoid function" when talking about the Logistic function. We'll adhere to this convention and use the term "Sigmoid function" as a synonym for Logistic function.</p><h2 id="from-linear-regression-to-logistic-regression">From Linear Regression to Logistic Regression</h2><p>Now that we've learned about the "mapping" capabilities of the Sigmoid function we should be able to "wrap" a Linear Regression model such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a> inside of it to turn the regressions raw output into a value ranging from \(0\) to \(1\).</p><p>Let's translate this idea into Math. Recall that our Multiple Linear Regression model looks like this:</p><p>\[ y = &nbsp;\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b \]</p><p>"Wrapping" this in the Sigmoid function (we use \(\sigma\) to represent the Sigmoid function) results in the following:</p><p>\[ y = \sigma(\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b) \]</p><p>Easy enough! Let's turn that into code.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is to implement the underlying Multiple Linear Regression model. Looking at the Math it seems to be possible to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot-product</a> to calculate the \(\beta\) and \(x\) part to which we then add the single \(b\) value.</p><p>To make everything easier to calculate and implement we'll use a small trick. Multyping a value by the identify \(1\) yields the value so we prepend \(1\) to the \(x\) values and \(b\) to the \(\beta\) values. This way we can solely use the dot-product calculation without the necessity to add \(b\) separately later on. Here's the mathematical formulation of that trick:</p><p>\[ \vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ x_1 \\ ... \\ x_n \end{pmatrix} \vec{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} b \\ \beta_1 \\ ... \\ \beta_n \end{pmatrix} \]</p><p>\[ y = \vec{x} \cdot \vec{m} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \beta_i = x_1 \times \beta_1 + ... + x_n \times \beta_n \]</p><p>Once we've calculated the dot-product we need to pass it into the Sigmoid function such that its result is translated ("squished") into a value between \(0\) and \(1\).</p><p>Here's the implementation for the <code>dot</code> function which calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot-product</a>:</p><pre><code>def dot(a: List[float], b: List[float]) -&gt; float:
    assert len(a) == len(b)
    return sum([a_i * b_i for a_i, b_i in zip(a, b)])

assert dot([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == 70</code></pre><p>And here's the <code>squish</code> function which takes as parameters the \(x\) and \(\beta\) values (remember that we've prepended a \(1\) to the \(x\) values and the \(b\) to the \(\beta\) values), uses the <code>dot</code> function to calculate the dot-product of \(x\) and \(\beta\) and then passes this result into the Sigmoid function to map it to a value between \(0\) and \(1\):</p><pre><code>def squish(beta: List[float], x: List[float]) -&gt; float:
    assert len(beta) == len(x)
    # Calculate the dot product
    dot_result: float = dot(beta, x)
    # Use sigmoid to get a result between 0 and 1
    return sigmoid(dot_result)

assert squish([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == 1.0</code></pre><h2 id="the-intuition-behind-the-0-1-range">The intuition behind the 0-1 range</h2><p>We've talked quite a lot about how the Sigmoid function is our solution to make the function outcome predictable as all values are mapped to a \(0\) - \(1\) range. But what does a value in that range represent? Let's take a look at an example.</p><p>The following is a data set which describes how long students have studied for an exam and whether they've passed the exam given the hours they've studied.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table>

</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Taking a glance at the data it seems to be that the more hours the students studied, the more likely they were to pass the exam. Intuitively that makes sense.</p><p>Let's plot the data to ensure that our intuition is correct:</p><figure><img src="https://philippmuens.com/content/images/2020/06/zmock_student_data.png"></figure><p>Looking at the plotted data we can immediately see that the values seem to "stick" to either the bottom or top of the graph. Given that it seems to be infeasible to use a Linear Regression model to find a line which best describes the data. How would this line be fitted through the data if the values we'd expect this line should produce are either \(o\) or \(1\)?</p><p>Let's try a thought experiment. What would happen if we've somehow found some coefficients \(\beta\) for the Linear Regression model which "best" describe the data and pass the result it computes through the Sigmoid function? Here's the graph from above with the Sigmoid function added to it:</p><figure><img src="https://philippmuens.com/content/images/2020/06/zmock_student_data_w_sigmoid.png"></figure><p>Looking at the plotting above we can see that the Sigmoid function ensures that the result from the "underlying" Linear Regression model is mapped onto a scale between \(0\) and \(1\), which in turn makes it possible to e.g. define a threshold at \(0.5\) to say that a value which is greater than \(0.5\) might be a predictor for a student passing the exam while a value less than \(0.5\) might mean that she'll fail the exam.</p><p>Note that the wording in the last sentence isn't a coincidence. The value the Signoid function produces can be interpreted as a probability where \(0\) means \(0%\) probability and \(1\) means a \(100%\) probability.</p><h2 id="the-probability-density-function">The Probability Density Function</h2><p>As it turns out we can translate our findings from the previous section into a function called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">Probability density function</a> or (PDF for short).</p><p>In particular we can define a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability">conditional probability</a> which states that given some \(\beta\) and \(x_i\), each corresponding \(y_i\) should equal \(1\) with probability \(\sigma(\beta x_i)\) and \(0\) with probability \(1-\sigma(\beta x_i)\):</p><p>\[ P(y_i \mid \beta x_i) = \sigma(\beta x_i)^{y_i} \times (1-\sigma(\beta x_i))^{1-y_i} \]</p><p>Looking at the formula above it might be a mystery how we deduced it from our verbal description from above. Here's something I want you to try: Please apply the formula by setting \(y_i\) to \(0\) and after that to \(1\) and see what happens. What you'll notice is that depending on what value you set \(y_i\) to, only one part of the formula stays the same while the other is canceled out.</p><p>Here's what we'll end up with if we set \(y_i\) to \(0\) and \(1\):</p><p>\[ 1-\sigma(\beta x_i) \quad \textrm{if} &nbsp;y_i = 0 \]</p><p>\[ \sigma(\beta x_i) \quad \textrm{if} &nbsp;y_i = 1 \]</p><p>And that's exactly the desired behavior we described above.</p><h2 id="deriving-a-loss-function">Deriving a Loss function</h2><p>With Logistic Regression our main objective is to find the models \(\beta\) parameters which maximize the likelihood that for a pair of \(x\) values the \(y\) value …</p></div></div>

    <p>Somewhere along the way toward our current JavaScript hellscape, programmers decided that HTML was over. We’re done with it.</p>

<p>The emergence of tools like <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">React</a> shifted programmers away from writing HTML, instead writing <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>, a fancier tag-based markup language that worked nicely inside your JavaScript.</p>

<p>Backends were then relegated to being dumb JSON API endpoints. Or if you were fancy and chasing upvotes, you’d use <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>!</p>

<p>But HTML? Yuck!</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-html-over-the-wire">A Brief History of HTML-over-the-wire</h2>

<p>One of the key pillars of Rails is to <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#integrated-systems">“Value integrated systems”</a>. While the industry moves towards microservices, highly decoupled front-ends and teams, and the siren song of Programming via LEGO Bricks, Rails leans into one system that does it all – termed the <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/">Majestic Monolith</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of rebuilding much of what already works in Rails in a client-side JavaScript MVC framework, apps like Basecamp, GitHub, and Shopify are able to achieve snappy page loads using the concept of “HTML-over-the-wire”.</p>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWEts0rlezA">seminal RailsConf 2016 talk</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sstephenson">Sam Stephenson</a> walks through the pieces of this stack.</p>

<p>By using <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a> (or similar libraries like <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax">pjax</a> or <a href="https://inertiajs.com/how-it-works">Inertia</a>) and fast HTML responses (aided by caching and avoiding excessive database queries to get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBccDerJPJE">sub-100ms response times</a>), you could build high performance pages, while still hanging on to the understated benefits of stateless HTTP responses and server-side logic.</p>

<p>As Sam points out, it was truly a “Golden Age of Web Development”.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/golden-age.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So while much of the industry went down the JavaScript rabbit hole – creating new innovations for <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html">reactive rendering</a>, <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk">functional</a> <a href="https://redux.js.org/">state management containers</a>, and <a href="https://reach.tech/router">approximately</a> <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">seventy</a> <a href="https://github.com/frontarm/navi">different</a> <a href="https://blog.remix.run/p/remix-preview">client-side</a> <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/docs/redwood-router">routing</a> <a href="https://github.com/4Catalyzer/found">libraries</a> – the quiet rebellion in Rails-land was honing these techniques and plugging along building apps out of boring server-rendered HTML.</p>

<p>We’re seeing a renaissance of these tools in 2020 and the excitement (at least in a small corner of the Twitter!) is reaching a fever pitch as Basecamp launches HEY: a fully-featured email client with a tiny JavaScript footprint that pushed the boundaries of the HTML-over-the-wire approach.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🤯 Basecamp is building a fully-featured, in-browser email client...using a ridiculously small amount of JavaScript. A tiny keyboard shortcut lib, one polyfill, and boring old Stimulus/Turbolinks/Rails...</p><p>🙏 to <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dhh</a> for generously shipping source maps, amazing learning resource <a href="https://t.co/IEAvwjiKeO">pic.twitter.com/IEAvwjiKeO</a></p></div>— matt swanson 🤔 🦢 (@_swanson) <a href="https://twitter.com/_swanson/status/1253037966710181892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2020</a></blockquote>


<h2 id="turbolinks--stimulus-20xx-the-future">Turbolinks / Stimulus 20XX: The Future</h2>

<p>The stack in 2014-2016 was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turbolinks/pjax</li>
  <li>Rails UJS + <code>js.erb</code> templates (<a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3697-server-generated-javascript-responses">Server-generated JavaScript Responses</a>)</li>
  <li>Heavy HTML fragment caching</li>
  <li>Rails Asset Pipeline and <a href="https://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can even trace the origin of these techniques back even further. I was recently <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_vannoy/status/1274682764948844545">sent a link</a> to a nearly 15 year old REST “microformat” called <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rest/ahah">“AHAH: Asynchronous HTML and HTTP”</a>, which is an early version of the same ideas we’re so excited about today. (You shouldn’t be surprised to see <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">David Hansson</a> listed as a contributor!)</p>

<p>Now a “state-of-the-art” 2020 version also includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction">StimulusJS</a> (see also <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine">AlpineJS</a>) for lightweight event management, data binding, and “sprinkles” of behavior</li>
  <li>Partial updates with Turbolinks via a new <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> command approach (replacing <code>js.erb</code> and supporting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP</a>)</li>
  <li>Real-time Turbolinks updates via <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html">ActionCable</a> (see also <a href="https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/">StimulusReflex</a>/<a href="https://cableready.stimulusreflex.com/">CableReady</a>)</li>
  <li>First-party support for Webpack, ES6, and new CSS approaches like <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> and <a href="https://purgecss.com/">PurgeCSS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This stack is extremely powerful and the development experience allows you to really fly. You can build fast and interactive applications with a small team, all while still experiencing the joy of a 2014-era vanilla Rails codebase.</p>

<p>But years of a <a href="https://macwright.org/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">JavaScript SPA-heavy monoculture</a> have made it hard to learn about this stack. The community is filled with practitioners, using the tools to build software and businesses. There simply has not been the same level of content produced and so many of these tools are unknown and can be unapproachable.</p>

<p>One of the ways I can contribute is to light the way for those want to know more by showing some real-world examples (not a <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TODO list</a> or a <a href="https://wsvincent.com/react-counter/">Counter</a>). Once you see how you can use tools like Stimulus and HTML responses to build features where you might instead reach for a tool like React, things will start to click.</p>

<h2 id="lets-build-something-real-hovercards">Let’s Build Something Real: Hovercards</h2>

<p>Hovercards show extra contextual information in a popup bubble when you hover over something in your app. You can see examples of this UI pattern on GitHub, Twitter, and even Wikipedia.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/hovercard-examples.png" alt="Examples of hovercard UI"></p>

<p>This feature is really easy to build with Rails using an HTML-over-the-wire approach.</p>

<p>Here’s the plan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a controller action to render the hovercard as HTML</li>
  <li>Write a tiny Stimulus controller to fetch the hovercard HTML when you hover</li>
</ul>

<p>…and that’s it.</p>

<p>We don’t need to make API endpoints and figure out how to structure all of the data we need. We don’t need to reach for React or Vue to make this a client-side component.</p>

<p>The beauty of this boring Rails approach is that the feature is dead-simple and it’s equally straightforward to build. It’s easy to reason about the code and super extensible.</p>

<p>For this example, let’s build the event feed for a sneaker marketplace app.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/shoe-hovercard.gif" alt="Shoe feed hovercard example"></p>

<p>When you hover over a shoe, you see a picture, the name, the price, etc. Same for the user, you can see a mini-profile for each user.</p>

<h3 id="the-frontend-stimulus--fetch">The Frontend (Stimulus + fetch)</h3>

<p>The markup for the link looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- app/views/shoes/feed.html.erb --&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;div</span>
  <span>class=</span><span>"inline-block"</span>
  <span>data-controller=</span><span>"hovercard"</span>
  <span>data-hovercard-url-value=</span><span>"</span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>hovercard_shoe_path</span><span>(</span><span>shoe</span><span>)</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>"</span>
  <span>data-action=</span><span>"mouseenter-&gt;hovercard#show mouseleave-&gt;hovercard#hide"</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;%=</span> <span>link_to</span> <span>shoe</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>shoe</span><span>,</span> <span>class: </span><span>"branded-link"</span> <span>%&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: we are using the APIs from the <a href="https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus/pull/202">Stimulus 2.0</a> preview release!</p>

<p>One of the great features of Stimulus is that you can read the markup and understand what’s happening without diving into the JavaScript.</p>

<p>Without knowing anything else about the implementation, you could guess how it’s going to work: this link is wrapped in a <code>hovercard</code> controller, when you hover (via <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code> events) the card is shown or hidden.</p>

<p>As recommended in <a href="https://boringrails.com/articles/better-stimulus-controllers/">Writing Better Stimulus Controllers</a>, you should pass in the URL for the hover card endpoint as a data property so that we can re-use the <code>hovercard_controller</code> for multiple types of cards. This also keeps us from having to duplicate the application routes in JavaScript.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// app/javascript/controllers/hovercard_controller.js</span>

<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>Controller</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>stimulus</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>class</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Controller</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>static</span> <span>targets</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"</span><span>card</span><span>"</span><span>];</span>
  <span>static</span> <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>};</span>

  <span>show</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>hasCardTarget</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>cardTarget</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>remove</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>hidden</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>urlValue</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>())</span>
        <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>html</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>const</span> <span>fragment</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span>
            <span>.</span><span>createRange</span><span>()</span>
            <span>.</span><span>createContextualFragment</span><span>(</span><span>html</span><span>);</span>

          <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>element</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span><span>fragment</span><span>);</span>
        <span>});</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>hide</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>hasCardTarget</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>cardTarget</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>hidden</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>disconnect</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>hasCardTarget</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>cardTarget</span><span>.</span><span>remove</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is all of the JavaScript we’re going to be writing for this feature: it’s only ~30 lines and we can use this for any other hovercards in the app. There isn’t really anything app specific about this controller either, you could pull it into a separate module and re-use it across projects. It’s totally generic.</p>

<p>The controller uses the <code>fetch</code> API to call the provided Rails endpoint, gets some HTML back, and then inserts it into the DOM. As a small improvement, we use the Stimulus <code>target</code> API for data binding to save a reference to the card so that subsequent hovers over this link can simply show/hide the markup without making another network request.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/hovercard-network.gif" alt="Hovercard Network tab"></p>

<p>We also choose to remove the card when leaving the page (via the <code>disconnect</code> lifecycle method), but you could also opt to hide the card instead depending on how you want caching to work.</p>

<h3 id="the-backend-rails--server-rendered-html">The Backend (Rails + Server rendered HTML)</h3>

<p>There is nothing magic on the frontend and it’s the same story on the backend.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># config/routes.rb</span>
<span>Rails</span><span>.</span><span>application</span><span>.</span><span>routes</span><span>.</span><span>draw</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>resources</span> <span>:shoes</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>member</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>get</span> <span>:hovercard</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Setup a route for <code>/shoes/:id/hovercard</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># app/controllers/shoes_controller.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ShoesController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>hovercard</span>
    <span>@shoe</span> <span>=</span> <span>Shoe</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>[</span><span>:id</span><span>])</span>

    <span>render</span> <span>layout: </span><span>false</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Write a basic controller action, the only difference being that we set <code>layout: false</code> so that we do not use the global application layout for this endpoint.</p>

<p>You can even visit this path directly in your browser to quickly iterate on the content and design. The workflow gets even better when using a utility-based styling approach like Tailwind since you don’t even need to wait for your asset bundles to rebuild!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- app/views/shoes/hovercard.html.erb --&gt;</span>

<article>
	<p>The Spark + AI summit for 2020 is currently happening from June 22nd to June 26th. There were talks by big names in the industry like Matei Zaharia
and even by Nate Silver from fivethirtyeight.com. There were multiple topics being talked about simultaneously and it was a difficult to just
pick one to listen to as all of them seemed interesting! I took some time to listen to Tomer Shiran, the founder of the Dremio project about the origins,
the need and use cases of Apache Arrow and how they used it in Dremio alongside the Apache Arrow Gandiva.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-querying-conundrum-in-data-lakes-paradigm">The data querying conundrum in Data Lakes paradigm</h2>
<p>Data Lakes are the talk of the town today! In today’s age where data is the chief asset that companies prize, they don’t want to lose any of it
and would rather have it stored in a Data Lake even if it does not make much sense to them right now, with the prospect of it being useful at a
later point in time. That very point makes the data unwieldy.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, when your data store has vast amounts of data, querying becomes slow because it is not just that the data is big but that
transferring data over the network when you query such stores also becomes a non-trivial factor. To get around this problem, companies again
copy part of their data from the Data Lake into Data Warehousing solutions like AWS Redshift. They then construct their OLAP cubes and
aggregations on top of this for fast querying of the underlying data. The drawback of this is that the flexibility of doing anything else with
this data reduces as you copy it into the Data Warehouse. This is the problem that the folks at Dremio / Apache Arrow are trying to solve -
how do you query your data directly from the Data Lake without having to copy it anywhere else?</p>
<h2 id="dremio">Dremio</h2>
<p>The folks at Dremio claim that they have built technology to query Data Lakes with 4 to 100 times better performance than existing solutions. The
way they were able to do it is by defining and implementing a new standard - Apache Arrow, of storing data in-memory in a columnar format for efficient
operations on today’s hardware. I will talk more about Apache Arrow later in this article.</p>
<p>Following are some features that power Dremio -</p>
<h3 id="data-reflections">Data Reflections</h3>
<p>Dremio creates a view of your data, an optimized data structure that lends itself well to boost different query patterns. This data structure can
also auto refresh itself.</p>
<h3 id="columnar-cloud-cache-c3">Columnar Cloud Cache (C3)</h3>
<p>The Columnar Cloud Cache feature takes advantage of local storage (generally NVMe - non-volatile memory express) for a distributed real time
caching solution that increases the amount of read throughput and reduces the amount of data transferred over the network. It is automatic, does
not need any user involvement and caches data based on SQL query patterns, workload management and file directory structures to optimize what to
store and evict.</p>
<h3 id="predictive-pipelining">Predictive Pipelining</h3>
<p>Dremio can predict access patterns of data which reduces its query response times. Based on usage patterns of analytical workloads and their understanding
of columnar data format, the Dremio folks provide this feature wherein they fetch data only before execution engine needs it.</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-dremio-and-facebooks-presto">Difference between Dremio and Facebook’s Presto</h2>
<p>Presto by Facebook is a distributed SQL engine over multiple data sources. Dremio offers more features on top of that. It sits between your
data over disparate sources and you who want an analysis of your data - it squashes the need for data warehousing solutions, OLAP cubes,
extracts and aggregations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dremio claims to offer speeds of interactive nature with data of any volume</li>
<li>It has deep integrations with some data stores and is thus able to push down some compute when queries are made over those data sources</li>
<li>It is able to show how different datasets are related to each other by creating a lineage of data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apache-arrow">Apache Arrow</h2>
<p>Apache Arrow is a specification for storing data in a columnar format in memory, serializing the metadata and for transferring data over the network.
It uses Google Flatbuffers for metadata serialization. It was born out of Dremio’s internal memory format.</p>
<p>It provides constant time random access, data adjacency for sequential scans and lends itself easily for SIMD (single instruction, multiple data)
class of instructions in modern processors.</p>
<p>It serializes data as Arrow buffers / vectors which are basically arrays of the same size with different data types. This whole package together
constitutes its schema.</p>
<h2 id="gandiva">Gandiva</h2>
<p>Gandiva is a part of Dremio which provides a high performance execution engine over Apache Arrow data buffers. Gandiva takes a sql expression,
compiles it into LLVM bytecode and translates it to machine code. To get this high performance it is written in C++.</p>
<p>Tomer wrapped up the talk on Dremio with a demo of the platform as well.</p>
<p>Go give Dremio a try!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What we pay attention to <a href="https://lithub.com/how-we-pay-attention-changes-the-very-shape-of-our-brains/" target="_blank">changes the shape of our brain</a>. Like water running through a landscape day after day after day, the neural pathways used in our work and routines cut familiar channels that give rise to the ecosystems of our mind. But paying attention is naturally selective. When we choose what to focus on, we are also choosing what to ignore.</p><p>I’ve been programming on and off since the 20th century. I see marked differences in myself, my behavior, perception, etc. when actively coding vs. not. It's finally time to investigate. What am I really paying attention to when programming? What are the implications?</p><p><i>And for the reader, what is your experience? Similar? Different? Or if you’re not a programmer, how does your discipline shape your perception?</i></p><p>When programming, I am writing the future. Every line of code is an instruction to be carried out predictably, if all goes well, a billion times over. Bits of simple logic—compounded across programs stacked on giant stacks of programs—create complex systems of logical inevitabilities.</p><p>To accomplish this, every command I write exercises a tiny mental loop:</p><ul><li><b><nobr>Step 1: </nobr></b><span>Research and understand the “inner logic” of relevant systems.</span></li><li><b><nobr>Step 2: </nobr></b><span>Formulate a hypothesis that models some new bit of logic.</span></li><li><b><nobr>Step 3: </nobr></b><span>Validate and iterate.</span></li></ul><p>Does it work? I test my code and expect an immediate response from the compiler. If yes, I move on to the next bit of logic in my day's lineup. If no, I retest my underlying arguments, breaking down my code into smaller and smaller bits. Every step of the way, my attention walks as efficiently as possible, a garden of forking yes/no paths. It's as if it were me, and not just an electric current, running through the logic gates of my computer’s circuit board.</p><p>When our brain focuses its attention, neuromodulators amplify its activated neural circuits. Like a spotlight on stage, the "speaking" actor is lit up. And likewise, the rest of the stage is intentionally dimmed. We actively suppress competing areas of the brain <code>"with slow waves in the alpha frequency band (between eight and twelve hertz), which inhibit a circuit by preventing it from developing coherent neural activity."</code></p><p>What part of my brain am I suppressing when I spend all day coding? The easy and obvious answer would be the opposite of logic—something to do with emotion. There’s certainly not much place for emotion in programming. This may influence why some of us gravitate more to front-end development—to be not so far from people. Or vice versa. But does programming suppress emotion? Let’s explore deeper.</p><h2>The Good</h2><p>I <a title="Click to expand">learned to code on LSD.</a><sup title="Click to expand">*</sup> Twenty-some years later, there are a few things I love about software development. But none more than the way it encourages and rewards mental plasticity through constant learning and unlearning.</p><p>We break systems apart in order to understand the imperative logic that glues them together. In the game of programming, the rules are entirely knowable… with enough digging. Somewhere, at some point in time, someone wrote them (and hopefully documented them). Debugging feels like the archeology of quirks, from programs layered atop older programs. There’s a real joy in discovery when we unlock a path forward. Over time, this clarity develops into confidence, and we approach systems knowing that yes, if needed, we could do the work to understand any part of this. Fortunately, this is far from what’s usually required; we rarely go deeper than the syntax and grammar of our immediate environment. But our environment still is always changing, and so we must always be learning.</p><p>The second joy of programming: I can build something out of nothing—or more specifically, out of logic and electricity. I’ve built with stone, wood, ink, plastic, etc. The freedom afforded by code is unique and specific—a kind of scalable mental scaffolding. Logically valid patterns can repeat ad infinitum into some functional space, limited for the most part only by their utility.</p><p>For me, programming enhances this way of seeing, which carries over into other areas of my life. My chess game improves drastically when actively coding. I see more clearly defined the risks and consequences of a position. Things seem more obvious, inevitable. I can break down an argument into its key dependencies, find flaws, and put it all back together efficiently optimized towards some solution. My mind begins to resemble the programs I work on.</p><h2>The Bad</h2><p>My mind begins to resemble the programs I work on. The ability to build applications is empowering; but I lose power when I become just another program in the stack for people to input instructions and expect outputs. I’ve seen it throughout my career. No one wants to be a code monkey. And yet, it’s a natural consequence of specialization. Developers are inevitably busy writing code all day, not talking to people. Yes, we’re a strange bunch to begin with, and to follow the stereotype, likely more comfortable with computers than people anyways. But it seems our work reinforces our role as awkward, estranged mental laborers.</p><p>I’d thought I could hack life with the same ease I could hack a program. But life is not an abstract model of logic where outcomes are inevitable and predictable. From where I stand as a microscopic organism inside an unknown number of infinite universes, math can only solve for so much. Certainly, many of society’s rules can be gamed. My heightened logic serves me well in certain domains. But, I struggle too—there’s a price I pay for spending days programming.</p><p>It’s difficult to be exact talking about this, but I feel it strongly in 3 areas of my life:</p><ul><li><b><nobr>1.</nobr></b><span>As I get older, the health impacts—physical and mental—become more apparent. I sit (or sometimes stand) staring into an artificial sun. My body becomes disoriented by space and time. My mind gets wound up, locked into the gears of software. My eyes go dim and blurry. Hiking with the dogs for an hour at the end of every day helps, but it’s not enough. I still find myself reaching for an easy jolt back to reality, often in the form of a drink.</span></li><li><b><nobr>2.</nobr></b><span>Programming requires a quite specific mental model that makes it difficult to balance in parallel with other, more creative activities (making art, creative writing, cooking, etc.). They all struggle for my attention like children with divergent needs. It’s not so simple as time boxing activities and switching modalities, as I have to travel half way around my mind to get from one headspace to another. Too often, I end up stuck wasting my time commuting between <a title="Click to expand">competing mindsets.</a><sup title="Click to expand">*</sup></span></li><li><b><nobr>3.</nobr></b><span>Finally, and perhaps the most significant consequence: I find it challenging to relate to others when in the mindset of programming. After spending my day communicating with the compiler in encoded logic, writing commands, and expecting immediate responses, talking with a human feels slow and inefficient.</span></li></ul><p>This last point is a bit of a trope, so I want to expand. When my attention is zeroed in programming, it’s not emotion that my mind suppresses, but rather, my ability to listen, to really listen. I notice it when talking with my wife (with whom I have 10+ years of observed patterns). After a day of programming, I hear her “inputs” and I can “output” the appropriate answer. But I lose touch with her human experience. What’s not explicitly defined ceases to register. Unless I’m being intentional about it, programming often degrades my capacity for empathy.</p><p>Empathy requires a different relationship to the unknown. It enables us to “hold space” for the valid, yet truly unknowable experience of another person. It saves us from projecting our ideas of ourselves, filled with expectations and judgements, into that space. That’s not to say we don’t try to understand or pattern-match. Or that we don’t share our own experience in response. It’s just that there’s no equation that can solve for two peoples life, history, genetics, etc. We try, of course, with derivatives, approximations, and metaphor. But this is where logic ends and art begins.</p><h2>The Unknown</h2><p>So what? Programming supports my way of life, my family. These side-effects are collateral damage. But I know that by seeking to understand them, I can at least begin to address negative impacts.</p><p>Perhaps, this is just one man’s experience and not something I should generalize. But my curiosity beckons, if what I’m writing about is an experience at all common to programmers, what are the implications?</p><h3>1. Can we find a healthier, more sustainable balance with programming?</h3><p>This obviously applies to computer work in general; the physical constraints and proposed solutions are well-documented—good ergonomics, exercise, etc. But on the mental side, how do we ground ourselves during a day spent riding the proverbial lightning? Stretched across the course of a career, how does this contribute to programming being a “young person’s game,” where individual contributors as they get older burn out and switch to manager roles?</p><h3>2. Looking through the wide-angle lens: is our work’s suppression of empathy at the root of the tech-lash?</h3><p>Tech has a lossy view of the human experience. We are degraded to a few million data points. Emotion is gamified for attention, dollars, and worse. Human activity online can be easily modeled by a bot. It's common to marvel at how advanced bots and algorithms have become. But on the flip side, it reveals how shallow our models of the human experience online actually are, that a few automated clicks and some NLP can fool us.</p><p>As they say, we only improve what we measure. But we don’t measure what we don’t know. We don’t talk about empathy because it’s not a variable or a metric in any of our systems. So how can we make space for empathy in our programs as they continue to eat the world?</p><h3>3. A final thought on the future of programming</h3><p>We're entering the terrain of science-fiction here, but what would it mean to program for empathy, to encode it in our systems? Here's one possible requirement: can our programs ever account for unknowable truths?</p><p>Pe…</p></div></div>

<p>Some commenters (/u/coderintherye chain notably) on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23630201">HN post</a> of the <a href="https://thinkingagriculture.io/what-silicon-valley-doesnt-understand-about-agriculture/">original article</a> brought up good points that I wanted to expand on and provide some additional context. Also for clarification: although farming is truly global, most ‘farming’ I refer to pertains to the United States (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_United_States">which is an agriculture juggernaut</a>), but in my experience should reasonably translate across agriculture zones (pending equivalent laws and climatic factors).</p>



<p><strong><em>There is ample VC money for Ag startups</em></strong></p>



<p>The original intention of the article wasn’t to bemoan the lack of capital available for <a href="https://agiowa.com/portfolio/">founders focused on agriculture</a> (there is actually plenty of capital–check out <a href="https://agfundernews.com/">AgFunderNews</a> for examples of successful raises). Instead, it is a recommendation for anyone entering the space to understand the industry and its history to harness existing synergies rather than try and swim upstream. Watching capital go to ‘solved’ problems is painful, because there are many opportunities for a unicorn ag startup if aimed in the correct space. Vertical farming for non-vegetables (or fruits) is likely dead-on-pitch. Yes, vertical farming <em>is</em> and <em>could be</em> successful, but those markets are very specific and probably 10x smaller than people think. Nice businesses no doubt, but not market shaping behemoths VCs are after. Agriculture is rightfully a commodity and the market will brutalize ideas/companies that can’t turn a profit. One bad year (droughts in 2011 and 2012 in the US Midwest) from external forces can absolutely put farmers out of business. Indoor farming has all of the risks of outdoor ag–and more! Indoor farming requires water (whose source can dry up and get shut off unexpectedly, just like a drought), has pests, and requires artificial lighting (power outage for 5 days? Uh oh). Herbicides (and sometimes pesticides) are actually an example of innovation pre-SV. Alternate technologies (i.e mechanical) didn’t work or were uneconomical for the time period; thus, chemical solutions seemed to thrive (glyphosate/glufosinate resistant corn/soy/wheat/cotton/sugar beets &amp; <a href="https://agrilife.org/lubbock/files/2020/02/BtTraitTable_FEB_2020.pdf">BT resistance for insects</a>). I predict in next 5-20 years we see that flip, where chemical and biological solutions fall out in favor of mechanized solutions (who wouldn’t want a semi-autonomous robot pulling weeds in fields in favor of a chemical solution that is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bayer-reaches-10-5-billion-settlement-roundup-cancer-lawsuits-n1232026">open to litigation</a>)? We just have too little understanding of 2nd and 3rd order effects of disrupting nature at this scale (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49660-6">gene drives included</a>, as promising as they appear) using these incredibly effective chemicals.</p>



<p><strong><em>Financing in the Heartland</em></strong></p>



<p>I won’t speak of financing agricultural operations in a municipality not located in the United States, as even understanding the US situation takes time and effort. Let’s be clear though: Most farmers <em>need</em> to borrow capital just to operate for a given year (hence, there is a note called an ‘operating loan’) and financing agriculture operations is more and more important as the size of farms increases. They buy seed, fertilizer, feed, chemicals, etc. to be able to produce an output to then (hopefully) sell at a profit–all to rinse and repeat. Buying big expensive new tractors ($300k+ USD), buildings to store the machines, grain storage, fencing, animal houses–all generally require a loan. Because of the huge cost to purchase these necessities, financing institutions generally need to have a <em>very</em> thorough understanding of the operation (Only farm 160 acres of corn,soy,or wheat? Good luck buying equipment). So bankers have become very good (not perfect) at evaluating and swaying farming practices to ensure maximum likelihood of repayment. Seriously, check of the used auction prices of ag machinery sometime–<a href="https://www.bigiron.com/Lots/2011JohnDeere8335RMFWDTractor-3">this tractor</a> is 10 years old and commands the price of a new Tesla. Is ag financing a place that needs disruption? Likely no because ag lending has evolved hand-in-hand in rural communities where agricultural production is the predominant industry. Because they evolved with ag, they likely have already captured the +EV that startups tend to seek because their very existence depends on it. So where <em>are</em> the value proposition? I know nothing of their founding, but the previous auction link is from <a href="https://www.bigiron.com/">Big Iron Auctions</a> and those founders likely understood ag (“hey, there is a robust secondary market for farm machinery”) and created on-line version of it–with what appears to be great success. I’d imagine these on-line secondary markets exist in Brazil and Eastern Europe given there agriculture exposure. </p>



<p><strong><em>Success Stories</em></strong></p>



<p>There are some truly incredible examples of engineering and innovation in agriculture that focus on the mechanization and scale <em>that already exists</em>. Transplanting vegetables in the Central Valley (CA) used to be labor intensive–<a href="https://www.planttape.com/">this brilliant solution solved that</a>. Auto-steer <a href="https://www.fieldbee.com/blog/fieldbee-tractor-autosteer-versus-other-systems/">systems</a> that leverage machinery that already exists. Sometimes the innovation is statistical/computation (<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-animal-021815-111422">genomic prediction has revolutionized dairy cattle</a>) Starting businesses is hard and agriculture is no different.</p>



<p>Stay away from vertical farming–unless you plan on growing saffron or figure out a way to cultivate morel mushrooms!</p>

June 25, 2020 | https://snake-ci.com/blog/go2go-stream/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://snake-ci.com/blog/go2go-stream/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<div>
										
										<p>The Go team recently released a new post in the Go blog called
<a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">Â«The Next Step in GenericsÂ»</a> and updated the design draft on
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md">Â«Type ParametersÂ»</a> (a long one).</p>

<p>In the current post I’m going to describe how to port Java’s Stream to Go 2 Generics.</p>

<p>Let’s make it straightforward â€” define the Stream:</p>

<pre><code>type Stream(type Type) struct {
	slice    []Type
	parallel bool
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we declare a new type using type parameter <code>Type</code> with underlying slice <code>[]Type</code>.</p>

<p>And let’s have a constructor:</p>

<pre><code>func Of(type Type)(slice []Type) *Stream(Type) {
	return &amp;Stream(Type){
		slice: slice,
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The parameter <code>(type Type)</code> after name of function and in type declaration is Type Parameter.
The type parameter is required whenever we are going to use generics.</p>

<p>Now we can implement core functions of a typical stream:</p>

<ul>
<li>Filter</li>
<li>Map</li>
<li>Reduce</li>
<li>ForEach</li>
<li>Collect</li>

<li><p>AnyMatch/AllMatch/NoneMatch</p>

<pre><code>func (stream *Stream(Type)) Filter(predicate func(Type) bool) *Stream(Type) {
	filtered := []Type{}
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		if predicate(item) {
			filtered = append(filtered, item)
		}
	}
	stream.slice = filtered
	return stream
}

func Map(type Type, R)(stream *Stream(Type), predicate func(Type) R) *Stream(R) {
	slice := make([]R, len(stream.slice))
	for i, item := range stream.slice {
		slice[i] = predicate(item)
	}
	return Of(slice)
}

func Reduce(type Type, R)(stream *Stream(Type), predicate func(R, Type) R) R {
	var result R
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		result = predicate(result, item)
	}
	return result
}

func (stream *Stream(Type)) ForEach(predicate func(Type)) *Stream(Type) {
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		predicate(item)
	}
	return stream
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that Map and Reduce functions are not declared on <code>Stream(Type)</code>. It’s one of unsolved problems of current generics
design draft â€” parametrized methods are not permitted.</p>

<p>It means that we can have a function that receives type <code>A</code> and returns type <code>B</code>:</p>

<pre><code>func foo(type A, B) (a A) B
</code></pre>

<p>But we can’t declare a parametrized method on type <code>Struct(A)</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>func (s Struct(A)) foo(type B) (a A) B
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>This design draft does not permit methods to declare type parameters that are specific to the method. The receiver may
have type parameters, but the method not add any type parameters.
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md#no-parameterized-methods">Quote from the updated design draft</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s time for the cherry on top â€” <code>Stream(Type).Collect()</code>.</p>

<p>The signature of Collect function will be pretty simple:</p>

<pre><code>func Collect(type Type, Col)(
	stream *Stream(Type),
	collector collector.Collector(Type, Col),
) Col
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that now we have two type parameters â€” one for original type that was used for creating a stream and another one
for resulting collection.</p>

<p>Here is a interface for a typical collector that consists of four functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Supply()</code> â€” a function that creates and returns a new result container.</li>
<li><code>Accumulate()</code> â€” a function that folds a value into a mutable result container.</li>
<li><code>Combine()</code> â€” a function that accepts two partial results and merges them. This is going to be used only in parallel mode.</li>

<li><p><code>Finish()</code> â€” while in Java this method converts from an intermediate type to the final result type, but in order to save
the simplicity of the implementation, it will return the same type.</p>

<pre><code>type Collector(type Type, Col) interface {
	Supply() Col
	Accumulate(Col, Type) Col
	Finish(Col) Col
	Combine(Col, Col) Col
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have the interface, we need an implementation. But since we want to allow developers to add
their own implementations without declaring new types, we need a constructor that will accept functions, think of it
like <code>http.HandleFunc()</code> which is often used to wrap functions and returns <code>http.Handler</code>.</p>

<p>We will declare a new constructor for <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> like we did for <code>Stream(Type)</code> that will return unexported
implementation of <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> that will just call the given functions:</p>

<pre><code>func Of(type Type, Col)(
	supply func() Col,
	accumulate func(Col, Type) Col,
	finish func(Col) Col,
	combine func(Col, Col) Col,
) Collector(Type, Col) {
	return impl(Type, Col){
		supply:     supply,
		accumulate: accumulate,
		finish:     finish,
		combine:    combine,
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we also have to specify <code>(Type, Col)</code> for <code>Collector</code> even though we specified it later <code>impl(Type, Col)</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>impl(Type, Col)</code> type is going to be a holder of functions that implements the <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> interface:</p>

<pre><code>type impl(type Type, Col) struct {
	supply     func() Col
	accumulate func(Col, Type) Col
	finish     func(Col) Col
	combine    func(Col, Col) Col
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Supply() Col {
	return collector.supply()
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Accumulate(collection Col, item Type) Col {
	return collector.accumulate(collection, item)
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Finish(collection Col) Col {
	if collector.finish == nil {
		return collection
	}
	return collector.finish(collection)
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Combine(collection1, collection2 Col) Col {
	return collector.combine(collection1, collection2)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we’re good, now let’s declare a simple collector that is going to convert a <code>Type</code> to <code>Map[Key]Value</code> â€” <code>ToMap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>func ToMap(type Type interface{}, Key comparable, Value interface{})(
	mapper func(Type) (Key, Value),
	accumulator func(Value, Value) Value,
) Collector(Type, map[Key]Value) {
	return Of(
		func() map[Key]Value {
			return map[Key]Value{}
		},
		func(table map[Key]Value, item Type) map[Key]Value {
			key, value := mapper(item)
			now, _ := table[key]
			table[key] = accumulator(now, value)
			return table
		},
		func(table map[Key]Value) map[Key]Value {
			return table
		},
		func(table1, table2 map[Key]Value) map[Key]Value {
			for k2, v2 := range table2 {
				v1, _ := table1[k2]
				table1[k2] = accumulator(v1, v2)
			}
			return table1
		},
	)
}
</code></pre>

<p>An interesting thing about this function is that while it has three separated type parameters, it returns
<code>Collector(Type, map[Key]Value)</code> that uses only two type parameters.</p>

<p>Note that we need to specify Type Constraint for Key <code>comparable</code> in order to use it as key of a map otherwise it just
wouldn’t work.</p>

<p><code>ToMap</code> expects two functions on input:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mapper <code>func(Type) (Key, Value)</code> â€” receives an original element and returns two values: first one is going to be used as key
of the map, and the second one is going to be used as the value of the map[key]</li>
<li>Accumulator <code>func(now Value, update Value) Value</code> â€” receives current value of map[key] and new value <code>update</code> that have to be
somehow accumulated into <code>now</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s see how it will work out on practice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Declare a simple type that will describe a movie and a score that a user gave to the movie:</p>

<pre><code>type MovieVote struct {
	Name  string
	Score int
}
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Create a stream of slice of some movies and user votes:</p>

<pre><code>items := stream.Of(
	[]MovieVote{
		{Name: "A", Score: 1},
		{Name: "A", Score: 2},
		{Name: "B", Score: 9},
		{Name: "B", Score: 10},
		{Name: "B", Score: 8},
		{Name: "C", Score: 7},
		{Name: "C", Score: 8},
		{Name: "C", Score: 7},
	},
)
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Now let’s convert them into <code>map[Name]SumOfScore</code>:</p>

<pre><code>result := stream.Collect(
	items,
	collector.ToMap(MovieVote, string, int)(
		func(movie MovieVote) (string, int) {
			return movie.Name, movie.Score
		},
		func(total, score int) int {
			return total + score
		},
	),
)
fmt.Println(result)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>The mapper returns name as key and score as value</li>
<li>The accumulator sums total and current score</li>
</ul>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>map[A:3 B:27 C:22]
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, this collector also works in Parallel mode, check it out in the source code:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><hr><p itemprop="description">I don't use social media often, that's by design. I know if I start using it regularly, I will become addicted to it. So, imagine my surprise when on one Sunday afternoon I found out that I spent the entire day doing nothing but watching videos on YouTube.</p><p>The saddest thing is that I didn’t even remember what I was watching. It was just a clockwork for my brain at that point. Wake up, open YouTube, watch a video, continue watching videos.</p><p>I write this blog on another Sunday afternoon, almost three months after, to say that I watched YouTube for just 10 minutes this week to watch a work-related video that a colleague sent.</p><p>I’m a little proud of myself, to tell the truth.</p><p>This is a log of everything I did to overcome this addiction. If it helped me, it might help someone else too.</p><h2 id="how-and-why-i-became-addicted">How and Why I Became Addicted</h2><p>YouTube is a community where billions of people share their talents, interests and findings with you.</p><p><strong>That’s the hook.</strong></p><p>The <strong>real</strong> YouTube is a billion-dollar company where hundreds of researchers and designers manipulate an algorithm to deliver a low-quality video to you.</p><p>I thought about why I was addicted for a long time. It basically was three things,</p><ul><li>Types of videos I watch</li><li>YouTube’s Algorithm</li><li>YouTube’s Story</li></ul><h3 id="types-of-videos-i-watch">Types of videos I watch</h3><h4 id="gaming-30">Gaming (30%)</h4><p>This one was easy to justify for me, I like watching someone be good at something. Until I realized that this was a passive way of thinking about it.</p><p>I’m not raising my skill by watching this, so what’s the point? The only way I could get better at video games is to play it more, not by watching someone else play it.</p><h4 id="self-help-30">Self Help (30%)</h4><p><strong>Biggest trap of them all.</strong> Productivity, Self Help, Motivational channels might seem to have a good agenda on the onset but they can’t profit if you actually improve yourself.</p><p>Most of the YouTubers in this category are good people at heart. But they know that 90% of the people watching them won’t improve anything in their life. They just like the feeling of improving themselves.</p><p>Every time you watch one of the self-help videos, your brain plays a trick on you. It makes you think that you are actually improving yourself but when in reality you are just actually watching a video that you will forget in 40 minutes.</p><p>You will come for more when that rush is over. And YouTube tells them to create more videos quickly for us to consume.</p><p>For quick reference these are the only things they will say to you from now until eternity:</p><ul><li>Self Help YouTubers: Take care of yourself</li><li>Productivity YouTubers: Organize your life for deep work</li><li>Motivational YouTubers: Never stop the Hustle (This will lead to burnout by the way.)</li></ul><p>Ironically most of these YouTubers recommend you to read a book.</p><h4 id="design-and-development-20">Design and Development (20%)</h4><p>I’m a professional web designer, so it’s important for me to keep up with the latest developments in my field. Of course, that’s what I told myself.</p><p>Things always change but YouTube is not a place to capture it. YouTube videos seem to be the fast-food sector of the industry. Fast to the point but not impactful and everlasting.</p><p>I’ve found that written content like</p><ul><li>Blog Posts</li><li>Documentation</li><li>Best Practices</li><li>Newsletters</li><li>Case Studies</li></ul><p>are often more informative and educational. They let you,</p><ul><li>Read at your own pace</li><li>Accessible and Developer Friendly</li><li>Most of them are intended to be everlasting or updated frequently</li></ul><p>One might argue developer tutorials are inherently good and I agree, but I usually get a better flow in my work from written tutorials.</p><p>These are mostly for entertainment, but as I distance myself from these more and more I find them to be passive entertainment.</p><p>Netflix has a collection of marvelously produced entertainment that will take my entire lifetime to watch. Why should I settle for this glut?</p><h4 id="pointless-internet-drama-10">Pointless Internet Drama (10%)</h4><p>This was the cone of shame for me, I liked reality TV, YouTubers fighting with each other and mostly pointless drama. I was thinking about why I like this, and then a quote someone said came to me,</p><p>Don’t live on someone else’s life.</p><p>I was projecting. I have a simple life with no problems. So, I liked watching other people have problems. I thought I was superior to them in some way and that made me feel good.</p><p>Of course, I was the idiot watching videos while they simply got paid and went home.</p><h3 id="youtubes-algorithm">YouTube’s Algorithm</h3><p>Whenever I open YouTube, it shows me a carefully chosen list of videos that interests me. It’s a combination of what I recently liked, latest videos from the creators I like, trending videos from my location, and cute animals.</p><p><strong>It’s impossible not to click on any of these.</strong></p><p>YouTube’s algorithm is very powerful at this point, probably the most sophisticated recommendation engine in the world. You simply can’t win it.</p><p>You can, however, not participate in its game. Some steps you can take:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Do not <code>smash that like button</code> on any videos.</strong></p><p>If you want to see a video again, download it to your drive. The YouTube video can be removed, blocked, or altered but you can always have what you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not <code>hit that bell icon</code>.</strong></p><p>Voluntarily having more notifications on your phone is the first step to becoming mindless and have other people dictate where you spend your time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pause Watched History and Search History.</strong></p><p>Again, download important videos. 98% of what you watch is not worth it and the other 2% can easily be searched again.</p></li></ul><p>Clear watch history, remove previously liked videos, clear out your comments. Do not give any indication to YouTube on what you like.</p><p>I even ran a puppeteer (automated script) to remove all the videos from my recommendation but it just pops back up. The <code>Not Interested</code> option is not real.</p><p><strong>Ultimately, be utilitarian on what you want.</strong></p><p>If you want to learn <em>How to Tie a Tie</em>, search for it, learn it and close it. Don’t needlessly subscribe, like or engage in any way.</p><h3 id="youtubes-story">YouTube’s Story</h3><p>A brand’s story is what you want other people to tell about your brand. YouTube’s story is,</p><p>YouTube is a community of people giving free information and entertainment.</p><ul><li><p><strong>YouTube is not a community.</strong></p><p>Individual creators may create a community. But YouTube is a company that wants nothing but profits.</p></li><li><p><strong>YouTube is not free.</strong></p><p>Nothing Google does is free.</p></li><li><p><strong>YouTube gives low-quality information and entertainment.</strong></p><p>Only 5% of its millions of videos are actually helpful. Don’t take that burden of sifting through all that to find something you might like.</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-i-overcame-youtube">How I Overcame YouTube</h2><p>Here are some simple and actionable steps that I took over the months,</p><ol><li><p><strong>Cancelling YouTube Premium</strong></p><p>If you get pissed off at the ads like I do, then it’s good. You will quit the video soon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Turn off notifications</strong></p><p>Taylor Swift’s new music video is not that important to notify you. No one should have the right to disturb you anytime they want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reducing subscriptions</strong></p><p>Go through your subscription list and remove anyone who you don’t need in your life anymore. I followed this and removed almost 300 subscriptions and I don’t even remember what they were now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Uninstalling apps</strong></p><p>YouTube is available everywhere, it doesn’t need to be on your phone or tablet. You can always watch in your mobile browser for something urgent.</p><p>Mobile apps have 30% higher engagement rate. We actively go back to an app more often than a website. That’s why everyone keeps pushing you to download their app. Don’t.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remove all subscriptions</strong></p><p>After some time, I naturally removed all my subscriptions, I found alternate sources to topics I was interested in. Books, Newsletters, Spotify, and Netflix was enough for me.</p><p>Tip: Subscribe to a channel called <code>Sub with no videos</code> to reduce the recommendations in your subscriptions tab.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add alternate habits</strong></p><p>My viewing hours reduced exponentially at this point. Now I opened YouTube, searched for some good creators, watched their latest video, and closed the site.</p><p>But to quit fully I knew I needed to replace YouTube time with something else. This can be a different thing for you and me. I started writing more often. The silence is great for creative thoughts and reflection.</p></li></ol><p>Today, after all this, I realized that I’m not addicted to YouTube anymore. I should be careful to make sure I don’t go back to it slowly. But I have high hopes for the future.</p><p>And always remember,</p><blockquote><p>“Too much of anything can make you sick” ~ Cheryl Cole</p></blockquote></article></div></div>]]>

<p>📘 Check our <strong>step-by-step tutorial and screencast</strong> on how to easily deploy on <strong>AWS</strong> a single-node <strong>Firecracker cloud</strong> integrated with the <strong>Docker Hub</strong> marketplace:</p>

</div></div>



<div><div>
<p>Application container technologies, like <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Docker (opens in a new tab)">Docker</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kubernetes (opens in a new tab)">Kubernetes</a>, are becoming the de facto leading standards for packaging, deploying and managing applications with increased levels of agility and efficiency. Kubernetes is widely used for the orchestration of containers on clusters, offering features for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>However, <strong>Kubernetes doesn’t necessarily work for every single use case</strong> nor solves all container management-related challenges an organization might face. Just to put an example, its support for multi-tenancy is actually quite limited, and it cannot guarantee perfectly secure isolation between tenants. The only way to run Kubernetes is by providing different teams with their own clusters. Upgrading clusters and patching vulnerabilities is not a quick and easy task, which in the end requires to build an <strong>expensive full-time admin team</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Moreover, Kubernetes does not offer cloud-like self-service provision features for users, nor accounting and advanced authorization features for administrators. Cloud providers and cloud management tools, like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Amazon EKS (opens in a new tab)" href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Google Kubernetes Engine (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine" target="_blank">Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</a>, try to bridge these gaps by offering <strong>managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service platforms</strong>. What these solutions do is to add an extra control layer that ends up <strong>increasing management complexity, resource consumption, and associated costs</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework” (opens in a new tab)" href="https://opennebula.io/firework/" target="_blank">OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework”</a> brings new exciting features to the container orchestration ecosystem by providing an <strong>innovative open source solution</strong> for organizations that need to build and manage a secure, self-service, multi-tenant cloud for serverless computing. Users of an OpenNebula cloud can now easily run isolated containers without the need to provision and manage servers or additional control layers, thus allowing them to focus on designing and building their applications instead of managing the underlying infrastructure. OpenNebula’s <strong>pioneering approach towards container orchestration</strong> integrates two main technologies: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="AWS Firecracker (opens in a new tab)" href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/" target="_blank">AWS Firecracker</a> as the VMM that provisions, manages and orchestrates micro-VMs, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Docker Hub (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a> as the marketplace for application containers from which users can obtain and seamlessly <strong>deploy Docker images as micro-VMs</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>AWS Firecracker is an open source technology that makes use of KVM to launch lightweight Virtual Machines—called micro-VMs—for <strong>enhanced security, workload isolation, and resource efficiency</strong>. It is widely used by AWS as part of their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Fargate (opens in a new tab)">Fargate</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Lambda (opens in a new tab)">Lambda</a> services. Firecracker opens up a whole new world of possibilities as the foundation for serverless solutions that need to quickly deploy critical applications as containers while keeping them in secure isolation. With the recent integration of Firecracker as a <strong>new supported virtualization technology</strong>, OpenNebula provides now an innovative solution to the classic dilemma between using containers—lighter but with weaker security—or Virtual Machines—with strong security but high overhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>OpenNebula’s integration of Docker Hub as a new native marketplace provides users with immediate access to <strong>Docker Hub official images</strong>. Through this integration Docker images can be easily imported into an OpenNebula cloud, following a process similar to the way in which the OpenNebula Public Marketplace operates. The OpenNebula context packages are installed during the import process so, once an image is imported, it becomes fully functional (including auto IP configuration, SSH key management and custom scripts). The Docker Hub marketplace also creates a new VM template associated with the imported image. This template can be customized by the user (e.g. adding the desired kernel, tuning specific parameters, etc.).</p>

<h2>An Enterprise Cloud for Containerized Applications</h2>



<p>OpenNebula brings to the container world a series of unique features to <strong>build your own enterprise cloud for serverless computing</strong>. Its unique approach speeds up the deployment of <strong>containerized applications and multi-tier services</strong> within your development workflow. In particular, OpenNebula provides:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fast startup times</strong>: With OpenNebula you can start containers in seconds by deploying them as Firecracker micro-VMs, without the need to provision and maintain Dockerized hosts or complex Kubernetes infrastructures.</li><li><strong>Direct access to applications</strong>:&nbsp; Deploying a container as a micro-VM allows your container to directly access your networks through the Firecracker micro-VM’s IP address. Furthermore, the micro-VM can be accessed via SSH and VNC by providing interactive modes that help with application development and troubleshooting.</li><li><strong>Hypervisor-level security: </strong>OpenNebula guarantees that your containerized application to run within a Firecracker micro-VM which, in turn, provides VM-grade security and isolation in a multi-tenant environment while preserving the efficiency of lightweight containers.</li><li><strong>Persistent storage: </strong>OpenNebula’s datastores can be used as persistent data volumes for containers by attaching them to your Firecracker micro-VMs. Read-only configuration or data files can be provided by using the OpenNebula file datastore, which can be used by the application within the micro-VM.</li><li><strong>Network access: </strong>Virtual Networks defined within an OpenNebula cloud (i.e. IPv4, IPv6, Dual Stack, Ethernet) can be easily configured so that containerized applications get direct access to the internet without requiring additional components (e.g. ingress controllers, load balancers, etc.). With OpenNebula Virtual Routers it is also possible to connect different virtual networks, allowing applications and Virtual Machines attached to different virtual networks to communicate with each other. It is possible to use security groups for ensuring network security for containers applications.</li><li><strong>Application horizontal scaling</strong>: Application deployed as complex, multi-tier services can be scaled up and down “manually” but also (via the OneFlow component) in an automatic manner, based on user-defined metrics and pre-defined criteria. An <em>init</em> script can be defined to send application metrics to OneGate, OpenNebula’s metadata server.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Complete multi-tenant environments</strong> with ACLs, users, groups, resource UNIX-like permissions and VDCs, in which cloud admins can easily adapt OpenNebula to their organization’s infrastructure and DevOps requirements and set up independent sets of resources for specific purposes or groups of users (i.e. development, testing, integration and production).</li><li><strong>Geo-distributed applications</strong>: Thanks to its elastic cloud infrastructure feature (OneProvision), OpenNebula allows to build on-demand geo-distributed infrastructures for execution of containerized applications at the Edge.</li></ul>







<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>Although many IT departments providing container execution services have decided to implement their <strong>DevOps requirements on top of Kubernetes</strong>, that doesn’t mean that betting only on one horse is the wisest thing to do. Organizations requiring container orchestration capabilities should first of all state what their main objective is, and be careful not to make apples to oranges comparisons or to fall into <strong>unexpected costs or vendor lock-ins</strong>. Kubernetes is a <strong>very complex and demanding technology</strong>, and—temporary fashions aside—other technologies may actually be the best solution for some use cases.<br></p>



<p>Some of the features provided by Kubernetes (such as its declarative model, self healing, automated rollout and rollbacks, secret and configuration management, service discovery and load balancing) make it ideal for companies that need complete container orchestration services for the deployment and management of containerized workflows in a production environment. Yet, these organizations have to be able to cope with <strong>high operational costs</strong> if what they want is to build and manage a <strong>corporate Kubernetes deployment</strong>.<br></p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OpenNebula (opens in a new tab)" href="https://opennebula.io/firework/" target="_blank">OpenNebula</a>, on the other hand, becomes an ideal solution for companies that need to build <strong>multi-tenant Container-as-a-Service environments</strong>, but with <strong>lower operational costs</strong>. In this way, users and business units can develop and deploy applications easily and very fast, without their organizations having to manage dockerized hosts or complex orchestration infrastructures such as Kubernetes or OpenShift. With the release of its version 5.12 “Firework”, OpenNebula has become a real alternative for implementing an <strong>agile and serverless cloud paradigm for containerized workloads</strong> in production environments 🚀</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>After 8 years of using Apple computers (mac mini and multiple MacBooks), I decided to say "Farewell" to Apple.</p>
<p>The quality of both software and hardware when it comes to their mobile computers went downhill in recent years.<br>
Butterfly keyboard issues, old CPUs (compared to what other manufacturers put in their machines), quite limited of memory (until latest iteration of 13" MacBooks Pro it was impossible to get more than 16GB of RAM), software issues with Catalina (audio glitches, random freezes, random reboots) - all of that led me to the point where I decided to sell my 2015-version of MacBook Pro (I still have one MBPro from 2019 that I'm using for work at current company, and I still need to live with this failing system)</p>
<p>When I had switched from 2012 mac mini to PC desktop three years ago (there was no reasonable alternative from Apple on the horizon) I've told myself I'm going to stick with Apple for mobile computing (and I partly do, I still don't see any alternatives to iPhone and iPad) based on my previous experiences with Linux on a laptop. But I decided to give it a try.<br>
When I previously used Linux on a laptop, it was between 2008 and 2011, and it was a mess - battery life was a joke compared to what I could achieve with Windows, constant issues with suspending and hibernation, failing wireless network card.<br>
That was when I joined Apple cult. It was quite the opposite - long battery life, beautiful UI, seamless integration between different products, quite good performance, lot of great apps. Too bad it's only partially true now.  I want to share my journey about looking for a suitable replacement for MacBook Pro in 2020, and I need to make clear that my needs for computing might not be usual. But hey, we're talking about MacBook <em>Pro</em>, and I mean this should be aimed at professionals. I'm 100% sure many people will be happy with their Macs.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>5-6 hours of battery life</li>
<li>As much memory as possible. I use a lot of Docker containers with memory-hungry applications. And I use Chrome, so there's no such thing as too much memory</li>
<li>Fast disks</li>
<li>Ideally - matte display</li>
<li>Screen no bigger than 14"</li>
<li>Reliably working Wi-Fi card</li>
</ul>
<p>You may think many products will meet these criteria, but you couldn't be more wrong.</p>

        <p>Back with a post after 6 years of silence. If you had to parse a microsecond-resolution epoch timestamp as quickly as possible, how would you do it?  We’ll take a look at using compiler intrinsics to do it in log(n) time.</p>


        <h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>

<p>Let’s say, theoretically, you have some text-based protocol, or file that
contains microsecond timestamps. You need to parse these timestamps as quickly
as possible. Maybe it’s json, maybe it’s a csv file, maybe something else
bespoke. It’s 16 characters long, and this could also apply to credit card
numbers.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="csv">timestamp,event_id
1585201087123567,a
1585201087123585,b
1585201087123621,c</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the end you have to implement a function similar to this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>parse_timestamp</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>// ???</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-native-solution">The native solution</h3>

<p>Let’s start with what’s available, and compare. We have
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/atoi"><code>std::atoll</code></a> , a function
inherited from C,
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_stringstream"><code>std::stringstream</code></a>
, the newer C++17
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/charconv"><code>&lt;charconv&gt;</code></a> header, and
by request
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_73_0/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/qi/reference/basics.html"><code>boost::spirit::qi</code></a>.
I’ll be using <a href="https://github.com/google/benchmark">Google Benchmark</a> to
measure the performance, and to have a baseline let’s compare against loading
the final result into a register - i.e. no actual parsing involved.</p>

<p>Let’s run the benchmarks! The code is not important here, it just shows what is being benchmarked.</p>

<p>Wow, <code>stringstream</code> is pretty bad. Not that it’s a fair comparison but parsing
a single integer using <code>stringstream</code> is 391 times slower than just loading our
integer into a register.  <code>&lt;charconv&gt;</code> and <code>boost::spirit</code> do a lot better by
comparison.</p>

<p>Since we know our string contains the number we’re trying to parse, and we
don’t need to do any whitespace skipping, can we be faster?  Just how much time
is spent in validation?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-naive-solution">The naive solution</h3>

<p>Let’s write a good old for loop. Read the string character by character, and
build up the result.</p>

<p>That’s actually not bad for a simple for loop. If such a simple solution is
able to beat a standard-library implementation, it means there’s quite a lot of
effort that goes into input validation. As a sidenote - if you know your input,
or can do simpler validation you can get some significant speedups.</p>

<p>For further solutions and benchmarks, let’s ignore the standard library
functions. We should be able to go much faster than this.</p>

<p>Ok, that’s slightly better again, but we’re still processing a character at a time.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-byteswap-insight">The byteswap insight</h3>

<p>Let’s draw out the operations in the unrolled solution as a tree, on a
simplified example of parsing ‘1234’ into a 32-bit integer:</p>

<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://kholdstare.github.io/diagrams/parse-unrolled.png">

<figcaption><p>Unrolled solution graph of operations for ‘1234’</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>We can see that the amount of multiplications and additions is linear with the
amount of characters. It’s hard to see how to improve this, because every
multiplication is by a different factor (so we can’t multiply “in one go”), and at
the end of the day we need to add up all the intermediate results.</p>

<p>However, it’s still very regular. For one thing, the first character in the
string is multiplied by the largest factor, because it is the most significant
digit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a little-endian machine (like x86), an integer’s first byte contains the
least significant digits, while the first byte in a string contains the most
significant digit.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://kholdstare.github.io/diagrams/parse-byteswap-insight.png">

<figcaption><p>Looking at the string as an integer we can get closer to
the final parsed state in fewer operations - see how the hex representation is
<strong>almost</strong> what we want</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Now to reinterpret the bytes of a string as an integer we have to use
<code>std::memcpy</code> (<a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1307">to avoid strict-aliasing
violations</a>), and we have compiler
instrinsic <code>__builtin_bswap64</code> to swap the bytes in one instruction. The
<code>std::memcpy</code> will get optimized out, so this is a win so far.</p>

<p>But now that we have an integer that kind of, sort of looks like what we want,
how do we get it across the finish line without too much work?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-divide-and-conquer-insight">The divide and conquer insight</h3>

<p>From the previous step, we end up with an integer whose bit representation 
has each digit placed in a separate byte. I.e. even though one byte can
represent up to 256 values, we have values 0-9 in each byte of the integer.
They are also in the right little endian order. Now we just need to “smash”
them together somehow.</p>

<p>We know that doing it linearly would be too slow, what’s the next possibility?
<strong>O(log(n))</strong>! We need to combine every adjacent digit into a pair in one step,
and then each pair of digits into a group of four, and so on, until we have the
entire integer.</p>

<p>After I posted the first version of this article, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gr18ig/faster_integer_parsing/frx9agb">Sopel97 on
reddit</a>
pointed out that the byteswap is not necessary. Combining adjacent digits works
either way - their order doesn’t matter.  I realized that it helped me with the
next insight, but could be omitted for the final code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key is working on adjacent digits simultaneously. This allows a tree of
operations, running in O(log(n)) time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This involves multiplying the even-index digits by a power of 10 and leaving the
odd-index digits alone. This can be done with bitmasks to selectively apply
operations</p>

<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://kholdstare.github.io/diagrams/parse-mask-insight.png">

<figcaption><p>By using bitmasking, we can apply operations to more than one digit at a time, to combine them into a larger group</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Let’s finish the <code>parse_8_chars</code> function we started earlier by employing this
masking trick. As a neat side-effect of the masking, we don’t need to subtract
<code>'0'</code>, since it will be masked away.</p>

<h3 id="the-trick">The trick</h3>

<p>Putting it all together, to parse our 16-digit integer, we break it up into two
chunks of 8 bytes, run <code>parse_8_chars</code> that we have just written, and benchmark it!</p>

<p>Not too shabby, we shaved almost 56% off of the unrolled loop benchmark! Still,
it feels like we are manually doing a bunch of masking and elementwise
operations. Maybe we can just let the CPU do all the hard work?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-simd-trick">The SIMD trick</h3>

<p>We have the main insight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Combine groups of digits simultaneously to achieve O(log(n)) time</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have a 16-character, or 128-bit string to parse - can we use SIMD? Of
course we can! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD stands for Single Instruction Multiple
Data</a>, and is exactly what we are looking
for. SSE and AVX instructions are supported on both Intel and AMD CPUs, and
 they typically work with wider registers.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/">Intel Intrinsics
Guide</a> to find
the right compiler intrinsics for the right SIMD CPU instructions.</p>

<p>Let’s set up the digits in each of the 16 bytes first:</p>

   <!-- Title -->
   
   <p><img src="https://cheapskatesguide.org/pics/gopher-240.jpg" alt="Gopher">
      I first had access to the early Internet--what there was of 
      it--through the university I attended.  I remember how different 
      the Internet was back in the mid-to-late 1980's.  We had 
      electronic mail, but almost no one used it.  We logged onto 
      remote computers with telnet and transferred files with FTP.  
      All this was done at the command line.  If I remember correctly, 
      very few graphical user interfaces existed then.  Those that 
      did were composed of ASCII characters.  The first web browser was 
      not released until 1991.  Remembering causes me some sadness, 
      though in some ways the Internet is better now.  It certainly 
      has many more users, and that is a good thing.  I just wish it had 
      more Internet-savvy users.</p>

   <p>I remember that many of the early computer networks and websites on 
      the Internet were run by imaginative people with great senses of 
      humor.  For example, the computer network that I used at the second 
      engineering company for which I worked in the late 1980's had seven 
      sun workstations named after the seven dwarves.  As you may imagine, 
      that provided us with no end of entertainment.  "Dopey is down, 
      AGAIN!"  "Grumpy is acting up."  "Sneezy died yesterday.  When is 
      the funeral?"</p>

   <p>Back then, computers were something special.  They were wondrous.  
      Individuals who owned them were mavericks in a sense.  Buying a 
      personal computer then was the same as painting the word "nerd" in big 
      red letters across your forehead, and being known as a nerd back then was 
      not something you wanted.  One of my highschool friends built a 
      Heathkit computer.  The only display it had was in the form of 
      one-inch, red LED digits on the front.</p>

   <p>Now, that computers permeate our society, no one bothers giving them 
      interesting names.  They've nearly become fungible commodities that we 
      use up and then throw away when they have outlived their usefulness.  
      Nearly everyone uses the Internet at least occassionally.  And, 
      strangely enough, being called a nerd is seen as a good thing.</p>
   <h2>Gopherspace</h2>
   <p>The Gopher protocol was released by the University of Minnesota in 
      1991.  Gopher servers provided users with access to various types 
      of files, including text, binary, image, sound, and GIF.  But the 
      milieu of gopherspace was text.   Text was mostly what Gopher users 
      saw.  Users could also access FTP, telnet, and 
      Usenet servers.  Back in the 1990's, Veronica search engines
      tied together the network of Gopher servers in a similar way as 
      modern search engines do today with the webservers of the
      modern Internet.  In the 1990's, Jughead search engines were designed 
      to search individual Gopher servers.  And, Archie was an FTP search 
      engine.  Archie, Veronica, and Jughead search engines were named 
      after characters in the Archie comics that first appeared in print in
      1941.  Back in the 1980's and early 1990's, when people who loved 
      computers still ran much of the Internet, it reflected their 
      personalities.  Now, the Internet is more a beige and gray  
      reflection of the corporate world.</p> 
  
   <p>Today the Gopher protocol has been supplanted almost completely 
      by the HTTP protocol upon which the World Wide Web is based.
      Though the Internet has changed considerably, Gopher servers are 
      still around.  Text is still mostly what users see 
      in gopherspace, and it can still be navigated with 
      gopher-capable Internet browsers.  Sadly, only one Veronica search 
      engine appears to operate today.  Now, When a user navigates through
      gopherspace with the Veronica search engine, by following links, or
      by entering URL's into his browser, he has an experience in many 
      ways similar to surfing the modern Internet.</p>
   
   <p>Though about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)"> 
      two dozen Internet browsers</a> can still access gopherspace, either 
      natively or with plugins, I will only talk about one.  I'll focus on the 
      Lynx browser, because it is readily available, easy to use, and 
      powerful.  The Lynx browser also runs on all the major 
      operating systems.  I'll show readers how to use the Lynx browser 
      to get into gopherspace and have a look around.</p>
   <h2>Installing and Using the Lynx Browser</h2>
   <p>The Lynx browser is a text-only Internet browser that has native 
      support for gopherspace.  Lynx allows a user to seamlessly navigate 
      around the Internet and gopherspace using only the keys on his computer's 
      keyboard.  Lynx does not use a mouse or touchpad.  Windows computer 
      users can download the Lynx browser from the 
      <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx website</a>.</p>
 
   <div><p>Most Linux users can install Lynx simply by opening a Linux 
      terminal window and typing:
   </p></div><div>
<pre>sudo apt-get install lynx
</pre>
   </div>
   <p>

   Then, type "lynx" (without the quotes) at the command line to start 
   the Lynx browser.</p>

   <p>To go to a Gopher address using the Lynx browser, hit the "g" 
      key on your keyboard.  Near the bottom of the Lynx window, the 
      prompt "URL to open:" will appear.  Now, begin typing the Gopher 
      address.  Gopher URL's can also be copied and pasted from other 
      applications.  First, copy the URL from the other application, 
      then select the Lynx window, hit the right mouse button, and 
      select "paste".  Try going to this Gopher address for practice: 
      gopher://infinitelyremote.com/0/books/Internet_Gopher_Users_Guide.txt.  
      After you hit the "Enter" key, the text file entitled "Internet 
      Gopher Users Guide" should be visible in your Lynx window.</p>

   <p>Lynx has three user modes.  At this point, you are in the novice 
      user mode, so at the bottom of the page, the following instructions 
      should be visible: "-- press space for next page --  Arrow keys: 
      Up and Down to move.  Right to follow a link; Left to go back.  
      H)elp O)ptions P)rint G)o M)ain screen Q)uit /=search 
      [delete]=history list".</p>

   <p>At a basic level, Lynx is very easy to use, so a user does not 
      have to know much to navigate around gopherspace and read text 
      files.  I will go over the basic commands, and leave it to you 
      to learn more later.  To navigate around inside a text file that 
      contains no hyperlinks, press the space bar or the down arrow on 
      your keyboard to move down one page and the up arrow to move back 
      up one page.  The left arrow is like the back button in a modern 
      Internet browser; it takes you to the previous text file that you 
      visited.  In a text file with hyperlinks, pressing the up or down 
      arrow moves the cursor to the hyperlink above or below the 
      cursor's present position.  When the cursor is on a hyperlink, 
      pressing the "Enter" key or the right arrow takes you to the 
      document pointed to by the hyperlink.</p>

   <p>Some Gopher pages contain forms similar to HTML forms.  For 
      example, links to search engines may appear as a search line.  Use 
      the left or right arrow to move the cursor to the search line.  
      Then, type the key words you want to search for and hit the 
      "Enter" key.  This will take you to a search results page.</p>

   <p>To display the Gopher URL of the file you are currently reading, 
      hit the "=" key.  Then, hit the left arrow key to get back to the 
      file you were just reading.</p>

   <p>Exit from Lynx by hitting the "q" key.  By the way, most 
      command-line Linux programs that take control of a terminal 
      window can be exited by hitting either the "q" key or by typing 
      ":q".</p>

   <p>This is all the information you need to know to navigate around 
      in gopherspace (or on the rest of the Internet) using the Lynx 
      browser.  For additional instructions on the use of Lynx, bring 
      up Lynx and hit the "h" key.</p>
   <h2>Exploring Gopherspace</h2>
   <p>Now the fun begins.  Perhaps the best place to enter gopherspace 
      is gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/world.  There you will find 
      links to dozens of Gopher servers.  Floodgap claims that it 
      hosts the last Veronica search engine in existence.  So, from 
      Floodgap you can use the Veronica search engine to search 
      gopherspace by key words, or you can go to individual Gopher 
      user sites by following links to the Gopher servers that host them.</p>

   <p>One of the largest collections of Gopher user sites can be found 
      by following the Link on Floodgap labeled "'Greatest hits': most 
      recently verified Gopher servers".  From there, follow the link 
      labeled "sdf.org:70" to the Super-Dimensional Fortress (URL: 
      gopher://sdf.org/1).  There you will find many interesting phlogs 
      and files.  Gopher blogs are called phlogs.  One interesting 
      phlogger is Tomasino (gopher://sdf.org/1/users/tomasino/).  
      Another is solderpunk (gopher://sdf.org/1/users/solderpunk/).  
      There are also may others.  So, have fun and explore!</p>

With no need to remember a password or prove email ownership, <a href="https://medium.com/@kelvinvanamstel/should-we-embrace-magic-links-and-leave-passwords-alone-c73db7007fc4">many</a> <a href="https://techbeacon.com/security/your-passwordless-future-make-it-sooner-rather-later">people</a> have hailed "Magic Link" as the perfect authentication solution.</p><p>How it works on SnapHabit? After a user enters their enter email address, we direct them to their inbox to tap a link to sign in. Before diving into what went wrong, here's a snapshot of our authentication funnel:</p><ul><li><strong>11% of users</strong> required at least 4 magic-link emails before completing signing up.</li><li><strong>18% of users never finished signup (clicked the magic link)</strong>. On average, these users attempted signup twice, with several users submitting &gt; 10 times.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="-why-would-you-use-magic-link-anyways">... why would you use magic link, anyways?</h2><p>Friends are core to SnapHabit, so the functionality to send a friend request is critical. Phone number or email felt like the cheapest way to support a unique identifier — as it could be used for both authentication and finding a friend.</p><p>Like most services, we first looked at using "Sign in with Google/Facebook". However, Apple recently adjusted App Store Guidelines... starting June 30, <strong>"apps that use a social login service ... must also offer Sign in with Apple"</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-17-at-3.47.00-PM-2.png"><figcaption>App Store Guidelines, June 17, 2020</figcaption></figure><p>Apple Sign In supports <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425">"Hide My Email"</a>, so many users who sign in with Apple would not have a meaningful email attached to their account. Asking for a user's email after they chose to "hide it" would be a poor user experience.</p><p>So in summary, we had 4 options for account creation:</p><ol><li><strong>Email + Password</strong> ... requires forgot password and users to prove email ownership</li><li><strong>Support all third-party (Apple, Google, Facebook)</strong> ... and add a new unique identifier to allow friends to find each other, given email will not be sufficient</li><li><strong>Phone number magic link</strong> ... we were relying on Expo (previously did not support phone-number auth), and we also felt emails would be a good/cheap tool for communication</li><li><strong>Email magic link</strong> </li></ol><p>Email magic link felt... perfect! &nbsp;We built the login flow, complete with a custom email, instructional webpage, and deep linking. <strong>Hurrah, we had cracked the authentication funnel!</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QoS2-mIuOZw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="what-went-wrong-and-how-we-tried-to-solve">What went wrong and how we tried to solve</h2><p><em>If you're interested in the technical details of how we implemented some of these fixes, let me know and we'll consider publishing.</em></p><h3 id="1-users-clicking-the-link-on-another-device-">1. Users clicking the link on another device.</h3><p>Of 10 users we chatted with who had issues, 4 tried to click the link on another device. There are two routes to solving this:</p><ul><li>technical solution to support this behavior (clicking the link on desktop will authenticate the user on mobile)</li><li>better instructional text</li></ul><p><strong>The latter was simpler, so we started with that:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/firstattempt.png"></figure><p><strong>And again.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/email.png"></figure><p><strong>And more.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/landingpage.png"></figure><h3 id="2-user-confusion-about-clicking-a-link-to-login">2. User confusion about clicking a link to login</h3><p>At least 2 people mentioned they simply did not understand that they needed to authenticate with email. &nbsp;To solve this, we added</p><ul><li>call-to-action to open Apple Mail or Gmail</li><li>disabled the "resend" button for 10 seconds, to encourage users to tap the mail CTA before attempting login again</li></ul><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/buttons.png"></figure><h3 id="3-users-entering-the-wrong-email">3. Users entering the wrong email</h3><p>Many users who did not finish finish signing up (eg. did not click email link) had accounts with a ".con" domain. &nbsp;We added an notice to alert users of a possibly unintended typo:</p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/dotcon.png"></figure><h2 id="-what-s-next">... What's next</h2><div><p>Despite attempting to solve 1, 2 and 3, our funnel drop-off is still larger than we'd like (~15% of users do not open the email correctly).</p><p>So after two months of solution hackery, we're cutting our losses and adding sign in with Google, Facebook and Apple options. If we still see users opting for email sign-in and failing to complete, we'll consider making the full-circle shift back to an email/password model.<br><strong><br>I hope our sharing this painful journey can save you from taking a similar path!</strong> &nbsp;Let me know if you have any questions or feedback at <a href="https://snaphabit.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="600a010b0520130e011008010209144e0110104e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p></div><hr><p><em>Don't have SnapHabit yet?

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, built on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You can use <strong>Foam</strong> for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and you’re free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-features-dark-mode-demo.png" alt="Foam kitchen sink, showing a few of the key features"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace</a> for all your knowledge and research.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation" title="Graph visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: This documentation was researched, written and published using <strong>Foam</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a GitHub repository from foam-template</a>. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.</li>
  <li>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/.vscode/settings.json">.vscode/settings.json</a> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to use <strong>Foam</strong>, read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>].</p>

<p>There are [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/known-issues" title="Known Issues">known-issues</a>], and I’m sure, many unknown issues! Please <a href="http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">report them on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif" alt="Short video of Foam in use"></p>

<p>Head over to [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>] for some useful patterns and ideas!</p>

<h2 id="call-to-adventure">Call To Adventure</h2>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s is currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check out [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/roadmap" title="Roadmap">roadmap</a>] to see what’s in the plans</li>
  <li>Read about our [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/principles" title="Principles">principles</a>] to understand Foam’s philosophy and direction</li>

<![CDATA[Server Side Rendering React App with Deno]]>

June 25, 2020 | https://dev.p.ota.to/post/server-side-rendering-react-app-with-deno-4qf28vm8axb/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dev.p.ota.to/post/server-side-rendering-react-app-with-deno-4qf28vm8axb/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage">
        <div><p><img src="https://dev.p.ota.to/images/5670392840585216/" alt="Image"></p>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Two of my favourites things are React and dinosaurs.
In this article I will show how I’ve put them together to develop a server side rendering <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> application with <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a>.</p>
<h2>Project Setup</h2>
<p>I will assume that we are all familiar with React and Deno. Knowing that Deno is pretty new, if you don’t know how to install it and how it works, I would highly suggest you to have a read at this great <a href="https://dev.p.ota.to/post/an-introduction-to-deno-4u3suut77w6/">introduction</a> before diving into this article.</p>
<p>Now let’s start creating the project structure and the files needed for this tutorial, I’m using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> but any editor will do.
Open your terminal and type:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir deno-react-ssr &amp;&amp; cd $_
code .
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new folder called <code>deno-react-ssr</code> and will open it with vscode.
In this folder we will need to create three files, <code>app.tsx</code> that will contain the code of the React component, <code>server.tsx</code> for the server code and <code>deps.ts</code> will contain all our dependencies. Think of it as our version of a <code>package.json</code>.
You will end up with a structure like this:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── app.tsx
├── deps.ts
└── server.tsx
</code></pre>
<h2>Setting up the dependencies</h2>
<p>In <code>deps.ts</code> we will have to export all the dependencies needed for this application to run.
Copy the following code and add it to your file.</p>
<pre><code>// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/types/react/v16.13.1/react.d.ts"
import React from 'https://jspm.dev/react@16.13.1';
// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/types/react-dom/v16.13.1/server.d.ts"
import ReactDOMServer from 'https://jspm.dev/react-dom@16.13.1/server';
export { React, ReactDOMServer }
export { Application, Context, Router } from 'https://deno.land/x/oak@v4.0.0/mod.ts';
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, in Deno you import the modules directly from a url. 
I’ve decided to import React and ReactDOMServer from <a href="https://jspm.org/">jspm</a> as suggested in the <a href="https://deno.land/#third-party-modules">documentation for third party modules</a> but you can use any other CDN that provides the same modules.</p>
<p>One unusual thing that may stand out to you could be this:<br>
<code>// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/types/react/v16.13.1/react.d.ts"</code><br>
Since we are using typescript, this line of code will inform Deno of the location of the types it needs to import and will affect the <code>import</code> statement that follows. A more exhaustive explanation can be found in the <a href="https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/typescript#compiler-hint">Deno Type Hint</a> manual.</p>
<p>I’ve also decided to use <a href="https://github.com/oakserver/oak">Oak</a>, a middleware framework for <a href="https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/http/mod.ts">Deno's http server</a> that also provides a router, so I’m importing all the modules we will use in the server in addition to the <code>Context</code> type that typescript requires.</p>
<h2>Create your React component</h2>
<p>This is how our <code>app.tsx</code> component will look:</p>
<pre><code>import { React } from "./deps.ts";

const App = () =&gt; {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const garden = {
    backgroundColor: 'green',
    height: 'auto',
    fontSize: '30px',
    maxWidth: '400px',
    padding: '20px 5px',
    width: '100%'
  };

  return (
    &lt;div className="pure-g pure-u"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;My DenoReact App&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;button className="pure-button" onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;Add a 🦕 in your garden!&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;p style={garden}&gt;
      { Array(count).fill(&lt;span&gt;🦕&lt;/span&gt;) }
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default App;
</code></pre>
<p>As with any standard React component, we start by importing React from our <code>deps.ts</code> file.</p>
<p>Then we are going to declare our App component that uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">hooks</a> to implement a simple button counter that allows you to add as many dinosaurs as you want in your personal garden!</p>
<h2>Setting up the Server</h2>
<p>For the server I’m using <a href="https://github.com/oakserver/oak">Oak</a> and the code in <code>server.tsx</code> will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import {
  Application,
  Context,
  React,
  ReactDOMServer,
  Router,
} from './deps.ts';

import App from "./app.tsx";

const PORT = 8008;

const app = new Application();
const jsBundle = "/main.js";

const js =
`import React from "https://jspm.dev/react@16.13.1";
 import ReactDOM from "https://jspm.dev/react-dom@16.13.1";
 const App = ${App};
 ReactDOM.hydrate(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById('app'));`;  


const html =
  `&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/purecss@2.0.3/build/pure-min.css"&gt;
      &lt;script type="module" src="${jsBundle}"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;main id="app"&gt;${ReactDOMServer.renderToString(&lt;App /&gt;)}&lt;/main&gt;  
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;`;

const router = new Router();
router
  .get('/', (context: Context) =&gt; {
    context.response.type = 'text/html';
    context.response.body = html;
  })
  .get(jsBundle, (context: Context) =&gt; {
    context.response.type = 'application/javascript';
    context.response.body = js;
  });

app.use(router.routes());
app.use(router.allowedMethods());

console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}...`);

await app.listen({ port: PORT });
</code></pre>
<p>As always we need to import all the dependencies we will use in our server. 
We will also import our App we created earlier, as you can see the extension <code>.tsx</code> is required in Deno so don’t forget it!<br>
Next step is to create our Oak server application and we’ll also need to define some routes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'/'</code> will serve our HTML page that contains the rendered app.  </li>
<li><code>'/main.js'</code>  will serve our application code that is needed to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate">hydrate</a> the client side React application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally we tell our application to use the route we just created and start listening on port <code>8008</code>. You can notice I’m also using <code>router.allowedMethods()</code>, it’s a middleware that lets the client know when a route is not allowed.</p>
<h2>Run the application</h2>
<p>Running the SSR React application we just created is extremely simple, you just need to use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>deno run --allow-net ./server.tsx
</code></pre>
<p>Deno is built secure by default, that means that a Deno application will not be able to access your network, to overcome this we'll just need to use Deno's <code>--allow-net</code> flag.<br>
Now the only thing missing is to open <code>http://localhost:8008/</code> and enjoy your new App!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you enjoyed the brief tutorial illustrated in this article and I’m looking forward to seeing what will happen next and how more complex applications can be built with this stack.</p>
<p>If you are still unclear about anything we’ve done or want a full reference of the code, here’s the <a href="https://github.com/fleonard/deno-react-ssr">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>You've got to start somewhere right. You've got your landing page and maybe even an MVP, but no one is visiting your website! How do you actually get those first 100 users? I've been there myself with  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nat.app/">my startup</a>, and I would have loved to read such an article when I got started, so here it is! In honour of my past self and to help all fellow startup founders! </p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<p>Here are a few basic tips you should get started with. They will pay off in the coming months. </p>
<h3 id="start-with-seo">Start with SEO</h3>
<p>SEO will not get you users overnight, but it's an amazing long term investment. Do it. 
Obviously, don't try to rank for super general keywords, instead, focus on niche keywords your audience is interested in. Here are a few examples from our own startup: </p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/@nathanganser/which-contacts-am-i-losing-touch-with-find-out-now-25f2db1320c3">Which contacts am I losing touch with? Find out now</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/nat-personal-relationship-manager/what-is-a-gmail-metadata-integration-and-why-you-should-use-it-57b37fe54dbe">What is a Gmail Metadata integration and why you should use it</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/nat-personal-relationship-manager/how-i-created-an-automated-relationship-management-tool-using-coda-zapier-8a31a6d2ebe2">How I created an Automated Relationship Management tool using Coda &amp; Zapier</a>  </li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/nat-personal-relationship-manager/the-ultimate-personal-relationship-manager-list-2ae87acf5070">Top 6 Best Personal CRM apps</a> </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Like passive income, those articles are generating a steady (albeit small) traffic to our app. But what's powerful about this traffic is that its super high-quality people. Only passionate people will find your articles, and when they do, they'll check out your app as well. </em></p>
<h3 id="quora-twitter-answer-to-questions">Quora &amp; Twitter: Answer to questions</h3>
<p>Create a company account and start replying to questions related to what you're doing. Twitter has a really good advanced search feature and Quora will suggest you more than enough questions you can reply to. If you spend a few hours each week generating good content on those platforms, you'll get a steady stream of clicks to your landing page as well. </p>

<h3 id="pioneer-app">Pioneer.app</h3>
<p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a>  is an online accelerator that you can join for free. Every week, you submit a progress update and other users will give you feedback. This is a free way to get a few clicks to your app from startup founders. </p>
<h3 id="get-listed-on-10words-betalist">Get listed on 10words &amp; Betalist</h3>
<p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://10words.io/">10words</a> and  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.nat.app/betalist.com">BetaList</a> are like a small Product Hunts. They are much smaller, you can expect around 50 clicks to your website for each. Still worth something! </p>
<h3 id="list-your-startup-on-indie-hacker-makerlog">List your startup on Indie Hacker &amp; Makerlog</h3>
<p>Those are two cool communities. If you're active, you'll definitely get some attention and users! </p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://getmakerlog.com/">MakerLog</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.nat.app/indiehackers.com">Indie Hacker</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="product-hunt-ship">Product Hunt Ship</h3>
<p>Product Hunt has a place for upcoming apps called <strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.producthunt.com/ship">Ship</a> </strong>, I've not found it to be very useful, but it can get you a few additional users. </p>
<h2 id="growth-hacks">Growth hacks</h2>
<p>That's where stuff gets exciting. Use these growth hacks with moderation, there is a fine line between marketing and spamming. </p>
<h3 id="product-hunt-phantombuster-twitter">Product Hunt + PhantomBuster + Twitter</h3>
<p>If there are already a few apps on ProductHunt that are similar to what you're building, consider using  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-i-growth-hacked-my-way-to-500-waiting-list-subscribers-9612933fd3">this growth hack</a>. I've used it extensively myself. </p>
<h3 id="buy-targeted-email-lists">Buy targeted email lists</h3>
<p>I've built a tool myself that lets me scrape email addresses from founders on Indie Hacker. What's powerful is that you can filter by every filter available on Indie Hacker (revenue, location, business model, ...). You can use it to buy an email list here and use a tool like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gmass.com/">Gmass</a> or Streak to reach out.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scrapeindiehacker.app/">Buy a list here</a>.</p>
<p>I don't recommend just sending the same email to everyone as this will impact your reputation. Instead, send personalized mass emails. It does take a bit longer, but it's worth every second considering the impact it will have on response rate and trust.</p>

<p>There are many chrome extensions out there that have tons of users but that are not maintained anymore. You can buy one for very cheap that is related to what you do and advertise your business on there. I bought  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-contacts-opener/pjpambjkhcilibnmeihhfgdkhfelbdkj">Google Contacts Opener</a>  and it's been generating significant traffic to our website ever since. </p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-not-be-doing">What you should not be doing</h2>
<h3 id="advertising">Advertising</h3>
<p>It will cost you too much. Just don't think about it. In the early days, ads are not the way to go.</p>
<h3 id="launch-on-product-hunt">Launch on Product Hunt</h3>
<p>You've got only one shot at this, it better be big. You don't want to launch on Product Hunt before having built a mature product. Product Hunt is not for the launching phase, it's for the growth phase.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://betalist.com/">BetaList</a> is a better place to start.</p>
<h3 id="my-startup-s-traffic">My startup's traffic</h3>
<p>Here is a breakdown of who visited our website recently. This will give you a better idea of what you should focus on.

<p>If you have used <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bountysource.com/">Bountysource</a> in the past, you may have received an email announcing new terms of service that included a clause that would forfeit unclaimed bounties. On June 16, Bountysource sent this message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are receiving this email because we are updating the Bountysource Terms of Service, effective 1st July 2020.</p>

  <h4 id="whats-changing">What’s changing?</h4>
  <p>We have added a Time-Out clause to the Bounties section of the agreement:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>2.13 Bounty Time-Out.</em></p>

    <p><em>If no Solution is accepted within two years after a Bounty is posted, then the Bounty will be withdrawn and the amount posted for the Bounty will be retained by Bountysource. For Bounties posted before June 30, 2018, the Backer may redeploy their Bounty to a new Issue by contacting <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">support@<wbr>bountysource.com</a> before July 1, 2020. If the Backer does not redeploy their Bounty by the deadline, the Bounty will be withdrawn and the amount posted for the Bounty will be retained by Bountysource.</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>…</p>
  <h4 id="what-do-i-need-to-do">What do I need to do?</h4>
  <p>If you agree to the new terms, you don’t have to do anything… Or, if you do not agree with the new terms, please discontinue using Bountysource.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gave open source projects and their bounty hunters just two weeks to act; oftentimes it would take <em>longer than that</em> to even get a response from the support team. The controversial terms have since been withdrawn—at least for now. On June 17, Bountysource sent the following message (emphasis theirs):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re receiving this because we updated our Terms of Service.</p>

  <h4 id="withdrawal-of-new-terms-of-service">Withdrawal of new Terms of Service</h4>
  <p>Yesterday, we communicated a change to the Bountysource Terms of Service (ToS) agreement. <br>
<strong>These changes have been withdrawn and the ToS reverted to its prior state.</strong><br>
The ToS will be revised and clarified in the future.</p>

  <p>Thankyou</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In December, 2017, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191008103840/https://blog.canya.com/2017/12/20/canya-acquires-majority-stake-in-bountysource-adds-over-46000-users/">Bountysource was acquired</a> by a cryptocurrency company called CanYa who redesigned the Bountysource site and service with a new cryptocoin focus. In addition to the general friction we’ve experienced with using the service since to get developers paid, we feel like this policy change–even withdrawn–is concerning. It calls into question the future of Bountysource as a platform and the stability of their business model. While we understand that operating a platform incurs costs, we want to make sure that funds are primarily going to developers, not being automatically scooped up by corporate stakeholders.</p>

<p>These events have led us to re-think our recommendation and use of Bountysource. As such, we’ve removed Bountysource from our website, removed any Bountysource integration with elementary repos on GitHub, withdrawn our funds, and closed our account. For backers and bounty hunters on Bountysource, your bounties on elementary projects will automatically be returned to you. You may also wish to withdraw any funds and close your account by emailing <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">support@<wbr>bountysource.com</a>.</p>



<p>As an alternative, we recommend checking out <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">GitHub Sponsors</a>. We recently launched a few tiers on Sponsors, and have been very pleased with it.</p>

<p>You can directly sponsor <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">organizations like elementary</a>, as well as individual contributors. For elementary specifically, we have a new $50/month tier that offers the closest equivalent to a bug bounty program: each month, backers at this tier can comment on any elementary issue to get at least an hour of our investigation time. This is a great way to help steer development in the direction you see fit while also directly supporting us.</p>



<p>GitHub also covers payment processing and doesn’t charge any fees for GitHub Sponsors; this means <strong>100% of your sponsorship goes to elementary</strong> to help fund our work.</p>

<p>If GitHub Sponsors isn’t your cup of tea, you can also check out the funding section on our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://elementary.io/get-involved#funding">Get Involved</a> page to see other ways you can help support elementary OS.</p>

<div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
	
<p>It seems that coding skills are becoming less and less of a barrier to building and launching a successful application.</p>
<p>No-code tools have offered everyone from small businesses to enterprises the opportunity to achieve digital transformation both simply and sustainably. In the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johneverhard/2019/01/15/what-really-is-low-codeno-code-development/#61935a6f2a8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">words of Forbes contributor John Everhard</a>, no-code, as well as often-associated low-code, solutions help “build powerful applications that can scale for any organization—without writing any code.”</p>
<p>Everhard further discussed in his article the powerful impact that no-code tools, also known as codeless tools, can have. With these types of software, IT teams no longer need to spend 60% of their time keeping their current systems working. Instead, no-code solutions help companies maintain a competitive edge over their peers with up to a 75% improvement on time to market.</p>
<p>Industry analysts have taken note of the “no-code movement” as well, with <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2019/08/gartner-lcap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner predicting</a> that low-code application platforms (LCAP) will account for 65% of application development activity by 2024. Enterprises seem to be taking note as well, whether by <a href="https://www.testcraft.io/testcraft-joins-perforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiring codeless tools</a> or by releasing no-code capabilities of their own.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is a list of different tools to keep on your radar in the no-code space. These tools cover every stage of application development, although there are other solutions that are not covered here, such as industry-specific solutions and payment applications.</p>

		<div>

			
<p>If you’re reading this wondering if you should stop using AES-GCM in some standard protocol (TLS 1.3), the short answer is “No, you’re fine”. </p>



<p>I specialize in secure implementations of cryptography, and my years of experience in this field have led me to dislike AES-GCM.</p>



<p>This post is about why I dislike AES-GCM’s design, not “why AES-GCM is insecure and should be avoided”. AES-GCM is still miles above what most developers reach for when they want to encrypt (e.g. <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin">ECB mode</a> or <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/">CBC mode</a>).</p>



<p>To be clear: This is solely my opinion and not representative of any company or academic institution.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-aes-gcm">What is AES-GCM?</h2>



<p>AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption mode that uses the AES block cipher in counter mode with a polynomial MAC based on Galois field multiplication.</p>



<p>In order to explain why AES-GCM sucks, I have to first explain what I dislike about the AES block cipher. Then, I can describe why I’m filled with sadness every time I see the AES-GCM construction used.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-aes">What is AES?</h3>



<p>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specific subset of a block cipher called Rijndael.</p>



<p>Rijndael’s design is based on a substitution-permutation network, which broke tradition from many block ciphers of its era (including its predecessor, DES) in not using a Feistel network.</p>



<p>AES only includes three flavors of Rijndael: AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. The difference between these flavors is the size of the key and the number of rounds used, but–and this is often overlooked–not the block size.</p>



<p>As a block cipher, AES always operates on 128-bit (16 byte) blocks of plaintext, regardless of the key size.</p>



<p>This is generally considered acceptable because AES is a secure pseudorandom permutation (PRP), which means that every possible plaintext block maps directly to one ciphertext block, and thus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Cast_as_a_collision_problem">birthday collisions</a> are not possible. (A pseudorandom function (PRF), conversely, does have birthday bound problems.)</p>



<h3 id="why-aes-sucks">Why AES Sucks</h3>







<h4 id="side-channels">Side-Channels</h4>



<p>The biggest reason why AES sucks is that its design uses a lookup table (called an S-Box) <a href="https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding#avoid-table-look-ups-indexed-by-secret-data">indexed by secret data</a>, which is inherently vulnerable to cache-timing attacks (<a href="https://cr.yp.to/antiforgery/cachetiming-20050414.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>



<p>There are workarounds for this AES vulnerability, but they either require hardware acceleration (AES-NI) or a technique called <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/tree/1.0.14/src/libsodium/crypto_stream/aes128ctr/nacl">bitslicing</a>.</p>



<p>The short of it is: With AES, you’re either using hardware acceleration,<em> or </em>you have to choose between performance and security. You cannot get fast, constant-time AES without hardware support.</p>



<h4 id="block-size">Block Size</h4>



<p>AES-128 is considered by experts to have a security level of 128 bits.</p>



<p>Similarly, AES-192 gets certified at 192-bit security, and AES-256 gets 256-bit security.</p>



<p><strong>However, the AES block size is only 128 bits!</strong></p>



<p>That might not sound like a big deal, but it severely limits the constructions you can create out of AES.</p>



<p>Consider the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_(CBC)">AES-CBC</a>, where the output of each block of encryption is combined with the next block of plaintext (using XOR). This is typically used with a random 128-bit block (called the initialization vector, or IV) for the first block.</p>



<p>This means you expect a collision after encrypting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> (at 50% probability) blocks.</p>



<p>When you start getting collisions, you can break CBC mode, as this video demonstrates:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0IsYNDMV7A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p><figcaption>Their attack on CBC mode completely hand-waves away the block size detail that the demo depends on, but so long as you keep that in mind, their attack is valid.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is significantly smaller than the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> you expect from AES.</p>



<h4 id="aes-post-quantum">Post-Quantum Security?</h4>



<p>Cryptographers estimate that AES-128 will have a post-quantum security level of  64 bits, AES-192 will have a post-quantum security level of 96 bits, and AES-256 will have a post-quantum security level of 128 bits.</p>



<p>This is because Grover’s quantum search algorithm can search <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="n" title="n"> unsorted items in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="\sqrt{n}" title="\sqrt{n}"> time, which can be used to reduce the total number of possible secrets from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{n}" title="2^{n}"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="\sqrt{2^{n}}" title="\sqrt{2^{n}}">. This cuts the security level, expressed in bits, in half.</p>



<p><strong>But remember, even AES-256 operates on 128-bit blocks.</strong></p>



<p>Consequently, for AES-256, there should be approximately <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> (plaintext, key) pairs that produce any given ciphertext block.</p>



<p>Furthermore, there will be many keys that, for a constant plaintext block, will produce the same ciphertext block despite being a different key entirely. (n.b. This doesn’t mean for <em>all</em> plaintext/ciphertext block pairings, just some arbitrary pairing.)</p>



<p><strong>Concrete example:</strong> Encrypting a plaintext block consisting of sixteen NUL bytes will yield a specific 128-bit ciphertext exactly once for each given AES-128 key. However, there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> times as many AES-256 keys as there are possible plaintext/ciphertexts. Keep this in mind for AES-GCM.</p>



<p>This means it’s conceivable to accidentally construct a protocol that, despite using AES-256 safely, has a post-quantum security level on par with AES-128, which is only 64 bits.</p>



<p>This would <em>not</em> be nearly as much of a problem if AES’s block size was 256 bits.</p>



<h4 id="aes-signal-protocol">Real-World Example: Signal</h4>



<p>The Signal messaging app is the state-of-the-art for private communications. If you were previously <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">using PGP</a> and email, you should use Signal instead.</p>



<p>Signal aims to provide private communications (text messaging, voice calls) between two mobile devices, piggybacking on your pre-existing contacts list.</p>



<p>Part of their operational requirements is that they must be user-friendly and secure on a wide range of Android devices, stretching all the way back to Android 4.4.</p>



<p>The Signal Protocol uses <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java/blob/4f5e1ff299cea22cc75bb97249020a7da67b816d/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/libsignal/SessionCipher.java#L395-L413">AES-CBC</a> + <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java/blob/4f5e1ff299cea22cc75bb97249020a7da67b816d/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/libsignal/protocol/SignalMessage.java#L111-L139">HMAC-SHA256</a> for message encryption. Each message is encrypted with a different AES key (due to the <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/">Double Ratchet</a>), which limits the practical blast radius of a cache-timing attack and makes practical exploitation difficult (since you can’t effectively replay decryption in order to leak bits about the key).</p>



<p>Thus, Signal’s message encryption is still secure even in the presence of vulnerable AES implementations.</p>

<p>However, the storage service in the Signal App uses <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/c24d285cd3e93f32fbcd94c7296aa6ac3a6967d0/libsignal/service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/signalservice/api/storage/SignalStorageCipher.java">AES-GCM</a>, and this key has to be reused in order for the encrypted storage to operate.</p>



<p>This means, for older phones without dedicated hardware support for AES (i.e. low-priced phones from 2013, which Signal aims to support), <strong>the risk of cache-timing attacks is still present</strong>.</p>

<p>What this means is, a malicious app that can flush the CPU cache and measure timing with sufficient precision can siphon the AES-GCM key used by Signal to encrypt your storage without ever violating the security boundaries enforced by the Android operating system.</p>



<p>As a result of the security boundaries never being crossed, these kind of side-channel attacks would likely evade forensic analysis, and would therefore be of interest to the malware developers working for nation states.</p>



<p>Of course, if you’re on newer hardware (i.e. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835), you have hardware-accelerated AES available, so it’s probably a moot point.</p>



<h3 id="aes-gcm-worse">Why AES-GCM Sucks Even More</h3>



<p>AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption mode that also supports additional authenticated data. Cryptographers call these modes <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">AEAD</a>.</p>



<p>AEAD modes are more flexible than simple block ciphers. Generally, your encryption API accepts the following:</p>



<ol><li>The plaintext message.</li><li>The encryption key.</li><li>A nonce (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bonce%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="n_{once}" title="n_{once}">: A number that must only be used once).</li><li>Optional additional data which will be authenticated but not encrypted.</li></ol>



<p>The output of an AEAD function is both the ciphertext and an authentication tag, which is necessary (along with the key and nonce, and optional additional data) to decrypt the plaintext.</p>



<p>Cryptographers almost universally recommend using AEAD modes for symmetric-key data encryption.</p>



<p>That being said, AES-GCM is possibly my least favorite AEAD, and I’ve got good reasons to dislike it beyond simply, “It uses AES”.</p>

<h4 id="ghash">GHASH Brittleness</h4>



<p>The way AES-GCM is initialized is stupid: You encrypt an all-zero block with your AES key (in ECB mode) and store it in a variable called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="H" title="H">. This value is used for authenticating all messages authenticated under that AES key, rather than for a given (key, nonce) pair.</p>

<p>This is often sold as an advantage: Reusing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="H" title="H"> allows for better performance. However, it makes GCM brittle: Reusing a nonce allows an attacker to recover H and then forge messages forever. This is called the “forbidden attack”, and led to <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/475">real world practical breaks</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s contrast AES-GCM with the other AEAD mode supported by TLS: ChaCha20-Poly1305, or ChaPoly for short.</p>



<p>ChaPoly uses one-time message authentication keys (derived from each key/nonce pair). If you manage to leak a Poly1305 key, the impact is limited to the messages encrypted under that (ChaCha20 key, nonce) pair.</p>



<p>While that’s still <em>bad</em>, it isn’t “decrypt all messages under that key forever” bad like with AES-GCM.</p>



<h4 id="short-nonces">Short Nonces</h4>



<p>Although the AES block size is 16 bytes, AES-GCM nonces are only 12 bytes. The latter 4 bytes are dedicated to an internal counter, which is used with AES in Counter Mode to actually encrypt/decrypt messages. </p>



<p>(Yes, you can use arbitrary length nonces with AES-GCM, but if you use nonces longer than 12 bytes, they get hashed into 12 bytes anyway, so it’s not a detail most people should concern themselves with.)</p>



<p>If you ask a cryptographer, “How much can I encrypt safely with AES-GCM?” you’ll get two different answers.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Message Length Limit: </strong>AES-GCM can be used to encrypt messages up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B36%7D+-+32&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{36} - 32" title="2^{36} - 32"> bytes long, under a given (key, nonce) pair.</li><li><strong>Number of Messages Limit: </strong>If you generate your nonces randomly, you have a 50% chance of a nonce collision after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B48%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{48}" title="2^{48}"> messages.<p>However, 50% isn’t conservative enough for most systems, so the safety margin is usually much lower. Cryptographers generally set the key wear-out of AES-GCM at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> …</p></li></ol></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Many laptop users choose to undervolt their machines. This decreases thermal output, which, in turn, can increase program performance, since modern CPUs will automatically adjust their operating frequency depending on the available thermal headroom. Undervolting tools exist for all major operating systems; they typically require administrator rights, but otherwise are easy to use. In Linux, however, things aren't quite so simple: recent versions of the kernel prohibit the mechanism used for undervolting Intel CPUs when SecureBoot is enabled. The most common way around this, unsurprisingly, is just to disable SecureBoot. With a bit of work, though, it is possible to keep SecureBoot enabled, but allow controlled access to the undervolting mechanism.</p>
<p>The next sections will go into some background information on undervolting, SecureBoot, and why newer versions of Linux prevent the former while the latter is enabled. You can skip any of these if you're already familiar with the topic.</p>

<p>Some laptops today are well-known for having thermal issues. A common culprit is that these laptops ship with voltage settings that are higher than actually required. This is a good default behavior, since chips' performance can vary significantly, even within a SKU. High-end chips that are put into more expensive models of these laptops, however, tend to be better binned, and often work without errors at substantially lower voltage. Since all modern chips implement some sort of "auto-overclock" when there is enough thermal headroom, this can translate into increased clock speeds, and thus, better performance.</p>
<p>My current laptop is a Dell XPS 15 7590, with an 8-core Intel® i9-9980HK. This particular model performs better compared to its predecessors, but there is still room for improvement. Unfortunately, Dell's UEFI provides no way to control the voltage settings, so any adjustments must be done after booting up.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot#What_is_UEFI_Secure_Boot.3F">Debian Wiki</a> has a great explanation of SecureBoot and Machine Owner Keys:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UEFI Secure Boot (SB) is a verification mechanism for ensuring that code launched by a computer's UEFI firmware is trusted. It is designed to protect a system against malicious code being loaded and executed early in the boot process, before the operating system has been loaded. SB works using cryptographic checksums and signatures. Each program that is loaded by the firmware includes a signature and a checksum, and before allowing execution the firmware will verify that the program is trusted by validating the checksum and the signature. When SB is enabled on a system, any attempt to execute an untrusted program will not be allowed. This stops unexpected / unauthorized code from running in the UEFI environment.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A key part of the shim design is to allow users to control their own systems. The distro CA key is built in to the shim binary itself, but there is also an extra database of keys that can be managed by the user, the so-called Machine Owner Key (MOK for short).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Large distros, like Ubuntu, ship with kernels signed by the same CA key used by Microsoft for Windows. This lets them be installed onto systems with SecureBoot without making the user go through the hassle of registering their own MOK and signing the kernel manually. If you want to run any custom kernel modules, however, you must create and register a MOK with the UEFI, and sign the driver(s) with it, or the kernel will refuse the load them.</p>

<p>Intel CPUs have had MSRs—<em>model-specific registers</em>—for quite some time. All sorts of tracing and debugging functionality is available through them, but, importantly for this topic, this is also how they provide a way to dynamically adjust voltages applied to the core and caches of the CPU. More troubling, though, is that these registers can also be used to violate protection rings, allowing user applications to read <em>and write</em> over kernel memory, including kernel code. This is why applications that use the MSRs have always required some sort of elevated privileges.</p>
<p>Previously, programs that wrote to the MSRs only required the <code>SYS_RAWIO</code> capability in Linux. Recent version of the kernel, however, don't allow any writes to the MSRs whatsoever when SecureBoot is enabled. (In kernel parlance, this is called "lockdown mode.") The motivation here is sound: the entire purpose of SecureBoot is to have a trusted environment that runs only the exact code that's been authorized, so any mechanism that potentially allows modification of kernel code at runtime flies in the face of that goal.</p>
<p>There has been at least <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/38d18a24-c580-d56b-f0cd-91e8184e1f0d@gmail.com/T/">one recent proposal</a> to open up the subset of MSRs used for undervolting, even when the kernel is locked down. A consensus hasn't yet been reached, though, so for the time being, we must come up with our own solutions.</p>

<p>tl;dr: the easiest way to allow undervolting in Linux while using SecureBoot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate your own MOK and register it with the UEFI.</li>
<li>Patch the <code>msr</code> module to remove the checks for lockdown mode.</li>
<li>Build, sign, and install the patched module.</li>
<li>Install an undervolting tool, like <code>intel-undervolt</code>, and give it the
<code>RAW_IO</code> capability.</li>
<li>Rejoice!</li>
</ul>
<p>In my case, Ubuntu 20.04 uses kernel v5.4.0, and the patch looks like this:</p>

<p>Pretty straightforward: look for all instances of <code>LOCKDOWN_MSR</code> in this file,
and comment-out the lockdown check &amp; error-handling code.</p>

<p>For all tests, these are the undervolt settings:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>ΔmV</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>CPU Core</td><td>-99.6mV</td></tr>
<tr><td>CPU Cache</td><td>-99.6mV</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The first test is running Prime95 with default settings. Starting with the undervolt applied, I let the CPU frequency and temperature settle. Then, I set the voltage to stock settings, and let the system settle again. Measurements were done using the <code>intel-undervolt</code> tool. Here's the averaged &amp; rounded results:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Voltages</th><th>CPU Core (W)</th><th>CPU Core (°C)</th><th>CPU Core (Hz)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Stock</td><td>38 W</td><td>92 °C</td><td>2350 Hz</td></tr>
<tr><td>Undervolted</td><td>34 W</td><td>92 °C</td><td>2950 Hz</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>To see how this change would affect a realistic workload for myself, I compiled the latest trunk branches of Firefox and alacritty. Both of these runs were done with the same settings, and with a clean build tree.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Voltages</th><th>Firefox Time (s)</th><th>alacritty time (s)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Stock</td><td>1401 s</td><td>139 s</td></tr>
<tr><td>Undervolted</td><td>1273 s</td><td>129 s</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>These are only brief, non-rigorous tests, but the results suggest that undervolting can provide tangible benefits.</p>

<p>The obvious objection to this solution, of course, is that it makes SecureBoot useless. Or does it? If your system has multiple tenants, some of whom require the ability to grant programs the <code>SYS_RAWIO</code> capability, then this objection holds water. For the vast majority of laptop users, though, this isn't a threat. The owner decides which programs are allowed to perform raw I/O, and is responsible for their own security.</p>
<p>As for the common solution to this problem—disabling SecureBoot entirely—the drawbacks are pretty clear: you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater, abandoning any sense of security and peace-of-mind that comes from cryptographic verification of your operating system. Users shouldn't have to sacrifice critical security features for acceptable performance.</p>
<p>The best solution would satisfy the needs of both server and desktop use cases. If the kernel had an interface to control undervolting, without providing access to the raw MSRs, then we could have the best of both worlds: no way to violate the SecureBoot contract from userspace, and laptop users can get better performance. Designing a good, reusable interface for this would undoubtedly take some time; we don't want it to be married specifically to one vendor, architecture, or platform. Until such an interface gets made and merged, we'll have to stick to workarounds.</p>

<p>Undervolting can provide noticeable benefits for many laptop configurations. Unfortunately, some OEMs prevent adjusting these settings in their UEFI, requiring the use of runtime mechanisms. Even <em>more</em> unfortunately, the mechanism for Intel CPUs also comes with potential security holes, which make it a challenge to provide this functionality in a way that completely complies with protocols like SecureBoot. Linux, in particular, takes the most conservative approach, absolutely forbidding access to undervolting mechanisms when running under a secure context. That is a sane starting point, but it would certainly be worthwhile to figure out an acceptable solution.</p>

<p>I have twice migrated large JavaScript apps to PureScript. At CitizenNet we replaced Angular with Halogen, and at Awake Security we’ve replaced most of a React application with PureScript React. Both companies have seen a dramatic drop in bugs in production.</p>

<p>It’s relatively easy to replace React due to PureScript’s <code>react</code> and <code>react-basic</code> libraries. The React mental model fits well with a strongly-typed, pure functional language like PureScript (or Reason), and using the same underlying library means that components can be shared between languages with little modification.</p>

<p>At Awake Security we share internationalization, a Redux store and middleware, and much more in an code base where PureScript regularly imports JavaScript and JavaScript regularly imports PureScript.</p>

<p>The best way to rewrite a significant app from one language to another is incrementally, while it runs. At first the new language can take over logically isolated parts of the app: the management dashboard, or the chat window, or a form. But eventually you must mix components from both languages together – for example, to support shared global state.</p>

<p>At this point you can’t just let the new language take over a DOM node. You need to support simple, clear features for intermixing the languages. Fortunately, you can transform the interface of idiomatic PureScript code into idiomatic JavaScript (and vice versa). With <code>react</code> and <code>react-basic</code> you can write business logic in PureScript but easily interoperating with the larger React ecosystem and your existing code.</p>

<p>In this article I will demonstrate how to replace part of a React application with simple components written in PureScript. Along the way, I’ll share best practices for making this interop convenient and dependable. The examples will be simple, but the same techniques also apply to complex components.</p>

<li><a href="#let-s-write-a-react-app-in-javascript">Write a tiny React application in JavaScript</a></li>
<li><a href="#setting-up-a-shared-purescript-javascript-project">Update the application to support PureScript</a></li>

<li><a href="#replacing-a-react-component-with-purescript-react-basic">Replace the component again with React Basic</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I encourage you to code along with this article; no code is omitted and dependencies are pinned to help ensure the examples are reproducible. This code uses Node <code>v11.1.0</code>, Yarn <code>v1.12.0</code>, and NPX <code>v6.5.0</code> installed globally, and PureScript tooling installed locally.</p>

<p>Peter Murphy has <a href="https://github.com/ptrfrncsmrph/purescript-react-tutorial">implemented the ideas in this article using React Hooks</a> if you’d like to see this in action.</p>




<h2 id="let-s-write-a-react-app-in-javascript">Let’s write a React app in JavaScript</h2>

<p>We are going to write a tiny React application which shows a few counters, and then we’re going to replace its components with PureScript. The resulting JavaScript code will be indistinguishable, aside from imports, from the original, and yet it will all be PureScript under the hood.</p>

<p>Let’s follow the official React docs in using <code>create-react-app</code> to initialize the project and then trim our source code to the bare minimum.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Create the app</span>
npx create-react-app my-app <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> my-app</code></pre></div>
<p>At the time of writing, <code>create-react-app</code> produces these React dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"react"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^16.8.6"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"react-dom"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^16.8.6"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"react-scripts"</span><span>:</span> <span>"3.0.1"</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have a handful of source files under <code>src</code>, but our application will need just two of them: <code>index.js</code>, the entrypoint for Webpack, and <code>App.js</code>, the root component of our application. We can delete the rest:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Delete all the source files except for the entrypoint and</span>
<span># root app component</span>
find src -type f -not <span>\(</span> -name <span>'index.js'</span> -or -name <span>'App.js'</span> <span>\)</span> -delete</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, let’s replace the contents of those two files with the bare minimum we’ll need for this article. From here on out I’ll supply diffs that you can supply to <code>git apply</code> to apply the same changes I did.</p>

<p>First, our entrypoint:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/index.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>ReactDOM</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react-dom"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>App</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./App"</span><span>;</span>

<span>ReactDOM</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(&lt;</span><span>App</span> <span>/&gt;,</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"root"</span><span>));</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then our main app component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span>My</span> <span>App</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span>

<h3 id="writing-a-react-component">Writing a React component</h3>

<p>Let’s write our first React component: a counter. This is likely the first example of a React component you ever encountered; it’s the first example in the PureScript React libraries as well. It’s also small and simple enough to be replaced twice over the course of this article.</p>

<p>The counter will be a button which maintains the number of times it has been clicked. It will accept, as its only prop, a label to display on the button.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/Counter.js

    <span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>Counter</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, we’ll import our new counters into our main application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>@@ -1,9 +1,13 @@
</span><span></span> import React from "react";

   return (
     &lt;div&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;My App&lt;/h1&gt;
<span>+      &lt;Counter label="Count" /&gt;

</span><span>+      &lt;Counter label="Interactions" /&gt;
</span><span></span>     &lt;/div&gt;
   );
 }
</code></pre></div>
<p>With <code>yarn start</code> we can run the dev server and see our app in action.</p>

<p><img src="https://thomashoneyman.com/images/2019/running-app.gif" alt="running app"></p>



<p>We’ve written entirely too much JavaScript. Let’s support PureScript in this project as well. Our goal is to write code in either language and freely import in either direction without friction. To accomplish that, we will install PureScript tooling, create a separate PureScript source directory, and rely on the compiler to generate JavaScript code.</p>

<h3 id="1-install-the-compiler-and-package-manager">1. Install the compiler and package manager</h3>

<p>First we must install PureScript tooling. I recommend installing versions of the compiler and Spago (a package manager and build tool) which match those used in this article. I’ll use NPX to ensure all commands are run using local copies.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Install the compiler and the Spago package manager however you prefer;</span>
<span># since we're already in a React project I'll use Yarn</span>
yarn add -D purescript@0.13.2 spago@0.8.4</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="2-initialize-the-project-and-package-set">2. Initialize the project and package set</h3>

<p>We can create a new PureScript project with <code>spago init</code>. As of version 0.8.4, Spago always initializes with the same package set, which means you should have identical package versions to those used to write this article. I’m using the <code>psc-0.13.0-20190607</code> package set.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># npx ensures we're using our local copy of Spago installed in node_modules.</span>
npx spago init</code></pre></div>
<p>Spago has created a <code>packages.dhall</code> file which points at the set of packages which can be installed and a <code>spago.dhall</code> file which lists the packages we’ve actually installed. We can now install any dependencies we need and we’ll know for sure the versions are all compatible.</p>

<p>Before installing anything, let’s update the existing <code>.gitignore</code> file to cover PureScript. For a Spago-based project this will work:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>echo</span> -e <span>"\noutput\n.psc*\n.purs*\.spago"</span> &gt;&gt; .gitignore</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="3-adjust-the-directory-structure">3. Adjust the directory structure</h3>

<p>Finally, let’s organize our source code. It’s typical to separate JavaScript source from PureScript source except when writing an FFI file for PureScript. Since we aren’t doing that in this project, our source files will be entirely separated. Let’s move all JavaScript code into a <code>javascript</code> subdirectory and create a new <code>purescript</code> folder next to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">mkdir src/javascript src/purescript
mv src/App.js src/Counter.js src/javascript</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we’ll adjust <code>index.js</code> to the new location of our root component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/index.js
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/index.js
</span><span></span><span>@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
</span><span></span> import React from "react";
 import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
<span>-import App from "./App";
</span><span></span><span>+import App from "./javascript/App";
</span><span></span>
 ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById("root"));
</code></pre></div>
<p>We’ve just one task left. The PureScript compiler generates JavaScript into a directory named <code>output</code> in the root of the project. But <code>create-react-app</code> disables importing anything outside the <code>src</code> directory. While there are fancier solutions, for this project we’ll get around the restriction by symlinking the <code>output</code> directory into the <code>src</code> directory.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># we can now import compiled PureScript from src/output/...</span>
ln -s <span>$PWD</span>/output <span>$PWD</span>/src</code></pre></div>
<p>Your <code>src</code> directory should now look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">src
├── index.js
├── javascript
│ ├── App.js
│ └── Counter.js
├── output -&gt; ../output
└── purescript</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="replacing-a-react-component-with-purescript-react">Replacing a React component with PureScript React</h2>

<p>I like to follow four simple steps when replacing a JavaScript React component with a PureScript one:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write the component in idiomatic PureScript.</li>
<li>Write a separate interop module for the component. This module provides the JavaScript interface and conversion functions between PureScript and JavaScript types and idioms.</li>
<li>Use the PureScript compiler to generate JavaScript</li>
<li>Import the resulting code as if it were a regular JavaScript React component.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll start with the <code>react</code> library, which we use at Awake Security. It’s similar to <code>react-basic</code> but maps more directly to the underlying React code and is less opinionated. Later, we’ll switch to <code>react-basic</code>, which will demonstrate some differences between them.</p>

<p>As we take each step in this process I’ll explain more about why it’s necessary and some best practices to keep in mind. Let’s start: install the <code>react</code> library and prepare to write our component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># install the purescript-react library</span>
npx spago install react

<span># build the project so editors can pick up the `output` directory</span>
npx spago build

<span># create the component source file</span>
touch src/purescript/Counter.purs</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="1-write-the-react-component-in-idiomatic-purescript">1. Write the React component in idiomatic PureScript</h3>

<p>Even though we are writing a component to be used from JavaScript, we should still write ordinary PureScript. As we’ll soon see, it’s possible to adjust only the interface of the component for JavaScript but leave the internals untouched. This is especially important if this component is meant to be used by both PureScript and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Life before a software engineering career is commonly a series of time-bound efforts to gain competency in a new area. This semester you learn geometry. That semester you learn history. Next semester you learn calculus. And so on.</p>

<p>As a result, most people entering the software engineering workforce equate learning with learning a brand new topic. I didn’t know ruby, I learned ruby. I didn’t know SQL, now I know SQL.</p>

<p>This kind of thinking leads people to 2 year cycles. On most modern software teams, it takes roughly one year to really feel like you have your feet under you. By that time the kind of learning novelty people are used to isn’t there. By 16 months they’re restless. By 24 months they’re gone.</p>

<p>This is a problem. It’s a problem because the majority of durable and transferable knowledge comes after achieving basic competency. Mastery of a skillset, understanding and learning from the outcomes of decisions made years ago, architecture and design, leading projects - these all come well after basic competency.</p>

<p>Not only does a life of cyclic learning work against reaching these next levels, but your ego and willpower also work against you. Those next-level skills are harder to learn. And once you’ve gained competency you lose the excuse of “I’m onboarding” or “still ramping up” when something goes wrong.</p>

<p>I always challenge engineers that want to make big changes in what they’re working on to consider whether they’re simply at the end of a novelty cycle. I always encourage them to go after those next level skills.</p>

<p>On the hiring front, I see a lot of people who have a career’s worth of 2-year stints. You can do that successfully for an entire career, and there are even some people that’ll tell you it’s a way to optimize earnings over time. If it does, I believe it only optimizes earnings for people who can’t get to those next level skills. The biggest earnings come from building and growing with a winning company.</p>

<p>24-monthers never deeply learn how things work. They’ll typically add value to a new company by carrying a collection of things they’ve seen before and shallowly applying them to similar problems. But when faced with a new problem that doesn’t map easily to the solutions they’ve seen, things start to break down.</p>

<p>The end-games for both careers are very different.</p>

<p>24-monthers eventually can get into C-level positions where it’s not uncommon to bring in someone who can just apply the common solutions to the similar task at hand. Their stints usually end right around the time where they’ve upleveled the company in some way and don’t know how to grow their team or evolve their strategy or deal with the short-comings of some of their decisions.</p>

<p>People who learn next level skills and how to deeply understand and react to the tasks at hand lead companies to uniquely successful outcomes. The best CEOs, the best CTOs, the best C-level anything - their careers are often a small handful of long-duration roles where they didn’t apply rote practices but innovated and reacted to change and created novel solutions based on deep understanding.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’m not saying you should stay with any given job. There are bad roles and bad bosses and everything in between. And skill diversification is important. But every job has problems. If you’re leaving because you’re chasing novelty or avoiding tackling your company’s challenges, you’ll start over in the cycle. Leave enough places for these reasons and you’ll find you’ve seriously limited your opportunities and earnings over time.</p>

<h3>What do you imagine when you see "Anomaly Detection"?</h3>
<p>When you think about anomaly detection, you probably visualize it for metrics: detection of outlier values like peaks, dropouts, or other deviations from normal. <img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=303&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png" alt="anomaly detection" width="303" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=152&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 152w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=303&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 303w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=455&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 455w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=606&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 606w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=758&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 758w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=909&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 909w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px">In the realm of application monitoring metrics are a scheduled measurements of a large set (thousands) of system health attributes – such as CPU, memory, latency and throughput. So metrics anomaly detection can be a useful tool to detect application health incidents, with the metrics anomalies serving as symptoms of the incident. A challenge with traditional time series anomaly detection is that it is noisy – applications can generate thousands of metrics, and in any given day it’s common to see many of them deviating from their historical ranges. Alerting on all of these would be a noisy mess,so users need to do more work to avoid alert fatigue. They must handpick which ones really matter, carefully tune thresholds, make adjustments for seasonality and trend lines, plus be thoughtful about algorithm selection.</p>
<p><br>This approach is untenable to detect new failure modes (unknown failure modes with as yet unknown symptoms). And it does not take advantage of the fact that when software incidents occur, they almost never impact just one metric. For example, memory contention on a node impacts multiple containers. Similarly, network bottlenecks impact latency for many operations which show up in metrics.</p>
<img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png?width=307&amp;name=correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png" alt="correlated metrics anomalies" width="307" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png?width=154&amp;name=correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png 154w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png?width=307&amp;name=correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png 307w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png?width=461&amp;name=correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png 461w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png?width=614&amp;name=correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png 614w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png?width=768&amp;name=correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png 768w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png?width=921&amp;name=correlated%20metrics%20anomalies.png 921w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px">

<p>To be useful for incident detection, anomaly detection has to work autonomously across all time series, but also separate the signal from&nbsp;the noise by picking out the hotspots of correlated anomalies that are indicators of real problems. And to be even more useful, it should automatically correlate these metric anomaly hotspots with something that is even harder to build rules for – anomalies in log events. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span><strong>Anomaly detection applied to logs is very different</strong></span></h3>

<p>Log events are generated synchronous with execution of specific software paths. This makes them incredibly granular (micro-second or even finer resolution). They are also rich: since log events are only generated when specific conditions are encountered, they can selectively output data with almost unbounded cardinality (such as labels and IDs). Most significantly, events provide the best indication of causality. Where metrics measure aggregate symptoms about the application, log events are closely linked to specific code paths or error conditions in the software. For all of the above reasons, logs are an invaluable trove of information, so troubleshooting invariably involves digging through logs to find out root cause of an incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What if you didn’t have to do this reactively? Why couldn’t anomaly detection also be applied to events, with the goal of detecting highly unusual patterns of code execution, or rare errors or conditions. In other words, patterns that are diagnostic of a software problem, an infrastructure issue that impacts the application, or even security incidents. This is a bit harder to conceptualize than anomaly detection for metrics, but here is how it works.</p>
<h3>Learn what to track</h3>
<p>Metrics are explicitly tagged with labels and IDs – so it is clear what is being measured. Unfortunately, the link between a specific log event and the corresponding line of code is not explicit – most log events don’t contain references to source code, and they are typically unstructured, free form outputs coded by developers to help them troubleshoot. As a result, many of them look similar to the human eye because they contain similar keywords or strings.</p>

<p>Luckily machine learning can do far better than a human in this regard – it only needs to see a few variants of each message type to fully extract the fixed and variable parts of each message type – rapidly learning all the unique message types. This essentially constitutes the “dictionary” <strong><em>of all unique event types generated by the application stack</em></strong> – all that’s</p>

<p>missing is the corresponding line # from the source code.</p>

<p>Note that this event type dictionary is not as big as you might think – an entire Atlassian suite has fewer than 1,000 unique event types.</p>

<p>Once we’ve assembled this foundational dictionary of event types, another layer of ML learns<img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png?width=300&amp;name=learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png" alt="learn the normal and detect the abnormal" width="300" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png?width=150&amp;name=learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png 150w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png?width=300&amp;name=learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png 300w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png?width=450&amp;name=learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png 450w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png?width=600&amp;name=learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png 600w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png?width=750&amp;name=learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png 750w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png?width=900&amp;name=learn%20the%20normal%20and%20detect%20the%20abnormal.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"> the normal patterns of <strong><em>each event</em></strong> <strong><em>type</em></strong>. This includes things such as its frequency, periodicity, severity, and even the values of metrics embedded within each event type. Now when a log event breaks pattern significantly, it is anomalous.</p>

<p>Particularly important variants include the first occurrence of a very rare event, and the sudden stoppage of a normal event (e.g. a system heartbeat).</p>

<p>s, with hundreds if not thousands of instances (many of them ephemeral), scaling operations and frequent updates. Good anomaly detection can be very selective - picking out the one in a million event that is truly anomalous. However, one in a million would still be too many things to focus on in an environment that generates billions of messages a day. Once again, machine learning to the rescue – it takes advantage of the fact that a single anomaly in one event type is rarely alert worthy – but when tightly clustered group of anomalies pops up across multiple event streams – that IS almost always alert worthy. What constitutes “unusually tight cluster” depends on the specific deployment of an application, so it needs to be learned on the fly.</p>

<p>This type of anomaly clustering doesn’t just improve signal to noise by several orders of magnitude. It also constructs an automatic summary of the incident – picking out the sequence of anomalous events and the related anomalous metrics, as well as highlighting the hosts and log types that fully describe the incident.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Done right, anomaly detection can <a href="https://www.zebrium.com/blog/is-autonomous-monitoring-the-anomaly-detection-you-actually-wanted" rel=" noopener">enable autonomous incident creation</a>, making it an incredibly powerful pillar of a monitoring strategy. It detects previously unknown problems the first time they occur, and reduces MTTR by automatically surfacing the unusual events and anomalies in metrics that describes an incident. But doing it right means understanding unique event types, learning the patterns and correlations of log events and metrics, and detecting anomaly clusters with good signal to noise. And for this to be practical, all of this has to work without extensive configuration, manual tuning, or impractical training windows.</p>
