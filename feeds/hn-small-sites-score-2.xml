		<p><em>Reverse engineering the North Korean version of a popular Sim City-like game using Ghidra and ndSpy to understand video game monetization strategies in the DPRK and the marketization of the country’s economy. </em></p><p><em>Key takeaways:</em></p><p><em>
<li>Android devices and applications are increasingly common in North Korea. Physical “app stores” can be found on every street corner in Pyongyang.</li>
<li>The game considered in this post is based on a Chinese version of a popular Android game developed in the Netherlands</li>
<li>The game’s monetization strategy was adapted to the country’s infrastructure (low internet/intranet availability, physical app stores)</li>
<li>The North Korean version eschews the original freemium + online microtransaction model for a one-time licence purchase + offline microtransaction model</li>
<li>File integrity checks added by North Korean developers shows that piracy is a concern and suggests the existence a warez/cracking scene in the DPRK</li>
<li>The cryptographic algorithms used for the licence are MD5, SHA1, RSA and AES. The library used by the game included the domestically developed private key algorithms Pilsung and Jipsam, but they were not used as part of the licencing system</li></em></p><p><a href="#intro">0.

<h4 id="intro">0. Introduction </h4><p>During a recent trip to North Korea, I noticed the recent and ubiquitous presence of <em>Information Technology Exchange Rooms</em> (정보기술교류실), physical stores where one can purchase a variety of electronic devices – from laptops and tablets to USB sticks and chargers – as well as software and video games for PC, mobile and tablets (for an in-depth look at what goes on inside those stores as well as what the app selection looks like, <a href="https://www.nknews.org/2019/02/what-to-buy-inside-a-north-korean-app-store/">this article</a> by Alek Sigley provides a an excellent description. There are also a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ujblnigJmM">videos</a> on YouTube). After looking through the catalogue of available games at different stores, I eventually decided to try and buy a Sim City-like game called <em>City Management</em> (도시경경).</p>
<figure id="attachment_426"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chongbo.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chongbo.png" alt="" width="845" height="760"></a><figcaption>Billboards for various app stores in Pyongyang</figcaption></figure><p>The game only cost 5000 wons (less than 1 USD) which I paid to have the app installed on the phone I had, a Samsung Galaxy A5 running Android 8. The vendor connected the phone to his PC, transferred the APK and tried to install it, but to no avail. After multiple attempts, he eventually informed me that North Korean apps most likely could not run on phones from other countries. </p>
<figure id="attachment_428"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marrichakyongchu.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marrichakyongchu.png" alt="" width="551" height="827"></a><figcaption>Advertisement for a car racing game inside a North Korean app store</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, I was later able to purchase one of the different tablets sold in North Korea. I got the <em>Morning</em> (아침) brand, which is geared towards students and quite affordable. The tablet ran Android 4 (Kit Kat) on an ARM cpu and came loaded with a few educational apps: language learning courses, dictionaries and several e-book libraries containing the complete works of Kim Il Sung, school textbooks and a collection of literary works. No games, but that could now be fixed quite easily.</p>
<figure id="attachment_431"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/achimtablet.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/achimtablet.png" alt="" width="800" height="490"></a><figcaption>A North Korean Ach’im (Morning) tablet</figcaption></figure><p>I retrieved the <em>City Management</em> APK from my phone and installed it on the tablet, where it ran perfectly. Unfortunately, after the game’s initial splash screen, I landed on this:</p>
<figure id="attachment_434"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/buyserial.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/buyserial.png" alt="" width="1024" height="600"></a><figcaption>Licence key needed</figcaption></figure><p>The screen tells us that there is no “key file” (열쇠화일) and that we should purchase one at a store. There is a “request number” (요청번호) likely used to generate the licence key and make sure it can’t be shared with other devices. Unfortunately, since the APK never installed, the vendor did not put a licence file on my phone when I bought the app. My stay in North Korea was coming to an end too and I did not have time to go back to an app store to buy a new key. So I figured I would take a look inside the app and see if I could get it running nonetheless. </p>
<hr id="licence">
<h4>1. Licensing system </h4><p>To start looking into the APK’s code, I’ll use the standard suite of tools to decompress, decompile and rebuild android apps: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dex2jar/">dex2jar</a>, <a href="http://java-decompiler.github.io/">jd-gui</a>, <a href="https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/">apktool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/appium/sign">apksign</a>. I’ll also use <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> to run and debug the app. The fact that I couldn’t run the app on my phone may have just come from an Android version compatibility issue: I had no problem running it on an emulated Android 4.4 device with Android Studio. The decompilation of the <code>classes.dex</code> file gives us some interesting information right away:</p>
<figure id="attachment_438"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dex2jar1.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dex2jar1.png" alt="" width="211" height="326"></a><figcaption>Packages and classes from the decompiled <code>classes.dex</code> file</figcaption></figure><p>The name of the <code>com.bz.cityisland2</code> package actually refers to the original game that <em>City Management</em> is based on: <a href="https://www.sparklingsociety.net/sparkling-games/city-building-games/city-island-2/">City Island 2</a> by the Dutch game studio Sparkling Society. The name of the package <code>com.smartions.appprotected</code> refers to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/smartions-ag#section-overview">Smartions</a>, a company that offers solutions to “monetize your mobile game or app in China” and are apparently also City Island’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkling_Society">distributor in China</a>. There are no mentions of those companies in the game itself however. The game’s loading splash screen only tells us that the game was made by the Ryusong (meteor) Technology Exchange Center (류성기술교류소) and that it is protected by the law for the protection of software (<a href="https://www.kisdi.re.kr/kisdi/common/premium?file=1%7C10360">콤퓨터쏘프트웨어보호법</a>). The law has been in place since 2003 to regulate the sales and distribution of software in the country and guarantees software developers the private ownership of their creation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_502"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kyongyong-1.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kyongyong-1.png" alt="" width="1000" height="640"></a><figcaption>Loading screen for the game</figcaption></figure><p>It’s hard to tell whether the North Korean version is based on the source code of the original game or if it’s entirely reverse engineered. In any case, the North Korean version does not use Smartions’s monetization system nor Sparkling Society’s but relies on a different system, which is the main difference from the original game. Save for the translation and some minor renames, the game is otherwise similar to the original (from a cursory examination) in its design, gameplay, features… to the original. </p>
<figure id="attachment_442"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/UnityStructure.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/UnityStructure.png" alt="" width="339" height="221"></a><figcaption>Structure a Unity APK. From Shim et al., <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2018/6280768/"><em>Static and Dynamic Analysis of Android Malware and Goodware Written with Unity Framework</em></a> (2018).<br></figcaption></figure><p>There’s not much more we can glean from the Java code for now since, as the classes in <code>unity3dplayer</code> and <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file make clear, it is used to run code that was written with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)">Unity</a>, a popular cross-plaform video game framework which uses C# as its main programming language. The Unity code is stored in various library with the developer’s C# code being compiled to <code>Assembly-CSharp.dll</code>. C# compiled code is easily decompilable using tools such as <a href="https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy">dnSpy</a>. Once the dll is decompiled, we can look for the message we got earlier “열쇠화일이 존재하지 않습니다” (“The key file does not exist”) to find the bits of code we are interested in. The string search takes us to the <code>CIGLoadingScreen</code> class where we find the string among other variables:</p>
<pre title="">
	// Token: 0x0400056A RID: 1386
	private string userKey;

	// Token: 0x0400056B RID: 1387

	// Token: 0x0400056C RID: 1388
	private bool bannerVisible;

	// Token: 0x04000573 RID: 1395
	private string reqNum;

	// Token: 0x04000574 RID: 1396
	private string finishLabel = "끝내기";
</pre><p>Looking for the name of the string variable <code>reqMsg</code> takes us here:</p>
<pre title="">	// Token: 0x06000928 RID: 2344 RVA: 0x00026E60 File Offset: 0x00025060
	private void OnGUI()
	{
		if (!this.m_isVerify &amp;&amp; this.loadingDone)
		{
			GUI.skin.font = this.kfont;
			GUI.DrawTexture(new Rect(0f, 0f, (float)Screen.width, (float)Screen.height), this.blackBg, ScaleMode.StretchToFill);
			GUI.Label(this.GetTextLabelRect(this.reqMsg, 0.5f, 0.3f), this.reqMsg);
			GUI.Label(this.GetTextLabelRect(this.reqNumLabel, 0.3f, 0.5f), this.reqNumLabel);
			GUI.Label(this.GetTextLabelRect(this.reqNum, 0.6f, 0.5f), this.reqNum);
			RectOffset padding = GUI.skin.button.padding;
			GUI.skin.button.padding = new RectOffset(20, 20, 10, 10);
			if (GUI.Button(this.GetButtonRect(this.finishLabel, 0.5f, 0.8f), this.finishLabel))
			{
				Application.Quit();
			}
		}
	}
</pre><p>This is the code used to display the splashscreen we encountered earlier. If the boolean property <code>this.m_isVerify</code>, presumably the result of a call to a function checking the existence and validity of a licence key, is <code>False</code> then, the screen is displayed with the message we saw earlier and the “request number”. The verification function and the generation of the request number are handled in another class <code>GameCus</code>:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently took a closer look at Cloudflare’s new project <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radar</a>. Besides statistics about internet usage, attacks and popular domains, the site also shows statistics about the market shares of browsers.</p><p>Here is an overview of the global statistics:</p><p><a href="https://media.jlelse.blog/eb2cc6b3a4f116777f08594989bc16b4376a10b159e2c9d9ccc93080fb077631.png"><img src="https://media.jlelse.blog/eb2cc6b3a4f116777f08594989bc16b4376a10b159e2c9d9ccc93080fb077631.png" loading="lazy" alt="Global top browsers" title="Global top browsers"></a></p><p>Here the distribution in the USA:</p><p><a href="https://media.jlelse.blog/172293b33c412050c263e9a5eff0062158c509b58e40c3da31447199e304a871.png"><img src="https://media.jlelse.blog/172293b33c412050c263e9a5eff0062158c509b58e40c3da31447199e304a871.png" loading="lazy" alt="Top browsers in the USA" title="Top browsers in the USA"></a></p><p>And here in Germany:</p><p><a href="https://media.jlelse.blog/fb2e26d1aafda14d14b0affe91b35c6e531669632b3aa7cad1de3276130dd795.png"><img src="https://media.jlelse.blog/fb2e26d1aafda14d14b0affe91b35c6e531669632b3aa7cad1de3276130dd795.png" loading="lazy" alt="Top browsers in Germany" title="Top browsers in Germany"></a></p><p>When comparing the statistics, I notice a few interesting things:</p><ul><li>In the USA as well as in Germany the usage of Firefox is higher than the world average. In Germany, however, it is much higher, instead of only about 7%, the share of Firefox in Germany is almost 21%.</li><li>The use of Safari (iOS and desktop) in the USA is significantly higher than the world average and in Germany.</li><li>However, Chrome (mobile) and Samsung Internet have higher shares in Germany than in the USA. But Chrome (mobile) in Germany still has less than worldwide.</li></ul><p>The higher share of Safari in the USA can probably be explained relatively by the higher market share of Apple in the USA. While many people in Germany tend to rely more on Android smartphones (and Windows PCs), the iPhone (and Mac) share is significantly higher in the USA. Here are <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/461900/android-vs-ios-market-share-in-smartphone-sales-germany/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some</a> <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1150677/us-market-share-held-by-leading-smartphone-vendors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistics</a> on this.</p><p>This different distribution naturally also affects the other mobile browsers. In Germany many people seem to use Samsung smartphones and the pre-installed browser Samsung Internet.</p><p>What I can’t quite explain is the high percentage of Firefox in Germany. Are people in Germany more critical of Google? I somehow don’t believe that…</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[An Honest Review of Gatsby]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We decided to adopt Gatsby for <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/">Sentry’s customer-facing documentation</a> - well, I should say that <em>I</em> decided. We were already using it successfully for a variety of static marketing content, and I knew it had a lot of hype, so after a brief proof-of-concept it seemed like a safe choice.</p>
<p>To help contextualize everything I’m about to say, it’s important to understand the scope of our usage. Sentry’s documentation is not as straightforward as you might think - in fact, there are over 3,000 pages as of writing. We have a large amount of templated content designed to render language-specific examples, as well as a variety of different types of documentation (user guides, help desk-y articles, code-rich technical docs). Originally we had extended Jekyll to support a lot of this, but Ruby isn’t widely used at Sentry (approximately 0% of the engineering team knows Ruby), and it had become a big mess of spaghetti code with slow build times.</p>
<p>I also want to note that while this blog post is primarily focusing on the flaws of Gatsby as a framework, I’m not here to tell you that it’s not good for your use case. That said, I was not able to discover many of these short comings easily when evaluating Gatsby, and many things you read on the internet don’t stem out of real-world usage. My hope here is that Gatsby continues to improve over time, and that, as a user, you can be more informed about if it’s the right choice for you.</p>
<h2>Adopting Gatsby</h2>
<p>So, enter Gatsby. It seemed fast, was built on React (we’re experts on that here, with our gigabyte-sized Sentry frontend app), and had a huge adoption (assumed future existence and stability). While we didn’t have the desire to use MDX, it also seemed like a positive outcome given we could more easily deal with some of the rich aspects of our docs site, without having to resort to 2010-era JavaScript. We assumed a bunch of the other features of Gatsby had value-add, but we didn’t have an immediate need. These were things like dynamic source data - thus the need for a GraphQL engine at all - as well as the large plug-in ecosystem.</p>
<p>We started by iteratively converting sections of the Jekyll site into Gatsby - running them side by side for a time. At one point we eventually bulk converted pages, and ripped off the band aid. At this point though it was becoming clear build times were a problem. You’d spend at least 5 minutes on image optimization alone, with no way to even disable that. Slowly but surely we were depleting the ozone later on re-optimizing images which had already been pre-optimized. Oh yeah, and we were crippling our iteration speed as well, since the build cache would invalidate under a variety of situations in early development.</p>
<p>Making this worse was how we deployed Gatsby. We started off leveraging what we had already done: deploying Jekyll with Docker onto our own infrastructure - effectively just proxied via a CDN. We continued that for a period of time, but deploy times were far too long - upwards of 30-40 minutes for everything to build. Eventually we moved over to <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> which dropped it down closer to 10 minutes, but ultimately it can’t fix what it doesn’t control.</p>
<p>The build and deploy times were the first of many woes, and they represent what would become a continued frustration: a problem without a clear solution.</p>
<h2>Enter MDX</h2>
<p>Rewind time a little bit - this actually wasn’t our first project converting documentation to Gatsby. The proof-of-concept I mentioned earlier was actually our <a href="https://develop.sentry.dev/">developer documentation</a>, which I had migrated out of Notion to make public. While doing that we had gotten our hands dirty with some initial MDX usability and extensions - like our code samples which support toggling between different languages. This was one of the many things we needed to solve for, but MDX made it look like it’d be seemingly easy. No more jQuery DOM manipulation, just clean, encapsulated React components. Or so we thought.</p>
<p>Almost immediately we hit rough spots with MDX. We were coming from Jekyll - which was Liquid-rendered (a template engine) markdown - to MDX - a strange offspring of Markdown and JSX, attempting all of the benefits of both, but missing by a fairly large margin. Let’s illustrate the crux of the issue with what has got to be one of the most common needs in a documentation system: an alert (or callout) component:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>info<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>You should know something important about this!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>At face value this looks great. <code>Alert</code> is just a React component, and JSX is close enough to HTML that non-technical folks are able to pick it up fairly easily. Now the problem comes into play when you actually want to do something in the real world. Here’s an example from our API docs:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>How would you expect this to render? Both as an engineer and a non-engineer, I would expect - given this is markdown - that the “PUT/DELETE” text would be bold. It’s not. Because the MDX interpreter decides that once you enter a component block, it’s no longer markdown. So instead, we’re forced with this monstrosity <em>everywhere</em> in our documentation:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There’s two things you should note here: 1) we have to use this <code>&lt;markdown&gt;</code> tag, 2) we have to put empty new-lines to ensure paragraph tags render.</p>
<p>“But David”, you might say, “why don’t you just tell the <code>Alert</code> component to render the text as markdown?“. If only you could, or at least, if only I could have possibly found a way to achieve that as a user with minimal Gatsby or MDX internals knowledge.</p>
<p>To Gatsby, or at least to the MDX team’s credit, they recognize some of these problems and <a href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/1041">there is work underway</a> on a 2.0 of the MDX dialect. While I’m confident they will improve things, I’m not confident MDX can ultimately succeed. It’s likely going to tradeoff one problem for another due to what it’s trying to achieve in the first place. It may get to a good place, but frankly, we need to step back and look at what we’re trying to solve, instead of creating a solution to a problem we don’t have. I don’t need JSX syntax in my markdown, I need a way to include JSX components. That might sound similar, but its quite a different thing.</p>
<p>As an example, there’s no reason I couldn’t simply use markdown syntax, and provide a way to achieve something akin to:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a-valid-html-tag-because-markdown-allows-that</span> <span>a-valid-property</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>a-value<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This wouldn’t force us to work around quirks in a new language (or interpreter even), and could be solved in a much more sustainable way. There are other alternatives as well. A generic way to render extensions in markdown could simply call into a React component, and avoid even trying to hijack HTML in the first place. While I don’t know what this might look like in Markdown, in <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html">Sphinx’s use of reStructuredText</a> this was solved early on with Directives:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.. my-directive:: some data
   :property-name: property-value</code></pre></div>
<p>I will hold out for MDX 2.0 and hope that finds a nice minimal-compromise place, but if not, we’ll be looking for a way to extend native markdown.</p>
<h2>A Broken DOM</h2>
<p>While we were able to work around the kinks of MDX, there’s been some things not yet solved. One of those is the layer which Gatsby uses to apply diffs to the DOM. I’m going to caveat this section with <em>I don’t know what the technical implementation is</em>, but I can make some assumptions given what I know of the domain. The system itself is intended to apply deltas to the DOM. This is naively also how React works, and I imagine under the hood it’s relying on React at least for part of it. We’ve had issues with this identified in two places already:</p>
<ul>
<li>progressive image loading</li>
<li>dynamic JSX components</li>
</ul>
<p>While they might not be linked to the same issue, they smell like they are, so we’re going to roll with it. The problem exhibits itself when you have a bunch of DOM that to a naive robot might look the same:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;bar&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;baz&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;foobizbar&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>In React it uses the graph to identify which node is which - effectively creating a unique entity ID based on its location. In cases where that’s difficult, React will warn you to explicitly bind a <code>key</code> attribute on each element to ensure it can more accurately deal with updates. While I would assume Gatsby is at least partially using React’s DOM engine, what we see in production effectively takes the above example, and replaces some of the content with other subsets of content - meaning it’s unable to accurately identify which nodes need updated.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this where a progressive image is replaced with an entirely different image that’s present near it on the page. We’ve also seen this happen for a dynamically loaded section of content (our language-selector include tags). While we’ve yet to identify a fix for the image tags, our other issue was resolved by literally changing a <code>div</code> tag to a different tag, one which is less commonly used (in our case, <code>section</code>).</p>
<p>All of the cases happen after Gatsby’s initial static render and exist only when applying some form of delta.</p>
<h2>Let’s Talk GraphQL</h2>
<p>It’s a static website generator. It literally does not need GraphQL all over the place. While there are few instances in the real world where that is valuable, it shouldn’t require a GraphQL API to read objects that are already in memory.</p>
<p>I don’t want to spend the energy to hammer this in, but take a look at Jared Palmer’s <a href="https://jaredpalmer.com/gatsby-vs-nextjs">Gatsby vs. Next.js</a> as it echoes my thoughts.</p>
<p>So, let’s actually not talk about GraphQL, but all its done is create complexity for us.</p>
<h2>Minor Gripes</h2>
<p>There’s a number of other things we’ve found fairly frustrating at this point, but this post is already getting long, so I’m choosing to summarize them.</p></section></div>

October 2, 2020 | https://wiki.alopex.li/RustStarterKit2020 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wiki.alopex.li/RustStarterKit2020">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>People were arguing about Rust’s std lib recently, so I went through the <code>Cargo.toml</code> of all the Rust projects I’ve written since 2015 and picked out the choice tools that get used over and over again. Up to date as of October 2020.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/RustCrates" title="Go to wiki page">RustCrates</a>, though that’s old. There’s also <a href="https://christine.website/blog/rust-crates-go-stdlib-2020-09-27">this</a>, which is narrower but deeper, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">awesome-rust</a>, which is shallower and broader, and the various <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">more</a> <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">specific</a> <a href="https://areweasyncyet.rs/">websites</a> <a href="https://www.areweguiyet.com/">for various</a> <a href="https://areweideyet.com/">topics</a>.</p>

<p>I need to set up a new Rust dev environment, what do I install?</p>
<h2 id="linting-clippy">Linting – <code>clippy</code></h2>
<p>The one, the only, the great Rust style and correctness linter. Want to learn how to write “idiomatic” Rust, or just learn more about handy little corners of the language and library? Run <code>clippy</code> regularly. It’s distributed with the compiler via <code>rustup</code> now, so you have no excuse not to.</p>
<h2 id="build-cache-sccache">Build cache – <code>sccache</code></h2>
<p>Or, “how to make a full rebuild 70% faster”. <code>sccache</code> is a build artifact cache similar to <code>icecream</code> or <code>ccache</code>, except it’s actually trivial to just use. <code>cargo install sccache</code>, add a single line in a home dir config file, and you’re ready to go. Pretty much handles most crate and compiler versioning issues for you, so it Just Works if you update crates or install a new version of <code>rustc</code> or something. I think I’ve had to force-clear the cache due to some build weirdness a grand total of once. Looks like it has enough features to use in a professional context as well, at least on a small-to-medium scale.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-viewer-cargo-tree">Dependency viewer – <code>cargo-tree</code></h2>
<p>The best way to view what dependencies you are using, and what dependencies they are using, and so on. Best way to start cracking down on flabby dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-criterion">Benchmarking – <code>criterion</code></h2>
<p>Basically the best benchmark system out there. Incredibly simple to use, informative, and statistically sound. Doesn’t really do profiling, but it’s a good start for understanding your program’s performance, and better for proving that your implementation of X is faster than someone else’s.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>Stuff that is less general purpose but occasionally very useful for the meta-programming process of choosing libraries, evaluating them, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo-geiger</code> – Measures how much unsafe code is in a codebase, and its dependencies</li>
<li><code>cargo-crev</code> – A <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingCrev">very neat tool</a> for authoring and verifying distributed code reviews.</li>
<li>Various tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem">Embark Studios</a>, useful for production/company purposes like checking licenses, pinning specific versions of crates, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cool stuff Real Computer Scientists write about.</p>
<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>
<p>No specific crates here. There’s no single crate that provides All The Hash Algorithms, just lots of little ones that generally provide a single algorithm each. Just type the name of the algorithm you want into <code>crates.io</code> and you’ll get at least a couple options, choose the one with 8 million downloads or whatever. <code>sha2</code>, <code>md5</code>, <code>crc</code>, etc. Lots of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>Same as the hashing category. Type <code>zip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> or whatever into crates.io and you’ll get what you need. <code>flate2</code> might be the one crate that’s not quite trivial to find. Again, many of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>I have little actual experience or authority on this topic, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<h2 id="pseudorandom-number-generator">Pseudorandom number generator</h2>
<p>Use <code>oorandom</code>. (Disclaimer, I wrote <code>oorandom</code>, but people besides me seem to like it.) More usually you’ll see the <code>rand</code> crate in use. If you’re doing Real Science and need to generate <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html">fancy probabilities</a>, then <code>rand</code> is the right tool, but most people aren’t doing that. Otherwise <code>rand</code> is complicated and has lots of features, while <code>oorandom</code> is very simple and has about two features, and I expect 80% of code to use at least one of them. <code>rand</code> has had several major breaking changes in its history that the rest of the ecosystem still hasn’t caught up with, while I intend <code>oorandom</code>’s API to change maybe twice in my lifetime. (Its version number, while obeying semver, is mostly a joke.)</p>
<p>There’s other lightweight PRNG crates that are just fine; see <code>oorandom</code>’s readme for a list of some others and choose one you like. Whatever you choose, use the <code>getrandom</code> crate to produce Real Random Seeds for it.</p>

<p>“I just need to solve this ooooooone common problem, but it needs to be solved WELL…”</p>
<h2 id="logging-log">Logging – <code>log</code></h2>
<p>Need to output log messages in your code? Why, use the <code>log</code> crate. Where do the log messages go? <code>log</code> provides only an interface, and that interface compiles to nothing if it isn’t used. You can write your own system for it to actually output the logs to, which is pretty easy, or use one of the small plethora of crates for it. My preferred one is <code>pretty_env_logger</code>, but <code>fern</code>, <code>slog</code> and others are all good too.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-data-crunching-rayon">Parallel data crunching – <code>rayon</code></h2>
<p>Ever have some computation where you have a big list of STUFF and want to process it in parallel, farming out jobs to as many threads as you have CPU’s? That’s what <code>rayon</code> does, and it does it really, really well. You still <a href="https://aspenuwu.me/posts/rust-optimization.html">have to know what you’re doing</a>, but changing a single <code>.iter()</code> into <code>.par_iter()</code> and watching your CPU-bound data-crunching run 8x faster is pretty magical. Now your CPU can help keep you warm this winter!</p>
<p>Please never use it in a library. It’s rude to spawn threads in library code, unless that’s specifically what the library is for.</p>
<h2 id="regexes-regex">Regexes – <code>regex</code></h2>
<p>To quote the inestimable <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">somebody’s gotta save the day</a>. So, use the <code>regex</code> crate. Also use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">anything else</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/xsv">written by BurntSushi</a>. BurntSushi is a paragon of Rust program design, and also just a great <del>human being</del> charred cuisine in general.</p>
<h2 id="threadsafe-globals-lazy_static">Threadsafe globals – <code>lazy_static</code></h2>
<p>“I know globals are evil,” you say, “but I just need one. I’ll only use it for good, I promise.” <code>lazy_static</code> has your back.</p>
<p>May eventually be superseded by <code>once_cell</code>, which looks like its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788">headed for inclusion into <code>std</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="serializationdeserialization-serde">Serialization/deserialization – <code>serde</code></h2>
<p>Ever have a struct and just wanted to turn it into JSON, CBOR, XML, or some other engine of woe and devastation designed to be written to an I/O stream? Or had a blob of random JSON and wanted to just stuff it into a struct matching it? Sure you have. <code>serde</code> lets you do this with a single <code>#[derive]</code>. <code>serde</code> is without a doubt one of Rust’s killer libraries. It is better than any other serialization system I have ever used.</p>
<p>What data formats does it support? Anything; the actual reading and writing is done via plugin library. There’s a <a href="https://serde.rs/#data-formats">wide selection of them</a>, of varying quality, and writing your own is a little tedious but not terribly difficult.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>This spot deliberately left blank.</p>
<p>Rust’s <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> type is one of the best setups for lightweight, transparent error handling I’ve seen, but it doesn’t do everything. How do you easily write your own error type without a bunch of boilerplate? What if you have multiple different error types from different libraries you want to coalesce together? How do you collect a backtrace of every function an <code>Err</code> is returned through, so you can find the root cause of where it came from? Can we do all this without allocating anything unnecessarily? And so on.</p>
<p>There have been various crates to try to solve these problems. First in 2015 there was <code>error_chain</code>, which was complicated and not very convenient. Then in 2017 there was <code>failure</code>, which was simpler but not very flexible, and which took an irritatingly long time to compile. Then in 2019 there was <code>anyhow</code>, which was about the time I stopped paying attention. Now apparently the new kid on the block is <code>eyre</code>, and I’m sure that in another year or two there will be something else.</p>
<p>So, I just write the boilerplate and make my errors descriptive enough I don’t need a backtrace. When I want to get fancy I implement the built-in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html"><code>Error</code></a> trait, which used to be kinda useless but is now more helpful. And in another five years it’ll still work just fine.</p>
<h2 id="byte-mucking-bytemuck">Byte mucking – <code>bytemuck</code></h2>
<p>For the rare occasions you need to turn a structure into arbitrary <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or back. Doing this using unsafe pointers is quite easy, and also makes it very easy to screw up horribly with Undefined Behavior galore. (Did you know that changing the value of padding bytes in a struct in UB? You do now.) <code>bytemuck</code> lets you muck around with bytes a little more responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="human-dates-and-times-chrono">Human dates and times – <code>chrono</code></h2>
<p>Rust’s <code>std::time</code> doesn’t really handle calendar or wall-clock times, just arbitrary, monotonic <code>Instant</code>’s and measurable <code>Duration</code>’s between them. Nice, pure, computationally-robust time measurement. For all the nasty human calendar and timezone stuff, you use <code>chrono</code>. (And maybe <code>humantime</code>, but I personally reach for <code>chrono</code> first, just out of habit.)</p>
<h2 id="bit-flags-bitflags">Bit flags – <code>bitflags</code></h2>
<p>Defining type-safe bit-masks in a reasonably convenient way. Not always worth the trouble, but sometimes pretty convenient.</p>

<p>“I have to create or read a…”</p>
<h2 id="pngjpeggifetc-image">PNG/JPEG/GIF/etc – <code>image</code></h2>
<p>General-purpose loading and saving and images, which can handle a lot of formats. Can do some amount of image manipulation as well, such as cropping, smoothing, etc. but that will hopefully be pulled out into its own library at some point soon.</p>
<h2 id="small-data-things-uuid-base64-csv-semver">Small data THINGS – <code>uuid</code>, <code>base64</code>, <code>csv</code>, <code>semver</code>…</h2>
<p>Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Not aware of any great encoders, but there’s plenty of <em>decoders</em> for common audio formats. <code>lewton</code> for Ogg Vorbis, <code>hound</code> for .wav, <code>minimp3</code> for MP3, <code>claxon</code> for FLAC. Video, I haven’t used enough to have an opinion on.</p>
<h2 id="config-files-toml">Config files – <code>toml</code></h2>
<p>For all your config file format needs. Works with <code>serde</code>, naturally.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-pulldown-cmark">Markdown – <code>pulldown-cmark</code></h2>
<p>There’s several good Markdown readers and writers, <code>pulldown-cmark</code> is my favorite. It supports CommonMark, it’s simple to use, and it’s pure Rust.</p>
<h2 id="templating-askama">Templating – <code>askama</code></h2>
<p>There’s several quite good text templating engines, but <code>askama</code> IMO rises above them all by compiling your templates into Rust code and type-checking your templates at compile time. Sometimes this isn’t what you want, but it is a great feature surprisingly often. This also makes it super fast, for when you really need to …</p></div></div>

<p>This document is a set of guidelines for using C++ well.
The aim of this document is to help people to use modern C++ effectively.
By “modern C++” we mean effective use of the ISO C++ standard (currently C++17, but almost all of our recommendations also apply to C++14 and C++11).
In other words, what would you like your code to look like in 5 years’ time, given that you can start now? In 10 years’ time?</p>

<p>The guidelines are focused on relatively high-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency.
Such rules affect application architecture and library design.
Following the rules will lead to code that is statically type safe, has no resource leaks, and catches many more programming logic errors than is common in code today.
And it will run fast – you can afford to do things right.</p>

<p>We are less concerned with low-level issues, such as naming conventions and indentation style.
However, no topic that can help a programmer is out of bounds.</p>

<p>Our initial set of rules emphasizes safety (of various forms) and simplicity.
They may very well be too strict.
We expect to have to introduce more exceptions to better accommodate real-world needs.
We also need more rules.</p>

<p>You will find some of the rules contrary to your expectations or even contrary to your experience.
If we haven’t suggested you change your coding style in any way, we have failed!
Please try to verify or disprove rules!
In particular, we’d really like to have some of our rules backed up with measurements or better examples.</p>

<p>You will find some of the rules obvious or even trivial.
Please remember that one purpose of a guideline is to help someone who is less experienced or coming from a different background or language to get up to speed.</p>

<p>Many of the rules are designed to be supported by an analysis tool.
Violations of rules will be flagged with references (or links) to the relevant rule.
We do not expect you to memorize all the rules before trying to write code.
One way of thinking about these guidelines is as a specification for tools that happens to be readable by humans.</p>

<p>The rules are meant for gradual introduction into a code base.
We plan to build tools for that and hope others will too.</p>

<p>Comments and suggestions for improvements are most welcome.
We plan to modify and extend this document as our understanding improves and the language and the set of available libraries improve.</p>



<p>This is a set of core guidelines for modern C++ (currently C++17) taking likely future enhancements and ISO Technical Specifications (TSs) into account.
The aim is to help C++ programmers to write simpler, more efficient, more maintainable code.</p>

<p>All C++ programmers. This includes <a href="#S-cpl">programmers who might consider C</a>.</p>

<h2 id="inaims-aims"><a name="SS-aims"></a>In.aims: Aims</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to help developers to adopt modern C++ (currently C++17) and to achieve a more uniform style across code bases.</p>

<p>We do not suffer the delusion that every one of these rules can be effectively applied to every code base. Upgrading old systems is hard. However, we do believe that a program that uses a rule is less error-prone and more maintainable than one that does not. Often, rules also lead to faster/easier initial development.
As far as we can tell, these rules lead to code that performs as well or better than older, more conventional techniques; they are meant to follow the zero-overhead principle (“what you don’t use, you don’t pay for” or “when you use an abstraction mechanism appropriately, you get at least as good performance as if you had handcoded using lower-level language constructs”).
Consider these rules ideals for new code, opportunities to exploit when working on older code, and try to approximate these ideals as closely as feasible.
Remember:</p>

<h3 id="in0-dont-panic"><a name="R0"></a>In.0: Don’t panic!</h3>

<p>Take the time to understand the implications of a guideline rule on your program.</p>

<p>These guidelines are designed according to the “subset of superset” principle (<a href="#Stroustrup05">Stroustrup05</a>).
They do not simply define a subset of C++ to be used (for reliability, safety, performance, or whatever).
Instead, they strongly recommend the use of a few simple “extensions” (<a href="#S-gsl">library components</a>)
that make the use of the most error-prone features of C++ redundant, so that they can be banned (in our set of rules).</p>

<p>The rules emphasize static type safety and resource safety.
For that reason, they emphasize possibilities for range checking, for avoiding dereferencing <code>nullptr</code>, for avoiding dangling pointers, and the systematic use of exceptions (via RAII).
Partly to achieve that and partly to minimize obscure code as a source of errors, the rules also emphasize simplicity and the hiding of necessary complexity behind well-specified interfaces.</p>

<p>Many of the rules are prescriptive.
We are uncomfortable with rules that simply state “don’t do that!” without offering an alternative.
One consequence of that is that some rules can be supported only by heuristics, rather than precise and mechanically verifiable checks.
Other rules articulate general principles. For these more general rules, more detailed and specific rules provide partial checking.</p>

<p>These guidelines address the core of C++ and its use.
We expect that most large organizations, specific application areas, and even large projects will need further rules, possibly further restrictions, and further library support.
For example, hard-real-time programmers typically can’t use free store (dynamic memory) freely and will be restricted in their choice of libraries.
We encourage the development of such more specific rules as addenda to these core guidelines.
Build your ideal small foundation library and use that, rather than lowering your level of programming to glorified assembly code.</p>

<p>The rules are designed to allow <a href="#S-modernizing">gradual adoption</a>.</p>

<p>Some rules aim to increase various forms of safety while others aim to reduce the likelihood of accidents, many do both.
The guidelines aimed at preventing accidents often ban perfectly legal C++.
However, when there are two ways of expressing an idea and one has shown itself a common source …</p></div></div>

<p>This week, we continue our four-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, III, IV) look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  Last week we took our ore and smelted it into a rough, spongy mass of iron called a bloom; this week we’re going to go through the processes to reshape that bloom first into a consolidated billet, then into a bar that is useful for forging and finally into some useful final object.</p>



<p>I want to stress at the outset that we are not going to cover anything close to the whole of blacksmithing practice in this post.  Blacksmithing is fairly complex and any given object, shape or tool is going to have its own set of processes and techniques to produce the required shape at the required hardness and malleability characteristics.  If you <em>are</em> interested in that sort of information, I recommend A.W. Bealer’s <em>The Art of Blacksmithing</em> (1969) as a fairly good starting point, though there is no substitute to speaking with a practicing blacksmith.</p>

<h2>Heat, Hammers and Hardness</h2>



<p>There are a few basic behaviors of iron that fundamentally control what blacksmiths are going to do with it in this stage.  To begin with, we need to introduce some terminology to avoid this coming confusing: a given piece of metal can be <em>hard</em> (resistant to deformation) or <em>soft</em>; they can also be <em>ductile </em>(able to deform significantly before breaking) or <em>brittle</em> (likely to break without deformation).  This is easiest to understand at the extremes: a soft, brittle material (like a thin wooden dowel) takes very little energy and breaks immediately without behind, while a hard, ductile material (the same dowel, made of spring-steel) bends more easily under stress but resists breaking.  But it is also possible to hard hard brittle materials (pottery being a classic example) which fiercely resist deforming but break catastrophically the moment they exceed their tolerances or a soft, ductile material (think wet-noodle) which bends very easily.</p>



<p>(I should note that all of these factors are, in fact, very complex – far more complex than we are going to discuss.  In particular, as I understand it, some of what I am using ‘hardness’ to describe also falls under the related category of yield strength.  Hopefully you will all pardon the necessary simplification; if it makes you feel any better, ancient blacksmiths didn’t understand how any of this worked either, only that it worked.)</p>



<p>Of course these treats are not binaries but a spectrum.  Materials have a degree of hardness or ductility; as we’ll see, these are not quite <em>opposed</em>, but changing one does change the other – increasing hardness often reduces ductility.</p>



<p>The sort of things that pre-modern people are going to want to be made in iron are going to have fairly tight tolerances for these sorts of things.  Objects that had wide tolerances (that is, things which could be weak or a little bendy or didn’t have to take much force) got made out of other cheaper, easier materials like ceramics, stone or wood; metals were really only used for things that had to be both strong and relatively light for precisely the reasons we’ve seen: they were too expensive for anything else.  <strong>That means that a blacksmith doesn’t merely need to bring the metal to the right shape but also to the right <em>characteristics</em></strong><em><strong>.</strong>  </em>Some tools would need to finish up being quite hard (like the tip of a pick, or the edge of a blade), while others needed to be able to bend to absorb strain (like the core of a blade or the back of a saw).</p>



<p>Keep all of that in mind as we discuss:</p>



<h2>Forge Techniques</h2>



<p>I realize this is a long aside to leave our bloom waiting, but as we’ll see, the remaining steps share a basic set of techniques, making it easier to discuss those techniques together.</p>



<p>Fundamentally, each stage of forging iron revolves around a basic cycle: <strong>by heating the metal, the smith makes it soft enough to <em>work</em> </strong>(that is, hammer into shape).  Technically, it is possible to shape relatively thin masses of iron by hammering when cold (this is called cold-working) but in contrast to other metals (tin, copper and bronze all come to mind) nearly all serious iron-working was done ‘hot.’  In smithing terminology, each of these cycles is referred to as a ‘heat’ – the more heats a given project requires, the more fuel it is going to consume, the longer and more expensive it is going to be (but a skilled smith can often finish the work in fewer heats than an unskilled smith).</p>

An assistant mans the bellows on the forge to maintain the temperature.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A modern blacksmith can gauge the temperature of a metal using sophisticated modern thermometers, but pre-modern smiths had no recourse to such things (and most traditional smiths I’ve met don’t use them anyway).  Instead, the temperature of the metal is gauged by looking at its <em>color</em>: as things get hotter, they glow from brown to dark red through to a light red into yellow and then finally white.  For iron heated in a forge, a blacksmith can control the temperature of the forge’s fire by controlling the air-input through the bellows (pushing in more air means more combustion, which means more heat, but also more fuel consumed).  As we’ve seen, charcoal (and we will need to use charcoal, not wood, to hit the necessary heat required), while not cripplingly expensive, was not trivial to produce either.  A skilled smith is thus going to try to do the work in as few heats as possible and not excessively hot either (there are, in fact, other reasons to avoid excessive heats, this is just one).</p>



<p>One hot the metal can be shaped by hammering.  The thickness of a bar of metal could be thickened by <em>upsetting</em> (heating the center of the bar and them hammering down on it like a nail to compress the center, causing it to thicken) or thinned by <em>drawing</em> (hammering out the metal to create a longer, thinner shape).  If the required shape needed the metal to be bent it could be heated and bent either over the side of the anvil or against a tool; many anvils had (and still have) a notch in the back where such a tool could be fitted.  A good example of this kind of thing would be hammering out a sheet of iron over a dome-shape to create the bowl of a helmet (a task known as ‘raising’ or ‘sinking’ depending on precisely how it is done).  A mass of iron can also be divided by heating it at the intended cutting point and then using a hammer and chisel to cut through the hot, soft metal.</p>



<p>But for understanding the entire process, the most important of these operations is the<strong> <em>fire weld</em></strong>.  Much like bloomery furnaces, the forges available to pre-modern blacksmiths could not reach the temperatures necessary to melt or cast iron, but it was necessary to be able to join smaller bits of iron into larger ones which was done through a fire weld (sometimes called a forge weld).  In this process, the iron is heated very hot, typically to a ‘yellow’ or ‘white’ heat (around 1100 °C).  The temperature range for the operation is quite precise: too cold and the iron will not weld, too hot and it will ‘burn’ making the weld brittle.  Once at the right temperature, the two pieces of iron are put next to each other and hammered into each other with heavy blows.  If done properly, the two pieces of metal join completely, leaving a weld that is as strong as every other part of the bar.</p>

<p>That’s not all there is to say about these processes (we’ll come back to them in a moment) but we now have enough of the basics to begin processing our bloom.</p>



<h2>From Bloom to Billet to Bar</h2>



<p>As you may recall, when we finished our process last time, we ended with a ‘bloom’ of iron: a spongy mass of pure, metallic iron interspersed with inclusions of waste materials called slag:</p>

<p>The iron of the bloom itself is also likely to be quite brittle because of these slag inclusions.  This isn’t a product that can be sent directly to a blacksmith.  It needs to be consolidated first into a billet and most of that slag needs to be forced out, both of which can be achieved via liberal application of <strong>fire welding</strong>.</p>



<p>This step is sometimes called <strong>bloomsmithing</strong>.  The bloom is heated to roughly 1100 °C (gauged, as above, by the color of the iron) – it seems plausible that it may have been broken up into smaller chunks to make this more useful – and then hammered into a single mass through a series of fire welds.  We’re not very well informed how this was done in the ancient world (save ‘with hammers’) because bloomsmithing doesn’t tend to leave a lot of evidence for us to observe.  The end shape of the process was generally a very thick rectangular bar called a <strong>billet</strong>, ready for relatively easy transport.</p>



<p>This process has some advantages and disadvantages, beyond merely shaping the metal into a more usable and transportable form.  Remember that our bloom contains a lot of material which isn’t iron (the slag); fire welding, especially when repeated, tends to expel this slag – as the iron is compressed in the weld, the slag is forced out.  There is some debate (note Sim &amp; Kaminski, <em>op. cit.</em>) if this process is sufficient to explain the <em>very</em> low slag counts seen in high quality weapons and armor, but it is certainly true that fire welding reduces the overall slag count.  That …</p></div></div>

<p>Landing in master, plasma has an optional new startup method to launch and manage all our KDE/Plasma services via a systemd user instance rather than the current boot scripts. This will be available in Plasma 5.21.</p>
<p>It is currently opt-in, off by default.  I hope to make it the default where available after more testing and feedback, but it is important to stress that the current boot-up method will exist and be supported into the future. A lot of work was put into splitting and tidying so the actual amount of duplication in the end result is quite small and managable.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bitmap.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bitmap.png" alt="Our logos are weirldy similar...conspiracy?"></a></p>

<h2>Overlapping requirements</h2>
<p>We have to start a lot of things in a given order. Systemd naturally is designed for handling doing this.</p>
<p>Whilst we already have a somewhat working system, it has issues. One classic problem is services that talk to other services needing to be both spawned but also fully initialised before the other can send a message. DBus activation solves a lot; but not quite enough.</p>
<p>For example, we have the real world case of scripts run long before plasmashell trying to send notifications; we want DBus daemon to know our notification server it's activatable so that it will pause the dispatch of the message, but making it DBus activatable can't guarantee the dependencies are run in the correct order. This is currently solved with a <del>genius</del> horrific hack.</p>
<p>But starting things up is only half the battle. We currently have a big issue with shutting things down. Whose responsibility is it to stop running services? A lot of things only exit because their wayland connection is swept away. When dealing with services that potentially restart during the session lifespan, this solution is far from trivial and the current situation is fundamentally broken.</p>
<h2>Customisation / Sysadmin Familiarity</h2>
<p>Most users and especially sysadmins already have to learn how to use their init system. Whether it's simply enabling a service on boot, or something much more complex users are exposed to it already. If not, there is good existing documentation and countless Stackoverflow posts to answer any question.</p>
<p>We had a meeting akademy 2 years ago about use of systemd and it was the sysadmins from Limux who clearly knew far more than any programmer as to how it should all work. There is a lot more merit in using existing things than just sharing code.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another big motivating factor was the ability for customisation. The root of Plasma's startup is very hardcoded. What if you want to run krunner with a different environment variable set? or have a script run every time plasmashell restarts, or show a UI after kwin is loaded but before plasma shell to perform some user setup? You can edit the code, but that's not easy and you're very much on your own.</p>
<p>Systemd provides that level of customisation; both at a distro or a user level out of the box. From our POV for free.</p>
<h2>CGroups and resource limits</h2>
<p>I've talked about use of <a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/modern-process-management-on-the-desktop/">cgroups for applications</a> for better control of resources. Especially as more things become multi-process. </p>
<p>CGroups and slices provide several benefits over what we can do currently. Because resources are always relative to within the parent slice, we are able to boost resources as well as limit things. This will allow us to bump kwin and such ever so slightly without needing elevated cap privileges.</p>
<p>This also works the other way; cgroups have some extra scheduler features not otherwise available. We can not just set weigh to a process, but also absolute limits. This could be useful for file indexers and alike to minimise battery drainage or capture runaway processes. CGroups are where all the new kernel features are.</p>
<p>Memory management is another factor, when we run out the kernel comes in and kills some processes.<br>
We can tag some services as being safer to OOM kill than others with a lot more granularity than a single oomscore adjustment. We can provide expected memory usages for a service, we can put defaults levels on entire slices at once, and it's all easily customisable by the user if their opinions don't match our upstream defaults.</p>
<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>The current state of logging is a mess. One of two things happen:<br>
Either stderr from a service is lost, or logs go into one giant "xsession-errors" file. This file exists on a real file system slowly expanding and expanding. It doesn't rotate, if it gets too big your home folder becomes full and things explode. Each time you log in, we override that log, so we lose any history. </p>
<p>The alternative is that logs are simply lost.</p>
<p>Systemd provides queryable logging with each unit, and each invocation of each unit being separate. It's already making my life a lot easier for the last bugs I've been working on. When people on bugzilla have this too, it'll make everything easier.</p>

<h2>Previous implementations</h2>
<p>A plasma systemd boot has been <a href="https://github.com/eliasp/plasma-workspace-units">tried before</a> by Elias Probst. It worked well as a demo, and was used as inspiration for some parts. The key difference now is instead of trying to design around plasma, we're changing plasma to fit what we need and really put the focus on every last detail.</p>
<h2>Refactor, Split, Refactor, Split, ...</h2>
<p>Unintuitively the first start of a port to systemd was a complete rewrite of the legacy path.</p>
<p>Plasma used to be managed by a tree of processes that would spawn, set up some environment variables, spawn the next part of the boot and continue running. We eventually get to ksmserver, which was a monolith that did many many things. It started several hardcoded processes like kwin, then all the autostart .desktop files, and then session restore. There were many reasons to break this up that I outlined when I started in <a href="https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/changes-to-ksmserver/">2018</a>.</p>
<p>Since then we've been chopping a tiny part out every release. Each release would split out a tiny part at a time so we could always be on top of any regressions that happened. </p>
<p>Once we'd refactored and rewrote some parts we could have a very clear and readable understanding of  <a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/plasma-startup/"> what actually happens in a plasma boot</a> and what is really dependent on what.</p>
<p>The biggest problem that we have is many things rely on environment variables or even xrdb databases to be correct at the time of launching; several early parts of the boot (kcminit, kded phase0) will adjust these and the next parts may rely on these for correct theming. </p>
<p>Another massive rewrite that landed (by Kai Uwe Broulik) was the detaching of kwin from ksmserver. kwin needs to know which session we're restoring so that restored windows can be placed at the right place; this previously came from an environment variable that means we needed ksmserver up and running to spawn kwin. We rewrote how that all works and gets communicated so the order can be agnostic but still without any features getting lost.</p>
<h2>Final patchset</h2>
<p>Eventually we got to a point where ksmserver is <em>only</em> dealing with X11 session management. We have another quite tiny binary (<code>plasma_session</code>) that <em>only</em> deals with starting services in a specific order. And everything else is completely separate standalone independent components. This has been released for a while. Even without the systemd boot, everything is in a much much cleaner better off state.</p>
<p>The final patch to use systemd is then really quite boring and small. We just don't call the <code>plasma_session binary</code>, and instead try to start a systemd target; <code>plasma-workspace.target</code>.</p>
<p>All our core services ship their own .service files which plasma-workpace requires for a full Plasma session.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_20200923_114125.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_20200923_114125-1024x249.png" alt="This picture shows random circles and lines. I felt it helped break up the wall of text."></a></p>
<h2>Autostart files</h2>
<p>One of the key aspects of startup is handling autostart .desktop files in /etc/xdg/autostart or ~/.config/autostart. We need this to work as before.</p>
<p>Benjamin Berg (of Red Hat and Gnome) came up with a very elegant solution using a <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.generator.html">systemd generator</a>. It goes through all the .desktop files parsing them and generates an appropriate systemd service automagically.</p>
<p>For application developers everything keeps working the same, but to an end user we can interact with them like native services. We get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Despite being a shared implementation even KDE-specific things like X-KDE-AutostartCondition just work. Implementation wise the generator converts this into an ExecCondition= line which then calls into a plasma-shipped binary to check if it's allowed.</p>

<h2>Is it faster?</h2>
<p>A lot of the prep work over the past few years to get to this state has made absolutely massive differences. The splitting found bugs dead code and potential optimisations that add up to magnitudes of difference.</p>
<p>As for switching over to the systemd itself, it should be roughly the same. Ultimately we're triggering the exact same set of things in the exact same order with the exact same blocks if we've done our job properly. Sorry to disappoint!</p>
<h2>Is it finished?</h2>
<p>The fundamentals are definitely at a point that I think are stable and working; but we haven't enabled all of the potential extra features we have available. I would welcome people who are experiences to give feedback and help out.</p>

<p>You must have latest master of Plasma, it is not in the 5.20 beta. </p>
<p>Enable with:</p>
<pre><code>kwriteconfig5 --file startkderc --group General --key systemdBoot true</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned above there are checks that you have the systemd 246 or newer for the generator of existing autostart services to work.</p>
<p>To confirm the boot worked correctly you can run</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user status plasma-plasmashell.service</code></pre>
<p>It should show as active.</p>
<p>This safety check of 246 can be skipped. You will lose auto-activation of apps using the classic .desktop file approach, but everything else still works. I won't mention how publicly to avoid false bug reports, but as a dev you can probably find out.</p>
<h3>Dev setups - a caveat</h3>
<p>If you build your own KDE and install into a non standard prefix, instead of getting Plasma from your distribution, there is one new hurdle. Systemd user sessions starts earlier than most people set their custom prefixes so naturally it can't find things in your new paths.</p>
<p>There are multiple solutions, simplest is to re-run  <code>./install-sessions</code> script in plasma-workspace …</p></div></article></div>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>As most of you may know, <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> started on 1st October 2020. And as it with most things in human life, people came with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/shitoberfest">different</a> ways to hack hacktoberfest to get the free t-shirt.</p>

<p>Now apart from the sheer number of spam PRs which were opened, copious amount of time is being spent by the comparatively small number of open source maintainers who have comment, close and label each individual PR.</p>

<p>I became aware of this happening from this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24643894">post</a>, and in a days time several more <a href="https://joel.net/how-one-guy-ruined-hacktoberfest2020-drama">posts</a> popped up. 
I got motivated (triggered?) to write this post when I saw the following on HN:</p>

<p><img src="https://pulkitsharma07.github.io/assets/hacktober/hn_comment.png" alt="hn-comment"></p>

<p>After some investigation, I found the original claim to be true, <code>more than 60% of the spam PRs are coming from one country: India</code> and that is just 1 day after hacktoberfest started, I am sure the percentage will increase as days go by (unless DigitalOcean does something).</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<p><a href="https://joel.net/how-one-guy-ruined-hacktoberfest2020-drama">This</a> post talks about one Indian YouTube channel which apparently told people to open spammy PRs. After I looked around some people were claiming he was falsely accused, anyways the video is deleted now, so I can’t comment on that.</p>

<p>Anyways, it didn’t take long and I was able to find few more Indian YouTubers who were pretty directly promoting ways to open PRs to get those sweet T-Shirts. One created his own <a href="https://github.com/seeditsolution/cprogram/pulls">repo</a> and encouraged people to google different programs and copy-paste them into a new PR against the empty repo.</p>

<p>I do not want to focus on the <em>How</em>, you will find find plenty videos/blogs on it, I am sure some Indian YouTuber has started working on creating a video on it.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>One of the simplest explanation is that, DigitalOcean should have been very well anticipated that this is going to happen, after all they must have all the stats from the previous HacktoberFests.</p>

<p>We need to understand that Hacktoberfest is an marketing event. And all these spam and blogs posts around it is definitely serving their main purpose, there is no such thing as bad publicity indeed. Of course I could be totally wrong, all of this could be completely unintentional.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, coming to the Indian side of the ongoing issue. Out of all the countries why does India have the most spammy PRs ? As a seasoned armchair philosopher, the following are my thoughts on the “Why” of all this.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="the-signalling-problem">The Signalling Problem</h3>
<p>Whenever an online article/documentary/report claim to give a view into the “real” India, most of us (Indians) get offended.</p>

<p>I <em>was</em> in the bubble which was in the “offended” bucket for long time. The reason was simple: I, the people around me and the societal structures around me were all part of the same bubble. We do not have to worry about paying school fees or rent, we do not have worry about sending part of salary back home just so that our parents can buy groceries to survive..</p>

<p>I can go on and on, the overall gist is that I got offended in seeing what other people claim as “real” India, because that India was not part of my reality. Sure, I saw that when travelling from one place to another, saw that on news, read about that in the newspaper; but I was at a very safe distance from all of that.</p>

<p>These days, I try to not get offended when people say India has problem X or problem Y, because I realise I am living inside a cocoon where all of my needs are met, and one of the most serious issues my country is facing right now is <strike>witch-hunting </strike> nabbing the “drug mafia” amongst the Bollywood celebrities who allegedly murdered an actor by giving CBD oil (The absurdity of all this is unfathomable)</p>

<p>I mention all of this, because whenever I read posts which show India in some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24552047">bad light</a>, there is always someone somewhere who gives anecdotes of how that is not true.</p>

<p>Here are some facts: we have a culture of <strong>extreme signalling</strong>. Signalling is the core building block of our society, most people don’t even realise that how big we are into signalling until they study about “signalling” as a phenomena and start becoming conscious of it. You notice that in the way your parents view you, how you make choices, how people around you make choices.</p>

<p>Of course, people will say “that is not an Indian problem, signalling is just a social construct and literally everyone does that on some level”. I am not denying not that, the very fact that I am writing this post is a kind of signalling I am doing.</p>

<p>It is well known fact that India is one of the densest countries on our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-density?time=2017">planet</a>, extreme siginalling is just one of the consequences of the myriad social problems created by high population density. Signalling in an high density environment is now ever more important as the people you interact or the people who notice your activities/accomplishments are multiples higher than in any other place on the planet.</p>

<p>We people like the wear the “tightly knit society” as badge of honour, let me tell you this “tightly knit society” has done more harm than good. We Indian people have no India of the amount of mental harassment we all go through, because that is just normalized as being just phases of “life”.</p>

<p>The prevalence of extreme signalling brews the classic and infamous <em>herd mentality</em> in our minds. In middle school children have dreams to become a Pilot in the airforce, or maybe a Police officer, or maybe a Opera Singer ! But by the time of high school, everyone is just either on road to become an Engineer, a Doctor, a Lawyer, a Chartered Accountant …. or a <strong>failure</strong>. This may seem harsh but that’s how most of the society operates here in India.</p>

<p>Now once your track is chosen for you (or fortunately, if you get to choose the track), you have some set goals you “must” achieve because they guarantee monetary success with an extremely high probability. If you are Engineer, you need to get into IIT. If you are a Doctor, you need to get into AIIMS. If you are doing management, you need to get into IIM.</p>

<p>Now, if you are an Engineer then your success criteria is not just any IIT, it should be one of the top ones (Bombay, Delhi, Kharagpur, Roorkee) and not just any branch in IIT, it should be <em>Computer Science</em>. Because that’s how you get <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/dec/04/five-iitians-bag-pay-packages-of-over-rs-15-crore-2071120.html">Rs 1.5 crore “packages” (equivalent to 200K USD)</a>.</p>

<p>You can give me examples of how not all IIT toppers choose “Computer Science”, but that’s not the point, for the vast majority of people (more than a million), the success criteria is: getting Computer Science at IIT Bombay.</p>

<p>As might know (or have guessed) getting a seat in IIT Bombay is next to impossible for more than 99% people giving IIT, so they “lower” their goal by aiming for other IITs, but “Computer Science” remains the top priority.</p>

<h3 id="the-jugaad-mentality">The Jugaad mentality</h3>
<p>Hacking systems is so ingrained in our society that we have a word for it: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad">Jugaad</a>. The whole scene with Hacktoberfest is just a demo of our Jugaad skills. Wait till you find out that <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/inside-indias-fake-research-paper-shops-pay-publish-profit-5265402">most of the research papers</a> published in India are <a href="https://scroll.in/article/908230/indian-academics-lead-the-world-in-publishing-in-fake-journals-tarring-the-whole-education-sector">fake</a>. Even the orthodontist I was visiting for my checkup turned out to be fake and had forged her certificates (as told by by one other dentist).</p>

<p>The coaching industry actively promotes “cracking” these exams, and I am so tired writing on that topic that I do not want to write more about it here. Refer to my post on this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coding-interviewing-coaching-industry-prologue-pulkit-sharma?articleId=6662006663559684097">here</a>. Some children start joining these coaching classes from as low as 5th grade! (apart from doing regular school), just to be able to “crack” the IITs after 7-8 years !</p>

<p>Now how is coaching industry a Jugaad ? Simply because from the point of view of IITs, attending regular school should be enough to prep you for the exams (I think). These coaching industries have made the process significantly harder as you can’t even hope of getting a low tier IIT without attending the coaching classes.</p>

<p>The IIT coaching industry is minting fat cheques out of this entire situation, look at these ads on the front page of the news paper. These ads create a vicious cycle by reinforcing the core “signalling” construct of our society.</p>

<p><img src="https://pulkitsharma07.github.io/assets/hacktober/paper_3.png" alt="hn-comment"></p>

<p>Do not quote me on this, but I think the IIT coaching industries make more <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/education/news/iits-iisc-say-that-patchy-funding-is-delaying-institute-of-eminence-plans/articleshow/72103538.cms">money than the IITs</a> themselves. I understand the purpose of IITs is not to directly generate money, but if it would have more resources they can probably improve the infrastructure, employ better professors and improve the overall level of education.</p>

<h3 id="computer-science-education-in-india">Computer Science Education in India</h3>
<p>For vast majority of engineers in India, Computer Science is  one of the subjects you study in order to succeed in life. Just like you study Chemistry, you “study” Computer Science and once you learn all the “concepts”, you get a good job. (Apologies for so many quoted words, I can’t help putting them in quotes because they carry so much weight for me).</p>

<p>When people are in an average Indian college and if they are are lucky, information about some permutation/combination of the following is spread amongst the …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Volumetric Live Video</h2>
<p>This is the second part of the series <a href="https://antmedia.io/volumetric-video-container-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spaceport Volumetric Video Container</a>. We pick up the containers back from the place where we created and read. In this tutorial, we’re going to walk you how to play <strong>Spaceport Volumetric Live Video</strong> using Unity. Don’t worry, it’s surprisingly easy to get the containers from the server and decode <strong>volumetric video</strong>, especially when controlling the <strong>container</strong> structure as we want.</p>
<h2>Modifying The Volumetric Video Container</h2>
<p>Let’s start by dividing the large <strong>volumetric container</strong> as many smaller containers that are broken up into ~10 frame increments(you can specify this size as you wish). We only need to buffer frames seconds in advance on the <strong>Unity App</strong> side as we divided the container up in this way. Normally, our CreateContainer() function is programmed to generate a single <strong>.space</strong> file. We will add one condition like the following figure.<br>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-18-1024x340.png" alt="spaceport volumetric video" width="1024" height="340" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-18-1024x340.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-18-300x100.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-18-768x255.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-18-1536x510.png 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-18-600x199.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-18.png 1964w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How To Play Spaceport Volumetric Live Video In Unity 1"><br>
In the old version, a single container was containing one metadata, now each small container can hold its own metadata. The metadata is served first and it tells the client where to find each frame start positions. <span>Navigate to the directory of the Spaceport Container file and run the following command:</span></p>
<pre> g++ -I ~/local/include -L ~/local/lib -o output ObjContainer.cpp 10 -ldracoenc -lboost_serialization</pre>
<p>Each new container looks like the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/output1-1024x519.png" alt="Inside of New Volumetric Video Container" width="750" height="380" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/output1-1024x519.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/output1-300x152.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/output1-768x389.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/output1-600x304.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/output1.png 1524w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="How To Play Spaceport Volumetric Live Video In Unity 2"></p>
<p>Congratulations! You are done with the hard part, now you have simple containers that can be served over HTTP to watch Volumetric Live Video. Let’s set up a simple HTTP server to test it. I used NodeJs / <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">http-server</a> but you can create it however you want.</p>
<h2>Getting Containers From HTTP Server</h2>
<p>We only require a simpler request/response pair. Nowadays, the most common way to solve this problem is to utilize the “Networking” library in Unity.<span>&nbsp;We only need to call the function “<code>SendWebRequest()</code>”&nbsp; to get a volumetric container one by one, until we get a request error.</span> Note that web requests are typically done asynchronously, so Unity’s web request system returns a “yield” instruction.&nbsp;You have to wait until the request is completed. Now you’re done with making requests over <strong>http-server</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-1024x759.png" alt="ant media server spaceport" width="1024" height="759" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-1024x759.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-300x222.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-768x570.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-1536x1139.png 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame-600x445.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/unity-get-frame.png 1796w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How To Play Spaceport Volumetric Live Video In Unity 3"></p>
<p>Do you remember how we read Volumetric Containers in the previous article? There are only a few fundamental differences between the two structures. We’ll do the same thing but this time, all the files will have the own <strong>metadata</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1024x720.png" alt="Volumetric Video ant media server" width="1024" height="720" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1024x720.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-300x211.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-768x540.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1536x1080.png 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-600x422.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16.png 1610w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How To Play Spaceport Volumetric Live Video In Unity 4"></p>
<p><span>Now let’s turn our eyes to the decoder.</span> We reconstruct the objects for each frame. As above, we will use <strong>MemoryStream</strong> class instead of <strong>BinaryReader.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-1024x777.png" alt="Volumetric Live Video spaceport" width="1024" height="777" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-1024x777.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-300x228.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-768x583.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-1536x1166.png 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1-600x455.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carbon-16-1.png 1544w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="How To Play Spaceport Volumetric Live Video In Unity 5"></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This article provides an overview of how to divide and handle volumetric video containers. That’s all folks, as we can see, we can change the container structure as we want and then reconstruct it for our purpose. We hope this article gave you some ideas for watching the live volumetric video. <span>If you have any questions or feedback don’t hesitate to write your thoughts.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>There are a few things you need to consider when you’re looking to buy a good dumb TV. Let’s take a closer look at each of them.</p><h3>Screen size</h3><p>The biggest challenge you will face when you’re looking for a good dumb TV is getting a good screen size. You will soon realize that there are not a lot of dumb TVs that come in the latest size standards for home entertainment.</p><p>A lot of dumb TVs only have 30-40-inch screens. If this size works for you, then you are in luck. However, in today’s standards, 30-40 inches is not enough screen real estate.</p><p>You may want to find something with at least a 50-inch screen. The good news is that they do exist and, according to our research, you can even go up to 65 inches.</p><p><strong>If you’re in hurry, here’s our recommendations</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Image</th><th>Product</th><th>Features</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="product-723"><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198XNF6U?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419R0211LBL.jpg" data-src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419R0211LBL.jpg" alt="Sceptre 65 Inches 4K UHD LED TV"></a></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198XNF6U?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sceptre 65 Inches 4K UHD LED TV</a></td><td><div><ul><li>Bright LED display and sharp contrast</li><li>65-inch 4K UHD, HDR and MEMC120</li><li>HDMI ports, component ports, optical and line audio outputs</li></ul></div></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198XNF6U?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-style="">Check Price On Amazon</a></td></tr><tr id="product-724"><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW4M13Y?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51S-2IYjHFL.jpg" data-src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51S-2IYjHFL.jpg" alt="Sceptre 50"></a></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW4M13Y?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sceptre 50″ 4K UHD Ultra Slim LED TV</a></td><td><div><ul><li>50-inch screen that supports 4K UHD</li><li>Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) to stream videos from a smartphone</li><li>Stunning colors and image contrast</li></ul></div></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW4M13Y?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-style="">Check Price On Amazon</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Input ports</h3><p>Another thing that turns a regular dumb TV into a good dumb TV is the number of input ports it has. Since your dumb TV relies on external devices for display content, you will want several ports to ensure that you can plug in all your devices.</p><p>Having several input ports will allow you to switch between devices without having to physically unplug and plug them. Reaching behind your TV to do this can be very inconvenient.</p><p>HDMI ports are what most external devices today use. You will want at least 3 HDMI ports on your dumb TV. Having more HDMI ports will be better, especially if you’re thinking about getting a few more external devices.</p><h3>Monitors</h3><p>When looking for a good dumb TV, people often make the mistake of looking in the monitor category. A monitor may work for you, but there are a couple of reasons why they may not work as well as a TV.</p><p><a href="https://pointerclicker.com/how-to-clean-a-matte-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monitor displays</a> are relatively darker than TV displays. This is because monitors are designed for people who sit up close.</p><p>It may not be a problem when you’re watching a movie in a dark room. If you watch with the windows open during the day, however, your monitor won’t be able to produce enough brightness to give you pleasant viewing experience.</p><p>Monitors also do not come with a TV tuner. This will be a problem if you’re thinking about watching local channels.</p><h2><span id="Does_a_great_dumb_TV_exist_in_2020">Does a great dumb TV exist in 2020?</span></h2><p>The short answer is yes. Although smart TVs are more popular, there are still a few great dumb TVs being manufactured.</p><p>You can visit your local electronic shop or search for one online. Below are some of our dumb TV recommendations.</p><h2><span id="Editors_recommendations">Editor’s recommendations</span></h2><p>We’ve put together a shortlist of our top dumb TV picks.

You won’t be needing additional ports with this TV.</p><h2><span id="What_is_the_dumb_TV">What is the dumb TV?</span></h2><p>When you walk through the video section in an electronic shop, you’re going to find an array of different TVs. Most of the newer ones you will have large high definition screens. And almost all of them are going to be smart TVs.</p><p>Smart TVs have taken over the home entertainment industry by storm. To the point where it has become more difficult to find one that does not have smart features. TVs lacking smart features are also called dumb TVs.</p><p>Dumb TVs are display screens with a built-in TV tuner. They also come with different input ports where you can input video information from an HDTV antenna, Blu-ray player, etc. The most common input ports are HDMI and AV.</p><p>What makes a dumb TV “dumb”? The difference between a dumb TV and a smart TV is that the former does not come with an operating system. It relies on external devices to convert data into video information that it can display.</p><p>All televisions that were manufactured before the invention of smart TVs are dumb TVs. Dumb TVs are still being manufactured today for various reasons, although they are less popular.</p><p>Smart TVs, on the other hand, are more like smartphones or computers. They come with an operating system and a handful of pre-installed apps. You can connect them directly to the internet and stream videos on YouTube, Netflix, and other popular platforms.</p><h2><span id="Why_do_people_need_a_dumb_TV_without_smart_features">Why do people need a dumb TV without smart features?</span></h2><p>As you learn more about what smart TVs offer, you may start to wonder why anyone would want to settle for a dumb TV. Smart TVs are more convenient, and they offer so many useful features.</p><p>While the popularity of smart TV increases, there are quite a few people who still prefer dumb TVs. There are a few reasons why you might opt to get a dumb TV. Let’s take a closer look at each of those reasons in more detail.</p><h3>Security and privacy</h3><p>When it comes to the internet, security and privacy are huge topics. There have been countless horror stories that resulted from having personal devices connected to the internet. If you’re connected, there is always going to be some sort of risk.</p><p>Smart TVs are said to be one of the most vulnerable to hacking and data theft. The FBI has even issued a warning of the risks.</p><p>One of the reasons for this is that smart TVs use automatic content recognition or ACR. ACR gathers information about what you watch and sends it back to the manufacturer. With this information, more relative ads can be shown when you’re browsing for something to watch.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are times when a third party receives the information captured by ACR. These third parties can do whatever they want with that information.</p><p>Many newer smart TVs also come with webcams and microphones. These can be used by hackers to spy on you while you’re watching your favorite show.</p><p>Many people are aware of the dangers of this. This is one of the main reasons there are still quite a few people who opt to get dumb TVs instead of TVs with smart features.</p><h3>Better set-top and stick options</h3><p>Another reason why people purchase dumb TVs is that they prefer to use other TV stick and set-top devices. These devices don’t cost a lot of money and they often work better than smart TVs.</p><p>A few of the more popular ones are the <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XLWML4?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Roku Streaming Stick+" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B075XLWML4" data-aawp-product-title="Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device with Long-range Wireless and Voice Remote with TV Controls  updated for 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true">Roku Streaming Stick+</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XLWML4?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Roku Streaming Stick+" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B075XLWML4" data-aawp-product-title="Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device with Long-range Wireless and Voice Remote with TV Controls  updated for 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true"><span></span></a></span>, <span><span>No products found.</span></span>, <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0791TX5P5?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Amazon Fire TV Stick" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B0791TX5P5" data-aawp-product-title="Fire TV Stick streaming media player with Alexa built in includes Alexa Voice Remote HD easy set-up released 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true">Amazon Fire TV Stick</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0791TX5P5?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Amazon Fire TV Stick" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B0791TX5P5" data-aawp-product-title="Fire TV Stick streaming media player with Alexa built in includes Alexa Voice Remote HD easy set-up released 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true"><span></span></a></span>, and <span><span>No products found.</span></span>. There are many more options in the market to choose from.</p><p>These devices connect to your WI-FI and allow you to stream content on popular platforms such as Netflix and YouTube.</p><p>All these devices have seamless UI’s and tons of different apps and features. They also come with <a href="https://pointerclicker.com/presentation-pointers-lcd-tv-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remote controls</a> that support voice commands.</p><p>One feature many people find very useful in these devices is the casting feature. It allows you to use your TV as a larger display for your smartphone. You can play videos, view images, and browse the web on your smartphone and have it cast onto your TV.</p><p>You should also remember that technology is advancing a lot quicker than ever before. Your brand-new smart TV will be outdated in just a couple of years. The only way you’re going to be able to keep up with new features and security fixes is to buy a new TV.</p><p>You won’t need to replace your dumb TV to stay updated. All you need to do is purchase the latest stick or set-top device. You can get brand-new ones that already come with voice control for an affordable price.</p><p>Check out this video to learn more about stick and set-top devices.</p><div title="4K Streaming Device Round Up 2019: Apple TV vs Chromecast vs Roku vs Fire TV, Which is best for you?"><div id="WYL_H2Bq9X3a41A"><div id="lyte_H2Bq9X3a41A" data-src="https://pointerclicker.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FH2Bq9X3a41A%2Fhqdefault.jpg"><div><p>4K Streaming Device Round Up 2019: Apple TV vs Chromecast vs Roku vs Fire TV, Which is best for you?</p></div></div></div></div><h3>Interface issues on smart TVs</h3><p>When you use your smartphone or computer, you have two main input sources: pointing and typing. You don’t have either of those in a smart TV interface.</p><p>For the most part, you will use your TV’s remote to click through menus and an onscreen keyboard for typing. It will take you quite a number of button presses to type something into your TV’s search service.</p><p>Some smart TVs also come with poorly designed interfaces. It will take a lot of time trying to navigate around the interface.</p><p>On the other hand, the interfaces that come with newer sticks and set-box devices are more seamless. They also include voice commands and many support keyboard input from your smartphone.</p><h3>Unreliable apps on smart TVs</h3><p>App developers today need to work harder when it comes to compatibility. They need to make sure apps work well with smartphones, browsers, stick and set-top devices, smart TVs and more. Unfortunately, smart TVs are often the last priority.</p><p>This leaves smart TVs with unreliable apps that may crash or freeze. Older smart TVs may also not be compatible with app updates.</p><h2><span id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2><p>Although smart TVs are the most popular choice, there are still a few reasons why you might opt to get a dumb TV. The good news is that there are still quite a few of them being manufactured.</p><p>It may be more challenging to find a good dumb TV, but there’s a good chance a few of them are being sold at your nearest electronics shop.

<p><em>Merlin Sheldrake, 32, earned his Ph.D. in tropical ecology at the University of Cambridge for his research into underground fungal networks in the tropical forests of Panama. Since then, he has not lost his fascination for them. He is the author of "Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds and Shape Our Futures," which was published in early September.</em></p>


<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Dr. Sheldrake, we are here in London's Hampstead Heath. This place, you write in your book, means more to you than any other. Why is that?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;I grew up here. This is where I learned to walk. Later, I climbed trees here, and still later, I had parties with friends. And my interest in nature has been incubated by this place.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>Your interest in nature in general, or fungi in particular?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:&nbsp;</strong>Both. I've always been particularly interested in how things transform, how they grow and decompose. I was amazed how piles of leaves disappear over time. How did this transformation come about without me being able to see anything? Composting, I understood, is largely the work of fungi.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>For most people, nature is primarily made up of plants and animals. What role do fungi play in between those two realms?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:&nbsp;</strong>Fungi are of enormous importance. The basic principle of ecology is the relationships between organisms - and fungi form connections between organisms and so embody this idea.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>If fungi are so important, why don’t we see them all over the place?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, fungi are everywhere. Just take this leaf: Between tens and hundreds of species of fungi live on and in it. No plant has ever been found in nature which does not have fungi in its leaves and in its shoots. Or take the roots of the grass we are walking on, the rotting twigs, the soil under our feet: There are fungi everywhere. You have yeast all over your body, in the lining of your ears, in your nostrils. Even in the air: At this moment, you are breathing fungi. Fifty million tons of fungal spores are floating in the atmosphere, the largest source of living particles in the air. And they change the weather by causing water droplets to form.</p>
</div>


<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>If fungi are so ubiquitous, why we know so little about them?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;There are many reasons. The most obvious one is access. The fungus we see is nothing more than the fruit of the organism itself. The mycelium network that belongs to it is buried in the ground. It is as if we only saw acorns for one moment every year, but we couldn't see the magnificent oak trees.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Do even scientists underestimate the importance of fungi?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;They did so for a long time, at least. Until the 1960s, fungi were thought to be plants. Only then did they gain taxonomical independence. The new sequencing techniques have changed that. Today, we can read the DNA in every teaspoon of soil and find out who is there.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>And? What does one find?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;The kingdom of fungi is vast. There are six times more species of fungi than of plants, and only 6 to 8 percent of them have even been described. We still know so little! ! Just one thing is clear: There are many ways to be a fungus.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Is perhaps the lack of appreciation for fungi because of the fact that they are not very nutritious and often even poisonous?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Many people think like that. But in fact, many mushrooms contain important minerals and they have a high content of antioxidants. They produce an amazing variety of substances that affect cancer, viruses or our immune system. And mushrooms are high in protein. Truffles are a good example of an edible fungus. After all, they want to be eaten. Truffles sit deep in the ground where no wind can spread their spores. They attract animals with a very subtle mixture of odors, so that these animals then eat them and spread their spores.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Some mushrooms lure us with substances that have a direct effect on our consciousness ...</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, about 200 fungal species contain psilocybin, a substance that people have been interested in because of its strong psychedelic effects.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Such mushrooms cause hallucination and change the way we think. How do mushrooms benefit from making psychedelic drugs for humans?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;We don’t know. The first mushrooms to make psilocybin lived 75 million years ago, long before humans arose. But the receptors that this substance binds to can also be found in many animals. Does psilocybin change the behavior of certain insects in a way that induces them to spread fungal spores? Or do they change the behavior of insects in a way that deters them from eating the mushrooms?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Have you personally tried the effects of psychedelic mushrooms?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, under their influence I realized that most of my consciousness was unknown to me. It was as if I had spent my life in a garden until then, and now I suddenly discovered that this garden has a gate through which I can enter a strange and wonderful forest, that was largely unknown to me.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Does the gate disappear once the effects of psilocybin fade away?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Not necessarily. Once you know that this forest exists, it is much easier to find your way into it.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;You even took part in a scientific study.</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, though it was LSD tested in that study. But both substances have similar effects. Among other things, it was to be examined whether LSD promotes creativity. Each participant had to name a problem they were currently working on and, under the influence of LSD, &nbsp;we were to try to solve that problem.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;And?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp; I found the effects of LSD very helpful in allowing me to approach questions from new angles and imagine the relationships between plant and fungus from different points of view.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;You attribute cognitive abilities to fungi. What makes you think so?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;I've been thinking about this for a while. I'm interested in the way fungi perceive their environment and how they react to it. Information is continuously flowing through their decentralized bodies.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;What do fungi perceive?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Most importantly, they have extremely diverse chemical sensors. A fungus can be seen as a large, chemically sensitive membrane, so to speak, as one big olfactory epithelium. But many mushrooms can also perceive light and they are sensitive to gravity, to changes in temperature and to changes in pressure.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;So the fungi under our feet can sense that we are here?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong> Some fungi would detect the pressure of our steps, yes. And now the question is, how do they process all this information without a brain and how do they translate it into behavior, into action?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Action? Behavior? What do fungi do?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Fungi are quite active. Take hunting, for example.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Excuse me? Mushrooms can hunt?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. When food becomes scarce, some fungi can switch to a hunting mode. They build traps consisting of sticky loops or poisonous droplets. And with special substances, they lure nematodes into these traps.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Is this really "behavior" of the kind we see in animals?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Well, we can run away from danger, fungi have to face it. Therefore, they defend themselves with the help of chemicals, or they regenerate. But that doesn't change the fact that fungi do make decisions, just as we do.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;What kind of decisions?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Fungi have many options: where to grow, what to eat, what nutrients to transport, whether to withdraw and when to hunt nematodes. Each fungus forms thousands of so-called hyphae - tiny tubes that can either grow, divide or fuse.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;If fungi make decisions, are they also capable of solving problems?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely. For example, their growth follows very efficient navigation algorithms. There are various experiments in which fungi very rapidly found the shortest route through a maze.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;If fungi are, as you claim, complex information processing networks, are they essentially a kind of brain?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;No, I wouldn’t say that. But you are right: Neurons are tip-growing, electrically excitable, network-forming cells. And so are fungal cells.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;So mushrooms have a form of intelligence?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;It depends on your definition of "intelligence." In a broad sense, all organisms show intelligence, albeit to different degrees. The study of cognition and intelligence arose from the study of the human mind. This resulted in a very human- and brain-centered view. I find it refreshing to extend these considerations to organisms that do not have brains. We shouldn't use ourselves as the yardstick to judge everything else in this world.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Is there still a lot to discover in the field of fungi cognition?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:&nbsp;</strong>Absolutely. Little is known about how fungi coordinate their behavior. We don't know the mechanisms by which they pass signals around. We've not fully understood the basic biology of mycelial growth.</p>

            	<h3>Where our economy is, for the young response II.</h3>
            	
            	<p>
I don't even no where to start here. Since I have other things I wish to
spend my limited time with I'll try to be brief. For those who may have
not read the original Hacker News "Where our economy is, for the young."
The author outlines essentially that young lives are not unique and as
bad to them alone compared to priors. I would like to expand on that
theme.
               </p>

					<p>
First I've been essentially unemployed since 2009. I have never owned a
home, new car, boat you have to be crazy! I have an associated degree and
more college classes under my belt then most graduates with a four year
degree. I'm not young for those of you would like know and classified
as more like a grandpa.
					</p>

					<p>
It never ceases to amaze me when young people today say they are struggling
like no other generation. Where are you getting your history from, I would
say you have none. Which is a shame because if you would just look up to
view some pictures of man-kinds existence you will find at this time in history
that most of the world is doing pretty good. Do you people know what famine
is? Food production for most of history was erratic and whole populations
would die of starvation during winter. Have you ever seen pictures of the
slums in NYC in the early 19th century? There was an Hacker News entry to
show you. How about war, go look if you can find them pictures during WWII
of the piles of dead naked Jews. Men, women, children in a twisted mass of
rotting flesh. Tell them how hard your life is.
					</p>

					<p>
Now I have not even given you any of my experiences when young, here are
just a couple. In high school some of my classmates were so poor that one
girl I know wore the same shirt and pants for most of the year. I had one
friend that I would visit on occasion. He lived in a old house with I
would say 6 to 8 other siblings. Most of the windows had no panes. The
house was heated by only a wood stove and I'm sure they maybe had an electric
washing machine, but no drier. He was pretty much always dirty and maybe
got to bathe once a week or so. I use to work down the street in a berry
field from his house during the summer, where bums from the city were brought
out to also work with me. I was in my early teens. They paid the bums essential
with booze and most were drunk by noon. You should have seen the shacks some
would stay in for a few days. There was no electricity, running water, and
the bed was maybe some straw on a dirt floor. Everyone shared the couple of
outhouses on the property. That was the bathroom. A hole in the ground with
some boards around it, wash your hands, that's a joke.
					</p>

					<p>
Life is hard for most and history shows it is not unique for the current
generation. Go look it up! You have a wonderful Internet to find out.
            	</p>

	<div>
	
<p>There probably have been millions of articles written about the Apple of Tim Cook and how it differs from the Apple of Steve Jobs. I’ve always been hesitant to add to that.</p>



<p>Having worked at Apple for 12 years under Steve and 8 years under Tim, that gives me plenty of exposure to both eras. I’ll start with a quick review of the <strong>big things</strong> that people generally agree Apple misses from the loss of Steve before getting to the <strong>little things</strong>.</p>



<h3>The big things Apple misses</h3>



<p>After Steve died, the majority of pundits seemed to predict some level of doom for Apple, as if Steve were personally responsible for the entirety of every Apple product. It was as if he were the sole person making every decision at Apple. The second most common thing mentioned is the loss of Steve’s relentless curation of Apple products. It was argued that Steve had once-in a lifetime skills in these two categories.</p>



<p>This may be true, but it must be recognized than Apple has enjoyed great financial success under Tim Cook and also product success with Apple Watch and AirPods specifically. To balance it out, there were also duds like HomePod, neglect of the Mac, and a decline in software quality. But you could pluck similar things from the era when Steve was in charge.</p>



<figure><img src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-shot-2012-01-28-at-6-28-23-pm.png" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-shot-2012-01-28-at-6-28-23-pm.png 669w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-shot-2012-01-28-at-6-28-23-pm-295x300.png 295w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/screen-shot-2012-01-28-at-6-28-23-pm-266x270.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px"></figure>



<h3>The little things Apple misses</h3>



<p>What interests me the most is the little things Apple misses. Just like Apple used to be famous for the clever little touches they added to their products, Steve had many little facets to his personality. Each one may not be significant on its own, but together, I think they add up to a huge loss.</p>



<h4>Giddy excitement</h4>



<p>Steve had an infectious excitement that we felt working at Apple and that people couldn’t help but notice at product introduction events. </p>



<p>Seeing him around campus, he was either deep in thought—possibly talking with Jony Ive or another confidant—or often with a grin on his face. But he always had a spring in his step, even close to the end. He felt like a little kid in an adult body. If you were having a down day, it was hard not to be uplifted by the sight of your CEO practically skipping down the halls.</p>



<figure><img src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-300x169.jpg 300w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-768x432.jpg 768w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-480x270.jpg 480w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316-850x478.jpg 850w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/getty_128349414_2000133320009280124_274316.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Although I don’t question that Tim is excited about Apple, you just don’t feel it. He comes across far too rehearsed. Steve’s combination of being very articulate, possessing great presentation skills, and this giddy excitement made you want to feel the same excitement he did about the products. </p>



<h4>Technical prowess</h4>



<p>Steve was never considered to be much of an engineer, but he could speak engineer language and understood the smallest of technical details. Even though he would motivate and push engineers to do the impossible, he also understood what was currently possible. How else would you know what’s impossible to demand? 🙂</p>



<p>Steve spent his life around engineers and artists at both Pixar and Apple. Tim simply does not have that background so you can’t criticize him for lacking in it. Nonetheless, having a CEO of a tech company be very highly technically savvy is a huge win.</p>



<h4>Two peas in a pod</h4>



<p>It’s cliché to say, but Steve and Jony Ive were definitely greater than the sum of their parts. By losing Steve, we also lost a great deal of Jony as well. I don’t know Jony or much about him, but I feel like he never fully recovered from Steve’s death.</p>



<p>I would go to lunch fairly late every day and would inevitably see Jony and Steve having lunch and immersed in conversation. I’d often see them walking and talking together. They were joined at the hip. I typically would see him alone—on his way somewhere—or with Jony.</p>



<figure><img src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-300x169.jpg 300w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-768x432.jpg 768w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-480x270.jpg 480w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203-850x478.jpg 850w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/steve-jobs-jony-ive_41203.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I hate to criticize such a close friend of Steve’s but the decline in Apple software quality is pretty closely aligned with Jony taking ownership of it in addition to his usual hardware duties. Without Steve to balance him out, he was just out of his league.</p>



<p>iOS 7 was one of Jony’s first software projects, widely regarded as a train wreck which took several years to fix. You’ll often hear the phrase “this would never have happened under Steve” and in this case, I think it’s true. Steve was good at reeling things in and stripping them down and that’s a huge loss.</p>



<h4>Belief and respect</h4>



<p>Before working at Apple, I was used to working for relatively uninspiring and often clueless CEOs. One thing that I found refreshing at Apple was that—even though people had their differences—people respected Steve and believed in the direction he was taking the company.</p>



<p>This had a profound affect inside Apple. If Steve was pushing the company in a specific direction combined with that respect, it was much easier to do your day-to-day job. Most jobs involve a lot of smaller decisions that would never rise to Steve’s level. But because we knew the path we were on, it was easy to make these smaller decisions ourselves.</p>



<p>In a sentence, we understood the mission we were on and we respected the messenger.</p>



<h4>Visibility</h4>



<p>I’ve worked at companies with 200 employees where we’d see the CEO twice a year at company meetings. He was holed up in his office or meeting with his directs all the time—or maybe playing golf—and never interacted with anyone else.</p>



<p>I worked at Infinite Loop for 19 years, with 12 of those under Steve. For such a large company, Steve was a routine presence around the company. He was often walking in the inner quad area of the campus, in the hallways, and would drop in frequently on projects important to him. He ate in the café every day as far as I can tell.</p>



<p>It’s easy to feel like there’s no one steering the ship if you never see the captain, so his frequent presence was very comforting. Even saying hi to him felt like an acknowledgment that you were a part of what everyone was working towards.</p>



<h4>Culling</h4>



<p>You’ll sometimes hear stories about how Steve is this awful tyrant and how he cruelly disassembled a project someone was working on during a presentation. All these stories have one thing in common: they come from <em>former</em> Apple employees.</p>



<p>Now, you could argue that a current employee would never talk, but I think a disgruntled one would talk anonymously at least. There are many cases of this.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ll-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ll-1.jpg 417w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ll-1-300x195.jpg 300w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ll-1-415x270.jpg 415w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px"></figure></div>



<p>I’m calling this trait “culling” because Steve was not only very direct, he was seeing how you handled the pressure. If what you were demoing to him was crappy, he would tell you it’s shit. Now, some people would take great offense at that, typically those with larger egos, while others see it as just part of the making great products.</p>



<p>Over time, I think this led to management and lead engineers being thick-skinned and willing to change when the CEO told them they were way off track. If you’ve worked in software, I think you can see the benefit of being able to take criticism.</p>



<p>Overall, I think it led to a stronger workforce that was less prone to petty politics or bad-mouthing others. Instead, people would criticize products, not people and that led to great people making great products.</p>



<h4>Hiring</h4>



<p>With a huge notable exception over his entire career— John Sculley—Steve really knew how to hire exceptional people. The talent pool that was inherited by the NeXT acquisition was phenomenal as well as hiring amazing people like Tim Cook.</p>



<p>I imagine a form of culling took place in a Steve interview as well. If you crumbled under difficult questions that might be highly critical of your current job, how could you survive at Apple?</p>



<h4>Public Presentations</h4>



<p>There’s general agreement that Steve was a great presenter, possibly one of the best ever. What is interesting to me is how that affected Apple employees. Certainly, having something you worked on or cared about demonstrated on a big stage with media present was a great feeling. But to have <em>Steve</em> be the presenter was an amazing feeling.</p>



<figure><img src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ap080115083034-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ap080115083034-1.jpg 800w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ap080115083034-1-300x205.jpg 300w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ap080115083034-1-768x524.jpg 768w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ap080115083034-1-396x270.jpg 396w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>FILE – In this Jan. 15, 2008, file photo, Apple CEO Steve Jobs holds up the new MacBook Air after giving the keynote address at the Apple MacWorld Conference in San Francisco. Apple on Wednesday, Oct. 5, 2011 said Jobs has died. He was 56. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)</figcaption></figure>



<p>When I worked on Mail in the very early days, we were generally in every keynote, primarily because there weren’t many apps on Mac OS X! But still, to have your work presented with the giddy excitement I mentioned previously was a great motivational factor.</p>



<h4>Internal presentations </h4>



<p>Only Apple employees saw these except for a few that leaked over the years. Employees would wait in line to see a his multi-hour communications meetings! How many can say that for their companies?</p>



<p>Even though Steve was a great marketer, these meetings were generally very straightforward and often very blunt. Not a lot of spin. Often a response would be “No. Next question!” rather than a drawn out politically savvy response.</p>



<p>Here’s one example of this. One employee got up to complain about his salary, feeling that Apple’s rising success—this was around 2005—was not reflected in his paycheck. Steve asked him “Do you have stock?” and he answered “Yes” and Steve answered with “Next Question!” </p>



<p>I’m sure he wasn’t the only one that felt like their salary could be higher but Steve’s response cut to the chase and people left thinking they had less to complain about. If we all work towards the success of the company and it’s reflected in the market, we had nothing to complain about.</p>



<p>And he was right.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>There are some big gaping holes left behind by Steve, but also quite a few smaller ones that add up to something significant. He is sorely missed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>Consider two graduating PhDs who are transitioning into industry. Both are incredibly busy finishing their research, writing their dissertation, and teaching. Both spend the same amount of time recruiting for industry roles - and both join the same company in a similar role. PhD #1, let’s call her Jane,  soon discovers she is being paid less than her peers for the same work and has a boss that won’t promote her. She’s forced to work doubly hard just to achieve parity with her co-workers, or else leave and start over somewhere new, wasting a year. PhD #2, let’s call her Joanne, in contrast, is happy with her job. She is paid similarly to her peers and has a clear path for growth at the company. What did Joanne do better?</p><p>We have now advised 71 PhDs to follow this second, better track and we understand what defines these trajectories. We hope this salary negotiation report educates similar individuals how to negotiate salary. The difference between these two individuals is not merit, nor is it about who interviewed better or does better work. The difference is in how they think and negotiate. Joanne understands that she is joining a business. Compensation and promotions are respectfully taken by her self-advocacy, not given by the company. Jane assumes that the company will take care of her once she proves herself and so does not ask for much at the beginning. Joanne sets expectations and gives feedback to her manager for a productive working relationship. This is a <em>virtuous</em> cycle: you ask and your manager sets the higher expectations that enable you to work upwards. Jane is reticent and does not want to damage relationships. This is a <em>vicious</em> cycle: you don’t ask and your manager doesn’t expect more, so you stagnate and it becomes even harder to advance. </p><p>This power of setting expectations is evident at the very beginning of your relationship with your employer, in the offer negotiation. You haven’t started work yet, but simply setting higher expectations from the outset enables you to get paid more and begins the positive, virtuous cycle. Here we quantify the impact of negotiating using Ralph by looking at the data from our first 71 PhD clients. Most of them came from computation-heavy PhDs and were transitioning into their first industry role in engineering or data science, or a research role in technology or quantitative finance. Our results reveal just how beneficial it can be to advocate for yourself, and how beneficial a Career Agent can be to advise you through this process of multiple offers and changes. Because while most people know they <em>should</em> negotiate, they don’t know how <em>far</em> to negotiate. Our data gives you insight into just how much you’re worth and how much room there is for offer changes. </p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_VkwwMuKsXVDkwaYZ/assets/KnTGkpeVnsGRSckK.jpg" alt="Tables.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_VkwwMuKsXVDkwaYZ/assets/uOGQqqzabfskEZzm.jpg" alt="Visualizations.jpg"></p><p><strong>High Level Results</strong></p><p>On average, our clients have increased their initial offer by 30% through negotiation using our insight and advising. This increase is calculated from changes in base salary, equity, and any annual, signing, or relocation bonus changes. This increase represents an average $75K more in the offer. As expected, having offers from multiple companies resulted in a larger increase from the baseline offer; however, even if clients only had an offer from a single company, they were still able to secure an average 20% increase from their initial offer. Having four offers resulted in a dramatic increase (56%) in the negotiated accepted offer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Negotiating You Are Likely Not Doing</strong></p><p>The majority of our clients (52%) changed their offer twice. This means they negotiated an increase once and then negotiated <strong>another</strong> increase. Usually this second change would occur after the company said no to any further changes. We were able to advise our clients to keep advocating for themselves and set initial expectations high, resulting in an average total increase of 39%.  When the offer changed once, it increased on average 18%. While the majority of this data comes from before COVID-19, we have advised 9 clients during COVID-19 with similar results. Our largest negotiated offer ever was achieved in March 2020 (<a href="https://www.withralph.com/blog/negotiated-a-143-offer-increase">the story here</a>). Our data from working with 70+ clients is clear: you can negotiate significant (and often multiple) increases in your offer if you know your true, competitive worth.&nbsp;</p><p>These results we hope debunk three common misconceptions that hinder a candidates' ability to negotiate a strong starting offer and set the stage for your upward growth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Misconception #1: Companies pay equally for the same role, level, and location in a new grad offer.</strong></p><p>We have seen two candidates with the same role, level, company, and location have a $35,000 base salary difference. We have seen equity range by more than $900,000 in a 4-year package in public company offers. We have data for new grad Google offers that start as low as ~$180K/year and end as high as ~$550K/year.</p><p>Even independent of a company's intent, if you don't negotiate you will be paid unequally because the highest paid individuals are always negotiating. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. </p><p><strong>Misconception #2: Interviewing with one company at a time is ok.</strong></p><p>The factor that affects your compensation the most is having multiple offers at the same time. Companies are a business. They will pay what they have to, not what they can. Our data shows having two offers increases your compensation by 5% and 4 offers increases your compensation by 56%.&nbsp;Companies interview candidates they have no intention of hiring just to see the market. So should you.</p><p><strong>Misconception #3: The company increased my offer so I’ve successfully negotiated.</strong></p><p>The majority of companies start with a low offer that leaves room for the candidate to negotiate. You should define successfully negotiating as getting a change <strong>after</strong> the company has said no. This is when the negotiation has actually begun. Otherwise, you have just asked and they conceded. There has been no negotiation. Our data shows that it is rare for an offer <strong>not</strong> to change after it is initially given: 90% of offers change from the initial offer after negotiating.</p><p>Almost all of the negotiation challenges PhDs face come from a lack of information and experience in industry. They don’t know what to expect, don’t have time to research, and assume whatever the company says is correct. As our data shows, there is room for negotiating multiple times to achieve a 30% or greater increase in your initial offer. We hope that by sharing our findings, we can help you educate and advocate for yourself and feel more confident to set high expectations even before you begin working at your company. Ask yourself the question: <strong>how do I know I am getting the best offer possible?</strong> You might be surprised to know that you are likely worth a lot more than the initial offer you receive. </p><p>--</p><p>To read more content: <a href="https://www.withralph.com/blog/where-to-start">start here</a></p><p><a href="https://www.withralph.com/blog/where-to-start"></a>To get updated with insights and learnings: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ralph-inc">Follow us on LinkedIn</a></p><p>Questions?

  <div><p>A lot of people write about chess as having an opening game, a middle game and an endgame. When you're playing is that what's going through your head?</p></div>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>Everyone has an opening repertoire. Many people just have one answer for each question they might reasonably expect their opponents to ask, which means they get very good at playing those answers, but equally become very predictable. There are some openings that are razor sharp and precise, and require knowing many 15-20 move variations in order to not get destroyed without the game even starting. I personally prefer openings that are more conceptual, which tend to be slightly more flexible, require much less knowledge, but arguably lead to somewhat more boring positions because of this.</p></div><div><p>So when the middlegame comes around, it's probably the kind of position I've played many times before. My strategy is usually to throw lots of pieces at their king and hope they die or I can win some material. Since I'm hoping to win at this point, I probably don't start thinking explicitly about the endgame until little suggestions of things that might become relevant start cropping up. So if pawns become isolated or doubled, or we end up with opposite colored bishops, or with a bishop on the same color square as most of our pawns, etc. If I can take one of these small positional advantages then I will, and then effectively "bank" it until the endgame actually comes around. Having one or more of these might make me more likely to head towards an endgame too.</p></div><div><p>Endgames are really hard and require a lot of technique that I don't really have. Fortunately most other people don't either, because you just don't get to play that many of them.</p></div><div><p>It probably is fair to say that I'm pretty aware of the opening/middlegame/endgame distinction. The opening is where I'm playing pretty much from memory, the middlegame is where I try and win, and the endgame is what I might head towards if I think I have a tangible advantage but try and avoid otherwise.</p></div>

          <div target="spkr-color-">
            <div><div>
  <div><p>So when you say that the endgame is what you might head towards - is the endgame not just the 'end of the game'? In which case won't most games have one? I know in the extremely amateur world of chess that I play in that most games come to a end where one side is actively checkmated. Is the endgame more unusual the higher up you go because a party will often resign when one side is in a dominant position?</p></div>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>I guess this is a question for statistics to answer properly, but my gut says that there possibly are fewer endgames in higher level play. If you lose a bishop or a knight without any obvious compensation, you will almost definitely resign on the spot. That said, it's probably also true that fewer boneheaded mistakes mean that neither side may have had much of a chance to win before the endgame. Overall I'm not sure!</p></div><div><p>But when I say "might head towards the endgame", I mean that I might deliberately choose to swap off pieces and accelerate progress towards the end of the game. If I'm a pawn up then trading off pieces is likely a huge win for me, because whilst a queen + 2 rooks + 1 bishop + 2 knights + 7 pawns v the same but 6 pawns is not a huge advantage, a bishop + 5 pawns v a bishop + 4 pawns probably is. Small material advantages are a much bigger deal in the endgame and leave less room for your opponent to generate compensation, so if you are slightly ahead then deliberately swapping off pieces is very important. Games can naturally meander towards an endgame where neither side is too psyched about their chances, or they can be forced.</p></div>

  <div><p>OK - that makes a lot of sense. You mentioned that you like to keep your openings of a 'conceptual' nature. What kind of concepts are you basing your openings on?</p></div>

          <div target="spkr-color-">
            <div><div>
  <div><p>Honestly I like openings that allow you to put your pieces on nice squares without thinking too hard, and then throw them all at your opponent's king. This is not a very sophisticated strategy, but it can be very hard to deal with if you aren't prepared (this is a good example). If you can get off the beaten track without doing anything too insane then you become much more familiar with the kinds of positions that result than your opponents, and develop a big box of patterns that have worked in the past.</p></div><div><p>This becomes somewhat less effective the higher level and more famous you get, as you start to become notorious for particular openings, and opponents can start preparing counters to them. This is where a degree of flexibility and unpredictability becomes invaluable, so that your opponents can't just put all their time into preparing for your Stonewall Dutch or Trompowsky, and also have to keep in mind that you might throw in a Benko Gambit or English Opening. It can be worthwhile playing these alternatives in high profile tournaments that will get their games into databases that your future opponents will see and get confused and upset by.</p></div>

  <div><p>1) Knights on the edge of the board don't attack many squares, knights in the centre of the board do. Because of their uniquely short range, they are the one piece that really benefits from being in the centre. A rook or bishop in the corner can still rake across the entire board, but a knight in the same spot looks pretty dumb.</p></div><div><p>2) If you want to attack the king (I do), you need to have your pieces attacking him and the squares around him! Even if you aren't planning on immediately checkmating anytime soon, you may be able to use threats against him to force smaller concessions or weaknesses.</p></div><div><p>3) An open file is one that isn't blocked by any of your pawns or pieces, and so if you put a rook at one end of it you'll be probing into some part of their position (hopefully a weak part!). This is the most direct way for your rooks to influence the game. As mentioned above, you don't necessarily need to be destroying or capturing anything in order for your pieces to be making your opponents' life awkward, so principles like "rooks on open files" will almost always be good things to at least look out for.</p></div>

  <div>
    
      
    
     <p><span size="1">(2 October 2020)</span></p><p>Thank you for your reports of Google warning about some pages on https://root.cern. Let me give you some background:</p>

<p>We have investigated virus scanner reports on some of ROOT’s binaries. The ROOT team has invested about 2.5 work days into this investigation: we took this seriously. On top of that, CERN IT’s security team has investigated this independently, and also invested a notable amount of working hours. We were able to create binaries that were diagnosed as infected, by building <code>hadd.exe</code> “from scratch”. We are convinced that these reports are false positives. We found out that upgrading the compiler works around the issue.</p>

<p>We could report this as false positive to the vendors whose virus scanner was reporting some of ROOT’s binaries. This has a high latency, especially when adding the latency between the virus scanner engines tweaking their patterns and Google removing root.cern from the list of flagged sites.</p>

<p>We could argue with Google. This does not seem like a fast track option either.</p>

<p>Instead, we have removed the file in question. We are upgrading the compiler on our build machines, which means that we cannot create Windows binaries for new patch releases of ROOT 6.20 and before: only newer ROOT versions can be built with the newest Visual Studio version.</p>

<p>Given the removal of the file reported by Google, we have asked Google for a review of root.cern. As <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044101#harmful_downloads">Google puts it</a>, “A review can take from a few days to a few weeks to complete.”</p>

<p>If you have ideas how to further improve the situation, please let us know by adding a comment below.</p>

<p>Please rest assured that we build our binaries on always up-to-date Windows installations running updated virus scanners, and that we do whatever we can to keep our binaries clean. This is the second time in 20+ years that ROOT files have been misdiagnosed as infected. To address this, we will scan binaries proactively on <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">VirusTotal</a> from here on, before offering them for download, to avoid false positives affecting us again.</p>

<p>Axel, for the ROOT team.</p>

This problem requires to put a thousand separator in its right position of the number. The question is how you can iterate on such a number to write a dot (.) in every possible position.</p><p id="049d">You’re given an integer and the output should be a string with the thousand separators. Dealing with strings can be cumbersome and a problem like this can take multiple lines of code while you can do it literally in one-liner code if you really compacted the variables. While regular expression (shortened regex) can be seen complicated, this is due to the unclear readability of it, I will try to explain solving this problem in a more readable approach and a more expressing way to be able to understand and solve such problem in just one line of code and if you need to get deeper, I’ve put some references at the bottom.</p><p id="685e">Regular expression is dealing with patterns so that you can manipulate strings. In this problem, it seems we want to find a pattern that exists across the string with multiple positions and then put dots in every possible position.</p><p id="ed4d">To know how it works, we need to know two things:</p><ul><li id="3e2f"><em>pattern </em>— the pattern we want to match</li><li id="87b7"><em>repl — </em>what should be replaced with</li></ul><h2 id="dbc9">Example 1</h2><p id="2f28">Say we have this simple example 1234. The separator here should exist between 1 and 2 like this 1.234</p><p id="92fb">Using regex can make us search for a pattern and when we match this pattern correctly we can use it to substitute/replace the number(s) we captured. Grouping is a basic concept of regex, you can use parenthesis to group specific characters.</p><p id="9450">The pattern here can be <strong>one digit followed by 3 digits</strong>. This can be converted to a regular expression pattern like this <code>(\d)(?=(\d{3}))</code></p><pre><span id="f806"><strong>(\d) </strong>one digit…</span><span id="d2b4"><strong>(?= </strong>followed by…</span><span id="909a"><strong>   (\d{3}) </strong>3 digits</span><span id="737e"><strong>)</strong></span></pre><p id="9312">The pattern here should match 1 in <strong>1</strong>234</p><p id="1f88">So now we have the pattern, what else should we do with that?</p><p id="244b">It seems we have captured two groups here, one digit and 3 digits .. we’re just interested in the first group so we should replace that digit (<strong>1 </strong>here) with itself followed by a dot so that we can see <strong>1.</strong>234. That’s why <em>repl </em>here equals <strong>\1. </strong>or <strong>\$1. </strong>depending on the language you use</p><p id="3abe">Let’s say we want the separator here to be a comma, not a dot, <em>repl </em>here should equal <strong>\1, </strong>and <strong>\$1,</strong></p><h2 id="3cb1">Example 2</h2><p id="338b">Let’s see a more complicated example: 123456789 so the expected output should be 123.456.789</p><p id="fe22">The pattern here is different from the previous example because if it’s the same, the grouping will be to these bold numbers <strong>123456</strong>789 because in each number is followed by 3 digits until you reach 789 (the last 3 digits). So how can we approach this solution to only group the numbers that we should replace each and add dots?</p><p id="ae4b">Here we should group the 3 digits in a right way; we want to <strong>capture one digit which is followed by one or more groups of 3 digits which are not followed by any more digits</strong>. Let’s convert that into a regular expression pattern: <code>(\d)(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))</code></p><pre><span id="fc30"><strong>(\d) </strong>capture one digit…</span><span id="d2e6"><strong>(?= </strong>which is followed by…</span><span id="1252"><strong>   (\d{3})+ </strong>one or more groups of 3 digits…</span><span id="3675"><strong>   (?!\d) </strong>which are not followed by any more digits</span><span id="99dc"><strong>)</strong></span></pre><p id="e594">With this pattern, the numbers highlighted will be matched 12<strong>3</strong>45<strong>6</strong>789. There you should replace both by each one plus a dot like this: 12<strong>3.</strong>45<strong>6.</strong>789</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

        <div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1601658998244" id="item-5f775f9b7e36cf63ac5e9f98"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-d26faa974e7c46179664"><div><p>Many years ago I was interviewing for a management job at a growing tech company. After a long day of meeting with engineers and product managers, I made it to the final boss, the VP of Engineering. He introduced himself, put his hands together at the fingertips, and said, "Tell me your top accomplishments for the last three and six months."</p><p>I froze up. It had been a very busy year. I’d worked on a wide variety of things. I stalled. "Hmm... Let me think about that." He quickly cut me off. “No. That's not a good answer. You should be able to answer that without hesitation. Communicating the value you bring to the organization is an important part of being a leader. My advice for you is to set a calendar reminder. Every three months write down the top achievements for your team and your personal ones."</p><p>I was not offered that job. But I appreciated the great advice! After the interview, I set a calendar reminder, and every quarter since that day I have written down my top accomplishments. It's a very helpful habit for reasons I describe below. Many things that help me succeed in my role as an engineering leader are simple habits, like that one. I developed a set of daily, weekly, quarterly and annual routines that I'll share in this post. Many were tips given to me by coworkers, some I read about in blogs and books.</p><p>These habits are all personal actions I would practice regardless of the type of project or team I’m working with. This is definitely not a comprehensive list of everything managers need to do to be effective. They’re just a few things I find helpful. Here are my habits:</p><p><strong>Identify Your Top Six Priorities</strong></p><p>I use a to-do list in<a href="https://evernote.com/"> <span>Evernote</span></a> to record all my pending tasks. During the day I’ll agree to do some work and add a task to the bottom of my to-do list. The list gets long during busy periods, so I prioritize it daily using the<a href="https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee"> <span>Ivy Lee Method</span></a>. Productivity consultant Ivy Lee recommended this method to Charles Schwab in 1918 as a way to help his company’s executives be more efficient. It’s very simple. At the end of work each day you rank your top six priorities in order of importance. When you start the next day, work on the tasks in priority order. That’s it! I typically set out to tackle three-to-six tasks per day, so the Ivy Lee number seems appropriate.</p><p><strong>Write and Share Daily Intentions</strong></p><p>Most software engineering teams start each day with a “standup” meeting where each member summarizes what they plan to focus on that day. The team I currently work on is distributed across US and EU time zones, so we do this asynchronously by writing that info into a Slack channel used for daily standup posts. I find it helpful to record my daily intentions as it motivates me to complete what I publicly said I’d do. Having those entries written down also helps me remember what I accomplished when I write my weekly status update.</p><p><strong>Keep an Emotional Journal</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic started I’ve been trying to keep closer tabs on my emotions. After experiencing strong feelings like stress, irritation, fear, anger, or excitement, I jot down a brief note about the emotion and situation in a notebook I keep on my desk. Recognizing and naming your feelings is an important part of building emotional intelligence. My daily entries are useful to reflect on when I write my weekly impact journal entry. They often describe the emotional roller coaster I experience while encountering setbacks, pitfalls, and small wins.</p><p><strong>Update My Calendar</strong></p><p>It’s important to start your week with a good plan. As a manager in a medium-sized company, I usually have 2 to 4 hours of meetings per day. Many of those are recurring like 1-on-1’s and weekly staff meetings. Others are ad-hoc project meetings that I need to prepare for in advance. I take a few minutes each Monday morning to look at the week ahead, canceling or declining meetings I don’t need to attend, and adding blocks of personal time for accomplishing the tasks on my “top six priorities” list. This helps me spend my time intentionally.</p><p><strong>Exercise</strong></p><p>Exercise is an important tool I use to manage stress. I’ve been going to the gym twice a week for years and doing the same simple workout. It’s such a regular habit that, after years of repetition, it requires no will power or deliberate effort on my part. It has been tricky adapting my exercise habits during the pandemic, but I’ve made do with jogging, YouTube yoga, and buying a bench and a few free weights for my basement. Whatever routine I follow must be so easy that I have no excuse not to do it. I also listen to things I enjoy while exercising like music, podcasts, and audiobooks as a rewarding motivator.</p><p><strong>Review Indicator Metrics</strong></p><p>In the seminal management book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884"><span>High Output Management</span></a>”, Andy Grove recommends establishing indicators to help you understand how you’re progressing towards your goals. Pursuing metrics blindly can cause unintended problems, so Grove recommends using “paired metrics” that show both the positive effects of your teams’ focus as well as the negative consequences. An example is pairing Jira velocity (quantity) with the bug rate (quality). I’ve managed infrastructure owning teams over the last few years, so I’ve tracked metrics like:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>new platform adoption %</p></li><li><p>weekly production incidents</p></li><li><p>off-hours paged while on-call</p></li><li><p>security tasks open past due date</p></li></ul><p>Every Friday morning I add a new column in my “indicator metrics” spreadsheet then record 10 metrics for the week. This process helps me model how work flows through the system, and allows me to see if the team made progress or was interrupted by reactive tasks. It also produces data I use to create charts showing trends like the percentage of customers migrated to the new platform over the last six months.</p><p><strong>Write in an Impact Journal</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>During an all-hands meeting, a VP at my company mentioned they keep a work journal where they wrote down the impact they made each week and how they felt about it. I started doing this and found it’s a very useful way to reflect. After starting his habit, you can scan the weekly wins you recorded every three months to remember the highlights from the quarter. Writing down your impact is doubly useful because you can immediately copy-paste it into your weekly status report. I’ve also found it interesting to read through my emotions from the last three and six months. When I read about my greatest worries and fears months after a stressful situation has been resolved, it reminds me of the powerful emotions we experience during challenges, and that every crisis is eventually resolved one way or another.</p><p><strong>Share a Weekly Update</strong></p><p>Information flow within your organization is critical and it helps to have a planned, consistent approach. This often looks like a weekly email, shared doc, or internal blog post shared with your manager and ideally with your stakeholders. There’s great advice on how to do these including<a href="https://twitter.com/lara_hogan"> <span>Laura Hogan</span></a>'s “<a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/week-in-review/"><span>Week in Review Leadership Comms</span></a>” and my colleague<a href="https://twitter.com/JadeRubick"> <span>Jade Rubick</span></a>’s “<a href="https://www.rubick.com/infobits-for-information-flow/"><span>How to be an information flow superhero</span></a>”. Currently, my process is writing a “reflection” on Friday mornings in<a href="https://www.koan.co/"> <span>Koan</span></a>, an OKR tracking tool. It's visible to leaders in my org and I also share it with the team I manage. The format of the update is: things the team accomplished, things I got done, after-hours on-call support issues, priorities for next week, and concerns I’d like to raise. I write this after reviewing indicator metrics and writing my impact journal entry, so it’s mainly a copy-and-paste exercise. As we’re all remote workers during the pandemic, this habit is even more valuable. Your manager and stakeholders need to know where your team is focused, what’s holding you back, what's finished, and what you’re working on next.</p><p><strong>Record My Quarterly Accomplishments</strong></p><p>Every three months I write down my top achievements under these categories:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Team accomplishments</p></li><li><p>Communications (internal blog posts)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Process work</p></li><li><p>Helping other managers</p></li><li><p>Hiring</p></li></ul><p>I scan through my impact journal entries from the last 12 weeks and copy-paste the most impressive items into the quarterly accomplishment list. When it comes time for my performance review, which happens every six months at my company, I simply combine the lists from the last two quarters then share with my manager. Nice and easy.</p><p>It's great having a record from each quarter going back for years of the things I've helped my team do and other things I've done personally. If anyone asks what I've done over the last year, I know where to look to help jog my memory. Sometimes I go back through the lists during times of doubt and uncertainty to help me remember what is possible. Reflecting on how you overcame past struggles can provide insight into your current challenge.</p><p><strong>Create Personal OKRs</strong></p><p>Each year on January 1st, I open a Google doc and create a list of personal OKRs (objectives and key results) for the year. I usually have three or four top objectives with about five measurable results under each one. After writing my list of new year’s resolutions, I set a biweekly calendar reminder to revisit and update my progress.<a href="https://twitter.com/cwodtke"> <span>Christina Wodtke</span></a>, author of the book<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0996006028/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0996006028&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eleganthack&amp;linkId=S5TUIOCJ66ZD4NMG"> <span>Radical Focus</span></a> on OKRs, has some<a href="http://eleganthack.com/personal-okrs-three-years-later/"> <span>great tips about using personal OKRs here</span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Personal OKRs help me focus on my health, family, friendships, and things I aspire to do outside my 8-to-5 job. Life is not all about work. It can be easy to continue thinking about work challenges on nights and weekends. This habit helps remind me there are other important things in my life.</p><p>Have you formed a productivity habit you find particularly useful? Is one missing from my list? I’m curious about what works for you. Feel free to share your favorite habit in the comments below. Thanks!</p></div></div></div></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>Recently I read Slava’s post on <a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">How to get promoted</a>.
I have a lot of respect for Slava, but I don’t agree with this post. So I thought I would share how I
think about it.</p>



<p>Slava is right about one important thing, that many people in Silicon Valley misunderstand what it
takes to get promoted. Many people assume that promotions just come naturally to people who deserve
them, and this is incorrect. The mentality here is like</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do good work</li>
  <li>???</li>
  <li>Promotion!</li>
</ol>

<p>To get promoted, you need to figure out Step 2. But how?</p>



<p>I mean this in a linguistic sense! If you think about it as “getting
promoted”, you are using the passive voice. You’re omitting
information. The laws of nature aren’t promoting you. Some specific
person at your company is the most important decisionmaker for your
promotion. To get promoted, you need to understand who that
decisionmaker is, and what sort of performance they want from you to
get a promotion. The mentality here is like</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do good work</li>
  <li>Convince the key decisionmaker that your work deserves a promotion</li>
  <li>Promotion!</li>
</ol>

<p>Who is the key decisionmaker? It depends on what your role is. If
you’re a software engineer, the key decisionmaker is probably just
your manager. Maybe it’s your manager’s manager. If your company is
smaller, maybe it’s just the CEO. But if you’re trying to get
promoted, you need to figure out who this person is, and what they
want.</p>



<p>If you have a good manager, you can simply ask them. Ask your manager
how promotion decisions are made, who the key decisionmakers are, and
more specifically ask them what you need to achieve in order to get
promoted.</p>

<p>If you have an inexperienced manager, maybe they aren’t able to
explain this to you. Or, maybe you just
won’t accept what your manager telling you, that you aren’t ready for a
promotion because you need to do better work.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it sounds like your manager is asking the impossible of
you, in order to get promoted. Sorry! That may or may not be your
manager’s fault, or your fault. I don’t know. At least you’re having
the conversation.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is impossible for you to get promoted on your current
team. You’re a senior engineer, and you want to make staff engineer,
but what you’re working on just isn’t important enough to merit a
promotion. This isn’t necessarily your manager’s fault, although often
a good manager can help you figure out how to navigate this.</p>



<p>So what’s the right strategy for someone who only cares about
promotion? Slava’s thoughts:</p>

<p><em>The winning strategy is to ignore company metrics completely and move
between projects every eighteen months so that nobody notices.</em></p>

<p><em>Wouldn’t people notice anyway? Rank and file employees will, but not
the management. In a fast growing company things change very quickly.</em></p>

<p>To me, this just sounds like a case of bad management. It’s hard to
manage a fast-growing startup, and bad management happens. But you
won’t find bad management everywhere. And often, what seems like bad
management from afar, is actually decent management grappling with a
seemingly impossible problem, once you dig into the details.</p>

<p>Instead, I think the best strategy for someone who only cares about
promotion is to do the unsexy work that management thinks is
important, but is having a hard time recruiting people for. Everybody
wants to work on the VR project. Nobody wants to fix the billing
system. Everybody wants to add a new feature to the consumer
app. Nobody wants to be responsible for fixing the database service that
recently caused a big outage. Work on the important stuff that nobody
wants to do.</p>

<p>People who do this are incredibly valuable to an organization, and
usually end up rewarded. Part of being a good manager is to figure out
who is willing to do the unsexy but critical work, and to reward these
people when they succeed at it.</p>



<p>In summary, my career advice for opportunists is to ask your manager
what it will take to get promoted, and then do it. If that isn’t
working, try working on a project that nobody wants to work on, but
management thinks it’s really important. The rituals and management
fashions, don’t worry about it. Spend your mental energy on getting
stuff done.</p>

This means that it breaks it down into the same starting materials that were used to make the product to begin with," Erika Erickson, a bioengineering researcher at the U.S. Department of Energy's&nbsp;National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NERL), told <em>As It Happens </em>host Carol Off.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"So instead of having an inferior product in the end, you could start with the same starting materials and come back to an equal value plastic water bottle or food package, etc., on&nbsp;the other side, without needing to use petroleum products to get there."</p>  <p>The findings were <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-09/uop-pe092520.php">published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</a></p>  <h2>Nature finds a way — and scientists speed it up&nbsp;</h2>  <p>The whole thing began when scientists at NERL and Britain's University of Portsmouth discovered a naturally occurring enzyme in a waste recycling centre in Japan that was helping bacteria break down&nbsp;polyethylene terephthalate&nbsp;(PET), a common plastic developed in the '40s that's used to make&nbsp;water bottles, food packaging, film and more.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"There are natural enzymes that have been evolved to break down plastic," Erickson said. "And if you think about that, it's quite extraordinary that an organism has been able to do this in such a short amount of time."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5746626.1601577848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/plastic-eating-enzymes.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Researchers from Britain's University of Portsmouth and the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory have combined two plastic-eating enzymes to create what they call a 'super enzyme.'<!-- --> <!-- -->(University of Portsmouth)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>However, the natural process is a slow one.

<strong>Linux Security Hardening and Other Tweaks</strong>
<hr>

<p>
Last updated: 08/18/2020,
by <a href="https://twitter.com/blakkheim">@blakkheim</a>

</p><p>
This page lists the changes I make to a vanilla install of Arch Linux
for security hardening, as well as some other changes I find useful.
While Arch is my target platform, most of the changes will work on
any Linux system that's reasonably up to date.

</p><p>
I typically favor security over performance. You may also see suggestions
merely to make something more useful or shave precious seconds off
a wait time. It's not a one-size-fits-all setup, but hopefully certain
pieces of it will be useful.

</p><p>
Arch is worth considering for a few reasons:

</p><ul>
<li><strong>The install size:</strong> The base install is relatively minimal
    compared to a "prebuilt" distro like Fedora or Mint. This lets me focus
    on adding just what I want, rather than constantly trying to strip out
    things I don't need.
</li><li><strong>The kernel:</strong> A common misconception about the Linux
    kernel is that it's secure, or that one can go a long time without
    worrying about kernel security updates. Neither of these are even
    remotely true. New versions of Linux are released almost every week,
    often containing security fixes buried among the many other changes.
    These releases typically
    <a href="https://youtu.be/5PmHRSeA2c8?t=4075">don't</a> make explicit
    mention of the changes having security implications. As a result, many
    "stable" or "LTS" distributions don't know
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200623161340/https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/23/2">which commits</a> should be
    backported to their old kernels, or even that something needs backporting
    at all. If the problem has a public CVE assigned to it, maybe your distro
    will pick it up. Maybe not. Even if a CVE exists, at least in the case
    of Ubuntu and Debian especially, users are often left with kernels full
    of <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/linux">known holes</a>
    for months at a time. Arch doesn't play the backporting game, instead
    opting to provide the newest stable releases shortly after they come out.
</li><li><strong>The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System">Arch Build System</a></strong>:
    Having enjoyed the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ports_collection">ports</a>
    system of <a href="https://vez.mrsk.me/freebsd-defaults.html">FreeBSD</a>
    and <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> for a long time, the ABS
    has been a pleasure to use. It makes building/rebuilding packages easy.
    It makes updating packages easy. It shows how things are actually built
    and with what options. This BSD-borrowed concept makes interacting with
    the package system simple and intuitive.
</li></ul>

Now on to how I set things up.

<h2 id="disks">Disk Layout</h2>

This section contains a few tips to consider during your initial disk layout
creation. The concepts should apply to any distrbution.

<p>
To start, consider using
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system">full disk encryption</a>
along with a
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LVM">Logical Volume Manager</a>
setup. Disk encryption protects data at rest, while LVM allows for some
flexibility that can be quite useful. A simple disk layout might look like
this:

</p><ul>
<li><code>/dev/sda1</code> (a small, unencrypted
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_system_partition">EFI System Partition</a>,
FAT32)
mounted at <code>/efi</code> (assuming this is
a PC with UEFI, otherwise not needed)
</li><li><code>/dev/sda2</code> (a small, unencrypted ext4 partition)
mounted at <code>/boot</code>.
</li><li><code>/dev/sda3</code> (using the rest of the drive space)
as the encrypted
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt">LUKS</a> container
for LVM
</li></ul>

Splitting up the logical volumes for different mount points provides some
benefits, including the ability to set mount flags on specific directories.
Consider creating separate logical volumes for <code>/</code>,
<code>/var</code>, and <code>/home</code> in the install. For a typical
desktop, you probably want to give <code>/home</code> most of the disk space.
The other two don't need much unless there's a specific use case in mind.
25GB and 8GB are used in this example. If you need to have a huge database
in <code>/var</code> or something, make adjustments accordingly.

<p>
There are a lot of user-writable directories in Linux, each one providing
an opportunity for attackers to execute their own binaries.
Once the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fstab">fstab</a>
file is created, add the <code>noexec</code> and <code>nodev</code> flags
to <code>/var</code> and <code>/home</code>. Doing so will disallow execution
of binaries on these mount points, as well as prevent interpreting character
or block special devices on them. Two temporary filesystems (<code>/tmp</code>
and <code>/dev/shm</code>) can also be locked down with the same flags by
adding the following:

</p><pre># /etc/fstab
[...]
tmpfs /tmp     tmpfs rw,noexec,nodev,size=1G,mode=1777 0 0
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw,noexec,nodev,size=1G 0 0
</pre>

Adjust the <code>1G</code> size limit value as desired.

<p>
Once booted into the finished installation, it should look something like this:

</p><pre># <strong>lvs</strong>
  LV   VG   Attr       LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  home lvm  -wi-ao---- 189.12g                                                    
  root lvm  -wi-ao----  25.00g                                                    
  var  lvm  -wi-ao----   8.00g                                                    
# <strong>mount | egrep '(lvm|/tmp|shm)' | sort</strong>
/dev/mapper/lvm-home on /home type ext4 (rw,nodev,noexec,relatime)
/dev/mapper/lvm-root on / type ext4 (rw,relatime)
/dev/mapper/lvm-var on /var type ext4 (rw,nodev,noexec,relatime)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nodev,noexec,size=1048576k)
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=1048576k)
</pre>

Another user-writable directory to consider is <code>/run</code>, specifically
the <code>/run/user/$UID</code> directories that systemd spawns when someone
logs in, but their transience is
<a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2015-February/028429.html">annoying</a>
and <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/436012/">complicated</a>.
I have yet to find the perfect solution there that won't break other things.
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/FUSE">FUSE</a> is another way
for non-root users to create new mount points and execute binaries. If FUSE
functionality isn't needed, the kernel module can be
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_module#Blacklisting">blacklisted</a>.

<hr>

<h2 id="pacman">Pacman</h2>

Package managers usually don't need much additional configuration.
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman">Pacman</a>, the one
Arch uses, is no different. My recommendation for any package manager is
simply to make sure that
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200528161634/https://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2018/02/21/attacks-against-secure-apt-repositories/">only HTTPS mirrors</a>
are used.

<pre># /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

Server = <strong>https</strong>://example.com/[...]/$repo/os/$arch
</pre>

Check the
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/all/https/">mirrorlist
generator</a> to see a list of TLS-capable servers near you.

<p>
Using an HTTPS mirror with Pacman is especially important because it
<a href="https://security.archlinux.org/package/pacman">doesn't validate</a>
the package database files and it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_separation">runs everything as root</a>.
HTTPS doesn't mitigate either of these problems, but it is one line of defense
against a MITM attack. I hope the developers will make fixing these two
security issues a priority for the project soon. Other package managers
have been doing it the right way for a long time.

</p><hr>

<h2 id="kern">Kernel Options</h2>

The
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/linux-hardened/">linux-hardened</a>
kernel package in Arch includes some compile-time security improvements
that can't be set at runtime.
If your distribution doesn't have a package for it, applying the
<a href="https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened/releases">patchset</a>
to upstream sources and building your own kernel is pretty easy. If you go
that route, have a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check">kconfig-hardened-check</a>
script for more compile-time settings to consider.

<!--
<p>
The main issue I've found with linux-hardened is that it's often outdated.
Upstream Linux development moves quickly, so out-of-tree patches will always
require extra work to maintain. Why the (relatively small) patches aren't
upstreamed is unknown to me. There are times when linux-hardened is lagging
multiple versions behind the latest kernel, thus missing out on many
important security fixes. In such a situation, the user must choose between
a more secure kernel with known vulnerabilities and a less secure kernel
with fewer known vulnerabilities. Not a great situation.
-->

<p>
Runtime configuration of the kernel can be done in a number of ways.
Desired flags may be passed on startup in the form of
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters">kernel parameters</a>,
of which there is an
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt">extensive list</a>.
Parameters are usually passed by the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bootloader#Boot_loader">bootloader</a>, so
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_parameters#Configuration">configuration details</a>
vary depending whether the system uses
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB">GRUB</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot">systemd-boot</a>,
or something else.

</p><p>
The following options, split up into categories, are worth considering for
security improvements:

</p><pre>l1tf=full,force
spec_store_bypass_disable=on
spectre_v2=on
</pre>

These are addtional mitigations for certain CPU security flaws.
While the <code>mitigations=auto</code> option is used by default in upstream
Linux, some of the mitigations it enables have been "toned down" for
performance reasons.
Examples of this include the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshadow_(security_vulnerability)">L1TF</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitectural_Data_Sampling">Microarchitectural Data Sampling</a>
vulnerabilities, which can't be fully mitigated unless HyperThreading
is disabled.
The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_Store_Bypass">Speculative Store Bypass</a>
vulnerability is only partially mitigated by default, with applications being
allowed to opt-in for protections via prctl or seccomp.
Finally, we enable all mitigations (including those against userspace) for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre V2</a>.

<pre>apparmor=1
lsm=lockdown,yama,apparmor
lockdown=<span color="#ff0000"><strong>XXX</strong></span>
</pre>

These enable the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AppArmor">AppArmor</a>, 
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt">Yama</a>,
and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200525014035/https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown</a>
features, with the lockdown mode left for the reader to choose.
Valid options are <code>integrity</code> and <code>confidentiality</code>,
both described briefly
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Security#Kernel_lockdown_mode">here</a>.
Replace <code><strong><span color="#ff0000">XXX</span></strong></code> with
whichever you see fit, or omit this option entirely if the feature isn't
wanted.

<p>
For what it's worth, running in <code>confidentiality</code> mode on my
desktop hasn't caused any problems. Your mileage and use case may vary.
Lockdown will break suspend-to-disk and any out-of-tree kernel modules
like ZFS, as well as
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support">DKMS</a> modules.

</p><pre>init_on_alloc=1
init_on_free=1
page_alloc.shuffle=1
slab_nomerge
vsyscall=none
</pre>

This group will instruct the kernel to fill newly allocated pages and heap
objects with zeroes, fill freed pages and heap objects with zeroes, tell the
page allocator to randomize its free lists, disable merging of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_allocation">slabs</a>
with similar size, and disable
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200526182112/https://lwn.net/Articles/446528/">vsyscalls</a>
due to their history of making exploits easier.
All five options are all set by default when using the linux-hardened kernel.

<pre>slub_debug=F
</pre>

This enables sanity checks in the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/slub.txt">SLUB allocator</a>.
Two other flags to consider for non-hardened kernels are <code>Z</code>
(redzoning, to detect when a slab is overwritten past its real size) and
<code>P</code> (to enable poisoning on slab cache allocations).

<p>
The full list of kernel parameters to be used must be specified on a single
line, separated by spaces, in the bootloader's config file. An example for
GRUB might look like this:

</p><pre># /etc/default/grub

[...]
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="apparmor=1 init_on_alloc=1 init_on_free=1 l1tf=full,force lockdown=confidentiality lsm=lockdown,yama,apparmor page_alloc.shuffle=1 slab_nomerge slub_debug=F spec_store_bypass_disable=on spectre_v2=on vsyscall=none"
[...]
</pre>

Depending on the bootloader in use, the file may need to be regenerated after
any edits are made.

<p>
Changes to the kernel parameters won't take effect until after a reboot.
To verify they were applied, run:

</p><pre>$ <strong>cat /proc/cmdline</strong>
</pre>

<p>
Yet more runtime options of the kernel can be configured through the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sysctl">sysctl</a> utility.

      <p><a href="https://bullish.email/"><img src="https://bullish.email/blog/logo.png"></a>
      </p>
      
      <hr>
      <p>
        At the beginning of this year, I launched a stock market newsletter
        called <a href="https://bullish.email/">Bullish</a>. I’ve been building
        this project to be fully autonomous, trying to squeeze as much I can get
        from free tiers available everywhere, keeping costs close to zero,
        trying to build a completely automated micro SaaS product.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bullish is a Ruby app that fetches data from multiple finance API’s and
        synthesizes that into an email template generated twice a day that gets
        triggered to MailerLite for delivery.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many ways to accomplish this task and the way I initially
        solved it was to re-purpose a Raspberry Pi that was collecting dust to
        run the project and set up CRON jobs to trigger emails and other tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although unusual, this configuration worked great, and the workflow was
        seamless; all I had to do was ssh into Pi and pull from master to get
        the latest updates.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time a couple of issues started to bother me. First, using
        Raspberry Pi introduced a single point of failure in the process if
        power was out, for example, or I was away from home, and something went
        wrong, there was no way to fix it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another problem is that I would forget to run bundle to install or
        update gems breaking the CRON jobs more often than not.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the most concerning one was security-related. Bullish stores all of
        its API keys in an env file, and although not in source control, these
        keys had to be available in the Raspberry Pi for the service to run and
        that alone was a big enough reason to look for a better, more scalable
        and FREE solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many ways I could have solved this. The most elegant probably
        being a Lambda function run on a schedule with API keys managed by a
        service like AWS Secrets Manager, which I still might do at some point,
        but this time around, I was looking for a quick win.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve been using Github Actions to run tests on every push to master
        branch, and one day it occurred to me, why not use this to have a
        workflow to trigger emails and other tasks as well?
      </p>

      <p>
        Doing some research, I found that Github Actions supports jobs triggered
        by a scheduled event and has a generous free tier that would work
        perfectly for my use case.
      </p>

      <p>
        Github Actions is still pretty new and has some annoying limitations
        like not sharing common data between jobs, leading to many duplicated
        steps, but it does allow sharing environment variables across jobs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another neat feature is that Github offers managed secrets that get
        injected in the container when the job executes, so no more API keys are
        in the open.
      </p>

      
      <p>
        Overall I am satisfied with this solution, maybe not definitive, but it
        addresses most of my concerns like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Single point of failure using Raspberry Pi</li>
        <li>Forgetting to update Pi manually with the latest code after a git push</li>
        <li>Secrets exposed in environment variables</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        And as a bonus, you get notified via email if your job ever fails,
        giving free visibility that you would otherwise have to put together
        yourself in services like CRON to figure out if a job ran successfully
        or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bullish is an open source project on
        <a href="https://github.com/eduardosasso/bullish">GitHub</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Cheers.</p>

      <h2 id="prologue-the-deep-learning-tsunami">Prologue: The Deep Learning Tsunami</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Deep Learning waves have lapped at the shores of computational linguistics for several years now, but 2015 seems like the year when the full force of the tsunami hit the major Natural Language Processing (NLP) conferences.” -<a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00239">Dr. Christopher D. Manning, Dec 2015</a> <sup id="fnref:part1_1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may sound hyperbolic - to say the established methods of an entire field of research are quickly being superseded by a new discovery, as if hit by a research ‘tsunami’. But, this catastrophic language is appropriate for describing the meteoric rise of Deep Learning over the last several years - a rise characterized by drastic improvements over reigning approaches towards the hardest problems in AI, massive investments from industry giants such as Google, and exponential growth in research publications (and Machine Learning graduate students). Having taken several classes on Machine Learning, and even used it in undergraduate research, I could not help but wonder if this new ‘Deep Learning’ was anything fancy or just a scaled up version of the ‘artificial neural nets’ that were already developed by the late 80s. And let me tell you, the answer is quite a story - the story of not just neural nets, not just of a sequence of research breakthroughs that make Deep Learning somewhat more interesting than ‘big neural nets’  (that I will attempt to explain in a way that just about anyone can understand), but most of all of how several unyielding researchers made it through dark decades of banishment to finally redeem neural nets and achieve the dream of Deep Learning.</p>


<blockquote><p id="sources">
I am certainly not a foremost expert on this topic. In depth technical overviews with long lists of references written by those who actually made the field what it is include Yoshua Bengio's <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/TR1312.pdf">"Learning Deep Architectures for AI"</a>, Jürgen Schmidhuber's <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.7828v4.pdf">"Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview"</a> and LeCun et al.s' <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf">"Deep learning"</a>. In particular, this is mostly a history of research in the US/Canada AI community, and even there will not mention many researchers; a particularly in depth history of the field that covers these omissions is Jürgen Schmidhuber's <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-overview.html">"Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview"</a>. I am also most certainly not a professional writer, and will cop to there being shorter and much less technical overviews written by professional writers such as Paul Voosen's <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Believers/190147">"The Believers"</a>, John Markoff's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/science/scientists-see-advances-in-deep-learning-a-part-of-artificial-intelligence.html">"Scientists See Promise in Deep-Learning Programs"</a> and Gary Marcus's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-deep-learning-a-revolution-in-artificial-intelligence">"Is “Deep Learning” a Revolution in Artificial Intelligence?"</a>. I also will stay away from getting too technical here, but there is a plethora of tutorials on the internet on all the major topics covered in brief by me.
<br>
Any corrections would be appreciated, though I will note some ommisions are intentional since I want to try and keep this 'brief' and a good mix of simple technical explanations and storytelling.

<p>The beginning of a story spanning half a century, about how we learned to make computers learn. In this part, we shall cover the birth of neural nets with the Perceptron in 1958, the AI Winter of the 70s, and neural nets’ return to popularity with backpropagation in 1986.</p>

    <figcaption>Linear regression <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg">(Source)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let’s start with a brief primer on what Machine Learning is. Take some points on a 2D graph, and draw a line that fits them as well as possible. What you have just done is generalized from a few example of pairs of input values (x) and output values (y) to a general function that can map any input value to an output value. This is known as linear regression, and it is a wonderful little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#cite_note-4">200 year old</a> technique for extrapolating a general function from some set of input-output pairs. And here’s why having such a technique is wonderful: there is an incalculable number of functions that are hard to develop equations for directly, but are easy to collect examples of input and output pairs for in the real world - for instance, the function mapping an input of recorded audio of a spoken word to an output of what that spoken word is.</p>

<p>Linear regression is a bit too wimpy a technique to solve the problem of speech recognition, but what it does is essentially what <strong>supervised Machine Learning</strong> is all about: ‘learning’ a function given a <strong>training set</strong> of <strong>examples</strong>, where each example is a pair of an input and output from the function (we shall touch on the unsupervised flavor in a little while). In particular, machine learning methods should derive a function that can generalize well to inputs not in the training set, since then we can actually apply it to inputs for which we do not have an output. For instance, Google’s current speech recognition technology is powered by Machine Learning with a massive training set, but not nearly as big a training set as all the possible speech inputs you might task your phone with understanding.</p>

<p>This generalization principle is so important that there is almost always a <strong>test set</strong> of data (more examples of inputs and outputs) that is not part of the training set. The separate set can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the machine learning technique by seeing how many of the examples the method correctly computes outputs for given the inputs. The nemesis of generalization is <strong>overfitting</strong> - learning a function that works really well for the training set but badly on the test set. Since machine learning researchers needed means to compare the effectiveness of their methods, over time there appeared standard <strong>datasets</strong> of training and testing sets that could be used to evaluate machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Okay okay, enough definitions. Point is - our line drawing exercise is a very simple example of supervised machine learning: the points are the training set (X is input and Y is output), the line is the approximated function, and we can use the line to find Y values for X values that don’t match any of the points we started with. Don’t worry, the rest of this history will not be nearly so dry as all this. Here we go.</p>

<h2 id="the-folly-of-false-promises">The Folly of False Promises</h2>

<p>Why have all this prologue with linear regression, since the topic here is ostensibly neural nets? Well, in fact linear regression bears some resemblance to the first idea conceived specifically as a method to make machines learn: <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1959-09865-001">Frank Rosenblatt’s <strong>Perceptron</strong></a><sup id="fnref:part1_2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.skynettoday.com/assets/img/overviews/2020-09-27-a-brief-history-of-neural-nets-and-deep-learning/34998.jpg" alt="Perceptron">
    <figcaption>A diagram showing how the Perceptron works. <a href="http://cse-wiki.unl.edu/wiki/images/0/0f/Perceptron.jpg">(Source)</a></figcaption>    
</figure>

<p>A psychologist, Rosenblatt conceived of the Percetron as a simplified mathematical model of how the neurons in our brains operate: it takes a set of binary inputs (nearby neurons), multiplies each input by a continuous valued weight (the synapse strength to each nearby neuron), and thresholds the sum of these weighted inputs to output a 1 if the sum is big enough and otherwise a 0 (in the same way neurons either fire or do not). Most of the inputs to a Perceptron are either some data or the output of another Perceptron, but an extra detail is that Perceptrons also have one special ‘bias’ input, which just has a value of 1 and basically ensures that more functions are computable with the same input by being able to offset the summed value. This model of the neuron built on the work of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts <a href="http://www.minicomplexity.org/pubs/1943-mcculloch-pitts-bmb.pdf">Mcculoch-Pitts</a><sup id="fnref:part1_3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_3">3</a></sup>, who showed that a neuron model that sums binary inputs and outputs a 1 if the sum exceeds a certain threshold value, and otherwise outputs a 0, can model the basic OR/AND/NOT functions. This, in the early days of AI, was a big deal - the predominant thought at the time was that making computers able to perform formal logical reasoning would essentially solve AI.</p>

    <figcaption>Another diagram, showing the biological inspiration. The <b>activation function</b> is what people now call the non-linear function applied to the weighted input sum to produce the output of the artificial neuron - in the case of Rosenblatt's Perceptron, the function just a thresholding operation.  <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/">(Source)</a> </figcaption>    
</figure>

<p>However, the Mcculoch-Pitts model lacked a mechanism for learning, which was crucial for it to be usable for AI. This is where the Perceptron excelled - Rosenblatt came up with a way to make such artificial neurons learn, inspired by the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.900930310/abstract">foundational work</a><sup id="fnref:part1_4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_4">4</a></sup> of Donald Hebb. Hebb put forth the unexpected and hugely influential idea that knowledge and learning occurs in the brain primarily through the formation and change of synapses between neurons - concisely stated as Hebb’s Rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Perceptron did not follow this idea exactly, but having weights on the inputs allowed for a very simple and intuitive learning scheme: given a <strong>training set</strong> of input-output examples the Perceptron should ‘learn’ a function from, for each example increase the weights if the Perceptron output for that example’s input is too low compared to the example, and otherwise decrease the weights if the output is too high. Stated ever so slightly more formally, the algorithm is as follows:</p>

  <li>For the inputs of an example in the …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>I learned that the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome#Stockholm_bank_robbery">Stockholm Syndrome</a> came from an incident that happened in 1972 in a bank in Stockholm, Sweden. Four employees of a bank were held hostage by two captors for six days. In the end, after the police caught the captors, none of the hostages were willing to testify against them in court. Rather, they began raising money to aid them with their defense.</p>
<p>When I watched <em>The Social Dilemma</em> recently, I kept thinking about this syndrome. Although it is still widely contested among psychologists and psychiatrists in its medical merit, I kept thinking about the analogy to social media. We have come to love something that has a captor-like spell on us, that we <em>know</em> can be detrimental. What do we do?</p>
<p>For starters, I urge you to watch the documentary. Second, spend some time thinking about what you saw (and maybe write about it?). Finally, <em>do something about it.</em></p>
<p>As a corollary to the second step above, I wanted to write down the top ten takeaways I had from the unnerving documentary followed by sharing my thoughts and short-term best practices on how I have been tackling this problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/200787-1-1100.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1" alt="The Social Dilemma Review: A Film About How Facebook Will Kill Us All | IndieWire" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<h2><strong>Top Ten Takeaways: <em>The Social Dilemma</em>&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<div>
<p><strong>One:</strong> In a 1980 interview for a documentary film, Steve Jobs said that the computer is like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c">bicycle for your mind</a>. The same cannot be said about social media. Whereas a bicycle is a passive <em>tool</em> that has the option to be used or not used based on an individual’s choice, social media is not just a passive tool. It is an active tool that <em>expects</em> you to use it, by giving instant gratification and feeding your dopamine levels in return.</p>
<p><strong>Two:</strong> The entire business model of companies like Facebook and Twitter are built on grabbing our attention <em>and</em> changing the way we think and behave. Jeff Orlowski, the director of the documentary, says, “Our social media platforms are powered by a surveillance-based business model designed to mine, manipulate, and extract our human experiences at any cost, causing a breakdown of our information ecosystem and shared sense of truth worldwide.”</p>
<p><strong>Three:</strong> As a result of the algorithms and preferences, our individual social media feeds can become echo chambers – basically reaffirming our worldview over and over, most worryingly perhaps even at the expense of the objective truth. We become more limited in our lens as we start to see only what we <em>want</em> to see.</p>
<p><strong>Four:</strong> Magicians are some of the earliest neuroscientists and psychologists who understood human behavior and exploited it by making us believe things that are not real (personally, I’m obsessed with decoding the magicians’ code). The effects are benign. On the other hand, social media does something similar: it collates fact and fiction by presenting the same information differently. Imagine having a customized Wikipedia page on every topic. What to believe anymore?</p>
<p><strong>Five:</strong> No one feels the existential threat while scrolling down to see one more image or video, but the consequences are seen when, as a society, we are more divided, lonely, and depressed. Left unchecked, the algorithms will feed us more and more divisive content in an effort to gain our attention and increase time on the platform.</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p><em>“In 2014,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/">Pew Research Center</a>&nbsp;found that partisan antipathy and division in America is “deeper and more extensive than at any point in the last two decades”. Over the past six years, social media has only exacerbated these sentiments. In 2019, 77% of Republicans and 72% of Democrats&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/partisan-antipathy-more-intense-more-personal/">said</a> voters in both parties “not only disagree over plans and policies, but also cannot agree on the basic facts”.”</em></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Six:</strong> We are all worried about a time when artificial intelligence will surpass our human strengths, i.e., achieve general intelligence and consciousness. What we don’t realize is that artificial intelligence has <em>already</em> surpassed our human weaknesses, i.e. our need for social validation, instant gratification, and limited focused attention.</p>

<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="How We Bring Humanity Back to Tech | by Tom Littler | Medium" src="https://i1.wp.com/miro.medium.com/max/3848/1*Z5vb1QsPiycUKi5BZ5BRPw.png?resize=986%2C540&amp;ssl=1" width="986" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<blockquote><p><em>“Dystopian technology will not strong-arm us. Instead, we’ll unwittingly submit ourselves to a devil’s bargain: freely trade our subconscious preferences for memes, our social cohesion for instant connection, and the truth for what we want to hear.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Seven:</strong> We can try to fight it, but it will always be a losing battle. Why? Because it is our brain vs their algorithms. It is our brain that was developed over millions of years and is still primitive in its needs vs their algorithms that is getting smarter, efficient, and more targeted by the second. We cannot blame ourselves; nor can we expect <em>will-power</em>, which is limited, to help us.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Eight:</strong> It is so hard to accept that technology is evil, <em>because it is not</em>. The degree of benefits we enjoy as a species today is unprecedented. We get access to everything ever known to humankind at the touch of a button (and soon by having a mere <a href="https://www.nanalyze.com/2020/09/kernel-brain-computer-interface/">thought</a>), we get to work with people from all corners of the world and learn from each other, we can get almost anything delivered in a day (or sometimes a few hours), we can travel anywhere we want to… I can keep going. How can this be considered dystopia? It’s not. Except, the same technology has also made us more disconnected, lonely, depressed, and divisive in real life. It is so hard to feel the threat because of the cruel juxtaposition of utopia next to dystopia.</p>
<p><strong>Nine:</strong> Any solution that can tackle this problem needs to be aligned with the financial incentive of a company. At the end of the day, all this technology is powered by shareholders who have vested interests. The first step to tackling this is through regulation. Unlike phone companies that have restrictions on how our data is used (and have had for decades), social media companies have just begun facing the consequences with anti-trust laws. There needs to be more, and fast.</p>
<p><strong>Ten:</strong> The people who created this are not evil. They did so with a good intention, of connecting the world, spreading positivity, and giving voice to everyone. But, we don’t see it anymore because of what happened along the way. Until the business model changes from ground up and the companies start valuing us for more than our attention, we can’t make progress. <em>We</em> created this, and so we <em>can</em> — and have a responsibility to — change it for the sake of our future generation.</p>

</div>
<h2><strong>What can we do?</strong></h2>
<div>
<p>I completely disagree with someone who says <em>we can choose to run away and try to live a completely social media-free life. </em>We cannot. Not if our profession or career goal requires us to disseminate our work to the mass public. If you’re a creator or an artist, of <em>any</em> kind, and you want your work to reach people, you, unfortunately, need to go where people are. And where people are is on social media. Besides, if all the good people quit social media, we are left with those who will only exacerbate the problem of spreading fake news. The solution is to rather use the knowledge we have against the system and build good habits in the short-term while demanding robust action from our leaders for the long-term.</p>
<p>I realize that I have been implementing some best practices to lessen my usage and consumption of content I don’t want since I <a href="https://www.bsoundarya.com/why-deep-work-is-valuable-busy-work-is-not-2/">read</a> <em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport in January 2019. I hope these help you as a starting point:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disable notifications from <em>all</em> non-essential apps:</strong> And I mean all. Except for messages from my family on WhatsApp, high-priority emails, reminders, and notifications related to finances, nothing else grabs my attention on my phone. I’ve never looked back. This can be itchy for a few days, as you’ll have the urge to constantly keep checking your phone. Like any good habit, it will be difficult to follow and easy to break. Give it two weeks, and you’ll see the result.</li>
<li><strong>Use plugins to block out irrelevant content:</strong> YouTube is rightly called a rabbit-hole. The algorithms are so good that they begin showing you videos that you never knew you needed <em>and</em> videos you never needed. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-youtube-recommende/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid?hl=en">Use a plugin</a> that hides all <em>recommended</em> videos so you can open the app only to watch what <em>you</em> wanted. While we’re on the topic of plugins, other good ones include: <a href="https://resumeworded.com/sendy/l/rLscJ9sX8BWC7yGUzQ81cA/OaW2vNZ0dV7NObkSSu8920iA/mdjjl892Dl5pWFKT0eV08B2A">Pomodoro clock</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/email-extractor/jdianbbpnakhcmfkcckaboohfgnngfcc?hl=en">email extractor</a>, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/weava-highlighter-pdf-web/cbnaodkpfinfiipjblikofhlhlcickei?hl=en">Weava</a> highlighter.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t let just anyone enter your email home:</strong> Your email is sacred. It’s where you receive the most important alerts, it’s where you interact with your friends, and maybe close deals. Don’t let just anyone enter. I use a <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection">Proofpoint</a> filter that automatically detects spam-my emails. I also religiously unsubscribe from information that isn’t directly relevant or interesting to me (yet I still get unwanted emails. Sigh.).</li>
<li><strong>Delete social media apps unless you need them for something critical:</strong> I know this seems drastic, but truth be told, you can still access these through your computer (or even your phone through the website). By deleting them from your phone, you will at least add one layer of friction. <strong>Side Note:</strong> Instead of using the better-looking version of Facebook, use the <a href="https://mbasic.facebook.com/">basic version</a> on your phone. With its limited functionality and sub-par UI, it’s the perfect panacea to stop getting addicted.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Honestly, despite the above, sometimes I still feel overwhelmed with information. Below are a few more measures I plan to experiment with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monitor my screen time. Although my phone screen time might be low, I’m afraid my laptop screen time is too high.</li>
<li>Read news articles only from paid subscriptions: <em>The New York Times, The Guardina, Medium.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li>Find a way to disable likes/comments on my posts on Instagram and LinkedIn so I’m not tempted to check them once I make a post.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most of you reading this will continue using social media, which is warranted. I plan to continue using it too. But, if you don’t pause for a few minutes to build some good habits now, you will wake up from the spell after a few years wondering where all the time went. Take control of your time now.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>If you work in tech, you probably have a YubiKey. I have this one, the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5c-nano/">YubiKey 5C Nano</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/nano.jpg" alt="YubiKey 5C Nano"></p>

<p>If you don’t work in tech but primarily work on your laptop, you probably <em>should</em> have a YubiKey. And if you work on a political campaign or as a journalist, you should definitely have one (or something similar). Talk to your IT Security department about that. This post will mostly be about something your IT Security department doesn’t want to hear about, though, so maybe don’t mention it to them.</p>

<p>YubiKeys act as two-factor authentication. This means that after you log-in to a system with your username and password, the system requires you to authorize in a second way as well. This way if your login credentials are compromised, the attacker would also have to compromise the second form of authentication, which is harder.</p>

<p>There are different forms of two-factor authentication - a common one is that a website will ask you to scan a QR code with the Google Authenticator app (or similar) on your phone which will generate 6 digit codes. The way this works is that the server and the app both have a shared secret. The phone generates codes based on that secret and the current timestamp and the server generates the same codes and sees if they match.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/qr-code.png" alt="QR Code"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/authenticator.png" alt="Google Authenticator"></p>

<p>Another one is SMS-based 2FA, which is pretty widely regarded as insecure. In this case, the server generates a code and sends it to your phone via SMS. The reason it’s considered insecure is that an attack exists called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM-jacking</a> where someone convinces a cell phone carrier to port a number to a new SIM card, effectively directing all SMS traffic to their phone instead of yours.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/wells.jpg" alt="Wells Fargo"></p>

<p>YubiKeys are small devices that plug in to the USB port of your computer and emulate a keyboard. When tapped, they emit a one-time password (OTP) which can be then verified by a validation server. A private key exists on the device which is used to sign information, but it can never leave the device because it is stored in a tamper-resistant environment.</p>

<p>The YubiKey that I use is designed to always sit in a USB port of my laptop, so whenever I would take my laptop from my desk to a conference room or to another office, it was always available. But like many new remote workers, my laptop never leaves my desk anymore. I have it hooked up to an external monitor and to save some desk space, I have it in clamshell mode sitting vertically on a stand.</p>

<p>This makes tapping the YubiKey difficult, especially when I store my laptop far away from my keyboard and mouse. I solved this by buying a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DMMW4J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">USB-C extension cable</a>, which brought the YubiKey closer to my keyboard.</p>

<p>One thing I haven’t mentioned about the YubiKey 5C Nano is that it’s kind of difficult to tap, even without the distance issues. The target area that you need to touch is extremely small:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/nano-big.png" alt="YubiKey 5C Nano"></p>

<p>One of the features of the YubiKey is that the little metal strip determines that it is being tapped by a human - this prevents it from being accidentally triggered by bumping your laptop into something, but if you’ve ever seen a one-time password in a Slack channel or Google Doc like <code>tlerefhcvijlngibueiiuhkeibbcbecehvjiklltnbbl</code>, you know it isn’t a perfect system. I would estimate that 1 in 5 times that I attempt to trigger it, it doesn’t register.</p>

<p>A lot of thought has gone into ensuring that the YubiKey can’t be triggered from software on the computer itself.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, I’d like to acknowledge the reasons for this. If a remote attacker were to compromise your laptop, being able to trigger the YubiKey from software on the computer defeats the whole point of using the YubiKey. But I think we always make tradeoffs between security and convenience - for example, you often don’t have to enter your YubiKey every time you access a system, some systems will only ask you once and not ask you again on subsequent logins for a certain amount of time. When you use a 2FA system and it gives you “backup codes”, do you always print those out and store them in a safe location? Everyone should figure out what level of security and convenience they are okay with.</p>

<p>With that being said, let’s talk about how you could trigger a YubiKey with software.</p>



<p>I’ve been calling this mechanism <strong>The Finger</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>First, we need some way for the computer to talk to <strong>The Finger</strong>. I had a bunch of these <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B076F53B6S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">IZOKEE D1 Mini</a> development boards lying around, they are smaller versions of boards that use the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">ESP8266</a> chip found in a lot of IoT devices.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/d1-mini.jpg" alt="IZOKEE D1 Mini"></p>

<p>We can connect this to the laptop and talk to it over USB serial, but since it has WiFi, we can also just run a webserver on it and send it HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Next, we need some way to push <strong>The Finger</strong> towards the Yubikey. After a little googling, I found that the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CP18J4A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">28BYJ-48 stepper motor</a> interfaces well with the D1 Mini board.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor.jpg" alt="stepper motor"></p>

<p>Stepper motors convert electrical pulses into mechanical rotation and the D1 Mini has pins for sending electrical pulses.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor.gif" alt="stepper motor"></p>

<p>But stepper motors rotate and we mostly just need to poke in a straight direction. So I searched on Thingiverse for “28BYJ-48” and found this: <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3593641">28BYJ-48 Motor Halter</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor-case.jpg" alt="28BYJ-48 Motor Halter"></p>

<p>This attaches a gear to the motor which can guide a long rack forward and backward. But if we’re going to push a long plastic thing toward the YubiKey, it might as well look like a finger. Back to Thingiverse, this time searching for “finger” and I found this model someone made for Halloween:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/finger_model.jpg" alt="finger"></p>

<p>I opened up these two models in Fusion 360 and used an advanced CAD technique called “smooshing”, resulting in this:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/finger_smoosh.png" alt="finger"></p>

<p>Next, I exported the smooshed STL and 3D printed it in <a href="https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/prusament/715-prusament-pla-lipstick-red-1kg.html">Prusament PLA Lipstick Red</a> because that’s what I happened to have in my printer at the time. Then I took the plastic finger and touched the YubiKey which.. didn’t do anything. I picked up a metal screw on my desk and touched the YubiKey, which immediately spit out a OTP. So then I took the finger and secured it to my desk with a vise and drilled a small hole in it, then screwed the metal screw into it and touched it to the YubiKey, which again did nothing.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/vise.jpg" alt="vise"></p>

<p>That’s when I realized that I’m an idiot and that when I had touched the metal screw to the Yubikey, it was just transmitting the electrical charge from my body to the metal screw, which then transmitted it to the capacitive touch sensor on the YubiKey. So how could I trick the capacitive touch sensor into thinking it was a real finger?</p>

<p>I guessed that the way that capacitive touch sensors work is that they’re measuring your body’s capacitance to ground, so if we just hook up the sensor directly towards ground, it’ll think that its really conductive or at least conductive enough for a human finger to be between the two. So I took an insulated wire, unscrewed the metal screw slightly, wrapped it around the screw and tightened it again. Then I took the other end and connected it the GND port on the D1 Mini board, touched it to the YubiKey, and it worked!</p>

<p>Now the driver board for the stepper motor already connects to the 5V and GND on the D1 Mini, so I thought I might have to strip the GND wire and run it to both the driver board and the screw, but on a whim I decided to just wedge the end of the wire from the metal screw between the stepper motor metal body (figuring the metal body case was grounded) and the plastic housing. This also worked!</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/ground.jpg" alt="grounding"></p>

<p>Once I confirmed that the finger would trigger the YubiKey, I needed a way to mount the YubiKey close to the finger, so I used my digital calipers to measure the size of the USB-C extension cable and designed a holder in Fusion 360.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/holder.png" alt="holder"></p>

<p>The USB-C extension cable would go into the hole on the left and the motor would mount on the right.</p>

<p>At this point, we have to wire the stepper motor driver board to the D1 Mini. This can be done by soldering some headers onto the D1 Mini and then connecting some Dupont jumper wires between them.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/pins.jpg" alt="pins"></p>

<p>Once we put the stepper motor into the housing and screw everything together, it should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/setup.jpg" alt="setup"></p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>The software is much more straightforward. The D1 Mini can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. First, we go into Preferences and add <code>https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json</code> under <em>Additional Board Manager URLs</em>. Then when you go into the <em>Boards Managers</em>, you can install the <code>esp8266</code> package which includes the board <strong>LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 &amp; mini</strong>, which should be selected under <em>Tools</em>.</p>

<p>At this point I’ll run a sketch for blinking the LED just to verify that it’s working:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define LED 2 //Define blinking LED pin

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // Initialize the LED pin as an output
}
// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // Turn the LED on (Note that LOW is the voltage level)
  delay(1000); // Wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // Turn the LED off by making the voltage HIGH
  delay(1000); // Wait for two seconds
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I found this <a href="https://robojax.com/learn/arduino/?vid=robojax_ESP8266_28BYJ-48_Stepper_ESP8STP-1">sketch</a> that shows how to control the 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor using WiFi.</p>

<p>Here are the parts that have to do with the motor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int Pin1 = D1; //IN1 is connected 
int Pin2 = D2; //IN2 is connected   
int Pin3 = D3; //IN3 is connected 
int Pin4 = D4; //IN4 is connected 
 
int pole1[] ={0,0,0,0, 0,1,1,1, 0}; //pole1, 8 step values
int pole2[] ={0,0,0,1, 1,1,0,0, 0}; //pole2, 8 step values
int pole3[] ={0,1,1,1, 0,0,0,0, 0}; //pole3, 8 step values
int pole4[] ={1,1,0,0, 0,0,0,1, 0}; //pole4, 8 step values

int poleStep = 0; 
int dirStatus = 3; // stores direction status 3= stop (do not change)
String argId[] ={"ccw", "cw"};

...

void loop(void) {
    server.handleClient();
    MDNS.update();

    if (dirStatus == 1) {
        poleStep++;
        driveStepper(poleStep);
    } else if (dirStatus == 2) {
        poleStep--;
        driveStepper(poleStep);
    } else {
        driveStepper(8);
    }
    
    if (poleStep&gt;7) { 
        poleStep=0; 
    }

    if (poleStep&lt;0) {
        …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Today we’re releasing CUDA.jl 2.0, a breaking release with several new features. Highlights
include initial support for Float16, a switch to CUDA’s new stream model, a much-needed
rework of the sparse array support and support for CUDA 11.1.</p>
<p>The release now requires <strong>Julia 1.5</strong>, and assumes a GPU with <strong>compute capability 5.0</strong> or
higher (although most of the package will still work with an older GPU).</p>
<h2 id="low--and-mixed-precision-operations">Low- and mixed-precision operations</h2>
<p>With NVIDIA’s latest GPUs featuring more and more low-precision operations,
CUDA.jl <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/pull/417">now</a> starts to support
these data types. For example, the CUBLAS wrappers can be used with (B)Float16
inputs (running under <code>JULIA_DEBUG=CUBLAS</code> to illustrate the called methods)
thanks to the <code>cublasGemmEx</code> API call:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>As part of these changes, CUDA.jl now defaults to using tensor cores. This may affect
accuracy; use math mode <code>PEDANTIC</code> if you want the old behavior.</p>
<p>Work is <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/issues/391">under way</a> to extend these
capabilities to the rest of CUDA.jl, e.g., the CUDNN wrappers, or the native kernel
programming capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="new-default-stream-semantics">New default stream semantics</h2>
<p>In CUDA.jl 2.0 we’re <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/pull/395">switching</a> to CUDA’s
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-pro-tip-cuda-7-streams-simplify-concurrency/">simplified stream programming
model</a>.
This simplifies working with multiple streams, and opens up more possibilities for
concurrent execution of GPU operations.</p>
<h3 id="multi-stream-programming">Multi-stream programming</h3>
<p>In the old model, the default stream (used by all GPU operations unless specified otherwise)
was a special stream whose commands could not be executed concurrently with commands on
regular, explicitly-created streams. For example, if we interleave kernels executed on a
dedicated stream with ones on the default one, execution was serialized:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>using</span> CUDA

N <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>20</span>

</figure>

<p>In the new model, default streams are regular streams and commands issued on them can
execute concurrently with those on other streams:</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="multi-threading">Multi-threading</h3>
<p>Another consequence of the new stream model is that each thread gets its own default stream
(accessible as <code>CuStreamPerThread()</code>). Together with Julia’s threading capabilities, this
makes it trivial to group independent work in tasks, benefiting from concurrent execution on
the GPU where possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>using</span> CUDA

<figure>
	<img src="https://juliagpu.org/2020-10-02-cuda_2.0/multithread_after.png" alt="Multi-threading (new)">
</figure>

<p>With the old model, execution would have been serialized because the default stream was the
same across threads:</p>

	<img src="https://juliagpu.org/2020-10-02-cuda_2.0/multithread_before.png" alt="Multi-threading (old)">

<p>Future improvements will make this behavior configurable, such that users can use a
different default stream per task.</p>
<h2 id="sparse-array-clean-up">Sparse array clean-up</h2>
<p>As part of CUDA.jl 2.0, the sparse array support <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/pull/409">has been
refactored</a>, bringing them in line with other
array types and their expected behavior. For example, the custom <code>switch2</code> methods have been
removed in favor of calls to <code>convert</code> and array constructors:</p>

October 2, 2020 | https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/morgenstern.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/morgenstern.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>by Jeffrey Kegler</p>
    <p>The story of Gödel's citizenship hearing had been much repeated over the years.
      What was known was that on 5 December 1947, Kurt Gödel went to his citizenship hearing in Trenton, New Jersey.
      The examiner was Judge Philip Forman.
      As his witnesses, Gödel brought his two closest friends, Oskar Morgenstern and Albert Einstein.
      Gödel was granted citizenship, and took his oath on 2 April 1948.
      Those were the reliably established facts.
    </p>
    <p>Afterwards, Morgenstern told many people that he and Einstein had had their hands full preventing the brilliant, but politically naive, Gödel from derailing his citizenship chances.
      No account directly from Morgenstern or anyone else at the hearing had survived, but hearsay versions circulated widely.
      The hearsay versions show considerable variation, but their burden is something like the following:
    </p>
    <p>Gödel, in his usual manner, had read extensively in preparing for the hearing.
      In the course of his studies, Gödel decided that he had discovered a flaw in the U.S. Constitution --
      a contradiction which would allow the U.S. to be turned into a dictatorship.
      Gödel, usually quite reticent, seemed to feel a need to make this known.
      Morgenstern and Einstein warned Gödel that it would be a disaster to confront his citizenship examiner with visions of a Constitutional flaw leading to an American dictatorship.
    </p>
    <p>Arriving in Princeton, the trio had no idea who the examiner would be.
      They happened to run into Judge Forman.
      Forman was a friend of Einstein's --
      when Einstein became a citizen, Forman had administered the oath.
      How lucky this was became apparent almost immediately during the questioning.
      Forman happened to remark how fortunate it was that the US was not a dictatorship, which Gödel took as a cue to explain his discovery.
      A surprised Forman exchanged glances with Einstein and Morgenstern, cut Gödel off, and forced-marched the hearing through to a successful conclusion.
    </p>
    <h2>The History, and the Legend</h2>
    <p>Nobody seems to know what Gödel's proof was.
      Many versions of the hearing that circulated featured invented dialog.
      In faculty room yarns this would be unfortunate, but not surprising.
      More startling is the presence of such dialog in the version given
      in the extremely scholarly and very carefully edited Gödel's
      <cite>Collected Works</cite>, Vol. I, p. 12.
      A footnote in
      <cite>Collected Works</cite>
      admits that its version is pure hearsay.
    </p>
    <p>I've learned to distrust such sources.
      When I was in graduate school, studying Theory of Computation, Kurt Gödel was still alive.
      I heard many tales of Gödel's eccentric behavior from mathematicians.
      Gödel certainly was eccentric, and first-hand tales of this abound,
      but I later discovered that every single anecdote I'd gotten second- or third-hand was almost certainly false.
    </p>
    <p>1997 marked a turning point in Gödel biography,
      with the publication of John Dawson's careful and reliable biography of Gödel:
      <cite>Logical Dilemmas</cite>.
      When Dawson wrote, all four participants in the hearing were dead.
      Morgenstern refers, briefly and cryptically, to the hearing in his diary, but does not say enough to fully support the story.
      Dawson in general, and quite correctly, rejected the use of hearsay.
      But this story was the most well-known story about Gödel, and nobody doubted that it had a basis in truth.
    </p>
    <p>Dawson apparently decided that some reference to this story must be made, regardless of sourcing difficulty.
      Given no alternative to using hearsay, Dawson was careful to seek out what could reasonably be thought of as the
      source of the best hearsay -- Morgenstern's widow.
      She certainly would have heard the story many times, and directly from Morgenstern.
      Dawson interviewed her on 17 October 1983.
      Dawson's account in
      <cite>Logical Dilemmas</cite>
      (pp. 179-180) is based on that interview and Morgenstern's diary entry.
    </p>
    <h2>The Lost Document</h2>
    <p>According to Dawson (p. 300), Morgenstern had written up an account of this matter for publication, but Dawson was unable to locate it.
      Dorothy Morgenstern was sure that she'd once had her husband's write-up,
      and that she'd sent it to someone.
      But she could not remember who.
      This wasn't exactly promising for the accuracy of her retelling.
      But best evidence is best evidence -- you take it how it comes.
    </p>
    <p>In dealing with the matter as a Wikipedia editor,
      I took the position that Dawson's account of this hearing was the final word.
      The other versions were either retellings of the Dawson account,
      hearsay from less reliable sources or pure speculation.
      Regardless of which of the three they were, they were to be rejected as sources for the Wikipedia article.
    </p>
    <p>When dealing with the matter as a novelist, the God Proof,
      I took the position that this story had become a legend as much as any tale of an 11th century saint.
      Since it was a legend, I was free as a writer of fiction to add any incident or dialog I thought to be in the spirit of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>But now the "lost" Morgenstern document has reappeared.
      Apparently the IAS has had it all these years.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>My trusty old USB 3 hub has failed. It was only around a year old, but it was cheap and it worked. It wasn’t powered, but most of the time it didn’t need to be. One day I began having very strange issues with USB on my computer. Devices randomly disconnecting, devices never connecting until the computer was rebooted and so on. I eventually narrowed it down to the hub. I tossed it out after a quick internal inspection had revealed nothing obviously wrong, and went shopping for a new hub.</p>
<p>My requirements for a hub were very simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>it must be externally powered,</li>
<li>it must be relatively aesthetically neutral - no gamer aesthetics or hideous glossy plastic,</li>
<li>it must be USB 3,</li>
<li>it must offer between 3 and 7 extra ports - any less and what’s the point, and more and the hub is unnecessarily big, and I treat my desk like Tokyo. Space is a at a premium,</li>
<li>the cost must not exceed 35 GBP (45 US Dollars at the time of writing),</li>
<li>and it must have a detachable cord that connects it to the computer, or offer a cord long enough to reach my computer under my desk.</li>
</ul>
<p>While shopping, almost every single hub I came across had some stupid design that either prioritised it looking space age with blue LEDS galore, and a lot of them even had individual power switches for each USB port. Why anyone would want that is beyond me. Other hubs had tiny 15cm cables, since they’re designed to be used right beside a laptop.</p>
<p>I ended up settling on a very cleverly designed Orico 4 port Aluminium hub. I particularly liked this one because aesthetically speaking it was pretty neutral, and it even handles the problem of the USB hub floating off in the breeze by integrating a clamp so that you can clamp it to your desk or your monitor.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kn100.me/hub-product.jpg"> <figcaption>
<h4>The hub I chose. A novel design!</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It arrived, and seemed to work perfectly. USB transfer speeds were as expected, the external power source being MicroUSB meant I could attach any fairly dumb USB power supply to it to supply extra power, the cable leading to the PC itself was detachable and relatively standard (USB A to USB A) and all was good with the world.</p>
<p>That was until I put my computer to sleep. The next morning, I pressed a key on my keyboard to trigger the system to wake up, and nothing happened. The keyboard is not attached to the hub, nor is it attached to a port on the motherboard that is on the same controller, so this was perplexing. I pressed the power button on the tower, but still nothing! Very strange. I detached the USB hub, and immediately my computer came to life and worked as normal.</p>
<p>Through further experimentation I determined this strange phenomenon only happened when an external power source was connected. I toyed with the idea of returning what was obviously a faulty product, but reasoned that I didn’t actually need it to be powered, and pretty much all the other hubs in the same price range were either aesthetically disgusting or lacked other features I liked about this one - so I kept it.</p>
<p>That is until today, when through some research, I found this isn’t just a problem with <em>my</em> USB hub, it’s a problem many have with powered hubs. Articles like <a href="https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/production-expert-1/2019/9/18/warning-your-usb-hub-may-be-harming-your-drives-and-you-may-lose-valuable-studio-work-heres-how-to-fix-it">this</a>, or forum posts like <a href="https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/computer-wont-start-with-usb-hub-connected.2753255/">this</a> show that totally unrelated hubs cause similar issues for their owners. This got me thinking to past experiences of USB hubs I’ve had. In the past, a less financially stable me used to buy the cheapest possible thing every time. At one time, I was experimenting with a Raspberry Pi along with external hard drives. I discovered that a powered hub was necessary for these experiments because the Pi itself was incapable of providing much USB power. I bought the cheapest USB 2 powered hub I could at the time from eBay, and it mostly worked fine. To describe the setup a little, I had the hub itself connected to its power supply, and the ‘in’ usb port connected to one of the Pis USB ports. Imagine my surprise when the Pi switched on and booted up, without any power supply attached! I thought this was cool at the time, and chalked it up to ‘It’s not a bug, it’s a feature’, and forgot about it. Fast forward to today me, when I realised my experience back then was possibly related to the problems I was having with this new Orico USB hub today. After a little bit of thought, I realised that the hub was most likely ‘backfeeding’ power to the connected computer.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, let’s stick to USB 2 for now. USB 2 consists of 4 conductors, known as VCC (this is the ‘positive’ 5 volt connection), GND (this is the ‘negative’ power connection), D+, and D- (the data transmission pins, no true power flows over these pins). This means that a connected USB device can both draw power and transfer data. When you see 5 volts on a power adaptor or something, this is usually an approximation. For various reasons which revolve mostly around cost saving, most USB power adaptors will actually output slightly more than 5 volts, and then when a load is applied (say, a charging phone), the voltage drops down a bit. The better the quality of the power supply, closer to 5 volts it’ll start at generally and the smaller the drop when a load is applied.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kn100.me/usb-pinout.png"> <figcaption>
<h4>The USB pinout</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This applies to your computer’s USB ports too - except for one big difference: the power supply inside your computer is probably significantly better designed than the USB plug sockets that are mass produced. In fact, if I measure the voltage coming from my USB ports on my computer, I get a value of around 5.03v. If I measure the voltage coming from my phone charger, I get 5.21v. This is a pretty big difference!</p>
<p>The next thing to know is how a powered hub actually works. Essentially, a powered hub takes an external power source, and passes that power source through to the USB devices connected to the hub in place of your computer. One problem that these hubs face however is what if the user wishes to use the hub in its ‘unpowered’ state - where they’ve connected the hub to their computer with no power supply. In order to implement this properly, the hub would probably need some mechanism to switch between the computer power and the external PSU if it is connected. This would however add cost to the manufacture of the hub, so instead of doing this, they just connect the 5v of your computer through to the 5v of the external power supply. This is ridiculously bad because if there is even the smallest difference between the voltage being supplied by your computer and the voltage being supplied by the external power source, power will flow towards the device with the lower voltage! This is ‘backfeeding’. As a simple analogy, imagine you took two rechargeable batteries and connected them together. What you’d find happens is that the batteries will eventually end up at exactly the same voltage, which will be slightly lower than what you’d expect if you did the maths, as a small amount of power would be lost as heat. If the power source is ‘infinite’ however - like our wall connected computer or our wall connected external hub, this power will just continue to flow. Where it goes or what happens with it is completely undefined. In the case of our Raspberry Pi earlier, the circuit was simple enough that it just led to the Pi being powered up. In the case of my computer, it screwed with the system so badly that hardware buttons like the power button literally stopped functioning altogether.</p>

<p>This design seems stupid right? The problem is, it is the cheapest way of achieving the design goal of having a USB hub work with or without power. If we didn’t care about this particular feature, we could either just not have an external power source and have a purely unpowered hub, or we could not connect the 5v pin from the computer and therefore only supply power from the external PSU. Both of these solutions in effect are more expensive than just living with the backfeeding ‘feature’ since it’d mean the company offering the hub would need to deal with support requests from people wondering why their hub doesn’t work ‘unpowered’ when their other one does, or vice versa. Instead, we get backfeeding. I’m sure that some computers would not exhibit any real problems with this design, seeing as it’s been around since as long as powered USB hubs have been around as far as I can tell, and it’s likely some USB chipsets are designed with this in mind, but mine was not. Others computers, especially Macs, deal with this particular issue far more destructively, causing damage to the computer’s USB chipset when a backfeeding USB hub is connected.</p>

<p>Before we continue, you should know I am not an electrical engineer, if that wasn’t clear from how vaguely I described things above. I am a software engineer who likes to dabble with electronics. This means my advice below does not come from someone who is qualified to give it. You should follow this advice at your own risk. I take no responsibility for damage you do to yourself, your USB hub, or your computer, or to anything else for that matter.</p>

<ol>
<li>Firstly, I validated this was the problem. I engaged in a clever little trick where I took an old USB cable - USB 2 or 3 is fine, cut it in half, exposed the either 2 (cable is power only) or 4 wires, and looked up USB wire colouring to realise that the red wire is usually the VCC wire, and Black/White is usually GND. I then connected the cut up USB lead to the input port on my hub (where my computer connects), and connected the external power supply. I measured 5 volts across these two wires using the multimeter, meaning this hub does backfeed.</li>

<p>There are 2 things I have come to believe about writing:</p>



<ol><li><strong>The average person should write 5x more things than they do.</strong></li><li><strong>The average written thing should be 5x shorter than it is.</strong></li></ol>



<p>That’s what I mean by “write 5x more but write 5x less.” Write more often, but make each thing you write shorter. </p>



<p>I don’t care what it is. Blog posts. Novels. Google docs. Articles. Wiki pages. Write more of them, but make them shorter. </p>



<p>Why write more often? </p>



<ul><li>Because writing helps thinking. </li><li>Because practice will make you better. </li><li>Because writing is more shareable than speaking.</li><li>Because humans are worse than computers at storing knowledge.</li><li>Because writing your old thoughts frees your brain to think of new thoughts.</li></ul>



<p>Why make them shorter?</p>



<ul><li>Because the shorter it is, the more people will read it.</li><li>Because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>: 80% of the value is in 20% of the length (hence “5x shorter”).</li></ul>



<p>So write more, but write less.</p>

	<p>I’m pleased to share the news that Altinity has raised a $4M seed investment from Accel. Dan Levine led the round. We are honored by Accel’s trust and delighted to work with Dan. We plan to use the investment to roll out our new <a href="https://altinity.com/cloud/">Altinity.Cloud platform</a> and to strengthen <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/">ClickHouse </a>into the best analytic database on the planet.&nbsp;</p><p>Dan was the first venture capitalist to contact us, as he tells in his <a href="http://www.accel.com/noteworthy/our-seed-in-altinity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog article about the seed investment</a>. He was enthusiastic but also very patient.That was fortunate, because we then talked to 43 other VCs at greater or lesser length over the next year and a half. The count omits those who greeted our overtures with stony silence. In the end we were absolutely confident Dan and Accel were the right choice. At the same time, we learned from many others.</p><p>Looking back, it is apparent we did more than just collect a check from a great investment team. We also learned a number of valuable lessons about early stage venture investment.&nbsp; Many of these were not obvious, at least to me. In this article I will share what we learned, along with a spreadsheet we developed to help with investment math. I hope our account will be useful — or at least entertaining!</p><p><h2 id="h-what-do-vcs-really-want">What do VCs really want?</h2>
</p><p>VC websites often sport brave slogans like “we are looking for bold entrepreneurs who will change the world.” What they are actually looking for, of course, is far more concrete: a big return on a speculative bet about a new business. The first thing we learned was how venture capital actually works and how we fit in.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s start with where the money comes from and how it is managed. Venture capital firms operate one or more funds, which they use to make investments. Each venture capital firm has general partners who work for the company, decide where to invest, and take care of serving on boards and other duties required to supervise each investment.&nbsp; There is also another type of partner, known as a limited partner or LP. LPs can be wealthy individuals, pension funds, sovereign investment funds, you name it. They supply cash but have no role in making investment decisions. Here is a picture.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="954" height="368" src="https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture.png" alt="" srcset="https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture.png 954w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-300x116.png 300w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-768x296.png 768w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-600x231.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 954px) 100vw, 954px" data-lazy-srcset="https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture.png 954w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-300x116.png 300w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-768x296.png 768w, https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture-600x231.png 600w" data-lazy-src="https://altinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-we-learned-from-accel-blog-investment-fund-picture.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
</div><p>In the first meeting with a new VC you typically hear about the current funds, how big they are, and other details like reserves for follow-on investments in promising companies. When you ask what payback they are seeking the most frequent answer is “return the fund.” This is so common that I stopped writing it down unless the answer was something different. It means the investment in your company needs to pay out at the value of the entire fund, not just what the VC put into your company. The reason has to do with the mechanics of the funds.</p><p>Most startups fail or return money that does not come close to covering the investment. To provide a decent return to limited partners and VC general partners plus pay overhead, at least a couple of investments need to hit home runs and to pay off at full value of the fund. It’s basic math, but the numbers are big. Say a $400M fund invests $40M total for a 25% share of your startup, a typical target percentage. To return the fund means that the startup will have to exit for $1.6B ($400M = $1.6B * 25%). Grand slams like <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/these-were-the-biggest-winners-in-snowflakes-record-busting-ipo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snowflake</a> return far more and make the fund very successful.&nbsp;</p><p>At first it was disconcerting when A-list VC prospects baldly asked how we would get them an exit in the $1B+ range. Over time I developed empathy for this attitude. VC general partners have to make the math work or find another job. Meanwhile entrepreneurs need to have a problem that fits the pattern of investment or venture funding does not make a lot of sense. That’s the economic reality and has little to do with how individual VCs feel about you personally, or even about your business.&nbsp;</p><p>We needed to articulate to ourselves how we would win in a large market–SQL data warehouses–filled with a lot of savvy competitors like Amazon and Snowflake. The classic strategy is to create a <em><span>new</span> </em>market that did not previously exist, then become the leader. Anurag Gupta and his colleagues at Amazon put it brilliantly <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2723372.2742795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a paper on Amazon Redshift</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><em>Our goal with Amazon Redshift was not to compete with other data warehousing engines, but to compete with non-consumption.&nbsp;</em></p><p>The unique differentiation of ClickHouse is that it is open source and runs anywhere: from public clouds down to Android phones. Any developer on the planet can download it and add high performance analytics to any application without sacrificing portability or scaling. That’s an enormous expansion of the market that will fuel innovation not just at the database level but will extend to new applications of big data as well as the tools and platforms to run them.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s another key insight: it took months to be able to state that value proposition in three sentences. It’s like learning a new language — anyone can learn to say hello but achieving fluency requires real work.&nbsp;</p><p>We did a lot of modeling to understand the growth trajectory needed to achieve the kind of revenue our predecessors are making. One of the conclusions was that we needed to build a great cloud platform for ClickHouse. It’s a tried-and-true way to build a successful business, especially for companies that manage data, and one that our customers have confirmed as a fruitful path to growth. We believe in the plan and it matches venture capital economics.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-vcs-work-off-a-thesis">VCs Work Off a Thesis</h2>
</p><p>I didn’t know a lot of early stage VCs when we began fund-raising, though like everyone I heard they were fine human beings worthy of acquaintance. The initial conversations were illuminating in one particular respect. Venture capitalists don’t necessarily know that much about specific technology or markets.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an example. My favorite demo for ClickHouse is the <a href="https://youtu.be/zDIK3Ej86GU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ClickHouse-fast demo</a> where I first run a query on data generated purely in memory followed by a similar query that accesses 1.3 billion rows of taxi data in slowish network-attached storage. I usually pause dramatically after the in-memory query to ask which query is going to be faster. Everybody knows access to memory is faster than storage, right?</p><p>Actually, in this demo it’s not. You have to be very careful to make an apples-to-apples comparison when comparing memory and storage access speeds. ClickHouse compresses stored data and parallelizes I/O extremely well. Reading from storage is therefore very fast. With ClickHouse it is not hard to choose in-memory queries that look similar but run far slower because they have a different execution path with less parallelization or other inefficiencies. It’s a subtle point that experienced database people understand, whereas VCs I talked to often got it wrong. (And then argued about it, too.)&nbsp;</p><p>This experience illustrates that deep dives on technology are not always the best way to evaluate early stage businesses. Good VCs tend to look for proxies that indicate signs of traction. In our case Dan Levine knew about ClickHouse because his other start-up investments used it. Dan pays really close attention to things they like. Dan picked up on ClickHouse earlier and more clearly than anyone we spoke to. The fact that we were an experienced team already selling services profitably was perhaps another useful signal. But Dan was also looking for more than just specific signals–he was looking for a pattern related to data, backed by a solid team.&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, we found that the VCs who really picked up on our story had a thesis about the value of combining two things:&nbsp;</p><div><ul>
<li>Data – Faster and more cost effective ways of analyzing large datasets are inherently valuable to enterprises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Open source – There are standard models for marketing and monetizing open source projects to build very large businesses</li>
</ul>
</div><p>VCs with these convictions tended to like what we were doing overall, though they often found specific things they didn’t like: open source community too small, too much competition, not the right team, already made a competing investment, etc. That said, we didn’t argue about the size of the market or whether open source was the right overall strategy to reach it.&nbsp;It helped that the original developers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickHouse">ClickHouse at Yandex</a> did an amazing job of open sourcing the code and starting a great community around it. </p><p>Not surprisingly, we learned that those same investors were precisely the people we wanted backing the company. Not only did we share key assumptions about the business, but they had funded such businesses before with successful outcomes. Because of that they could offer useful advice on big topics like strategy to build open source communities or workable business models.&nbsp; They could also connect us with outstanding people like Mike Olson of Cloudera (and many others) who had worked through similar problems and could help us see around corners.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a final insight that relates back to the technology point I made above. VCs can identify promising companies, but they can’t tell you how to run yours. As an entrepreneur you understand the technology, your customers, and what is feasible to achieve. We had a number of debates with potential investors about details of the business plan.</p><p>For example, many VCs favor pure cloud services, because the best ones experience explosive growth and high margins. However, a push-button service is not a complete solution, especially for complex enterprise products like databases. Altinity has been in business since 2017 and we have articulate users who say they want us to take care of running ClickHouse in the cloud. They also want application tools, new server features, training, support, and implementation help. Their problem is not just to deploy a database but to create applications that add value to their own business. If you help them do that you have a much more competitive business.&nbsp;</p><p>Our mission is to help any enterprise that uses ClickHouse. We provide everything customers need to be successful with ClickHouse, <em>including</em> a great cloud service. We also support the ClickHouse …</p></div></div>

<p>As part of my work on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agave.com/" target="_blank">Agave</a>, I needed to find a way to render a virtual office in a web application. I also needed the ability to maintain a high engineering velocity and get high leverage out of the libraries we chose.</p>



<p>So far, the biggest learning experience for me has been isometric rendering. You know isometric rendering. It’s that sort of 2.5-dimension look that some video games have, where you’re sort of looking down from the top right on the map. Some examples:</p>

<p>Perhaps the most appropriate modern example is the intro scene to HBO’s Silicon Valley:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>From the start, we had a vision of a virtual office in this style. It would be significantly more immersive than a flat (two-dimensional) map, and afforded the opportunity for some seriously cool experiences. (Plus, Jared and I both loved playing these games when we were kids.)</p>



<p>This was a daunting task, as I had no experience in video game design or programming. I ended up watching a ton of different YouTube videos on the topic in an effort to find my way. I didn’t really even know what I was looking for – it was sort of an immersive, random process.</p>



<p>I have been a longtime fan of Id software, Doom in particular, and have followed John Carmack for a long time. So, naturally I ordered a copy of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1099819776/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">The Game Engine Black Book: Doom</a> and read it cover to cover in three days. I learned a lot!</p>



<p>I was most interested in how the engine worked and, in particular, rendering:</p>

<p>I finally figured out that what we were looking for was called <strong>isometric</strong> rendering. Here’s what I learned.</p>



<h2>Cartesian vs. Isometric</h2>



<p>On a 2d game, there is simply a cartesian map. It has x and y coordinates. If you were to lay out the old-school board game <strong>Risk</strong> onto its cartesian map, it would look something like this:</p>

<p>Conventionally the top left cell is 0,0 (the origin). So, where I live in South Lake Tahoe would be somewhere inside 5,5, or maybe 6,5. </p>



<p>Cartesian grids are trivial to store in memory as two dimensional arrays. And, even in games like Sim City, all of the units, characters, items, really anything on the map has a coordinate in the Cartesian plane. So to store the data for our virtual office, we’d need a simple two dimensional array that indicates where each avatar, furniture, etc all exist in the office.</p>



<p>Next, we needed artwork for everything. We started with floor tiles. Here’s an example of the sprite we used:</p>

<p>As you can see, this is not a square. It’s a square tile as seen from the top-right. It’s also not technically a <strong>perspective</strong> sprite because the lines do not converge to the horizon – they remain parallel. It’s an <strong>isometric</strong> sprite. To make things more confusing, the image file itself is a rectangular, transparent PNG. Here’s a closer look:</p>

<p>And, it turns out, the tile itself has a height of 5 pixels, meaning the “top” of the tile is 50×25. It’s half as tall as it is wide.</p>



<p>After some fiddling I had produced the following map by rendering each tile individually (in a loop) in order from “top left” to “bottom right”:</p>

<p>It got confusing quickly. The “top left” when looked at isometrically is actually in the top of the screen, slightly to the right of center!</p>



<p>So I needed to figure out how to place avatars and other items onto the map from my cartesian grid. The brown-haired avatar on the left is “at” location 5,12. I had to figure out how to convert from cartesian to isometric so that I could tell the game engine precisely where to render the avatar.</p>



<p>If we were just rendering on a Cartesian plane, I could simply tell the engine to render an item at 2,2 by multiplying by the width of one tile in the grid:</p>



<pre><code>screen_x_coord = cartesian_x * tile_width
screen_y_coord = cartesian_y * tile_height</code></pre>



<p>However, this only works with a square grid. Our isometric grid is not exactly a square. This illustrates the problem better than I can explain:</p>

<p>Thinking this through: for every 1 cell “right” we want to go, we’re actually going “right” by 1/2 a tile <em>width</em> and “down” by 1/2 a tile <em>height</em>. Like this:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1449" data-permalink="https://davepaola.com/2020/10/02/what-ive-learned-about-isometric-rendering/img_572c53bca2e5-1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_572C53BCA2E5-1.jpeg?fit=1229%2C605&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1229,605" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="IMG_572C53BCA2E5-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_572C53BCA2E5-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C148&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_572C53BCA2E5-1.jpeg?fit=660%2C325&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="660" height="325" src="https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_572C53BCA2E5-1.jpeg?resize=660%2C325&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_572C53BCA2E5-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C504&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_572C53BCA2E5-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C148&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_572C53BCA2E5-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C378&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_572C53BCA2E5-1.jpeg?resize=553%2C272&amp;ssl=1 553w, https://i0.wp.com/davepaola.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_572C53BCA2E5-1.jpeg?w=1229&amp;ssl=1 1229w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>







<p>So, we have a new formula:</p>



<pre><code>screen_x_coord = cartesian_x * (tile_width / 2) - cartesian_y * (tile_width / 2)
screen_y_coord = cartesian_y * (tile_height / 2) + cartesian_x * (tile_height / 2)</code></pre>



<p>Plugging these values in gives the right map location and everything looked great.</p>

<p>The other thing I wanted was the ability to click somewhere on the map and move your avatar to that location. This meant I had to detect the x,y coordinates on the screen that the mouse clicked, reverse the above conversion from isometric to cartesian, move the avatar in the 2d arrays and then re-render them isometrically. </p>



<p>Whew! Lots of steps to simply render an item at a specific set of coordinates. </p>



<p>Another wrinkle that I ran into was that rendering a sprite “at” a location is not very well defined. If I’m trying to render a square image at a particular cell, by default many game engines place the top left of the image at the defined location. That won’t work for us since we need our characters to be “standing” in a particular cell. So much of our rendering code actually does even more arithmetic by adjusting the coordinates according to the width and height of the sprite such that the bottom-center of the image (where the character’s feet are) become the “anchor” point and we render the item “at” a coordinate by place it’s bottom-center in the defined coordinates:</p>

<p>There were lots of other challenges along the way, including representing the whole thing as a grid, determining which sections of the map are “walkable” so that we can use a pathfinding algorithm, finding the right “pace” a character walks across the map, and more. And I’m just scratching the surface on the types of challenges – I haven’t even mentioned our proximity video conversations that enable magical serendipitous moments, the interactive relic system we’ve devised, native operating system components and much more.</p>

<p>To sum it up: I learned a lot in this process and continue to learn more every day. Agave is truly a cross-disciplinary project – it requires more than simply building features to a spec. Blending the engineering of game engines with the art of sprite design (and even interior design!) has been a super cool thing to be a part of. I can’t wait to show it to you.</p>

The order finds that BMW of North America LLC (BMW NA) maintained a reserve of unreported retail vehicle sales — referred to internally as the “bank” — that it used to meet internal monthly sales targets without regard to when the underlying sales occurred. The order also finds that BMW NA paid dealers to inaccurately designate vehicles as demonstrators or loaners so that BMW would count them as having been sold to customers when they had not been. Additionally, the order finds that BMW NA improperly adjusted its retail sales reporting calendar in 2015 and 2017 to meet internal sales targets or bank excess retail sales for future use. As a result, according to the order, the information that BMW provided to investors in the bond offerings by BMW’s U.S. financing subsidiary, BMW US Capital LLC, and to credit rating agencies contained material misstatements and omissions regarding BMW’s U.S. retail vehicle sales.</p><cite><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-223</a></cite></blockquote><p>After having spent 43 years in the car business (many of which with BMW North America), I can unequivocally say these practices are routine and commonplace within car dealerships. Fraudulent behavior like this is not limited to BMW. Every manufacturer I have ever worked for encourages this.</p><p>When I worked for Penske Automotive Group we were explicitly instructed not to fudge any numbers. If our BMW rep asked us to “pad the numbers” one month, we didn’t. Penske didn’t want to participate in that type of activity. They were the exception to the rule.</p><p>As a dealer you have very little choice but to “play the game.” As I’ve talked about in other videos and guides here on the blog, car dealers don’t make much of anything when they sell vehicles. Instead, <a href="https://yourautoadvocate.com/guides/how-do-car-dealerships-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they make their money from factory incentives and from selling finance and insurance products</a>.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTYnhidJMe8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>With that in mind, it’s clear why dealers “play the game.” If you have a $250,000 incentive that is based on the number of cars you sell in any given month, and the person writing you that check (BMW) is encouraging you to “fake” sales so that you can actually attain the bonus, what would you do? The answer is simple.</p><p>Car manufacturers are happy to pay out giant monthly bonuses to subsidize their dealers, but only if they hit certain sales volume thresholds. This is because manufacturers are then able to report better than expected sales volumes to their investors.</p><p>How many fraudulently reported vehicles are “sold” in any given month? In any given month we would designate 15 Mini Coopers as “sold,” even though they hadn’t been. In that same month we may have actually sold 35 or 40 vehicles. Each month, upwards of 20% of our “sales” were fake.</p><p>It’s surprising to think that BMW was only fined $18M. Considering a nontrivial amount of their sold inventory is not actually sold, you would think the fine should be $180M instead of $18M.</p><p>Fiat Chrysler paid $40M in fines a few years ago for similar practices. Regardless of who it is, it’s clear that the fines aren’t enough to stop the fraudulent behavior.</p>

You also need to download the <a href="https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-cli/releases/tag/1.0.0">OpenWhisk CLI tool <code>wsk</code></a> for your operating system in order to interact with OpenWhisk.</p><p>Once prerequisites are satisfied, you can start a local OpenWhisk with the following command:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">bash &lt;(curl -sL https://s.apache.org/openwhisk.sh)
</code></pre></div><p>The command will download a Docker image for standalone OpenWhisk and it will start it. It will also open the playground, that you can use to create and run a function on the fly from your browser.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/playground-ui.png" alt="Playground"></p><p>Once you have OpenWhisk up and running you can configure the <code>wsk</code> tool to access it. OpenWhisk access is protected by a key that you have to retrieve and use to configure <code>wsk</code>, as follows:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">AUTH=$(docker exec openwhisk wsk property get --auth | awk '{ print $3}')
wsk property set --auth $AUTH --apihost http://localhost:3233
</code></pre></div><p>Now let’s build our chess engine and use the local OpenWhisk to test it locally. The source code of the chess engine <a href="https://github.com/openwhisk-blog/whisk-chess">is available on GitHub</a>.</p><p>The code is based on a freely available chess engine called <a href="https://github.com/ChizhovVadim/CounterGo/pulls">CounterGo</a>. It is written in Go. I adapted it to run as a stateless serverless action, and I added a frontend in JavaScript, using the libraries <a href="https://chessboardjs.com/">Chessboardjs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js">chess.js</a>.</p><p>In order to build the action, you need common tools like <code>git</code>, <code>make</code> and <code>docker</code>. Once you have them you can download and build the sources with the commands:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">git clone https://github.com/openwhisk-blog/whisk-chess
cd whisk-chess
make
</code></pre></div><p>Note that you do not need a Go compiler to build the action, just Docker, as you can compile the action using the OpenWhisk Go runtime itself. The result is the file <code>chess.zip</code> containing a pre-compiled Go action ready to be deployed.</p><p>Once you have the action, you use the following command to deploy it in OpenWhisk:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">wsk action update chess chess.zip --kind go:1.11 --web true
</code></pre></div><p>Finally you can retrieve the URL of the action with the command:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">wsk action get chess --url
</code></pre></div><p>If you now type the URL in a browser you will see the user interface of our chess engine, a chessboard, and you can play chess against the computer.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/chess.png" alt="Chess"></p><p>Now let’s start deploying our chess in the services of the various vendors that offer OpenWhisk.</p><p><a href="https://nimbella.com/">Nimbella</a> offers a serverless solution based on OpenWhisk and focused on providing an “awesome developer experience”.</p><p>I think it is appropriate to say that I work for Nimbella, but I am trying to be neutral in this article and offer a fair comparison of all the OpenWhisk vendors I am aware of.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/020.png" alt="Nimbella"></p><p>Nimbella uses its own CLI called <code>nim</code> for deployment. The Nimbella CLI was recently <a href="https://github.com/nimbella/nimbella-cli/">open sourced</a>. You need to sign-up and login to use their service. Once you are logged in, you can deploy our chess action and get an URL for it. The <code>nim login</code> command conveniently permits sign-up.
The CLI is available <a href="https://nimbella.io/downloads/nim/nim.html#install-the-nimbella-command-line-tool-nim">for download</a> for Mac OS, Windows and Linux.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">nim login
nim action update chess chess.zip --kind go:1.12 --web true
nim action get chess --url
</code></pre></div><p>It is possible to use the <code>wsk</code> CLI with Nimbella if one prefers it. You’ll notice the command is identical here to the one shown earlier but replaced <code>wsk</code> with <code>nim</code>.</p><p><a href="https://apigcp.nimbella.io/api/v1/web/msciabar-zc3thebgxgh/default/chess">Follow this link to play chess on Nimbella</a>.</p><p>The IBM cloud was the original cloud offering OpenWhisk as a service.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/030.png" alt="IBM"></p><p>You need to download and install the <code>ibmcloud</code> CLI in order to deploy actions to IBM. There are also some requirements like downloading a plugin and to target a space; all the steps are explained on their website.</p><p>They offer a generous free tier for running functions. You need to register on their website to use a very large number of function invocations for free.</p><p>Once you downloaded the tool, the commands to deploy the chess engine and get an URL to run the action are:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">ibmcloud login -u "$IBMUSER" -p "$IBMPASS"
ibmcloud fn action update chess chess.zip --kind go:1.11
ibmcloud fn action get chess --url
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://eu-de.functions.appdomain.cloud/api/v1/web/a1d40f6b-e5e3-4f07-8f92-77b525392253/default/chess">Follow this link to play Chess on IBM Cloud.</a></p><p>Naver is a Korean company, owner of the main search engine in the Korean language, but also offering cloud services. The Naver Cloud Platform uses OpenWhisk to implement cloud functions.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/040.png" alt="Naver"></p><p>Currently Naver does not offer a CLI to deploy actions, however I was told a CLI is actually under development. For now I deployed the chess action using their web interface.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/041.png" alt="Naver Deploy"></p><p><a href="https://wka9bi13u3.apigw.ntruss.com/chess/chess/ZC2o7bFh0x/http">Follow this link to play Chess on Naver.</a></p><p>Adobe has a serverless offering based on OpenWhisk too. It is called the <a href="https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/runtime.html">Adobe I/O Runtime</a>.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/045.png" alt="Adobe I/O"></p><p>Adobe I/O Runtime currently supports only Node.js based runtimes, so if you pick them as your serverless function providers you have to write your serverless functions in JavaScript. However being based on OpenWhisk, it is possible to use other runtimes by request, and so we can also run our chess engine. I thank the team at Adobe for their kind support and help in deploying my action for demonstration purposes.</p><p><a href="https://whisk-chess.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/default/chess">Follow this link to play Chess on Adobe I/O.</a></p><p>Finally, you can run OpenWhisk in any cluster supporting Kubernetes. For this purpose, I created an EKS cluster on AWS and installed OpenWhisk on it, then I deployed my chess application. I will show here how to do that quickly and easily.</p><p><img src="https://openwhisk.blog/post/advocate/openwhisk-portable-serverless/053.png" alt="AWS"></p><p>You will need to create and configure an AWS account. I refer you to AWS documentation for information how to do this.</p><p>Once I created an account, I installed the <a href="https://eksctl.io/"><code>eksctl</code></a> tool that makes easy to create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.</p><p>Also you need to install the <a href="https://helm.sh/"><code>helm</code></a> deployment tool and use it to actually install OpenWhisk. You can download the helm chart from GitHub and install OpenWhisk as follows:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">git clone https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube
cd openwhisk-deploy-kube/helm
</code></pre></div><p>Once everything is ready your can create a Kubernetes cluster and install OpenWhisk with just 3 commands:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">eksctl create cluster --name openwhisk
eksctl create nodegroup --cluster openwhisk --node-labels openwhisk-role=invoker
helm install --set whisk.ingress.type=LoadBalancer openwhisk ./openwhisk
</code></pre></div><p>The cluster creation will take a while. Once it is completed you will get your private OpenWhisk service running in AWS, and you can deploy your chess application to it.</p><p>You can use the <code>wsk</code> or <code>nim</code> CLIs to deploy to OpenWhisk. You have to retrieve the location of the Apache OpenWhisk entry point, and the authorization key and pass them to the CLI tool. The required commands using <code>nim</code> are:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">cd whisk-chess
APIHOST=$(kubectl  get svc | awk '/openwhisk-nginx/ { print $4}')
AUTH=$(cat openwhisk/values.yaml |  awk '/guest/ { print $2}' | tr -d '"')
nim auth login --apihost http://$APIHOST --auth $AUTH
</code></pre></div><p>It is important to note that we configured an insecure setup because we are accessing OpenWhisk over the unencrypted HTTP protocol.</p><p>In a real world setup you will need additional steps to setup an HTTPS endpoint with a certificate. You will find relevant details in the <a href="https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube">helm chart GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>Once you retrieved the API host and authentication key, you can deploy your chess app, and get the URL.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">nim action create chess chess.zip --web true --kind go:1.11
nim action get chess --url
</code></pre></div><p>I cannot provide a URL in this case as I a destroyed the cluster after testing, however, you can see the result in the image at the beginning of the paragraph.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>After my <a href="https://nitschinger.at/Rusty-PID-Porting-the-TSic-sensor-from-C-to-Rust">last blog post</a> on the TSIC 306 temperature sensor port to Rust, someone on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/j1g4tp/porting_the_tsic_sensor_from_c_to_rust/g720uww/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Reddit</a> mentioned that it does not provide any guidance on how to get the code samples actually running on the chip.</p>
<p>So this post takes a step back and runs you through the basics of setting up a project, configuring it properly and finally running different examples.</p>
<p>Before we dive in I want to mention that I’m still quite new to the embedded world, so some of the information might not be accurate or misleading. If you run into issues please comment below and I’ll do my best to get them fixed.</p>
<p>Also, I noticed that especially this part of the Rust ecosystem evolves very quickly. So if you read this post some time in 2021 or later, double check the tooling and see if it has been further improved.</p>
<p>The full code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/daschl/nrf52840dk-sample">this repository</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hardware: <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits/nRF52840-DK">nRF52840 DK</a></li>
<li>OS: macOS 10.15.6</li>
<li>Rust: 1.46.0 installed through <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://nitschinger.at/img/nrf-without-usb.jpg" alt="nRF Without USB"></p>
<p>For this post I’m using the <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits/nRF52840-DK">nRF52840 DK</a> which contains an Arm Cortex-M4 processor with floating point support. The development kit also contains lots of ports and features that you can use to experiment. Check out the <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/-/media/Software-and-other-downloads/Product-Briefs/nRF52840-DK-product-brief.pdf">Product Brief</a> for all details.</p>
<p>I first tried to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32">ESP32</a>, but I struggled to get it working properly because you need to use a custom LLVM fork and the tooling isn’t there yet. I picked the nRF52840, because <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/">ferrous systems</a> were running an embedded workshop using this board and they are so kind as to provide their material <a href="https://embedded-trainings.ferrous-systems.com/">free online</a>. I figured this might be the easiest way to start exploring Rust embedded, and indeed it has been pretty painless.</p>

<p>Since the initial release of the workshop material (which contained lots of custom code to run, log and flash), many of their tools have been extended and found a new home inside the <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/">knurling-rs github organization</a>. In particular, we are going to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run">probe-run</a>: a custom cargo runner to transparently flash and run our programs.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt">defmt</a>: for easy and efficient logging back to the host.</li>
</ul>
<p>probe-run uses the <a href="https://probe.rs/">probe-rs</a> debugging toolkit underneath which is adding features and support for more targets all the time so you might be able to use a similar process as below for your own board.</p>
<p>The development kit needs to be connected to your computer via USB like shown in the picture below:</p>
<p><img src="https://nitschinger.at/img/nrf-with-usb.jpg" alt="nRF With USB"></p>
<p>It is important to use the USB port on the left and not the one at the bottom, because I think that’s the only port which contains the J-Link debugging probe (which we are going to use to flash and run our code). <a href="https://embedded-trainings.ferrous-systems.com/hardware.html#nrf52840-development-kit-dk">This</a> section in the training material describes it in greater detail.</p>

<p>Note: if you want to cut corners, you can also use the <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart">Cortex-M Template</a>. In this post we’ll start from an empty cargo project and work our way to a flashed device.</p>
<p>Let’s first start with an empty crate:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new nrf52840dk-sample --bin
</code></pre><p>Other than just compiling our code fine with <code>rustc</code>, we also need to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>cross-compile for our embedded target. In our case this is <code>thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code>.</li>
<li>send the compiled code to our target. We’ll use <code>probe-rs</code> for this task through <code>probe-run</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To allow us to cross-compile, we need to make sure that <code>rustup</code> has the toolchain needed for our target:</p>
<pre><code>$ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
</code></pre><p>Since by default <code>cargo</code> will build for the host platform we are on, we instruct it through a custom <code>.cargo/config.toml</code> that we always want to build for our target platform instead:</p>
<pre><code>[build]
target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf"
</code></pre><p>Next up, let’s work on our <code>main.rs</code>. Our embedded device does not have a full operating system installed, which means we cannot use the standard library. Also, our entry point into the program is not <code>main</code> because the usual bootstrapping infrastructure is not available.</p>
<p>These two attributes hint it to rust:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>#![no_main]</span>
<span>#![no_std]</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"Hello, world!"</span>);
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>If we try to run this on our host, we’ll see the following:</p>
<pre><code>error: cannot find macro `println` in this scope
 --&gt; src/main.rs:5:5
  |
5 |     println!("Hello, world!");
  |     ^^^^^^^

error: `#[panic_handler]` function required, but not found

error: aborting due to 2 previous errors
error: could not compile `nrf52840dk-sample`.
To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
</code></pre><p>This tells us two things: first, the <code>println!</code> macro is not available (this is why we are going to use <code>defmt</code> later). Second, we need a panic handler. At this point, things get a bit tricky and we need to bring in our first dependencies (in <code>Cargo.toml</code>):</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
cortex-m = "0.6.3"
cortex-m-rt = "0.6.12"
defmt = { git = "https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt", branch = "main" }
defmt-rtt = { git = "https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt", branch = "main" }
nrf52840-hal = "0.11.0"
</code></pre><p>The <code>cortex-m</code> and <code>cortex-m-rt</code> crates are our board support crates and provide the hardware abstractions we need in a minute. Since we cannot use println and friends, we include <code>defmt</code> to provide us with a decent logging infrastructure.</p>
<p>Also, to enable <code>defmt</code> logging we need to add these features:</p>
<pre><code>[features]
# set logging levels here
default = [
  "defmt-default",
]

# do NOT modify these features
defmt-default = []
defmt-trace = []
defmt-debug = []
defmt-info = []
defmt-warn = []
defmt-error = []
</code></pre><p>If those are not present, the code will compile but you won’t see log output on the console.</p>
<p>Ok, so now we can rework our <code>main</code> function a little bit:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>#[cortex_m_rt::entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() -&gt; <span>!</span> {
    defmt::info<span>!</span>(<span>"Hello, World!"</span>);
    exit();
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>You’ll notice that we switched to <code>defmt</code> for logging, and also use the <code>cortex_m_rt</code> to provide us with an entry function into our program that is compatible with the nRF board.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to set up our panic handler and an <code>exit</code> function. Note that this is a very simplistic version but helps to get us off the ground:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3
</span><span> 4
</span><span> 5
</span><span> 6
</span><span> 7
</span><span> 8
</span><span> 9
</span><span>10
</span><span>11
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>#[panic_handler]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>panic</span>(_info: <span>&amp;</span><span>core</span>::panic::PanicInfo) -&gt; <span>!</span> {
    defmt::error<span>!</span>(<span>"panicked"</span>);
    exit()
}

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>exit</span>() -&gt; <span>!</span> {
    <span>loop</span> {
        cortex_m::asm::bkpt();
    }
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>A <code>cargo run</code> attempt later, we are much closer:</p>
<pre><code>    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
     Running `target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/nrf52840dk-sample`
target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/nrf52840dk-sample: target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/nrf52840dk-sample: cannot execute binary file
</code></pre><p>We did not get any compile errors, but of course we cannot run an arm executable on our host machine. Time to flash our device!</p>
<p>To do this, we need to install <code>probe-run</code>. For now we need to install it from git because we need the <code>defmt</code> support. At some point in the future I’m sure you can just install it from a stable version:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo install probe-run --git https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run.git --branch main -f --features defmt
</code></pre><p>While this installs, we need to open our <code>.cargo/config.toml</code> file once again and enable the custom cargo runner:</p>
<pre><code>[target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
runner = "probe-run --chip nRF52840_xxAA  --defmt"
rustflags = [
  "-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.x",
  "-C", "link-arg=-Tdefmt.x",
]

[build]
target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf"
</code></pre><p>All these properties and flags are from the <code>probe-run</code> docs. If you are using a different chip, I think you can use <code>probe-run --list-chips</code> to find the right one for your device.</p>
<p>At this point we could try to run it, but there are two issues remaining. <code>defmt</code> wouldn’t log anything, and we are lacking our memory layout for the <code>nrf52840</code>.</p>
<p>So, we finally need to add these two lines before our main function:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>use</span> defmt_rtt <span>as</span> _; <span>// global logger
</span><span></span><span>use</span> nrf52840_hal <span>as</span> _; <span>// memory layout
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Finally, when we now type <code>cargo run</code>, the program gets flashed onto our device successfully:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>With that little victory under our belt, let’s try one more thing: access a peripheral sensor and display its state. In my previous post I used an external sensor, but we can also use a built-in one. The board features a <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fps_nrf52840%2Ftemp.html&amp;cp=3_0_0_5_27">temperature sensor</a> which measures the temperature of the processor.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to add are two more imports for the <code>Peripherals</code> in general and our <code>Temp</code> sensor specifically:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>use</span> nrf52840_hal::pac::Peripherals;
<span>use</span> nrf52840_hal::temp::Temp;
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Inside our main function, we first need to take ownership of the <code>Peripherals</code> and then feed the right <code>TEMP</code> peripheral to our struct:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>// Take ownership of the device peripherals
</span><span></span><span>let</span> peripherals <span>=</span> Peripherals::take().unwrap();

<span>// Access to the temp sensor
</span><span></span><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> temp_sensor <span>=</span> Temp::new(peripherals.TEMP);
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Now all we need to do is read the temperature from the sensor and convert it to a <code>i32</code> so that <code>defmt</code> can log it for us:</p>
<div><div>

<h3>Introduction and Goals</h3>
<p>
For years, I have been joking with my students that I would teach probability with the same level of excitement even if I were woken up in the middle of the night and asked to teach it. Years later, as a new father, I started writing this book when it became clear to me that I would not be sleeping at night for the foreseeable future.
</p>

<p>
This book is intended for undergraduate and first-year graduate-level courses in probability, statistics, and random processes. My goal has been to provide a clear and intuitive approach to these topics while maintaining an acceptable level of mathematical accuracy.
</p>

<p>
I have been teaching two courses on this subject for several years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. While one of these courses is an undergraduate course taken by juniors, the other is a graduate-level course taken by our first-year Masters and PhD students.
</p>

<p>
My goal throughout this process has been to write a textbook that has the flexibility to be used in <i>both</i> courses while sacrificing neither the quality nor the presentational needs of either course. To achieve such a goal, I have tried to minimize the dependency between different sections of the book. In particular, when a small part from a different section of the book is useful elsewhere within the text, I have repeated said part rather than simply referring to it. My reasoning for doing so is twofold. Firstly, this format should make it easier for students to read the book and, secondly, this format should allow instructors the flexibility to select individual sections from the book more easily.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, I wanted the book to be easy to read and accessible as a self-study reference. It was also imperative that the book be available to anyone in the world, and as such the book in its entirety can be found online at www.probabilitycourse.com.
</p>

<p>
The book contains a large number of solved exercises. In addition to the examples found within the text, there is a set of solved problems at the end of each section. Detailed and step-by-step solutions to these problems are provided to help students learn problem-solving techniques. The solutions to the end-of-chapter problems, however, are available only to instructors.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, throughout the book, some examples of applications$-$such as engineering, finance, everyday life, etc.$-$are provided to aid in motivating the subject. These examples have been worded to be understandable to all students. As such, some technical issues have been left out.
</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3><p>

After a brief review of set theory and other required mathematical concepts, the text covers topics as follows:
</p><ul>
  <li> Chapters 1 and 2: basic concepts such as random experiments, probability axioms, conditional probability, law of total probability, Bayes' rule, and counting methods;</li>
  <li> Chapters 3 through 6: single and multiple random variables (discrete, continuous, and mixed), as well as moment-generating functions, characteristics functions, random vectors, and inequalities;</li>
  <li> Chapter 7: limit theorems and convergence;</li>
  <li> Chapters 8 and 9: Bayesian and classical statistics;</li>
  <li> Chapters 10: Introduction to random processes, processing of random signals;</li>
  <li> Chapter 11: Poisson processes, discrete-time Markov chains, continuous-time Markov chains, and Brownian motion;</li>
  <li> Chapter 12: basic methods of generating random variables and simulating probabilistic systems (using MATLAB);</li>
  <li> Chapter 13: basic methods of generating random variables and simulating probabilistic systems (using R);</li>
  <li> Chapter 14: recursive methods;</li>
</ul>
<p>
All chapters are available at <a href="http://www.probabilitycourse.com/">www.probabilitycourse.com</a>. Chapters 12 through 14 are available as PDFs and are downloadable from the textbook website. Chapters 12 and 13 cover the same material. The difference is that the codes in chapter 12 are provided in MATLAB while the codes in Chapter 13 are provided in R. The reason for this again is to give flexibility to instructors and students to choose whichever they prefer. Nevertheless, students who are unfamiliar with MATLAB and R should still be able to understand the algorithms.
</p>

<h3>Required Background</h3><p>
The majority of the text does not require any previous knowledge apart from a one-semester course in calculus. The exceptions to this statement are as follows:
</p><ul>
  <li> Sections 5.2 (Two Continuous Random Variables) and 6.1 (Methods for More Than Two Random Variables) both require a light introduction to double integrals and partial derivatives;</li>
  <li> Section 6.1.5 (Random Vectors) uses a few concepts from linear algebra;</li>
  <li> Section 10.2 (Processing of Random Signals) requires familiarity with the Fourier transform.</li>
</ul>

  <article>
    <p>Boa is an experimental Javascript lexer, parser and compiler written in Rust. It has support for some of the language, can be embedded in Rust projects fairly easily and also used from the command line.
Boa also exists to serve as a Rust implementation of the EcmaScript specification, there will be areas where we can utilise Rust and its fantastic ecosystem to make a fast, concurrent and safe engine.</p>

<p>We have a long way to go, however v0.10 has been the biggest release to date, with 138 issues closed!</p>

<p>We have some highlights, but if you prefer to read the full changelog, you can do that <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">here</a></p>

<h2 id="test262">Test262</h2>

<p>One question we’ve been asked for a long time is “how conformant are you to the spec?”. It’s been tough to answer as we’ve been unable to run against the official test suite.</p>

<p>Test262 is the official ECMAScript Test Suite and exists to provide conformance tests for the latest drafts of the Ecma specification. It is used for all engines, you can even run it in your <a href="https://bakkot.github.io/test262-web-runner/">browser</a>.<br>
Thanks to @Razican in v0.10 we now have a test harness that allows us to run it against Boa at any time.</p>

<p>This is a new crate inside the Boa repository that can parse through all of the tests (roughly 40,000 of them) in under 10 minutes and tell us how conformant we are.</p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-10-02/test262-screenshot.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Today Boa has <span>18</span>% conformity to the specification. We’ll be keeping an eye on this number over the releases. We expect to achieve around 30% by 0.11 due to some of the fixes we’re adding which should pass a few thousand tests.</p>

<p>These are run via Github Actions against PRs and for our master branch so that we can keep track of where we are and if there are regressions.</p>

<h2 id="built-ins">Built-ins</h2>

<p>We’ve added support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"><code>Date</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map"><code>Map</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol">well-known symbols</a>. Supporting Well-known symbols unblocks a lot of work around adding <code>@@iterators</code> to some of our global objects which is coming up in the next release.<br>
Both <code>Math</code> and <code>Number</code> have had their remaining methods implemented.</p>

<h2 id="lexer">Lexer</h2>

<p>The lexer has been rebuilt from scratch. Just like the old parser it was a single file before looping through and becoming unmaintainable. Today we’ve reorganised it into separate modules which know how to lex certain areas. The new lexer <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues/294">now supports goal symbols</a> and can now tokenize with the correct context at any time.</p>

<h3 id="goal-symbols">Goal Symbols</h3>

<p>Our issue with goal symbols is explained by the V8 team:
<a href="https://v8.dev/blog/understanding-ecmascript-part-3#lexical-grammar">https://v8.dev/blog/understanding-ecmascript-part-3#lexical-grammar</a></p>

<p>Previously we weren’t distinguishing between the contexts where some input elements are permitted and some are not, so lexing <code>/</code> would yeild a <code>division</code> symbols when it should be a <code>RegularExpressionLiteral</code> for example. This change unblocked us being able to run Test262.</p>

<p>Performance wise it is much faster for larger files. The lexer is far more efficient at streaming tokens to the parser than previously so in some scenarios we have big gains.</p>

<p><em>You can see all the benchmarks <a href="https://boa-dev.github.io/boa/dev/bench/">here</a></em></p>

<h2 id="repl-syntax-highlighting">Repl syntax highlighting</h2>

<p>Syntax highlighting was added to the repl this release thanks to @HalidOdat<br>
Our repl is made possible due to the great work of <a href="https://github.com/kkawakam/rustyline">RustyLine</a></p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-10-02/syntaxHighlighting.gif" alt="image"></p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>

<p>There are plenty of fixes and performance changes still needed, we also hope to experiment with producing Bytecode from our AST in future. Test262 coverage will almost certainly increase, and we are polishing the public API for easier use when embedding into other Rust projects.</p>

<p>Thanks to all those who contributed to 0.10, you can see the names in the full changelog linked above.</p>

<p>You can checkout Boa via <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa">Github</a> or on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/Boa">crates.io</a></p>

<p>I’ve seen people quit programming because they don’t want to struggle with bugs. That’s like hating the gym because you don’t want workouts to hurt.</p>
<h2>Learn to see the struggle as the way.</h2>
<p>You don’t run from bugs; you train yourself to find them quicker. </p>
<p><strong>A proficient programmer is an efficient detective of bugs.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re feeling frustrated that things are not smooth, remember that this is how learning actually works. </p>
<p>Neuroscience research confirms that practice doesn’t simply make you perfect; it is deliberate practice to improve in a specific task that makes you better. And deliberate practice involves struggling.</p>
<p>So your mantra should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>You code. </li>
<li>You debug.</li>
<li>You struggle. </li>
<li>You overcome. </li>
<li>And you repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve not struggled at all, you’re simply playing around. </p>
<p>If you struggle all the time, then the next section is for you.</p>
<h2>You’re not dumb, you’re learning at the wrong level.</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a little analogy. </p>
<p>Imagine learning the English language (the language of exceptions).</p>
<p>You start with a tutorial motivating you to learn to spell big words like <em>ELEPHANT</em>.</p>
<p>But it’s not working. After beating yourself for so long you decide to go to a lower tutorial and learn to spell smaller words like <em>ANT</em>.</p>
<p>But you still struggle.</p>
<p>So you conclude that you’re dumb because you lowered your tutorial level and still didn’t grasp anything.</p>
<p>But when a new teacher investigates why you’re struggling, they find out that you’ve been struggling because you actually don’t know the English alphabets.</p>
<p>Let’s bring this home to our coding world.</p>
<p>Some people jump into beginner tutorials to learn frameworks like <em>React (ELEPHANT)</em>. Then realize it makes no sense so they move on to learn <em>JavaScript (ANT)</em>. But that still makes no sense to them, so they quit.</p>
<p>But they’re simply working with something that’s too advanced.</p>
<p>Even introduction courses can be advanced because your thinking is not wired yet to programming in general. </p>
<p>There’s no shame in finding something lower than Intro courses and starting from there to build up to Intro courses. </p>
<p>I don’t see this recommended enough but if you’re struggling with intro courses, you should consider Intro to programming for kids. </p>
<p>Learn with tools like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice </li>
<li>Scratch</li>
<li>Codewars.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since you’re older, you’ll go through them faster. But they’ll give you the much needed soft intro that makes sense and builds your appetite.</p>
<p>Again, this has nothing to do with ego. </p>
<p><strong>It’s your learning journey.</strong></p>
<p>If you learn the alphabets first, you’ll gain the confidence needed to start spelling <em>ANT</em>, <em>ELEPHANT</em>, and later constructing long-winded sentences. </p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what discipline or area of coding you jump into, this holds for <em>Intro to Python</em> as much as it holds for <em>Intro to Machine Learning</em>.</p>
<p>You’ll learn more efficiently if you learn at the right level. </p>
<h2>Elevate how you learn with spaced repetition.</h2>
<p>This technique is from research in Neuroscience. And I’ll summarize it short and quick.</p>
<h3>How it works:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You learn.</li>
<li>Recall in 48 hours.</li>
<li>Then review in 72 hours. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Doing this:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You’ll forget less.</li>
<li>Connect new ideas to old; and</li>
<li>Retain more in long term memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>I put 48 and 72 hours but you can expand that timeline to days and weeks. The most important takeaway is not to simply learn once. But to intentionally set aside time for you to come back and review. </p>
<p>The longer the delay between reviews, the more it gets buried in long-term memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Duolingo uses it.</li>
<li>Quizlet adopted it.</li>
<li>You can also apply it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1 project &gt; 10 hello worlds</h2>
<p>Don’t get caught up in <code>hello worlds</code> forever.</p>
<p>I understand the thrill of completing simple exercises:</p>
<div>
      <pre><code># OMG - I can print all day
print “I am awesome”.
print “You’re cool”. 
print “Wait, are we cool?” </code></pre>
      </div>
<p>But I have to be honest with you, this won’t cut it.</p>
<p>Going back to our ANT analogy, no matter how many ways you rearrange the words ANT, you’ll never arrive at ELEPHANT. </p>
<p>No matter how many Intro tutorials you learn, you’ll never really get past the basics unless you push yourself beyond that. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>But I don’t know what projects to start as a beginner.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No worries. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Random Password Generator: Creating a program that intakes some words from the user and then generates a random password using those words. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currency converter: Create a program that converts currencies from one unit to another, for example, converting Indian rupee into dollars, pound to euros, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you find these boring, here are <a href="https://www.upgrad.com/blog/python-projects-ideas-topics-beginners/">40 other ideas to choose from.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if all of them seem too difficult, <a href="https://twitter.com/LifeTechPsych">DM me on Twitter</a> and I’ll create something specifically for you to start with. Remember, this is not about ego; it’s about your learning level and growth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Motivation is like taking a hot shower.</h2>
<p>Taking a hot shower feels good - you should do it.</p>
<p>But if your hot water is out for 2 weeks, would you not shower?</p>
<p>The question sounds ridiculous but in the same way, you really shouldn’t base your learning on only days when you’re motivated. </p>
<p>There are lots of exciting days in coding; but there will also be dark, unmotivating days. </p>
<p>Honestly, this is not just with coding. It’s with life and embarking on any new adventure. But you have to train yourself to show up not only when you’re feeling hyper inspirational but also on low, boring days.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean forget motivation.
Far from it - on days when you feel super motivated, use your motivation to quickly commit yourself to something big that will keep you accountable when the motivation goes dry.</p>
<h4>How? Join an accountability movement like:</h4>
<ul>
<li>30daysofcode</li>
<li>100DaysOfCode</li>
<li>30DaysOfCodingChallenge</li>
</ul>
<p>Something. Anything. To keep you accountable on slow days. </p>
<p>In Behavioral Psychology, this is known as pre-commitment. You use moments when you’re optimistic to commit yourself in the future for when you have zero optimism.</p>
<h2>The journey of learning is never-ending.</h2>
<p>No one teaches you how to learn. </p>
<p>But it’s crucial in going far.</p>
<p>You may have started with the idea of simply learning to code or to one day become a developer. But there’s more.</p>

<p>When you come out on the other side, you’ll come out not just a coder.</p>
<p>But as a renewed person because you’ve picked up a new way of learning and approaching things.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. This isn’t easy peasy lemon squeezy – you’ll work like hell. </p>
<p>But in the end, it’ll be worth it not just because of coding but because of the joy of transforming yourself.</p>
<p>Remember, the ball’s always in your court…</p>

<p>Knowing Javascript inside and out or all the programming languages in the world won’t be enough to help you land a great job that pays incredibly well or secure those amazing opportunities that are hard to come by.</p>



<p>If you want to truly advance your career and succeed as a developer, you need to market yourself. Sure, coding is your passion and you’d rather bury yourself in it, but how would anyone know that you’re good at what you do or even discover you unless you put yourself out there?</p>



<p>When screening for developer positions, many companies pay attention to candidates who have active <a href="https://blog.codersrank.io/profile-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">programmer profiles</a>—a blog, podcast, open-source contributions, YouTube channel, or a history of speaking at tech events—that speaks to their abilities. They view developers with these achievements and experiences as more likely to be talented because their reputation suggests it.</p>



<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/the-office-michael-scott-5B6PQ4lDOlbB6">via GIPHY</a></p>



<p>A little marketing can help you shine brightly in the eyes of potential employers. The last thing you want is to be just another candidate or resume when applying for a job. You need to find a way to stand out from the other stack of papers so that companies are pushed to invite you for an interview or make you an offer.</p>



<p>With effective marketing, you may not even have to go job hunting, opportunities will come knocking at your door. When you share your goals, skills, experiences, and knowledge about your field publicly, it helps to establish you as an expert. As such, companies will be happy to pay you a premium salary rather than hiring one of your seemingly less qualified counterparts.</p>



<p>Now that you understand how important marketing is and how it can enhance your reputation and turn you into a job magnet, we’re going to walk you through actionable steps you can take to successfully market yourself as a developer, stand out from the competition, get on recruiters’ radars, and bag the job offer of your dreams.</p>



<p>We have ranked these steps according to how useful and important they can be in helping you market yourself and your skills effectively.</p>







<ol><li><a href="#portfolio">Build your portfolio</a></li><li><a href="#brand">Build a personal brand</a></li><li><a href="#codersrank">Register a profile on CodersRank</a></li><li><a href="#network">Network with fellow tech professionals</a></li><li><a href="#linkedin">Tidy up your LinkedIn profile</a></li></ol>



<p>Following these steps will help you enlarge your horizons and place your best foot forward so life-changing opportunities can find you. While other developers are scrambling to submit resumes and nail their technical interviews, you’ll already be far ahead.</p>



<p>Let’s take an in-depth look into each of these steps and how you can use them to enhance your career as a software developer and go from chasing after the prize to becoming the prize.</p>



<h2 id="portfolio" data-amp-original-style="color:#50b0ba"><strong>1. Build your portfolio</strong></h2>



<p>As a developer, you know that you need to keep practicing and refining your skills. What you might not know is that you can use the assignments and projects you do to create a portfolio that showcases your expertise.</p>



<p>If you don’t already have a GitHub profile, start by creating one and start pushing code to it regularly, and make your experiments public. This is non-negotiable. GitHub is your <a href="https://blog.codersrank.io/the-evolution-of-the-most-popular-repositories-since-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">code repository</a> and it should be used to display all the code you’ve written, projects you’ve worked on, and other interesting code-related activities you’ve been involved in.</p>



<p>Your GitHub account is basically your developer resume because it serves as proof of how well you can code. It says more about your skills than any CV or interview can. Contribute to as many open source libraries as you can. The more open source contributions you have the greater the value prospective employers will see in hiring you.</p>



<p>If you’d like to make valuable contributions to open source libraries, but you’re not sure how to go about submitting one, finding projects to contribute to, or even what kind of contributions you can make, check out these resources:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to contribute to open source</a></li><li><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A first timer’s guide to an open source project</a></li><li><a href="https://rubygarage.org/blog/how-contribute-to-open-source-projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to contribute to open source projects</a></li></ul>



<p>It’s also important to have a portfolio website where potential employers can go to learn more about you, the work you’ve done, and how your skills and experience can benefit their organization.</p>



<p>When building your portfolio, here are the things you’ll want to pay attention to:</p>



<h3>Set up a professional site</h3>



<p>It makes sense for your domain to be in your name since this is a personal portfolio and people should be able to find it by simply entering your name into a search engine. Make sure you purchase the domain so that you can have full control over it and be able to migrate to a different web platform.</p>



<p>You cannot expect employers to take you seriously if you proclaim yourself to be a talented developer, but your website looks shabby and amateurish. You want anyone who stumbles on your site to be immediately impressed by the layout and design even before they go through any of your pages.</p>



<figure><amp-img src="https://file.mockplus.com/image/2019/07/75f1f76e-eeb4-4166-8cf1-3500d6256538.png" alt="" object-fit="contain" width="1170" height="400" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://file.mockplus.com/image/2019/07/75f1f76e-eeb4-4166-8cf1-3500d6256538.png" alt="" width="1170" height="400" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzQwMCcgd2lkdGg9JzExNzAnIHhtbG5zPSdodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZycgdmVyc2lvbj0nMS4xJy8+"></amp-img><figcaption><a href="https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/web-developer-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your site should be easy to navigate and visually pleasing. You can decide to code your website from scratch and display it as one of the projects in your portfolio or create one using your preferred web platform. Whatever you choose, remember to keep it simple.</p>



<p>Include a well-designed logo that communicates your values and serves as an accurate representation of who you are and what you do.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that a <strong>personal website is going to mean different things to a back end developer and a front end developer</strong> since they’re different fields. Whichever faction you belong to, you just need to find an approach to your website design and presentation that best represents who you are and what you do.</p>



<p>If you’re a newbie developer, this <a href="https://mikkegoes.com/portfolio-site-on-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed step-by-step guide</a> will help you build a great-looking portfolio website from scratch to showcase your skills and value to potential employers and help you get hired faster. It covers everything from registering a domain name to choosing a reliable website, creating eye-catching home and about me pages, building contact forms, and more.</p>



<p>Check out these <a href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/programmer-portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 best practices for creating a programming portfolio website</a> that stands out. The article also contains tips on mistakes to avoid when building your website and what recruiters look for in a developer portfolio, as well as stunning website examples that are sure to get your creativity flowing.</p>



<h3>Showcase your work</h3>



<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/kodewithklossy-coding-karlie-kloss-kwk-ZG719ozZxGuThHBckn">via GIPHY</a></p>



<p>The point of having an online portfolio is to highlight the work you’ve done in the past and the accomplishments you’re proud of. If you don’t have any concrete work experience yet, you can start by creating a single web page and adding links to other online profiles you have like your social media and GitHub account.</p>



<p>When you write articles, host webinars, give talks, contribute to open source libraries, create tutorial videos, or work on anything interesting, update your site accordingly. Explain what each project is about, why it’s important, and when it was done.</p>



<p>Don’t just go on and on about the agile methodologies, frameworks, and programming languages that you know. Display that project you built using Javascript, PHP, CSS, or whatever tech stacks you say you’re familiar with. </p>



<p>Let visitors see the skills you possess in action and how you can use these skills to grow their business. This will establish your expertise, credibility, and trustworthiness.</p>



<h3>Share your story</h3>



<p>Don’t be shy about being yourself. Let your personality shine through. Describe yourself as honestly as you can. What is it that makes you special? What struggles, failures, or challenges have you encountered over the course of your career? Employers don’t want to hire mindless code monkeys, but people they can relate to.</p>



<h3>Include your contact details</h3>



<p>Give visitors and potential employers a way to reach you. Add your email address and phone number or create a simple contact form they can fill out. If they have to jump through hoops to find your contact information, you might miss out on many good opportunities.</p>



<h2 id="brand" data-amp-original-style="color:#50b0ba"><strong>2. Build a personal brand</strong></h2>



<p>Personal branding is simply a way of making yourself known for something. As a programmer, you not only want to be competent in your field, you also want people to see you that way. Thanks to the internet, it’s easier than ever to create a brand around yourself.</p>



<p>Ask yourself what you want to be known for? Who are you and what do you want to represent? What is your core message? What do you want people to think of when they see or hear your name? Once you have this figured out, start putting this message out there and making sure it’s reflected in everything you do.</p>



<p>Here are some of the ways you can create a strong personal brand and actively promote yourself:</p>



<h3>Clean up assets related to communication</h3>



<p>Come up with a logo for your brand if you don’t already have one. It should be something simple, eye-catching, and an accurate representation of who you are and what you’re about. Don’t go changing your logo every week or so. Find one that works for you and use it everywhere.</p>



<p>Get professional headshots taken to use as cover images for your online profiles. Go through your social media accounts and public forums and delete any inappropriate messages or comments that don’t align with the image you want to project or reflect badly on you as a person.</p>



<h3>Start a blog</h3>



<p>A blog can be a wonderful way to showcase your skills as a developer, become well-known in your industry, and attract potential clients or employers.</p>



<p>Your blog doesn’t have to have tens of thousands of readers, but you do need to build a decent audience. You can do this by sharing useful information that adds some kind of value to your readers’ lives. Talk about your professional journey, the challenges you’ve faced along the way, and how you overcame them.</p>



<p>Teach people how to solve problems. Show examples of work you’ve done in the past to help junior developers find their way and build themselves up. Think of something you’ve struggled with that you found a solution …</p></div></div>

		<p>At Bearer, we are a polyglot engineering team. Both in spoken languages and programming languages. Our stack is made up of services written in Node.js, Ruby, Elixir, and a handful of others in addition to all the languages our agent library supports. Like most teams, we balance using the right tool for the job with using the right tool for the time. Recently, we reached a limitation in one of our services that led us to transition that service from Node.js to Rust. This post goes into some of the details that caused the need to change languages, as well as some of the decisions we made along the way.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-context"><strong>A bit of context</strong></h2><p>We are building a solution to help developers monitor their APIs. Every time a customer’s application calls an API, a log gets sent to us where we monitor and analyze it.</p><p>At the time of the issue, we were processing an average of 30k API calls per minute. That's a lot of API calls made across all our customers. We split the process into two key parts: Log ingestion and log processing.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg" alt="Original architecture with Node.js" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion-service---node.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>We originally built the ingestion service in Node.js. It would receive the logs, communicate with an elixir service to check customer access rights, check rate limits using Redis, and then send the log to CloudWatch. There, it would trigger an event to tell our processing worker to take over.</p><p>We capture information about the API call, including the payloads (both the request and response) of every call sent from a user's application. These are currently limited to 1MB, but that is still a large amount of data to process. We send and process everything asynchronously and the goal is to make the information available to the end-user as fast as possible.</p><p>We hosted everything on AWS Fargate, a serverless management solution for Elastic Container Service (ECS), and set it to autoscale after 4000 req/min. Everything was great! Then, the invoice came 😱.</p><p>AWS invoices based on CloudWatch storage. The more you store, the more you pay.</p><p>Fortunately, we had a backup plan.</p><h2 id="kinesis-to-the-rescue"><strong>Kinesis to the rescue?</strong></h2><p>Instead of sending the logs to CloudWatch, we would use<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/"> Kinesis Firehose</a>. Kinesis Firehose is basically a Kafka equivalent provided by AWS. It allows us to deliver a data stream in a reliable way to several destinations. With very few updates to our log processing worker, we were able to ingest logs from both CloudWatch and Kinesis Firehose. With this change, daily costs would drop to about 0.6% of what they were before.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg" alt="Architecture after adding Kenesis" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion---node_kinesis.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>The updated service now passed the log data through Kinesis and into s3 which triggers the worker to take over with the processing task. We rolled the change out and everything was back to normal... or we thought. Soon after, we started to notice some anomalies on our monitoring dashboard.</p><p><strong>We were Garbage Collecting</strong>, a lot. Garbage collection (GC) is a way for some languages to automatically free up memory that is no longer in use. When that happens, the program pauses. This is known as a <em>GC pause</em>. The more writes you make to memory, the more garbage collection needs to happen and as a result, the pause time increases. For our service, these pauses were growing high enough that they caused the servers to restart and put stress on the CPU. When this happens, it can look like the server is down—because it temporarily is—and our customers started to see 5xx errors for roughly 6% of the logs our agent was trying to ingest.</p><p>Below we can see the pause time and pause frequency of the garbage collection:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg" alt="GC pause and frequency charts" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/gc-pause.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>In some instances, the pause time breached <strong>4 seconds</strong> (as shown on the left), with up to <strong>400 pauses per minute</strong> (as shown on the right) across our instances.</p><p>After some more research, we appeared to be another victim of a<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/329"> memory leak in the AWS Javascript SDK</a>. We tried increasing the resource allocations to extreme amounts, like autoscaling after 1000 req/min, but nothing worked.</p><h2 id="possible-solutions"><strong>Possible solutions</strong></h2><p>With our backup plan no longer an option, we moved on to new solutions. First, we looked at those with the easiest transition path.</p><h3 id="elixir"><strong>Elixir</strong></h3><p>As mentioned earlier, we are checking the customer access rights using an Elixir service. This service is private and only accessible from within our Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). We have never experienced any scalability issues with this service and most of the logic was already there. We could simply send the logs to Kinesis from within this service and skip over the Node.js service layer. We decided it was worth a try.</p><p>We developed the missing parts and tested it. It was better, but still not great. Our benchmarks showed that there were still high levels of Garbage Collecting, and we were still returning 5xx to our users when consuming the logs. At this point, the heavy load triggered a <a href="https://github.com/benoitc/hackney/issues/594">(now resolved) issue</a> with one of our elixir dependencies.</p><h3 id="go"><strong>Go</strong></h3><p>We considered Golang as well. It would have been a good candidate, but in the end, it is another Garbage Collected Language. While likely more efficient than our previous implementation, as we scale there is a high chance we'd run into similar problems. With these limitations in mind, we needed a better option.</p><h2 id="re-architecting-with-rust-at-the-core"><strong>Re-architecting with Rust at the core</strong></h2><p>In both our original implementation and our backup, the core issue remained the same: garbage collection. The solution was to move to a language with better memory management and no garbage collection. Enter Rust.</p><p>Rust isn't a garbage-collected language. Instead, it relies on a concept called <em>ownership</em>.</p><blockquote>Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector. <br>— <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">The Rust Book</a></blockquote><p>Ownership is the concept that often makes Rust difficult to learn and write, but also what makes it so well suited for situations like ours. Each value in Rust has a single owner variable and as a result a single point of allocation in memory. Once that variable goes out of scope the memory is immediately returned.</p><p>Since the code required to ingest the logs is quite small, we decided to give it a try. To test this we addressed the very thing that we had issues with—sending large amounts of data to Kinesis.</p><p>Our first benchmarks proved to be very successful.</p><p>From that point, we were pretty confident that Rust could be the answer and we decided to flesh out the prototype into a production-ready application.</p><p>Over the course of these experiments, rather than directly replacing the original Node.js service with Rust, we restructured much of the architecture surrounding log ingestion. The core of the new service is an <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a> proxy with the Rust application as a sidecar.</p><p>Now, when the Bearer Agent in a user's application sends log data to Bearer, it goes into the Envoy proxy. Envoy looks at the request and communicates with Redis to check things like rate limits, authorization details, and usage quotas. Next, the Rust application running alongside Envoy prepares the log data and passes it through Kinesis into an s3 bucket for storage. S3 then triggers our worker to fetch and process the data so Elastic Search can index it. At this point, our users can access the data in our dashboard.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg" alt="Diagram of new rust service" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/Log-ingestion---rust.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>What we found was that with fewer—and smaller—servers, we are able to process even more data without any of the earlier issues.</p><p>If we look at the latency numbers for the Node.js service, we can see peaks with an average response time nearing 1700ms.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/before-latency.png" alt="Latency with original Node.js service" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/before-latency.png 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/before-latency.png 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/before-latency.png 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/before-latency.png 2400w"></figure><p>With the Rust service implementation, the latency dropped to below 90ms, even at its highest peak, keeping the average response time below 40ms.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/after-latency.png" alt="Latency after re-architecture" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/after-latency.png 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/after-latency.png 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/after-latency.png 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/after-latency.png 2400w"></figure><p>The original Node.js application used about 1.5GB of memory at any given time, while the CPUs ran at around 150% load. The new Rust service used about 100MB of memory and only 2.5% of CPU load.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>As with most startups, we move fast. Sometimes the best solution at the time isn't the best solution forever. This was the case with Node.js. It allowed us to move forward, but as we grew we also outgrew it. As we started to handle more and more requests, we needed to make our infrastructure evolve to address the new requirements. While this process started with a fix that merely replaced Node.js with Rust, it led to a rethinking of our log ingestion service as a whole.</p><p>We still use a variety of languages throughout our stack, including Node.js, but will now consider Rust for new services where it makes sense.<br></p>

<p data-block-type="core"><em>At first, I didn’t know how it happened. How a dorky kid with no fashion sense was able to ditch the ugly sweater and wear a shirt and a tie on major events – sometimes even for breakfast. Was I suddenly obsessed by a fashion spirit or the covers of the modern magazines subconsciously recorded in my memory when I was walking past them on the street? It turns out, it wasn’t any of those things. I simply managed to settle in a glamorous looking crew of folks who shopped for new clothes as often as they checked their Instagram stories. Eventually, their fashion taste and erratic spending habits were quickly adopted by me.</em></p>



<p data-block-type="core">Imagine a blank slate. That’s how the brain of a newborn looks like. Some scientists argue that there are certain traits embedded in our genes influencing our behavior, others claim that such nonsense does not exist.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">What both groups agree with is the following: We’re all heavily influenced by the surrounding people.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">It’s actually our biggest advantage over all other living organisms. Our development is based on imitation. Our ability to observe others, evaluate, and copy their moves is a vital skill that helps us survive and advance.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">Yet, this same copying mechanism is also the reason we’re feeling worthless in the age of abundance. Our tendency to imitate what others are doing – and thinking – is the reason we’re carelessly spending our hard earn cash. Therefore, the more we obey the norms of the social circle we’re in, the more we become incapable of escaping the <a href="https://durmonski.com/well-being/internet-rabbit-holes/" target="_blank" aria-label="never-ending depths (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">never-ending depths</a> of the online world. A world full of comparison and erratic behavior.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">The mere existence of the Other, as we’ll observe below, is both a blessing and a curse.</p>







<h2 data-block-type="core">Why Other People Are Both Good and Bad For Us?</h2>



<p data-block-type="core">Let’s start with the good things.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">You emerge from your mother’s womb. You cry. You crawl. You get up. You start to run. Eventually, at some point, you start to talk. Respectfully, if you’re born in Germany, you’ll call you dad “vader”. If you’re residing in the US, you’ll call him “father”. If you happen to appear in France, you’ll use the word “père”.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">Same meaning, different words.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">Obviously, you get why we use different words for the word father – because we’re exposed to different languages. If your parents are speaking English, the first language you’ll learn will be, unsurprisingly, English.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">This is simple. We get that.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">But what we often fail to realize is that we also adopt everything else our parents do. Every little act. Every little glimpse of emotion. We accumulate everything the surrounding people do, filter the stuff that are not relevant, and create a set of beliefs for ourselves that we’ll eventually use for (sometimes) the rest of our lives.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">But it’s not only our parents. It’s everyone around us.</p>

That’s why, eventually, we wind up desiring the very same things.</figcaption></figure>







<p data-block-type="core">The horde of people you expose yourself to is calibrating your persona and shaping it based on what you observe.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">The gains here are clear: thanks to our ability to mimic the behavior of others we’re able to learn new skills, tactics, tricks, set of instructions that are essentially helping us live another day.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">What about the downsides?</p>



<p data-block-type="core">There are plenty.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">But before we talk about how corrupting the influence of others is, we first need to explain the mimetic theory.</p>







<h2 data-block-type="core">How The Mimetic Theory is Influencing our Lives?</h2>



<p data-block-type="core">René Girard, a French historian and polymath, is the father of this theory – <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rene-girards-mimetic-theory/" target="_blank" aria-label="the mimetic theory (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the mimetic theory</a>. The goal of this concept is to explain our human behavior and from where our desires originate.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">According to his views, our desires are a direct consequence of the desires of the surrounding people. Both people who we regularly see, in person, and such we highly admire.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">As we concluded above, our behavior is based on imitation. But we’re not only imitating the moves and the actions of others. We also adopt the motives, the aspirations, the dreams of other people.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">You might think that you want to go on an exotic vacation because you think that you are a free spirit and because you want to take a break from the world. In reality, though, according to the mimetic theory, you’re simply imitating what everyone else is doing. </p>



<p data-block-type="core">Probably a celebrity you follow online is regularly posting pictures of her drinking cocktails on the beach. If that’s so, this behavior transports in your brain and you suddenly want to do the same thing.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">This model of desire takes a triangular shape.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">And it kind of looks like this:</p>



<figure data-block-type="core"><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1024x512.jpg" alt="mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20512'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire.jpg 2000w" data-lazy-src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mimetic-theory-triangle-model-of-desire-1024x512.jpg"><figcaption>There is always a triangular relationship between the subject, the model, and the object. Through the object, the person feels that he’s getting closer to the model, whom Girard calls the mediator.</figcaption></figure>







<p data-block-type="core">On the top, there is an ideal we strive towards. René Girard calls them mediators. On the right, are our actions, the things we want to obtain, that are always somehow related to this goal – the top. On the left is where we are currently.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">Or to put it differently, our goals, ambitions, and longings are never truly our own. They are a mere reflection of what we see in the world around us and who we want to imitate.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">Actually, if we dig even deeper into the mimetic theory, we can see that we never really know what we actually want. We always adopt the desires of others:</p>



<blockquote data-block-type="core"><p>Human desire is not based on the spontaneity of the subject’s desire, but rather the desires that surround the subject. He argues that humans do not themselves know what to desire; as a result, they imitate the desires of others.” Wolfgang Palaver from <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rene-girards-mimetic-theory/" target="_blank" aria-label="René Girard’s Mimetic Theory (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">René Girard’s Mimetic Theory</a></p></blockquote>



<p data-block-type="core">“This is not so bad,” you say. “What’s wrong with going to a distant island and taking a break? What’s wrong with wanting what others want?”</p>



<p data-block-type="core">Not that traveling 10,000 miles and spending 10,000 USD is necessarily a bad thing to do.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">But the point is different.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">If you don’t take a step back to identify your own desires, the things <em>you </em>want to do, without considering what others want from you, you’ll always feel miserable. You’ll simply respond to what everyone else is doing and never find your genuine, true self – as banal as it might sound.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">A person who is always imitating someone else is unable to trust his own judgment. That’s why, he desires only objects desired by others. And also, he always follows and never leads.</p>







<h2 data-block-type="core">The Bad Influence Of The Other</h2>



<p data-block-type="core">Amongst many, a common “perk” that comes from imitating others is your longing to earn their approval.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">As we observed, we strive to reach an ideal that is shaped by taking into account what everyone around us is wanting. But we don’t do it only because this will move us closer to a potentially god-like existence. We also do it because we want other people to approve of us.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">This tear us from the inside.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">Part of us wants to express our true nature while the other part wants to win the approval of others.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">This forms the following inner conflict:</p>



<p data-block-type="core">“To be myself or to be what others will accept me to be?”</p>



<p data-block-type="core">If you focus on being your genuine, true self, without considering others and caring about their opinion – which is still influenced by other people in your life in some way – you will fail to gain their recognition. After all, your actions will be different from what is “accepted” as right in the group.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">For example, if you’re mostly hanging around people who smoke and visit nightclubs, your reluctance to smoke and say yes to heavy drinking during the night will be badly perceived. After all, since everyone is doing it, and you’re not, you can’t expect their approval of you. Actually, your disobedience will cause them to question their own actions – something nobody wants. “Why don’t you go out with us? What do you think you are, better than us or what?”</p>



<p data-block-type="core">Eventually, you’ll be left out of the group or you won’t enjoy a lot of attention from them.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">The second scenario, if you decide to go along with the group and focus on “being someone who they will adore” – which is kind of sad if you decide to go in that direction – is still not going to be that easy. At least, if you have any will left.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">For example, if you’re a bookworm, an introvert, an anime fanatic, and you start partying only because you want others to approve of you, you’ll be torn between your true self (the person <em>you </em>want to be) and the socially accepted self (the person you strive to become because others will like more).</p>



<p data-block-type="core">Striving towards the socially accepted self, in the book <a aria-label="René Girard’s Mimetic Theory (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rene-girards-mimetic-theory/" target="_blank">René Girard’s Mimetic Theory</a>, is called “bad faith”.</p>



<p data-block-type="core">Your efforts to appear as this cool kid, which you’re not, at least still not, will put you out of your skin and make you look like an amateur, an imposture at first. When observed under a loop, your actions won’t look natural.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; Hopsworks provides support for machine learning (ML) experiments. That is, it can automatically track the artifacts, graphs, performance, logs, metadata, and dependencies of your ML programs.Many of you already know about platforms like <a href="https://mlflow.org/">MLflow</a>, so why should you read about Hopsworks Experiments?&nbsp; Because you do not have to rewrite your TensorFlow/PyTorch/Scikit-learn programs to get <strong>tracking and distributed ML for free</strong>, and TensorBoard comes built-in. We discuss how Hopsworks uniquely supports implicit provenance to transparently create metadata and how it is combined with the oblivious training function to make your training distribution transparent.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hopsworks Introduction</h2><p>Hopsworks is a single platform for both data science and data engineering that is available as both an <a href="http://github.com/logicalclocks/hopsworks">open-source platform</a> and a <a href="http://www.hopsworks.ai/">SaaS platform</a>, including a built-in <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/hopsworks-featurestore">feature store</a>. You can train models on GPUs at scale, easily install any Python libraries you want using pip/conda, run Jupyter notebooks as jobs, put those jobs in Airflow pipelines, and even write (Py)Spark or Flink applications that run at scale.&nbsp;</p><p>As a development environment, Hopsworks provides a central, collaborative development environment that enables machine learning teams to easily share results and experiments with teammates or generate reports for project stakeholders. All resources have strong security, data governance, backup and high availability support in Hopsworks, while assets are stored in a single distributed file system (with data stored on S3 in the cloud).<br></p><figure id="w-node-a0d33d55738e-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f74366329e691163a9537f8_mT5Xl3PGQNailTwXRoPhMMlEZePoa3PjlnagKaWj7mJxckcqP1SfcSbkOS3P-adIEnIq7kURxZ-TJ4ypWTt7yw94d_vqkB9o2FMTUrosMB8Pnxz0pPYkehYlOoJySGBdjPuDNQ7I.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>A Hopsworks ML experiment stores information about your ML training run: logs, images, metrics of interest (accuracy, loss), the program used to train the model, its input training data, and the conda dependencies used. Optional outputs are hyperparameters, a TensorBoard, and a Spark history server.</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-06188dbd9c79-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f743664aeafc406b94b027c_hraL3X_VAEzOtdesnelgqqb4FQcVGC8Q6J0-KQM0UPGGQxgU_TlMb_-LIZuMOszzdZIhxEZogwxlSSfOMdZvcAIgRlLZzoNg2dLmoPUSrNWyK0CABpAglOV9q9SqfogrRxoO6k29.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>The logs of each hyperparameter trial are retrieved by clicking on its log, and TensorBoard visualizes the different trials results. The TensorBoard HParams plugin is also available to drill down further on the trials.</figcaption></figure><p>When you run a Python or PySpark application on the Hopsworks platform, it can create an<strong> experiment</strong> that includes both the traditional information a program generates (results, logs, errors) as well as ML-specific information to help track, debug, and reproduce your program and its inputs and outputs:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>hyperparameters</strong>: parameters for training runs that are not updated by the ML programs themselves;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>metrics</strong>: the loss or accuracy of the model(s) trained in this experiment;</li><li><strong>program artifacts</strong>: <em>python/pyspark/airflow</em> <em>programs, </em>and their <em>conda environments</em>;</li><li><strong>model artifacts</strong>: serialized <em>model objects,</em> <em>model schemas</em>, and <em>model checkpoints</em>;</li><li><strong>executions</strong>: information to be able to re-execute the experiment, including parameters, versioned features for input, output files,&nbsp; etc;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>versioned features</strong>: to be able to reproduce an experiment, we need the exact training/test data from the run and how it was created from the feature store;</li><li><strong>visualizations</strong>: images generated during training and score.

</p><p>Platforms that support experiment tracking require the user to refactor their training code in a function or some explicit scope (such as “with … as xx:” in MLFlow, see Appendix A) to identify when an experiment begins and when an experiment ends. In Hopsworks, we require the developer to write their training code inside a function.&nbsp;</p><p>We call this Python function an <em>oblivious training function</em> because the function is oblivious of whether it is being run on a Python kernel in a Jupyter notebook or on many workers in a cluster, see our <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/unifying-single-host-and-distributed-machine-learning-with-maggy">blog </a>and <a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/unifying-single-host-and-distributed-machine-learning-with-maggy">Spark/AI summit talk</a> for details. That is, you write your training code once and reuse the same function when training a small model on your laptop or when performing hyperparameter tuning or distributed training on a large cluster of GPUs or CPUs.</p><p>We double down on this “wrapper” Python function by also using it to start/stop experiment tracking. Experiment tracking and distribution transparency in a single function, nice!&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, the <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/maggy">Maggy</a> library runs experiments, see code snippet above. As you can see, the only code changes a user needed compared to a best-practice TensorFlow program are:&nbsp;<br></p><ol role="list"><li>factor the training code in a user-defined function (<strong>def train(..):</strong>);</li><li>return a Python dict containing the results, images, and files that the user wants to be tracked for the experiment and accessible later in the Experiments UI; and</li><li>invoke the training function using the <em>experiment.lagom</em> function.<br></li></ol><p>The hyperparameters can be fixed for a single execution run, or as shown in the last 4 lines of the code snippet, you can execute the <em>train function </em>as a distributed hyperparameter tuning job across many workers in parallel (with GPUs, if needed).&nbsp;</p><p>Hopsworks will automatically:</p><ul role="list"><li>track all parameters of the train function as hyperparameters for this experiment,&nbsp;</li><li>auto-log using Keras callbacks in model.fit;</li><li>create a versioned directory in HopsFS, where a copy of the program, its conda environment, and all logs from all workers are aggregated;</li><li>track all provenance information for this application - input data from HopsFS used in this experiment (train/test datasets from the Feature Store), and all output artifacts (models, model checkpoints, application logs);</li><li>redirect all print statements executed in workers to the Jupyter notebook cell for easier debugging (see GIF below - each print statement is prefixed by the worker ID).<br></li></ul><figure id="w-node-756fb7ca0b23-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f74366291399a79d18af461_4BATblXBajOTlBXREg6utXoqcRgymvySZx03Hh_JeYvjJ7YLGzxYpnUgMwCvHaNxMFgj_XepZ23xJh3QFnfhHsAetRlt24IkRw4BI8R4Wo5gaQLkVuuIRRbE8CK7swOEJaa-Lm-k.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>In Hopsworks, logs from workers can be printed in your Jupyter notebook during training.

    -- CODE language-bash --
    
    def train():
    from maggy import tensorboard
    ...
    model.fit(.., callbacks=[TensorBoard(log_dir=tensorboard.logdir(),..)], ...)
</p><p>TensorBoard is arguably the most common and powerful tool used to visualize, profile and debug machine learning experiments. Hopsworks Experiments integrates seamlessly with TensorBoard. Inside the training function, the data scientist can simply import the <em>tensorboard</em> python<em> </em>module and get the folder location to write all the TensorBoard files. The content of the folder is then collected from each Executor and placed in the experiment directory in HopsFS. As TensorBoard supports showing multiple experiment runs in the same graph, visualizing and comparing multiple hyperparameter combinations becomes as simple as starting the TensorBoard integrated in the Experiments service. By default, Tensorboard is configured with useful plugins such as HParam, Profiler, and Debugging.&nbsp;</p><h3>Profiling and debugging</h3><p>Hopsworks 1.4.0 comes with TensorFlow 2.3, which includes the TensorFlow profiler. A new long-awaited feature that finally allows users to profile model training to identify bottlenecks in the training process such as slow data loading or poor operation placement in CPU + GPU configurations.&nbsp;</p><p>TensorFlow 2.3 also includes Debugger V2, making it easy to find model issues such as NaN which are non-trivial to find the root cause of in complex models.<br></p><figure id="w-node-821b5c19e74e-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f743661e73aacd6dc310040_Rywm-fmUfHouqW1zVdYsZ88LvtAYDvCZPpze3hHJeENCBjPVPkkpy_J-2bescj5Z-Xlb7A7DNpmNws1H4lsmUsuOpLROLO_S16jFM_CI-6JdACYY5Rp3Q3yYVMfkecV7aK7ECsf_.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-fc6081bc518f-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f743662849afea39f14cb69_S0v-cuc6N5MT4gsC3KUBFa3dQi7ZZBEaF9w684FzTrmXH4FPHkDEFCaMy2ThIpmSHDHSY-vmXCvXyDVrMVS_FYy3vnODkL8uXcHrm4uIlNjhNHHhsxoMghDrFfX_Yn_eVe1eYBbE.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Model Registry</h2><figure id="w-node-6cad6e721c68-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f743662ec097905b0778b6b_KcTuR12rSnRVQSSDh-eLxqM0ad3eAXSGCkehOJ8ik2BPfnohgCfudLLx7HkUIk3DKfTTxz-DzRwlJ7OAYU0eafq0bwSN2tYy7dt_rnOeth550yYPqa-esKRO6uGREvB1C4iNjk3l.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the training code models may be exported and saved to HopsFS. Using the <em>model </em>python module in the <a href="https://hops-py.logicalclocks.com/">hops library</a>, it is easy to version and attach meaningful metadata to models to reflect the performance of a given model version.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hopsworks Model Registry, is a service where all models are listed in addition to useful information such as which user created the model, different versions, time of creation and evaluation metrics such as accuracy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Model Registry provides functionality to filter based on the model name, version number and the user that exported the model. Furthermore the evaluation metrics of model versions can be sorted in the UI to find the best version for a given model.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Model Registry UI, you can also navigate to the experiment used to train the model, and from there to the train/test data used to train the model, and from there to the features in the feature store used to create the train/test data. Thanks, provenance!<br></p><h3>Exporting a model</h3><p>A model can be exported programmatically by using the <em>export</em> function in the <em>model</em> module. Prior to exporting the model, the experiment needs to have written a model to a folder or to a path on HopsFS. Then that path is supplied to the function along with the name of the model and the evaluation metrics that should be attached. The <em>export</em> call will upload the contents of the folder to your Models dataset and it will also appear in the Model Registry with an incrementing version number for each export.</p><p>
    -- CODE language-bash --
    from hops import model

# local path to directory containing model (e.g. .pb or .pk) 
path = os.getcwd() + “/model_dir”

# uploads path to the model repository, metadata is a dict of metrics</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

a playtester when the time comes.</p><p>For the past few months I’ve been writing my first ever indie game (in Rust).
It’s a 2D <span>puzzle-platformer</span> that I’m super
happy with so far. I think it’s pretty unique and I’m excited to see where it
goes. I’m quite stubborn and like things done a particular way so I’m not using
an off-the-shelf engine like Unity and I’m writing almost everything myself
except for some of the low-level libraries. It’s challenging and fun.</p><p>Anyway, some friends suggested I share what I’ve been doing. Until now, I’ve
been reluctant to because I already have heaps to do but I think it would be a
shame if this knowledge is lost (because I’ll inevitably forget). Therefore,
I’m going to try and write occasional gamedev notes and publish them here. I
don’t guarantee they’ll all make sense without extra context. I’m hoping to
refer back to them later, e.g. if I turn them into YouTube videos or something.</p><p>Most recently (the last few days) I’ve been working on adding water and
swimming to the game. Currently the player character is land-based and I wanted
to expand that out to add variety and a new set of constraints for the player
to grapple with. There are story reasons as well, but I won’t spoil it. Before
diving(!) in, here’s a quick demo of what I made this week:</p><figure><a href="https://tuzz.tech/videos/swimming-high-res.mp4" target="_blank"><video muted="" autoplay="" playsinline="" loop=""><source src="https://tuzz.tech/videos/swimming-low-res.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></a><figcaption><span>▲</span><span>Demo of swimming in my game (click for a higher resolution)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It probably doesn’t look much compared to AAA games but I added a few niceties
to make it visually interesting and fun to navigate. The first thing I worked
on was a new component called <code><span><span>Liquid</span></span></code> that I can attach to a game entity. I
decided to use the more general term ‘liquid’ rather than ‘water’ because I
already use the term ‘solid’ and it seemed to fit better with the language of
my engine.</p><a href="#liquids"><h2 id="liquids">Liquids</h2></a><p>Here are the properties I can currently set on a liquid:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>Liquid </span><span>{</span><span></span></span><span><span>    direction_of_flow</span><span>:</span><span> Vector2f</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>    default_buoyancy</span><span>:</span><span> Buoyancy </span><span>{</span><span></span></span><span><span>      upthrust</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.0</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>      drag_coefficients</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>0.15</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>.</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>      jump_scale_factor</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.4</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>      waterline</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.3</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>      settle_rate</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.01</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></span><span><span></span><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Before I can do anything interesting with these properties, I first need to
know which entities are ‘submerged’ in the liquid. I created a resource called
<code><span><span>SubmergedEntities</span></span></code> that tracks this and a system that incrementally keeps this
resource up to date based on which entities have moved since the last update. I
consider an entity ‘submerged’ if its bounding box overlaps with the liquid,
even slightly. In other parts of the code I need to distinguish ‘partially’
versus ‘fully’ submerged, but I check this as needed.</p><p>With that out of the way, I wrote a <code><span><span>LiquidPhysics</span></span></code> system that applies these
properties to submerged entities. I made it so this only applies to those that
have a <code><span><span>Mass</span></span></code> component so that static geometry (e.g. the floor) isn’t
affected. I initially tried to make <code><span><span>LiquidPhysics</span></span></code> work in harmony with my
existing <code><span><span>GravityPhysics</span></span></code> system but that turned out to be really fiddly so I
abandoned that. Instead, it’s one or the other: if an entity is submerged,
<code><span><span>LiquidPhysics</span></span></code> handles it. If it is not, <code><span><span>GravityPhysics</span></span></code> does.</p><p>Here’s a quick summary of what each properties does:</p><ul><li><strong>direction_of_flow:</strong> controls the direction/speed entities move in the liquid</li><li><strong>upthrust:</strong> the same as above but only for the y-direction</li><li><strong>drag_coefficients:</strong> controls how rapidly an entity reaches the flow velocity when it’s not moving at that velocity, e.g. if the player jumps into some water, they will initially be travelling much faster than it</li><li><strong>jump_scale_factor:</strong> when an entity is ‘walking underwater’, i.e. it is standing on the ground in liquid, this parameter reduces the velocity applied when it jumps</li><li><strong>waterline:</strong> when an entity is floating at the top of the liquid, this parameter controls how high it naturally sits above the liquid, as a fraction of height</li><li><strong>settle rate:</strong> when an entity isn’t sitting at its waterline, this parameter controls how quickly it converges to it</li></ul><p>There’s quite a lot going on here but <code><span><span>LiquidPhysics</span></span></code> didn’t turn out too
complicated, only 100 lines or so. I did a bunch of reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity" target="_blank">terminal
velocity</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)" target="_blank">drag</a> before writing it which
helped. The reason most of the properties are nested in a <code><span><span>default_buoyancy</span></span></code>
field is so I can override them on a per-entity basis. For example, I might
want something to float on the surface while everything else sinks or to set a
lower waterline for a pirate ship.</p><a href="#swimming"><h2 id="swimming">Swimming</h2></a><p>I probably spent most of my time working on the swimming controls. I watched a
few videos of how swimming is typically handled in 2D games. In <a href="https://youtu.be/1wR8x5b_ExM?t=298" target="_blank">Super
Mario</a>, the swimming is a bit like jumping.
The player constantly sinks and swims up by jumping. They stay upright at all
times. I eventually got a nostalgia trip watching how swimming works in <a href="https://youtu.be/lSbLrWRLWl4?t=51" target="_blank">Ecco
the Dolphin</a>. I never really understood what
to do in that game but I remember it being fun to play. I like that the
character rotates to face the direction they’re heading. The boost is fun, too.</p><p>Currently, the on-land controls of my game are very responsive - you can
immediately switch directions. I figured it would be a nice change to introduce
some delay in water so you first have to turn to face the direction you want to
go, perhaps bumping into a wall along the way. You effectively always move in
the direction your head is pointing and turn at some arbitrary rate I can
control. Most people are better on land than in water so this fits well with
reality. Another minor reason for choosing this was that my engine works with
arbitrary transforms - it’s richer than a tile-based engine, which many 2D
games are built on, so I figured I may as well make use of this capability. If
I add analogue controller support, I can see it working well with that, too.</p><p>The way this works is by mapping the direction you’re pressing to one of the
eight intercardinal directions. I use the nautical term
‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_(navigation)" target="_blank">course</a>’ for this. I then
get the angle the player is current facing which I call its
‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heading_(navigation)" target="_blank">heading</a>’ and figure out
which direction to turn to get there soonest. This is a bit fiddly because
angles wrap around and are usually in the range -PI to PI (from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2" target="_blank"><code><span><span>atan2</span></span></code></a> function). Rust has a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html#method.rem_euclid" target="_blank"><code><span><span>rem_euclid</span></span></code></a>
function that helps with this. In the case when the player switches to the
opposite direction (e.g. left to right), either direction works. I decided to
arbitrarily* turn counter-clockwise.</p><p>Some things I added later were ‘hold space to boost’ (inspired by Ecco) and
automatic uprighting. If the player is idle, it seemed a bit weird to just
leave them hanging upside down in water so after a couple of seconds, I rotate
them back to their upright position. I quite liked the possibility of using
this for some tricky puzzle later in the game. Maybe there’s a spike-ridden
section that requires very fine turns and requires you to rotate back to your
upright position, rather than holding up and turning in a wider arc. That’s
pretty contrived, though.</p><p>One thing that caused me a headache was what to do at the surface of the water.
What was basically happening was the player was swimming past the waterline and
out of the liquid. They were then falling back down again when <code><span><span>GravityPhysics</span></span></code>
kicked in, flipping between the two. It was very glitchy. My solution to this
was to introduce some logic for
‘<a href="https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/95478/bobbing-in-the-water" target="_blank">bobbing</a>’
on the water. I tried a few variations but eventually settled on a simple
approach that allowed the player to keep swimming up for a small amount of time
above their waterline but at a greatly reduced speed. After which, they’d drop
down (at the same speed) until below the waterline where they could ‘bob up’
again.</p><p>To control the swim speed and rate they turn in water, I added <code><span><span>swim_speed</span></span></code> and
<code><span><span>turn_rate</span></span></code> to my pre-existing <code><span><span>Agility</span></span></code> component that controls things like
the player’s foot speed and width of their jump arc.</p><a href="#walking-underwater"><h2 id="walking-underwater">Walking underwater</h2></a><p>I decided I wanted the player to be able to walk at the bottom of the liquid.
That’s kind of how it works in reality and it didn’t <em>seem</em> like it would be
hard to add. I basically distinguish between being ‘suspended’ in the liquid
and not (e.g. when walking at the bottom). When you’re not suspended, the
player controls fall through to the already existing walking/jumping controls
but with a few changes, mostly just slowing the player down and reducing their
jump velocity (using the <code><span><span>jump_scale_factor</span></span></code> I mentioned earlier). You also
can’t boost to go faster.</p><p>The slight difficulty here is that normally, gravity is pushing down on you,
which keeps you on the ground. If you swim down to the ground but then stop
pressing down, it doesn’t know you’re still ‘touching’ the ground because
there’s nothing pushing you into it each update (unless the liquid has negative
flow in the y-direction). Maybe this isn’t a problem for better engines than
mine, but my fix was to basically constantly apply a negative velocity of the
player’s swim speed to keep them anchored on the ground after reaching it. I
like this solution because it means if the liquid has a lot of upthrust - more
than the player’s swim speed - they won’t be able to ‘cheat’ and stick to the
ground when they shouldn’t be able to. Similarly, my solution for bobbing on
the water has a similar property. Once you’re pushed under the water, its flow
takes over and out-paces your swim speed.</p><p>A problem I ran into at this point was with accidentally killing the player.
When walking on the ground, i first reset the player’s rotation so they’re
upright, but if they’re too close to the ground (swimming parallel to it), this
can sometimes place the player entity inside the ground. I have some code that
tries to detect if the player has been crushed based on the magnitude of
collision response. This can sometimes trip and kill the player. Not good!</p><p>My solution (read: hack) for this is to give the player a ‘free pass’ from the
grim reaper for a single frame - the exact moment their rotation is reset. I
also re-position the player slightly to reduce the size of this collision and
hopefully prevent any …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>Earlier this year, DeisLabs released Krustlet, a project to implement Kubelet
in Rust. <sup id="fnref:Fisher"><a href="#fn:Fisher">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:Squillace"><a href="#fn:Squillace">2</a></sup> Kubelet is the component of Kubernetes that
runs on each node which is assigned Pods by the control plane and runs them on
its node. Krustlet defines a flexible API in the <code>kubelet</code> crate, which allows
developers to build Kubelets to run new types of workloads. The project
includes two such examples, which can run Web Assembly workloads on WASI or
waSCC runtimes. <sup id="fnref:wasmtime"><a href="#fn:wasmtime">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:waSCC"><a href="#fn:waSCC">4</a></sup> Beyond this, I have been working to
develop a Rust Kubelet for traditional Linux containers using the Container
Runtime Interface (CRI). <sup id="fnref:krustlet-cri"><a href="#fn:krustlet-cri">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:CRI"><a href="#fn:CRI">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Over the last few releases, Krustlet has focused on expanding the functionality
of these Web Assembly Kubelets, such as adding support for init containers,
fixing small bugs, and log streaming. This, in turn, has built quite a bit of
interest in alternative workloads and node architectures on Kubernetes, as well
as demonstrated the many strengths of Rust for development of these types of
applications.</p>

<p>For the <code>v0.5.0</code> release, we turned our attention to the internal architecture
of Krustlet, in particular how Pods move through their lifecycle, how
developers write this logic, and how updates to the Kubernetes control plane
are handled. <sup id="fnref:Pod-Lifecycle"><a href="#fn:Pod-Lifecycle">7</a></sup> We settled upon a state machine implementation
which should result in fewer bugs and greater fault tolerance. This refactoring
resulted in substantial changes for consumers of our API; however we believe
this will result in code that is much easier to reason about and maintain. For
an excellent summary of these changes, and description of how you can migrate
code that depends on the <code>kubelet</code> crate, please see Taylor Thomas’ excellent
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/releases/tag/v0.5.0">Release Notes</a>.
In this post I will share a deep dive into our new architecture and the
development journey which led to it.</p>

<h2 id="the-trailhead">The Trailhead</h2>

<p>Before <code>v0.5.0</code>, developers wishing to implement a Kubelet using Krustlet
primarily needed to implement the <code>Provider</code> trait, which allowed them to write
methods for handling events like <code>add</code>, <code>delete</code>, and <code>logs</code> for Pods scheduled
to that node. This offered a lot of flexibility, but was a very low-level API.
We identified a number of issues with this architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>The entire lifecycle of a Pod was defined in 1 or 2 monolithic methods of the
<code>Provider</code> trait. This resulted in messy code and a very poor understanding
of error handling in the many phases of a Pod’s lifecycle.</li>
<li>Pod and Container status patches to the Kubernetes control plane were
scattered throughout the codebase, both in the <code>kubelet</code> crate and the
<code>Provider</code> implementations. This made it very difficult to reason about what
was actually reported back to the user and when, and involved lot of repeated
code.</li>
<li>Unlike the Go Kubelet, if Krustlet encountered an error it would report the
error back to Kubernetes and then (most of the time) end execution of the
Pod. There was no built-in notion of the reconciliation loop that one expects
from Kubernetes.</li>
<li>We recognized that a lot of these issues were left to each developer to
solve, but were things that any Kubelet would need to handle. We wanted to
move this kind of logic into the <code>kubelet</code> crate, so that each provider did
not have to reinvent things.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>

<p>At its core, Kubernetes relies on declarative (mostly immutable) manifests, and
controllers which run reconciliation loops to drive cluster state to match this
configuration. Kubelet is no exception to this, with its focus being
indivisible units of work, or Pods. Kubelet simply monitors for changes to Pods
that have been assigned to it by <code>kube-scheduler</code>, and runs a loop to attempt
to run this work on its node. In fact, I would describe Kubelet as no different
from any other Kubernetes controller, except that it has the additional
first-class capability for streaming logs and exec sessions. However these
capabilities, as they are implemented in Krustlet, are orthogonal to this
discussion.</p>

<p>Our goal with this rewrite was to ensure that Krustlet would mirror the official
Kubelet’s behavior as closely as possible. We found that many details about
this behavior are undocumented, and spent considerable time running the
application to infer its behavior and inspecting the Go source code. Our
understanding is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Kubelet watches for Events on Pods that have been scheduled to it by
<code>kube-scheduler</code>.</li>
<li>When a Pod is added, the Kubelet enters a control loop to attempt to run the
Pod which only exits when the Pod is <code>Completed</code> (all containers
exit successfully) or <code>Terminated</code> (Pod is marked for deletion via the
control plane and execution is interrupted).</li>
<li>Within the control loop, there are various steps such as <code>Image Pull</code>,
<code>Starting</code>, etc., as well as back-off steps which wait some time before
retrying the Pod. At each of these steps, the Kubelet updates the control
plane.</li>
</ul>

<p>We recognized this pretty quickly as a finite-state machine design pattern,
which consists of infallible state handlers and valid state transitions. This
allows us to address the issues mentioned above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Break up the <code>Provider</code> trait methods for running the Pod into short,
single-focus state handler methods.</li>
<li>Consolidate status patch code to where a Pod enters a given state.</li>
<li>Include error and back-off states in the state graph, and only stop
attempting to execute a Pod on <code>Terminated</code> or <code>Complete</code>.</li>
<li>Move as much of this logic into <code>kubelet</code> as possible so that providers need
only focus on implementing the state handlers.
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>With this architecture it becomes very easy to understand the behavior of the
application, and strengthens our confidence that the application will not enter
undefined behavior. In addition, we felt that Rust would allow us to achieve
our goals while presenting an elegant API to developers, and with full
compile-time enforcement of our state machine rules.</p>

<h2 id="our-animal-guide">Our Animal Guide</h2>

<p>When first discussing the requirements of our state machine, and the daunting
task of integrating it with the existing Krustlet codebase, we recalled an
excellent blog post,
<a href="https://hoverbear.org/blog/rust-state-machine-pattern/">Pretty State Machine Patterns in Rust</a>,
by Ana Hobden (hoverbear), which I think has inspired a lot of Rust developers.
The post explores patterns in Rust for implementing state machines which
satisfy a number of constraints and leverage Rust’s type system. I encourage
you to read the original post, but for the sake of this discussion I will
paraphrase the final design pattern here:</p>

<pre><code>struct StateMachine&lt;S&gt; {
    state: S,
}

struct StateA;

impl StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt; {
    fn new() -&gt; Self {
        StateMachine {
            state: StateA
        }
    }
}

struct StateB;

impl From&lt;StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt;&gt; for StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt; {
    fn from(val: StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt;) -&gt; StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt; {
        StateMachine {
            state: StateB 
        }
    }
}

struct StateC;

impl From&lt;StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt;&gt; for StateMachine&lt;StateC&gt; {
    fn from(val: StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt;) -&gt; StateMachine&lt;StateC&gt; {
        StateMachine {
            state: StateC 
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let in_state_a = StateMachine::new();

    // Does not compile because `StateC` is not `From&lt;StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt;&gt;`.
    // let in_state_c = StateMachine::&lt;StateC&gt;::from(in_state_a);

    let in_state_b = StateMachine::&lt;StateB&gt;::from(in_state_a);

    // Does not compile because `in_state_a` was moved in the line above.
    // let in_state_b_again = StateMachine::&lt;StateB&gt;::from(in_state_a);

    let in_state_c = StateMachine::&lt;StateC&gt;::from(in_state_b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ana introduces a number of requirements for a good state machine
implementation, and achieves them with concise and easily interpretable code.
In particular, these requirements (some based on the definition of a state
machine, and some on ergonomics) were a high priority for us:</p>

<ul>
<li>One state at a time.</li>
<li>Capability for shared state.</li>
<li>Only explicitly defined transitions should be permitted.</li>
<li>Any error messages should be easy to understand.</li>
<li>As many errors as possible should be identified at <strong>compile-time</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next section I will discuss some additional requirements that we
introduced and how these impacted the solution. In particular, we relaxed some
of Ana’s goals in exchange for greater flexibility, while satisfying those
listed above.</p>

<h2 id="tribulation">Tribulation</h2>

<p>We were off to a great start, but it was time to consider how we want
downstream developers to interact with our new state machine API. In
particular, while the Kubelets we are familiar with all follow roughly the same
Pod lifecycle, we wanted developers to be able to implement arbitrary state
machines for their Kubelet. For example, some workloads or architectures may
need to have additional provisioning states for infrastructure or data, or
to introduce post-run states for proper garbage collection of resources.
Additionally, it felt like an anti-pattern to have a parent method (<code>main</code> in
the example above) which defines the logic for progressing through the states,
as this felt like having two sources of truth and was not something we could
implement on behalf of our downstream developers for arbitrary state machines.
Ana had discussed how to hold the state machine in a parent structure using an
<code>enum</code>, but it felt clunky to introduce large match statements which could
introduce runtime errors.</p>

<p>We knew that to allow arbitrary state machines we would need a <code>State</code> trait to
mark types as valid states. We felt that it would be possible for this trait to
have a <code>next()</code> method which runs the state and then returns the next <code>State</code>
to transition to, and we wanted our code to be able to simply call <code>next()</code>
repeatedly to drive the machine to completion. This pattern, we soon found,
introduced a number of challenges.</p>

<pre><code>/// Rough pseudocode of our plan.

trait State {
    /// Do work for this state and return next state.
    async fn next(self) -&gt; impl State;
}

fn drive_state_machine(mut state: impl State) {
    loop {
        state = state.next().await;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="what-does-next-return">What does <code>next()</code> return?</h3>

<p>Within our loop, we are repeatedly overwriting a local variable with
<em>different</em> types that all implement <code>State</code>. …</p></div></div>

<p><em>In case you are coming from Hacker News and are confused about some comments, be aware that I updated the essay to deal with some criticism</em>.</p>



<p>The title is not hyperbole. I do think that privacy is the most important concept of our time. Let me tell you why:</p>



<ul><li><strong>internet is not a virtual world anymore</strong>, it is a dimension that permeates our lives; we work, socialize and get informed through the internet</li><li><strong>our society is more diverse</strong>; we have some things in common with our neighbors and some with separate communities</li><li><strong>privacy is integral to separate the</strong> <strong>different parts of our lives</strong>; once the separation could be just physical and accidental (i.e., you live here and work there), now it must be built intentionally because there are no natural barriers in information spreading</li></ul>



<p>In short, internet has made sharing information easier and complexity has made information more dangerous. We need to evolve our understanding of rules and norms to deal with this new situation. </p>



<p>I have always believed in the importance of privacy, but I felt that common definitions (e.g., <em>the right to be left alone</em>) were lacking. In fact, I think that the whole conceptualization of privacy as simply a right of an individual and regarding private information as partial and limiting.</p>



<p>Think about this: the government can send policemen to surveil you and everybody they deem interesting. However, it can do this only for few people. <strong>This limitation is due to physical constraints, not legal ones</strong>. There is a limited number of policemen and you would notice if there was a police car in front of each house of the neighborhood. <strong>This is not true for internet communications: the government can spy everyone at once and you would never notice</strong>. As many whistleblowers have revealed, this is what the NSA has actually done.</p>



<p>So, the changes in society affect privacy directly but may also affect all our rights indirectly. Privacy is the fundamental principle that must respond to these changes.</p>



<p>You might say that then, maybe, I am not really thinking about privacy, but rather something else. That might be true, so let’s not talk about privacy, instead let’s talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#Umberto_Eco">Ur-Privacy</a>, the principles of any possible concept of privacy. Take this essay as the opinion of a random guy that cares about the issue.</p>



<div><h2>What is Ur-Privacy</h2><p><em>A few principles for privacy</em></p></div>







<p><strong>Privacy is not just something we need to separate our private live from our public live. It is necessary to separate our private live, the communities we belong to and the public sphere from each other.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Privacy is about boundaries.</strong> It is not about hiding something but allowing to create a space with rules decided by its members. I like to compare it to borders. Some people say that borders are a restriction, something that limit freedom of movement and we do not need in the contemporary world. As if they were arbitrary obstacles put there by petty people. It almost makes sense if you do not think about them, after all you are actually stopped at a border.</p>



<p>However, that is not true, that is not why they exist. Borders delimit the area that a certain state control, an area where a specific set of rules and laws applies. There was a time before borders, in fact most of human history did not have clear borders. It was not a time of freedom, but anarchy, where bands of barbarians could roam into your home and pillage everything.</p>



<p>In this context is also important to remember that before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a> modern European states were plagued by continual wars. The short version is that this was due to the combination of two facts:</p>



<ul><li>modernity begets differences, different kings choose different religions<sup><a id="link_1" href="#note_1" data-type="internal" data-id="#note_1">1</a></sup> and separated societies</li><li>however, the legitimacy of kings was still based on shared medieval ideals, like the concept of divine rule</li></ul>



<p>In short, the issue was not that <strong>leaders wanted to make war all the time, they needed to do so</strong> because the legitimacy of their power depended, at least on some level, to what the rest of the European world was doing. If you claim to be a divine king there better be agreement on what the divine is, otherwise a guy that picks a different religion can also pick a different king. And, according to some, he could be a legitimate king. To change the situation this peace treaty established the principle that the internal affairs of a state are the exclusive interest of said state.</p>



<p>The connection with privacy is this: without clear rules on what is private and what is public, nobody knows which stuff belongs to whom. This means chaos and often that all belong to the strongest. Somebody might say that what you do in private, it is not private at all but political. It concerns the society at large. Therefore, it must be regulated according to their rules.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy does not imply hiding the truth.</strong> <strong>Meaning depends on context, therefore everything should be considered within its context.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Privacy is about control</strong>. Without privacy we cannot decide for ourselves how to live our lives. If there is no privacy, all become public. Whoever has more power and an interest can affect your life according to their own rules. Then, I have to care about what other people think, otherwise they will control how I can behave. As before the peace of Westphalia, the issue is not that other people are bad, <em>they have to do it</em>. When everything is subject to public scrutiny, you either control the rules and judge others or you are judged and controlled by others.</p>



<p>Think about this way: we say a lot of things in our private lives that are not meant to be taken literally. In private we say something and then we add: <em>you know what I mean</em>. And that is actually true. We can do that because the people we talk to in private know us; they understand the context in which our words must be understood. And even more importantly: they care about us; they do not want to intentionally misunderstand us.</p>



<p>When I was a child I would sometimes say and think that I wanted to kill my brother. I did not mean it literally and everybody knew it. If I said the same thing now, in public, to somebody that does not know me, the phrase would be different. It would be a threat.</p>



<p>Why is that? They are the exact same words. You know why, of course. I am different and the context is different. The real meaning of something, whether an action or a word, is not absolute, in most cases it is relative. When we speak in public, we share a different context, therefore our words have a different meaning. </p>



<p>So even if I say something as a hyperbole, or something that can be construed as an implicit threat (e.g., <em>they must be stopped at all costs</em>!), they might protest. You might say that they are overreacting, that it was just a joke, but how can they be sure of it? <strong>They do not know me.</strong> It is true that acts of violence are prepared by violent words. Even if you are unsure if something is really violent, you have to take a stand. You have to make clear that any attack against you is not permissible. Otherwise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings">somebody, maybe a crazy guy, might think that it is permissible and the right course of action</a>. Somebody might feel legitimated to take your land and kingdom.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy is not just needed to protect us from the government or exceptional situations. It is about understanding the rules that applies to every aspect of our life so that they can be fair for everybody.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Privacy is about everyday life</strong>. The issue is not simply that something we say can be considered a threat. When you are communicating with someone you need to be able to understand them. Communication requires a shared understanding at some level.</p>



<p>The easiest example to understand this are work discussions. When we talk with people that work in our field, we can communicate more easily the impact of a choice. This goes beyond the ability to use technical terminology: we know which are the main things to care about. The same discussion with our bosses would be different. Even making them understand the basic strengths and weaknesses is more challenging.</p>



<p>Now imagine being forced to communicate everything you do in the most general terms, to people that do not care about you, because <strong>everybody can see you</strong>. So, they can use any piece of information for their own needs. This could mean a policeman investigating you. It could also mean a company making you pay more for a pair sneakers, because they know how much disposable income you have and that you really love sneakers.</p>



<p>We need privacy to be aware of what is happening to us. It is too much to demand we know how other people interpret what we say. However, it is not excessive to ask that we can control what is shared about us.</p>



<div><h2>Privacy Affects Everything</h2><p><em>Defending privacy would require all-around changes</em></p></div>







<p><strong>Privacy is the most important concept of our time, because it influences everything else. Without privacy we do not know what rules applies. Our lives will be judged according to the rules of somebody else</strong> <strong>in ways we cannot even imagine.</strong></p>



<p>We cannot discuss all of the possible implications of privacy on other rights, so let’s see just the example of <em>freedom of speech</em>. Of course, sometimes you can also be judged for who you are: your religion or lack thereof, political opinion or sexual orientation.</p>



<blockquote><p>Give me six lines written by the most honest man, and there I will find something to hang him.</p><cite>Cardinal Richelieu</cite></blockquote>



<p>People lost jobs and had their lives ruined, because the mob judged something they said in private in a different way from what they expected. And they paid a price. You might say: that was fair. We might judge ourselves by our intentions, but others by their actions, which are real and objective.</p>







<p>I, for once, disagree with XKCD and this view. There are a couple of different issues here:</p>



<ul><li>how we should react to speech we disagree with</li><li>what was meant to be shared among friends was taken out of context and made public</li></ul>



<p>This complicates the …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>Two years ago I <a href="https://flatkill.org/">wrote</a> about then heavily-pushed Flatpak, self-proclaimed "Future of Apps on Linux". The article criticized the following three major flows in Flatpak:</p><ul>
<li>Most of the apps have full access to the host system but users are misled to believe the apps are sandboxed
</li><li>The flatpak runtimes and apps do not get security updates
</li><li>Flatpak breaks many aspects of desktop integration
</li></ul>

<!-- <p>A lot has changed in the 2 years (the company behind Flatpak is now just another IBM's brand for one thing) so let's see how Flatpak developers addressed these fundamental issues.</p> -->
<p>So let's see how Flatpak developers addressed these fundamental issues.</p>

<h2>The sandbox is STILL a lie</h2>

<p>Almost all popular apps on Flathub still come with <span>filesystem=host</span> or <span>filesystem=home</span> permissions, in other words, <b>write access to the user home directory</b> (and more) so all it takes to escape the sandbox is trivial <span>echo download_and_execute_evil &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc</span>. That's it.</p>


<p>The most popular applications on Flathub still suffer from this - Gimp, VSCodium, PyCharm, Octave, Inkscape, Audacity, VLC are still not sandboxed.</p>

<p>And, indeed, users are still mislead by the reassuring blue "sandboxed" icon. Two years is not enough to add a warning that an application is <b>not</b> sandboxed if it comes with dangerous permissions (like full access to your home directory)? Seriously?</p>

<img src="https://www.flatkill.org/2020/sandboxlie.png" alt="sandboxlie">

<h2>Flatpak apps and runtimes STILL contain long known security holes</h2>
<p>It took me about 20 minutes to find the first vulnerability in a Flathub application with full host access and I didn't even bother to use a vulnerability scanner.</p>

A perfect example is <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-17498">CVE-2019-17498</a> with public exploit <a href="https://github.com/github/securitylab/tree/main/SecurityExploits/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_disconnect_CVE-2019-17498">available</a> for some 8 months. The first app on Flathub I find to use libssh2 library is Gitg and, indeed, it does ship with unpatched libssh2.

<p>But is it just this one application? Let's look at the <b>official runtimes</b> at the heart of Flatpak (org.freedesktop.Platform and org.gnome.Platform <b>3.36</b> - as of time of writing used by most of the applications on Flathub). The first unpatched vulnerable dependency I found in the offical runtime is ffmpeg in version 4.2.1 with no security patches backported, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-12284">CVE-2020-12284</a>.</p><p>Recently I stumbled upon an article from 2011 which started what is today known as flatpak, <a href="https://people.gnome.org/~alexl/glick2">in the words of the project founder:</a></p>

<p><a href="https://people.gnome.org/~alexl/glick2"><b><i>"Another problem is with security (or bugfix) updates in bundled libraries. With bundled libraries its much harder to upgrade a single library, as you need to find and upgrade each app that uses it. Better tooling and upgrader support can lessen the impact of this, but not completely eliminate it."</i></b></a></p>

<p>After reading that it comes as no surprise flatpak still suffers from the same security issues as 2 years ago because flatpak developers knew about these problems from the beginning.</p>

<h2>Local root exploits are NOT considered a minor issue anymore!</h2>
<p>Great! Two years ago I wrote about a trivial local root exploit using flatpak to install suid binaries (<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-9780/">CVE-2017-9780</a>) and how it was downplayed by Flatpak developers as a minor security issue <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/releases/tag/0.8.7">here</a>. I am happy to see at least the attitude to local root exploits has changed and today <a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/security/advisories/GHSA-j2qp-rvxj-43vj">local root exploits</a> are considered high severity.

</p><h2>Desktop integration</h2>
<p>System and user fonts are now available to flatpak applications and basic font rendering settings are respected as well, however do not expect your changes in /etc/fonts, typically setting a proper fallback font for CJK characters, to work with flatpak.  KDE applications in flatpak are still ignoring themes, fonts and icon settings (tested with Qt5ct). Applications installed from the distribution sources do not have these problems, of course. <a href="https://www.flatkill.org/2020/desktopbrokenation.mp4">A quick screen capture to demonstrate</a>.</p>

<p>More importantly, fcitx, <i>the</i> IME for Chinese is still broken - it has been 2 years. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/2031">issue</a> I linked 2 years ago - especially of interest is <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/2031#issuecomment-655134889">the following comment</a> directly from fcitx developer:

</p><p><i>"Because fcitx im module in flatpak is from 4.2.97 and using a different dbus object path. <b>It need to be the same version of fcitx on your host</b>."</i></p>

So I need to run multiple fcitx daemons on my desktop and switch between them as I switch flatpak apps depending on which fcitx libraries are bundled with that app or maybe in the future of linux apps it's not possible to type chinese anymore and it's fine?

<p>While the "bundle everything" approach has proven very useful on servers it clearly does not work for desktop applications, let's keep linking system libraries in desktop applications (and use the bundled libraries as a fallback only) to avoid introducing all these problems to Linux desktop.</p>

<![CDATA[Using GNU stow to manage dotfiles]]>

October 2, 2020 | http://mathieuhendey.com/posts/stowing-dotfiles/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://mathieuhendey.com/posts/stowing-dotfiles/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I recently found about a piece of GNU software called Stow<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It lets you manage your dotfiles in a really simple way, meaning you can put them in git and have them easily transferable between machines.</p>
<p>What it will do is let you move all your dotfiles into a directory, and then symlink them back into your home directory with a simple command.</p>
<p>From the man page<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct sets of software and/or data located in separate
directories on the filesystem, and makes them all appear to be installed in a single directory tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="set-up">Set up</h2>
<p>First you’ll need to install <code>Stow</code> using your package manager of choice. I use a Mac so it’s just:</p>
<p>Then you’ll need to create a directory in which to store your dotfiles, and directories within it to keep them separate.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">mkdir ~/dotfiles;
mkdir ~/dotfiles/git;
mkdir ~/dotfiles/zsh;
</code></pre></div><p>Move your dotfiles into the relevant directories:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">mv ~/.gitconfig ~/dotfiles/git;
mv ~/.zshrc ~/dotfiles/zsh;
mv ~/.zshenv ~/dotfiles/zsh;
</code></pre></div><h2 id="the-magic-part">The magic part</h2>
<p>Now here’s where <code>stow</code> comes in. Stow will, given a source directory and a destination directory, create symlinks in the destination directory to all the files in the source directory.</p>
<p>From within <code>~/dotfiles</code></p>
<p>Here’s an explanation of what that command is doing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>-R</code> means “restow”. This will overwrite your symlinks, say if you’ve updated your dotfiles on another machine and want to sync them to your current machine From the manpage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Restow packages (first unstow, then stow again). This is useful for pruning obsolete symlinks
from the target tree after updating the software in a package.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-t ~</code> is the target directory. This is where the symlinks will be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final argument is the directory containing the files to be symlinked to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Putting it all together, running <code>stow -R -t ~ git</code> will create a symlink in your home directory to <code>~/dotfiles/git/.gitconfig</code>.</p>
<p>And it’s that simple.</p>
<p>Now you can <code>git init</code> inside your <code>~/dotfiles</code> directory, push them up to your remote and have them immediately available on all your machines.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple bit of bash that will stow all the dotfiles in your home directory from your <code>~/dotfiles</code> repo:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>for</span> d in */ ; <span>do</span>
    stow -R -t ~ <span>"</span>$d<span>"</span>
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For reference, <a href="https://github.com/mathieuhendey/dotfiles">here are my dotfiles on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Multiple NodeJS packages laden with malicious code have been spotted on npm registry.</p>



<p>These “typosquatting” packages served no purpose other than collecting data from the user’s device and broadcasting it on public GitHub pages.</p>



<p>The findings were spotted by Sonatype’s <a href="https://blog.sonatype.com/sonatype-spots-malicious-npm-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">automated malware detection systems</a> and further investigated by the company’s Security Research team which includes me. </p>



<p>The packages previously present on the open source npm registry included:</p>



<ol><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/electorn" target="_blank">electorn</a> (intentional misspelling of a legitimate package “electron”)</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/loadyaml" target="_blank">loadyaml</a> </li><li>loadyml</li><li>lodashs (intentional misspelling of a legitimate package “lodash”)</li></ol>



<p>All four packages were published by the same user “simplelive12” and have now been removed, with the first two having been taken down by npm as of October 1, 2020. The previous two packages were unpublished by the author themselves.</p>



<p>Once installed, <code>electorn</code> ran a script in the background <strong>every</strong> <strong>hour</strong> which collected the logged-in user’s IP, geolocation data, username, path to home directory, and CPU model information.</p>

<p>Sonatype’s Security Research team has accounted for these malicious packages into their products, and had notified both npm and GitHub teams of the malicious activity stemming from the components. This led to the takedown of these malicious packages. </p>



<p>To this date, all 4 packages have scored a little over <strong>400</strong> total downloads.</p>



<p>It is not exactly clear what was the purpose of collecting this data and why was it being published on the web for the world to see, however, incidents like these highlight the potential of typosquatting attacks on the open-source ecosystem.</p>



<p>We can only imagine what the next possible version of these packages could have been capable of – possibly carrying out even more sinister activities. </p>



<p>By tricking an unsuspecting developer into mistakenly installing a misspelled package, attackers can push their malicious code “downstream” into any other open-source projects that use the misspelled malicious component as a transitive dependency.</p>



<p>Adopting DevSecOps best practices and building security early on into your software development lifecycle can prevent “counterfeit components” such as electorn and loadyaml from entering, and thriving in your software supply chains.</p>



<p>The complete research findings are available on the <a href="https://blog.sonatype.com/sonatype-spots-malicious-npm-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonatype blog</a>.</p>

When asked to analyze the experiences of black people in the United Kingdom, we now talk with an American accent.</p><p>Take a look, for instance, at a meme that has been circulating among some of my white friends on Facebook and Instagram:</p><blockquote><p>I have privilege as a White person because I can do all of these things without thinking twice about it … I can go jogging (#AmaudArbery). I can relax in the comfort of my own home (#BothemSean and #AtatianaJefferson). I can ask for help after being in a car crash (#Jonathan Ferrell and #RenishaMcBride). I can have a cellphone (#StephonClark). I can leave a party to get to safety (#JordanEdwards). I can play loud music (#JordanDavis). I can sell CDs (#AltonSterling). I can sleep (#AiyanaJones). I can walk from the corner store (#MikeBrown).</p></blockquote><p>The post goes on and on, like an interminable spoken-word poem. All the individuals listed are American, but most of the people who have shared this on my timeline are British. In trying to express their solidarity with black Britons, they are affirming a supposedly transcendental truth: to be black is to live in perpetual terror of being murdered by the state. </p><p>But Britain is not America. And importing American race discourse into the United Kingdom not only prevents us from recognizing the specific ways in which racial injustice manifests in this country—it cloaks the reality of black British lives behind an abstraction that flattens our humanity. </p><p>Britain has a long and painful history of anti-black racism. In the twentieth century alone, the growing black presence led to a long catalogue of abuses: the 1919 race riots in Liverpool, Cardiff and London; the 1958 race riots in Nottingham and Notting Hill; the 1969 police murder of David Oluwale, a Nigerian immigrant who was tortured, pissed on and finally drowned in a river in Leeds. I could list other examples. It is not hard to see why the horrific killing of George Floyd has evoked such strong feelings in this country as well.</p><p>But for all of the country’s flaws, Britain is not America. Trying to understand its racial dynamics through the lens of another country’s does more to obscure than to illuminate the situation that black Britons like myself actually face.</p><p>The average black American in the United States can trace his ancestry further back than the average white American. Most black Americans are descended from enslaved Africans. Their forebears suffered through the segregation and racial terror of the Jim Crow era. The majority of black people in the United Kingdom, by contrast, are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Though many of them have certainly had harrowing experiences with injustice or discrimination, they do not have the same history of racist disadvantage.</p><p>To understand the experience of black Britons, it is not only necessary to grasp how different their history is from that of black Americans: we need to understand the diversity captured by the label “black British.” For example, around two out of every three students with Congolese or Somali origins get free school meals, a standard indicator that their parents are poor. Among students with Nigerian or Ghanaian origins, only one in five do. It is also noteworthy that black Caribbean students are twice as likely to be excluded from school as black African students. </p><p>The discrepancy in educational attainment is just as stark. On average, 58% of black African students graduate from middle school at grade level (defined as achieving A* to C grades at GCSE)—about the same number as white students. But black Caribbean students are significantly less likely to do so—while those whose parents hail from Nigeria actually outperform their white peers by a considerable margin. </p><p>None of this is to disavow the label “black British.” But we need to invest it with the nuance consonant with its reality—and to cast doubt on the idea that every discrepancy in representation must be explained by structural injustice or white supremacy.</p><p>There has, for example, been a lot of concern about the underrepresentation of black Britons in professions like the arts and publishing. But why would you choose to go into theater or journalism—rather than law, medicine or finance—if you are a talented child of ambitious but not well off immigrants? </p><p>This is not a flippant question. While representation can be important, anybody who actually wants to improve the condition of black Britons should at least be a little curious about why they are overrepresented in some prestigious professions and underrepresented in others. In a country in which black people make up only three percent of the population, for example, six percent of junior doctors are black. Would the country—or the black community—really benefit if more black Britons chose to ditch medicine for the theater? The debate is worth having. But in the place of that debate, there have only been pious paeans to diversity.</p><p>The stereotype of the West African parent who wants their child to study law or medicine bears some relation to reality; but the widespread view of black people as perennial victims devoid of agency is a defamatory abstraction. The black person in Britain, like Ralph Ellison’s iconic protagonist, is “invisible because no one wants to see him.”</p><p>So much of the British reaction to the death of George Floyd has constituted a failure of nerve. Desperately seeking to assuage their feelings of guilt, to do <em>something</em>, many Britons have sacrificed their critical faculties to a narrative that does not actually help black people—a narrative that, by reducing us to passive abstractions, only makes us more invisible.</p><p>Racists assume that black people are all the same. Ironically, anti-racists sometimes do so too. But anybody who is truly committed to racial equality needs to recognize that this kind of simplification neither serves justice nor reflects the truth.</p><p><strong>Tomiwa Owolade is a writer who lives in London.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <div>
                                                                            
                                                                         <p>Feeling down lately?</p>
<p>But you don’t know why?</p>
<p>This quick test helps you to figure it out and gives you tips on getting up again.</p>
<h2>Quick Test</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you sleep 7-8 hours a night for most of the last 7 days?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sleep is essential, and we should not skip on that. While we sleep, our brain processes the day and also cleans itself of toxic waste (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deep-sleep-gives-your-brain-a-deep-clean1/#:~:text=Why%20sleep%20has%20restorative%E2%80%94or,is%20hugely%20improved%20during%20sleep.">see</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you drink less than 10 drinks of alcohol in the last 7 days?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing to say against a drink or two. But if you take it too far, you start to feel down, groggy and more. Moreover, alcohol can be addictive, and you don’t want to become an alcoholic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you drink too much caffeine in the last 7 days? (Coffee, black tea, energy drinks, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caffeine is a short energy booster, but it comes with downsides too. It blocks the body’s desire to rest for a short time, but then your body is twice as tired, wanting to rest.</p>
<p>Now, if you drink caffeine again, you start a vicious cycle. You’ll only feel productive when you got your dose of caffeine. Otherwise, you feel tired again.</p>
<p>Over time you need to consume more and more caffeine to even get the effect.</p>
<p>Rest. Your body needs rest, and you should give it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think you’re eating healthy in the last 7 days?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your body needs proper nutrition to function.</p>
<p>A diet of chips, chocolate bars, ice cream, or fast food is not the right thing to fuel your body the energy it needs.</p>
<p>Once in a while, it is fine but don’t thrive on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you gone outside in the last 7 days?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pandemic here, pandemic there. But even without it, many of us don’t go outside enough—especially people working from home.</p>
<p>But we need movement and fresh air. So, enjoy a long walk in nature, or a park or forest near you. Or just stroll through your city.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you exercised in the last 7 days?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Move your ass. Doesn’t matter what kind of exercise you like, do it. Movement is king.</p>
<p>Not only will it lift your mood. It will also help you to think fresh and clear again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you meditated in the last 7 days? Or journaled, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meditation is a great tool to clear your thoughts and calming down. But you don’t need to sit still.</p>
<p>You can do <a href="https://mindfuldevmag.com/issues/issue-3-mindfulness-for-skeptics/walking-meditation">walking meditations</a> or journaling or other kinds of activities that help you to focus and clear your mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you done anything to actively relax?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be taking massages, doing yoga, taking a hot bath, sauna, or anything else that helps you relax.</p>
<p>Take your time and do it on purpose.</p>
<p>Btw watching tv might feel like relaxation, but it mostly is not. Our brain’s on alert mode.</p>
<p>Can’t decide on one?</p>
<p>Go for a walk in the next park.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you talked to other people or met with your friends? Preferably IRL</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the most introverted of us love to talk to somebody. Sure, I can go without days of talking to somebody except my family. But even that has its limit.</p>
<p>Talk or, better yet, meet your friends, and have a great time. None handy at the moment? Talk to your neighbor, cashiers, or anybody else you can have interactions with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re in a relationship, are you with the right person?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your relationship sucks, your mood will drop too. But if it is a loveable and stable one, it can lift you up and help through darker times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you helped someone in the last days with something you’re good at?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Believe it or not. It’s humans to help others and feel good about it at the same time. It’s totally refreshing and re-energizing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you made any new experiences in the last month?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doing the same old from day to day, week to week, and month to month can drag you down. It feels like a rut. Being stuck.</p>
<p>Energize your life and go for new experiences. Go for a hike, visit a new city, test a new restaurant. Whatever it is, pick something new.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you working on stuff that’s meaningful to you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does your job or the things you work on in your spare time give you enough meaning? Or does it feel like working for the devil?</p>
<p>Does it fulfill you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does your current situation allow you to do what you really want to do in life?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If not, think about what you could start to change? What are thing top 3 things holding you back?</p>
<p>How could you remove them?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you create anything in the last week?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does not matter what it is. Maybe you draw comics or paint art, make music, build websites, or whatever.</p>
<p>Let your creativity go wild, and your mood will go up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are your working on too many things at the same time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pursuing multiple things at the same time makes you feel like nothing moves forward. Often paired with getting frustrated and then feeling down.</p>
<p>Set your focus on one thing for now and work on that. The down feelings will fade.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have the feeling that you accomplished something?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we hustle and hustle but have the feeling we got nowhere. Just being tired and running towards a burnout.</p>
<p>Think about what small things you could add that make you feel to have accomplished something? Must not be work-related. It could also be private things you pushed for years in front of you.</p>
<h2>All Positive But Still Feeling Down?</h2>
<p>If you answered all questions positively and are still feeling down, it might be time to visit a therapist. There is no shame in that. We all need help sometimes.</p>
<p>Find someone near you or use an online service like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/">talkspace</a> or more on this <a href="https://www.e-counseling.com/online-therapy/">list of online therapy services</a>.</p>

		<p>After spending part of the last 12 months <a href="https://blog.luap.info/travelling-with-24-monitors.html">travelling in Europe</a> I'm now settling down around Paris and I need to adapt my multi-screens setup.</p>
<p>You probably have seen an ads for <a href="https://altwork.com/">the altwork desk</a> <em>a $7000 desk that let you work laying down</em>. Spending a big part of my day in front of a computer I want to have the most comfortable position as possible, but well $7000 + $1000 for the delivery seems so expensive. There is also <a href="http://www.ergoquest.com/">this company</a> but this is still about $4000 all included. Let's be creative and build it myself.</p>
<p>Here is the result</p>
<p><img alt="complete desk" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/complete.jpg"> </p>
<p>The things I have to take into account are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have three monitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no diy tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want a laying down position</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should be easy to use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should be light and not take too much space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have only a bike to move the parts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven't found anyone who has done something similar and so don't really have examples</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So instead of doing the waterfall way I decided to go the agile way and to not do any plans, I didn't know what to expect, so let's do it step by step and see how it goes</p>
<h2>Take care of the chair</h2>
<p>There are several options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Built a chair from scratch including the 'mattress' part</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a reclined chair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adapt a chair</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The issue with the first option is that I will not be sure of the result, is it going to be comfortable ? How I'm going to wash the seat covers ? I have no idea of the things to take into account for building a comfortable chair.</p>
<p>Reclined chairs are great but they are very heavy (except the garden ones but not very comfortable) and expensive. So again let's be creative, I got inspired by <a href="https://www.ikeahackers.net/2017/04/poang-gravity-recliner.html">this</a> and <a href="https://www.ikeahackers.net/2020/04/remove-poang-arms.html">this</a> ikea hacks which use a IKEA POANG chair and transform it into a reclined chair.</p>
<p>Here is the result :</p>
<p><img alt="ikea poang adaptation" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/chair.jpg"></p>
<p>The chair is 69 euro, I had to buy three cushion to extend it</p>
<p>The most complex part was to do 7km with the chair on a bike. I do not recommend doing the same, particularly because I have done it on a rainy day but well a bit of challenge in my life is always welcome!</p>
<p><img alt="ikea bike" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/ikea_bike.jpg"></p>
<p>Great, the chair is comfortable, let's do something for the desk part.</p>
<h2>What structure for the desk</h2>
<p>The biggest issue you are going to have with the lay down position, is that the desk is going to be on your legs and you cant 'enter' or 'leave' the desk if you can't move the desk. So you need the 'desk' part to be dynamic from the 'chair' part.</p>
<p>I had two ideas for that, either the Altwork way, the structure goes above your head and can incline, or the the base is on the side and the desk can move somewhere (writing that, having the desk in front of me, I wonder if having the base where the foot are is not an even better solution ? Damn, too late). Having the base on the side seems better because it would be smaller and lighter and also you can balance the weight much better. But the structure also needs to be more rigid and I need to find a way to incline the desk, anyway I haven't found a way to do it :(, after a night of thinking I went the altwork way.</p>
<p>There are two parts to design:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The base + the incline system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The desk + the screen supports</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Base + incline system</h3>
<p>The base is pretty standard, you need something strong enough so that it can suppot the whole thing. At that point I still didn't know the weight of the complete platform so I didn't know how strong it should be. After a few failing choices, I ended up with a main pole of 7cm x 7cm.</p>
<p>Now the complex part, how to design the rotation part ? How heavy is going to be the rest of desk ? How much does the desk need to move so that I can 'enter' the desk ? So many questions I didnt have an answer for.</p>
<p>So let's try something and see how it goes, I bought an <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00H8SZ87W">gaz actuator on Amazon</a> which can support 70kg with a range of 31cm, it is built for cars and pretty cheap, 19euro. Actually 70kg is a lot. So at least I have a some freedom on the weight of the structure.</p>
<p>I had two issues with the actuator:</p>
<ul>
<li>70kg IS A LOT, it is so much that when I was fixing it on the wood of the base, it was breaking the wood. The best would be to have an iron piece that I can fix to the wood but I didnt have the tools for that so I used stronger woods but this is still fragile. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="fixation verrin" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/fixation_verrin.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>The desk follows a circular trajectory when you move it up and down. As a result the barycenter of the structure changes depending on the Y position of the 'desk part' and so there is more strength applied on the actuator when it is up than when it is down. So basically the desk will not stay by itself when in the up position.  I need to find a way to get the desk in the up position.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not really proud of the way I've done it, but it somewhat works. I've built a piece of wood that inserts itself in the area between the two poles where the actuator is. There is a counterweight which drags the piece into the zone when in up position, and when I want to release it, I just need to pull on the rope. (I think I will replace the actuator with a real electric actuator when the current system breaks so that I can control the movement, it is about 120euro)</p>
<p><img alt="system block" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/blocking_system.jpg"></p>
<h3>2. Desk + screens support</h3>
<p>I bought a chipboard plate of 80cm x 120cm, and cut some space for my body</p>
<p><img alt="plaque bois" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/agglo.jpg"> </p>
<p>This is pretty solid, so I can directly screw this plate to the pole and we have a desk surface</p>
<p><img alt="plaque bureau" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/bureau_with_plaque.jpg"></p>
<p>For holding the monitors I did something pretty basic, I created a box for each screen. Then comes the position of the screen, how to know the position of each screen ? I didnt know how to know it beforehand, so I just created dynamic arms and adjusted them while in front of the screens</p>
<p><img alt="support monitor" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/support_monitor.jpg"></p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>This is only a few days old so I can't really make a feedback but there are already a few things that I need to fix</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I can't use a mouse anymore, as the mouse would fall down, I'm probably going to replace it by a trackball</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to invest in an ergonomic keyboard to get really comfortable, probably going to buy the kenesis advantage 2, but this is expensive !</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a video of the complete desk:</p>

</video>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When you want to build this kind of structure, I'm not sure you can plan everything beforehand, there are always things that will happen that you didn't expect, like when you code: if you want to modify the actuator when the 60kg setup is mounted how do you do ? (I have done it 6 times) When your base can't support the weight because it lacks one screw and you need to unmount everything what do you do ? ...</p>
<p>I'm really annoyed by the actuator part, I hope I will find something more reliable</p>
<p>Overall it cost me :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>45 euro for tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>130 euro for wood pieces, screws, joins, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>110 euro for the IKEA chair + cushions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and I spent 26 hours working, excluding the transport and the time shopping for pieces</p>
<p>Don't forget when you do woodworking to clean afterwards  :)</p>
<p><img alt="dirty" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/desk/dirty_floor.jpg"></p>
<p>If you have done something similar and know a few advice, please send me an email</p>
<p>PS: If you wonder whether you can do that or not, everyone can do it, basic woodworking is not complex, you need to know how to cut wood, how to join wood, how to screw and a little bit of imagination, you dont even need a car to transport parts, I transported everything: pole of 2m40, big plate ... on a bike</p>

    <div>
<p>In Flancia the internet is truly open: they managed to get rid of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform">walled gardens</a>. How they did it is an interesting&nbsp;story.</p>
<h2>Status&nbsp;quo</h2>
<p>Let’s take just one example; it should suffice to represent the general approach they took. In Flancia they had a social network — well, they had many of course, same as we do, but one in particular had grown into dominance. People had sort of liked it at some point, then eventually didn’t anymore, but they were stuck with it by then; it had developed at just the right time in internet history, and it had done enough things right in the beginning to take over from contenders and really soar in&nbsp;usage. </p>
<p>As it often was the case in those days, this network was fully controlled by a single corporation, and although at the beginning there were some provisions in place that made it look like a relatively healthy platform eventually the company had chosen to consolidate their dominion; namely close down APIs and turn it into a walled garden. By then network effects had taken over and de facto locked people in, too: the company had gotten users to build up an expansive social graph for them and had succeeding in retaining control over it. They proceeded to use this virtual monopoly on many users’ social capital and attention to make billions selling ads — and gained the ability to significantly steer public opinion in the process, too. Many people recognized problems with this approach, but users at large mostly kept using it. It was that or being locked out of a significant portion of social activity online and&nbsp;offline. </p>
<h2>X marks the&nbsp;spot</h2>
<p>One of the obstacles that Flancians faced when trying to improve on this status quo was that there was no single clearly better platform of choice available; in areas where there were some alternatives there were often too many, so the competitive landscape was fragmented, and that played to the company’s advantage. The company also used their ad-fueled wealth to buy most promising contenders and offer them as relatively empty alternatives to their main network, while effectively gaining access to more social data and expanding their influence. After a while network effects and inertia were so strong that competitors all but stopped trying; social networks are known to be hard to decamp from, as most of their value is in the social graph that users build on them; and the oh-so-valuable graph was kept very deep within the company’s walled&nbsp;garden. </p>
<p>Flancians didn’t have much when facing this dire state of affairs, but they had one thing, and it was an important one: they had <a href="https://flancia.org/agora/">a machine for solving coordination problems</a>. So they used it. First they sketched out a declaration of intents flowing naturally from their publicly espoused&nbsp;values.</p>
<ul>
<li>Useful internet platforms should be&nbsp;open.</li>
<li><span>‘</span>Open’ means that no single monolithic entity can fully control them and that their inner workings are transparent to interested parties and appropriately&nbsp;malleable.</li>
<li><span>‘</span>Open’ is desirable because otherwise monolithic egotistical entities can gain control of the network and extort value out of its users, or mislead&nbsp;them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then they proceeded to write a plan together. The first version was remarkably simple; a sketch to get the real discussion started. It said essentially as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each useful internet platform X that is not&nbsp;open:</li>
<li>Let X’ be its open&nbsp;replica.</li>
<li>Write down a plan to reimplement its core functionality, F(X’) ≈&nbsp;F(X).</li>
<li>Write down a plan to reproduce its critical data set, D(X’) ≈&nbsp;D(X).</li>
<li>Add X’ to the <a href="https://anagora.org/wiki/Missing_Devices">Catalog of Missing Devices</a> in the Agora. This both marks it as a canonical replica of X and announces it as a priority for&nbsp;Flancians.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this bootstrap process was complete, the standard Agora algorithms took over; Flancians would best-effort iterate, improving on plans and resource estimates and executing actions as available to them, until failure or&nbsp;convergence.</p>
<p>Social networks were useful internet platforms; the Agora, after all, was in many ways a social network (a focused, goal-oriented one). So Flancians set out to replicate the company’s social network. They named that particular X’ <em>Flanbook</em> — after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Sand">The Book of Sand</a>, of course. It was fitting because the task of replicating it seemed at that point in time infinite in&nbsp;scope.</p>
<h2>I(X’)</h2>
<p>Looking around, it turned out that Flancians were relatively lucky. Most of the tools and libraries needed to build an open replica of the social network were available off-the-shelf. From all its algorithms, its ranking algorithms were perhaps the most sophisticated; but Flancians intended to replace those anyways, thinking the community could do better, so that was not an issue. The road to I(X’) was not trivial by any means, but it wasn’t very interesting for the purpose of telling this particular&nbsp;story.</p>
<h2>D(X’)</h2>
<p>In the case of social networks, then, it followed that most of their value was in their data; and, from all their data, none was more valuable than their social graph. Here Flancians had an ideological advantage, albeit perhaps not strictly a legal one to begin with, as they were known to often burst into chant in unison in barely appropriate&nbsp;occasions:</p>
<p><em>This, which is our data,<br>
will always be our data.<br>
A Flancian and their data<br>
shall never come apart.</em><br></p>
<p>This somewhat awkward ritual came handy sometimes, though. Flancians strongly believed that any information they produced and maintained was theirs; they believed this almost as much as they believed in the Agora. To a Flancian, the idea of their part of the social graph (the piece they had contributed a node and edges to) being out of their reach, locked down somewhere deep in a walled garden, just didn’t make sense. They refused to take it. So they just agreed to take their data&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>To perform this kind of task in a scalable way, they built special devices called <em>syphons</em>. The simplest came in the form of browser extensions. Whenever a Flancian used a targeted service X, the syphon redirected relevant data in the background to the replica X’. This allowed building up D(X’) incrementally so it could eventually function as a drop-in replacement. Flancians agreed to use these devices any time they could in platforms being replicated, even when they were not otherwise directly involved in the replication&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>Now, Flancians are an altogether friendly group, and they have the added advantage of knowing how to use an Agora; but they still do sometimes come into disagreements. Here Flancians disagreed with each other in how to define <em>relevant</em> in the above paragraph. Some Flancians, believing closed platforms to be actively dangerous to society, took the position that <em>all</em> data could be considered relevant in the noble pursuit of replicating such platforms, and consequently took a relatively aggressive stance and built and used syphons that actively sought to crawl and extract the largest portion of D(X) possible as fast as possible, regardless of provenance of data. Other Flancians, mostly aligned with the Middle Way, built syphons that only extracted data that they could strongly claim to be <em>theirs</em> to begin with, according to a shared and public&nbsp;definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the user of the syphon added the node or edge, it is considered&nbsp;relevant.</li>
<li>If a non-Flancian added the node or edge, and they give explicit consent to extraction, it is&nbsp;relevant.</li>
<li>If a Flancian added the node or edge, it is relevant (Flancians consent by default to the rational constructive actions of other&nbsp;Flancians).</li>
</ul>
<p>The second approach introduced the additional problem of identifying users across platforms and tracking consent. The syphons offered cross-platform validation as a feature; otherwise it could be manually accomplished by cross-posting tokens and declarations of intent publicly in the relevant&nbsp;networks.</p>
<p>Once this system was in place, it would presumably make D(X’) converge into a usable&nbsp;dataset.</p>
<p>The company, of course, put up a battle. They correctly identified X’ as an existential risk, and sought to attack syphons and their users. This started an arms race. Both groups of Flancians were affected differently, with those subscribing to the Middle Way being on more solid legal footing. The fact that Flancians had enough resources and a platform to organize a united resistance (the Agora) helped them tremendously; also helpful was the fact that relatively small but dense parts of D(X’) were sufficient to bootstrap smaller social networks within the&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>It would be perhaps unwise of me to say at this point which group fared better in the end, and precisely when and how the first replication project was brought to effective completion. Suffice it to say that Flanbook was a success, at least for a while, and it remains somewhat popular among the more old school Flancians. I, myself, am more partial to&nbsp;Instaflan.</p>

<p>Now, the latest Chrome is stopping to send the URL path as HTTP Referer on cross-domain access.</p>

<p>If you analyze access to your web site, you can not know which article leads the user to your site.</p>

<h2>Beginning</h2>

<p>We have a blog as our own media to lead to our web service.
And, we are monitoring the reference URLs to our web service.</p>

<p>We happen to nice that the more and more reference is from the blog top page, and less and less reference from each article URLs.</p>

<h2>Chrome 85</h2>

<p>From our access logs, it looks like the change happens only on Chrome.</p>

<p>And, we noticed that the default "Referrer Policy" is changed from <strong>no-referrer-when-downgrade</strong> to <strong>strict-origin-when-cross-origin</strong> on Chrome85.</p>

<p>For example, the reference URL "<a href="https://paiza.hatenablog.com/entry/2020/10/01/140612">https://paiza.hatenablog.com/entry/2020/10/01/140612</a>" is stripped to "<a href="https://paiza.hatenablog.com/">https://paiza.hatenablog.com/</a>" .</p>

<p><cite><a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6251880185331712">www.chromestatus.com</a></cite></p>

<p>But, actually, when I test on Chrome85 my machine, the setting was  "no-referrer-when-downgrade", yet.
It looks that the setting is changing gradually.</p>

<h2>How to see the Referrer Policy</h2>

<p>We can see that what URL is sent as Referer on the cross-domain link.</p>

<p><a href="https://webdbg.com/test/refer/">https://webdbg.com/test/refer/</a></p>

<p>If the first green box has a URL with the path, your Chrome has "no-referrer-when-downgrade" as the Referrer Policy.</p>

<figure title="ãƒ‘ã‚¹å��ã�Œã�‚ã‚‹å&nbsp;´å�ˆ"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002143005.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002143005p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002143005p:plain" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>URL with path(no-referrer-when-downgrade)</figcaption></figure>

<p>If the first green box has a URL without the path like below, your Chrome has the new "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" settings like below.</p>

<figure title="ãƒ‘ã‚¹å��ã�Œã�ªã�„å&nbsp;´å�ˆ"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002142849.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002142849p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002142849p:plain" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>URL without path(strict-origin-when-cross-origin)</figcaption></figure>

<p>You can also see the Referrer-Policy on Chrome developer tool, network tab.</p>

<p><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002143238.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002143238p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002143238p:plain" itemprop="image"></span></p>

<h2>Why is the "Referrer Policy" changed ?</h2>

<p>The Referrer Policy is changed because of privacy and security concerns.</p>

<p>The Referer URL may contain search keywords, account ID, e-mail address, or other IDs, and the information may be sent to the linked site as "Referer".</p>

<p><cite><a href="https://web.dev/referrer-best-practices/">web.dev</a></cite></p>

<figure title="(https://web.dev/referrer-best-practices/ ã‚ˆã‚Š)"><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002143341.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002143341p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002143341p:plain" itemprop="image"></span><figcaption>(from <a href="https://web.dev/referrer-best-practices/)">https://web.dev/referrer-best-practices/)</a></figcaption></figure>

<p>Nowadays, security and privacy are getting more critical than before. So, other browsers may change the settings as Chrome does.</p>

<h2>Current Referrer Policy deployment status</h2>

<p>How many Chrome85 have new "strict-origin-when-cross-origin", at now ?</p>

<p>At first, I created a poll at Slack. It looks more than half have the new settings.</p>

<p><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002143535.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002143535p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002143535p:plain" itemprop="image"></span></p>

<p>Also, from the access logs to our web sites, the percentage of Referer from the top page is growing from less than 10% to around 20% on  8th/Sep, and more than 50% on 29th/Sep or later.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>If you can change the HTTP header or the HTML meta tag, you can change the Policy Referrer settings.</p>

<h3>HTTP header(Policy-Referrer) settings</h3>

<p>You can change Policy-Referrer HTTP response header field.
On nginx, you can change the configuration file like below.</p>

<pre data-lang="" data-unlink="">add_header 'Referrer-Policy' 'no-referrer-when-downgrade';</pre>


<h3>meta tag(name=referer) settings</h3>

<p>You can also change using the HTML meta tag like below.</p>

<pre data-lang="html" data-unlink=""><span>&lt;</span><span>meta</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"referrer"</span><span> </span><span>content</span><span>=</span><span>"no-referrer-when-downgrade"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
</pre>


<h3>Chrome settings</h3>

<p>You can also change on Chrome settings by putting "chrome://flags/#reduced-referrer-granularity" on the URL bar for testing.
By enabling the settings, Chrome does not send pathname on the URL.
By disabling the settings, Chrome sends pathname on the URL.</p>

<p><span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Photograph"><img src="https://cdn-ak.f.st-hatena.com/images/fotolife/p/paiza/20201002/20201002153758.png" alt="f:id:paiza:20201002153758p:plain" title="f:id:paiza:20201002153758p:plain" itemprop="image"></span></p>



<p>On Safari 13 introducing ITP2.3, the access from the domain classified as tracker does not contain the path on Referer.</p>

<p><cite><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/">webkit.org</a></cite></p>



<p>The new Chrome85 is gradually stopping to send a URL path on Referer on cross-domain link, and it can cause huge impact on your web marketing.
I recommend checking your settings on web sites, access logs, or analysis tools.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I've been using JavaScript daily for 7 years, and I'm not able to remember the syntax of a JavaScript for loop.</p>
<p>Despite this fact, I'm a rather successful freelance developer. Recently I even had the awesome opportunity to work for Facebook, as the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2336">Docusaurus lead maintainer</a>, writing the code for the framework that powers the documentation sites of Babel, Prettier, Jest, ReactNative...</p>
<p>I'll explain why I'm not able to remember such syntax, and why it does not matter much.</p>
<hr>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: I'm a functional programmer</p>
<p>I've really started programming at the beginning of my engineer degree, around 2004 (before that, I was only able to hack some scripts for Counter-Strike console or IRC).</p>
<p>Most of our school teaching was based on Java, but we also saw a bit of C, C++, OCaml. </p>
<p>The first loop syntax I learned probably looked like this one:</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = Lists.newArrayList(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>);

<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {
   System.out.println(numbers.get(i));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Before I came out of school, Java 6 brought some new, simpler syntax:</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = Lists.newArrayList(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>);

<span>for</span> (Integer number : numbers) {
   System.out.println(number);
}
</code></pre>
<p>At my first job, the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google/guava">Google Guava</a> lib brought some new verbose functional syntax to Java, and I was able to do weird things with it 😅.</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = Lists.newArrayList(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>);

Lists.newArrayList(Collections2.transform(numbers, <span>new</span> Function&lt;Integer,Void&gt;() {
  <span>@Override</span>
  <span><span>public</span> Void <span>apply</span><span>(Integer number)</span> </span>{
    System.out.println(number);
    <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
  }
}));
</code></pre>
<p>This Guava lib got me intrigued by functional programming, and lead me to become a Scala developer since 2012, and I was finally able to use functional programming concepts (loops, but not only) without the ugly Java/Guava syntax.</p>
<pre><code>val numbers = List(1, 2, 3)
numbers.foreach(println)
</code></pre>
<p>In 2013, <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html">ReactJS came out</a>, and this totally changed my career path. At this time, I didn't like JavaScript much and was only able to hack some inline JQuery things in server-rendered pages. But as a startup CTO, I saw my team struggle with architecture, BackboneJS and RequireJS, and thought I had to become better at frontend to lead them.</p>
<p>AngularJS looked like the safer choice at this time, but a Scala developer colleague really pushed for React, which looked fancy and risky. All things made sense with the visionary post of David Nolen (<a target="_blank" href="https://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/">The Future of JavaScript MVC Frameworks</a>), and we finally adopted React in January 2014, as it seemed we would be able to use our functional programming knowledge to the frontend app as well, and make the UI more predictable.</p>
<p>Fast forward, it wasn't easy to be a React early-adopter for our critical app. All companies were building their own state management solution, trying to figure things out, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stample/atom-react">and so we did</a>, based on the ideas of David Nolen to hold a single immutable state in an atom (I was able to get a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxN8FYYBcrI">hacky time-travel working</a> before Redux). </p>
<p>Since then both the JavaScript language and the ReactJS ecosystem have progressed a lot, and it's very common to use functional programming principles nowadays.</p>

<p>As a long-time functional programmer, <strong>I simply don't write for loops</strong> very often. </p>
<p>Like anything you don't use regularly, you end up forgetting the syntax.</p>
<p>Today, many of us use ES5+ syntax (or Lodash/Ramda...) and some functional constructs. Using <code>map</code>, <code>forEach</code>, <code>filter</code> are the most illustrated examples in the JS community.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> numbers = [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>]
numbers.forEach(<span><span>number</span> =&gt;</span> <span>console</span>.log(number));
</code></pre>
<p>But we can go much further than that once we are more experienced with functional programming, and almost never write any for loops anymore. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, it's not necessarily a goal to not write for loops anymore, and I'm not telling you that you should remove all for loops of your production codebase.</p>
<p>Very often there's an alternative syntax possible for your loops that might be more expressive and easier to understand. After a while, you end up seeing a for loop as an implementation detail of a more elegant functional abstraction.</p>
<p>This more expressive syntax is not only for loops, and you can as well see a functional abstraction being an implementation detail of another higher-level abstraction.</p>
<p>Let's consider we want to increment the age of 2 brothers.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> brothers = {
  <span>id1</span>: {<span>name</span>: <span>"Sébastien"</span>, <span>age</span>: <span>34</span>},
  <span>id2</span>: {<span>name</span>: <span>"Antoine"</span>, <span>age</span>: <span>23</span>}
};
</code></pre>
<p>I very often see the <code>array.reduce()</code> operator used when a more expressive alternative was possible.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>incrementBrothersAges</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> <span>Object</span>.entries(brothers)
    .reduce(<span>(<span>acc,[id,brother]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
      acc[id] = {...brother, <span>age</span>: brother.age + <span>1</span>};
      <span>return</span> acc;  
    },{})
}
</code></pre>
<p>You know what? <strong>I really struggled to write this code</strong>. </p>
<p>My first attempt was not working at all (TypeScript would have helped).</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>incrementBrothersAges</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> <span>Object</span>.entries(brothers)
      
      .reduce(<span>(<span>[id,brother],  acc</span>) =&gt;</span> {
        acc[id] = {...brother, <span>age</span>: brother.age + <span>1</span>};
        
      },{});
}
</code></pre>
<p>Yet, writing this kind of transform is idiomatic for me, using higher-level functional programming abstractions, such as <code>mapValues</code> (included in lodash).</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>incrementBrothersAges</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> mapValues(
    brothers, 
    <span><span>brother</span> =&gt;</span> ({...brother, <span>age</span>: brother.age + <span>1</span>})
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>And I think nobody would argue that this is harder to read and maintain right? If junior developers are not familiar with functional programming, they'll catch up fast and get used to it. This might even be harder to learn <code>reduce</code>.</p>

<p>I don't write for loops (or <code>reduce</code>), but I know the concepts. I know that these loops exist in different syntaxes, that can be useful for different use cases, and how to make a choice with a good tradeoff (performance, readability...).</p>
<p>I'll illustrate this with a concrete example from my daily work that actually led me to write this article.</p>
<p>I had this async function that performs some long task for a given country.</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>runCountryTask</span>(<span>country</span>) </span>{

  
  <span>const</span> taskDuration = <span>1000</span> + <span>Math</span>.random() * <span>4000</span>;
  <span>await</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span>(<span><span>resolve</span> =&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span>(resolve, taskDuration));

  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`Task completed for <span>${country}</span>`</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This task had to be run for many countries, but the tasks should be run sequentially, not in parallel.</p>
<p>As I know the concepts, and I knew that the following would not work, as <code>Promise.all</code> would run all tasks in parallel.</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>runAllCountryTasks</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>const</span> countries = [<span>"FR"</span>, <span>"EN"</span>, <span>"US"</span>, <span>"DE"</span>, <span>"UK"</span>, <span>"IT"</span>];

  
  <span>await</span> <span>Promise</span>.all(countries.map(runCountryTask))
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also knew that there were multiple possible solutions to solve this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a third-party dependency exposing the higher-level async primitive I need</li>
<li>use <code>Promise.then()</code> recursively</li>
<li>use async/await, using a for loop syntax to iterate over a fixed-size array</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't want to introduce a new third party dependency just for a tiny utility function. </p>
<p>I also knew that using <code>Promise.then()</code> recursively could be harder to read, write, and maintain. There are many ways to write such a recursion, one of them could be:</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>forEachAsyncSequential</span>(<span>array, asyncFn</span>) </span>{
  <span>await</span> array.reduce(<span>(<span>acc, item</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>return</span> acc.then(<span>() =&gt;</span> asyncFn(item))
  }, <span>Promise</span>.resolve());
}
</code></pre>
<p>So I opted for a basic for loop, as it seemed the right tradeoff. </p>
<p>As I'm totally unable to remember the syntax (<code>in</code> vs <code>of</code>, can I actually use <code>const</code>?), I had to actually google it, and it didn't take me long to be able to write the TypeScript code that will be shipped in production.</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>forEachAsyncSequencial</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt;(<span>
  array: T[],
  asyncFn: (t: T) =&gt; <span>Promise</span>&lt;<span>void</span>&gt;,
</span>): <span>Promise</span>&lt;<span>void</span>&gt; </span>{
  <span>for</span> (<span>const</span> item <span>of</span> array) {
    <span>await</span> asyncFn(item);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>runAllCountryTasks</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>const</span> countries = [<span>"FR"</span>, <span>"EN"</span>, <span>"US"</span>, <span>"DE"</span>, <span>"UK"</span>, <span>"IT"</span>];

  
  <span>await</span> forEachAsyncSequencial(countries, runCountryTask);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Believe me or not, but I think It's the only for loop I actually wrote in JavaScript this year. And once it's written, I won't need to write it ever again (at least for this project), as it's now part of my functional programming abstractions, that I can reuse anywhere I need.</p>

<hr>

<p>It's not very important to remember every syntax details to be productive in your daily work, particularly when you don't use them often (on purpose), as you prefer to work with more expressive, higher-level abstractions. </p>
<p>I had to google many things to write this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax for declaring a Java list</li>
<li>Syntax for iterating a Java list</li>
<li>Does <code>System.out.println</code> accept an Integer?</li>
<li>Syntax for Scala string interpolation</li>
<li>Is there a <code>forEach</code> in Guava (actually found <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38251257/guava-iterators-for-nested-foreach">my own StackOverflow question</a>)</li>
<li>What are the possible syntaxes for iterating over a JavaScript array</li>
<li>Signature of <code>array.reduce()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Not remembering all this does not matter much, as long as I know what to look for.</p>
<p>In the same way, I don't know much about many other JavaScript things:</p>
<ul>
<li>prototypes: I think I never hard to use them directly in my entire life, and I'm fine</li>
<li>classes: used them temporarily when I really had to in React</li>
<li>JavaScript quirks: I know some of them, but simply avoid the others by using ESLint, <code>===</code>, TypeScript... it's not worth knowing all of them</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>The knowledge and concepts you learn are more easily transposable from one language to another. I was able to learn React and contribute to its ecosystem quickly, thanks to my functional programming background. </p>
<p>I would argue that knowing how to do a recursive algorithm is more important than knowing the syntax of a for loop of a particular language. You will likely write many recursive algorithms in your career: the concept of recursion is not going anywhere anytime soon. But it's way more likely that you switch from one language to another from time to time. </p>
<p>Hopefully, writing this post will help me remember the syntax for a while until I forget it again 🤪.</p>

    <p>The Rust programming language provides memory[1] and thread[2] safety
guarantees via its ownership[3], references and borrowing[4], and slice
types[5] features. However, Unsafe Rust[6] introduces unsafe blocks, unsafe
functions and methods, unsafe traits, and new types that are not subject to
the borrowing rules.</p>

<p>Parts of the Rust standard library are implemented as safe abstractions over
unsafe code (and historically have been vulnerable to memory corruption[7]).
Furthermore, the Rust code and documentation encourage creating safe
abstractions over unsafe code. This can cause a false sense of security if
unsafe code is not properly reviewed and tested.</p>

<p>Unsafe Rust introduces features that do not provide the same memory and
thread safety guarantees. This causes programs or libraries to be
susceptible to memory corruption (CWE-119)[8] and concurrency issues
(CWE-557)[9]. Modern C and C++ compilers provide exploit mitigations to
increase the difficulty to exploit vulnerabilities resulting from these
issues. Therefore, the Rust compiler must also support these exploit
mitigations in order to mitigate vulnerabilities resulting from the use of
Unsafe Rust. This post is going to document these exploit mitigations and
how they apply to Rust.</p>

<h2 id="exploit-mitigations">Exploit mitigations</h2>

<p>This section documents the exploit mitigations applicable to the Rust
compiler when building programs for the Linux operating system on the AMD64
architecture and equivalent.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> All examples in this section were
built using the Rust compiler version 1.40.0 (2019-12-19) on Debian testing
(Bullseye).</p>

<p>The Rust Programming Language currently has no specification. The Rust
compiler (i.e., rustc) is the language reference implementation. All
references to “the Rust compiler” in this post refer to the language
reference implementation.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_target/src/spec">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_target/src/spec</a>
for a list of targets and their default options. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

<h3 id="position-independent-executable">Position-independent executable</h3>

<p>Position-independent executable increases the difficulty of the use of code
reuse exploitation techniques, such as return-oriented programming (ROP) and
variants, by generating position-independent code for the executable, and
instructing the dynamic linker to load it similarly to a shared object at a
random load address, thus also benefiting from address-space layout
randomization (ASLR). This is also referred to as “full ASLR”.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler supports position-independent executable, and enables it
by default since version 0.12.0 (2014-10-09)[10]–[13].</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ readelf -h target/release/hello-rust | grep Type:
  Type:                              DYN (Shared object file)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Fig. 1. Checking if an executable is a position-independent executable.</p>

<p>An executable with an object type of <code>ET_DYN</code> (i.e., shared object) and not
<code>ET_EXEC</code> (i.e., executable) is a position-independent executable (see Fig.
1).</p>

<h3 id="integer-overflow-checks">Integer overflow checks</h3>

<p>Integer overflow checks protects programs from undefined and unintended
behavior (which may cause vulnerabilities) by checking for results of signed
and unsigned integer computations that cannot be represented in their type,
resulting in an overflow or wraparound.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler supports integer overflow checks, and enables it when
debug assertions are enabled since version 1.0.0 (2015-05-15)[14]–[17], but
support for it was not completed until version 1.1.0 (2015-06-25)[16]. An
option to control integer overflow checks was later stabilized in version
1.17.0 (2017-04-27)[18]–[20].</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>u</span><span>:</span> <span>u8</span> <span>=</span> <span>255</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"u: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

u: 0
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Fig. 4. Build and execution of hello-rust-integer with debug assertions
disabled.</p>

<p>Integer overflow checks are enabled when debug assertions are enabled (see
Fig. 3), and disabled when debug assertions are disabled (see Fig. 4). To
enable integer overflow checks independently, use the option to control
integer overflow checks, scoped attributes, or explicit checking methods
such as <code>checked_add</code><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It is recommended that explicit wrapping methods such as <code>wrapping_add</code> be
used when wrapping semantics are intended, and that explicit checking and
wrapping methods always be used when using Unsafe Rust.</p>

<p id="fn:2">2. See <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html</a> for more
information on the checked, overflowing, saturating, and wrapping methods
(using u32 as an example). <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

<h3 id="non-executable-memory-regions">Non-executable memory regions</h3>

<p>Non-executable memory regions increase the difficulty of exploitation by
limiting the memory regions that can be used to execute arbitrary code. Most
modern processors provide support for the operating system to mark memory
regions as non executable, but it was previously emulated by software, such
as in grsecurity/PaX’s
<a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/pageexec.txt">PAGEEXEC</a> and
<a href="https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/segmexec.txt">SEGMEXEC</a>, on processors that
did not provide support for it. This is also known as “No Execute (NX) Bit”,
“Execute Disable (XD) Bit”, “Execute Never (XN) Bit”, and others.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler supports non-executable memory regions, and enables it by
default since its initial release, version 0.1 (2012-01-20)[21], [22], but
has regressed since then[23]–[25], and enforced by default since version
1.8.0 (2016-04-14)[25].</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ readelf -l target/release/hello-rust | grep -A 1 GNU_STACK

                 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000  RW     0x10
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Fig. 5. Checking if non-executable memory regions are enabled for a given
binary.</p>

<p>The presence of an element of type <code>PT_GNU_STACK</code> in the program header
table with the <code>PF_X</code> (i.e., executable) flag unset indicates non-executable
memory regions<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> are enabled for a given binary (see Fig. 5).
Conversely, the presence of an element of type <code>PT_GNU_STACK</code> in the program
header table with the <code>PF_X</code> flag set or the absence of an element of type
<code>PT_GNU_STACK</code> in the program header table indicates non-executable memory
regions are not enabled for a given binary.</p>

<p id="fn:3">3. See the Appendix section for more information on why it affects other
memory regions besides the stack. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

<h3 id="stack-clashing-protection">Stack clashing protection</h3>

<p>Stack clashing protection protects the stack from overlapping with another
memory region—allowing arbitrary data in both to be overwritten using each
other—by reading from the stack pages as the stack grows to cause a page
fault when attempting to read from the guard page/region. This is also
referred to as “stack probes” or “stack probing”.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler supports stack clashing protection via stack probing, and
enables it by default since version 1.20.0 (2017-08-31)[26]–[29].</p>

Fig. 8. Cross references to <code>__rust_probestack</code> in modified hello-rust.</p>

<p>To check if stack clashing protection is enabled for a given binary, search
for cross references to <code>__rust_probestack</code>. The <code>__rust_probestack</code> is
called in the prologue of functions whose stack size is larger than a page
size (see Fig. 6), and can be forced for illustration purposes by modifying
the hello-rust example as seen in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.</p>

<h3 id="read-only-relocations-and-immediate-binding">Read-only relocations and immediate binding</h3>

<p><strong>Read-only relocations</strong> protect segments containing relocations and
relocation information (i.e., <code>.init_array</code>, <code>.fini_array</code>, <code>.dynamic</code>, and
<code>.got</code>) from being overwritten by marking these segments read only. This is
also referred to as “partial RELRO”.</p>

<p>The Rust compiler supports read-only relocations, and enables it by default
since version 1.21.0 (2017-10-12)[30], [31].</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ readelf -l target/release/hello-rust | grep GNU_RELRO
  GNU_RELRO      0x000000000002ee00 0x000000000002fe00 0x000000000002fe00
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Fig. 9. Checking if read-only relocations is enabled for a given binary.</p>

<p>The presence of an element of type <code>PT_GNU_RELRO</code> in the program header
table indicates read-only relocations are enabled for a given binary (see
Fig. 9). Conversely, the absence of an element of type <code>PT_GNU_RELRO</code> in the
program header table indicates read-only relocations are not enabled for a
given binary.</p>

<p><strong>Immediate binding</strong> protects additional segments containing relocations
(i.e., <code>.got.plt</code>) from being overwritten by instructing the dynamic linker
to perform all relocations before transferring control to the program during
startup, so all segments containing relocations can be marked …</p></div></div>

(Map image by Daniel R. Strebe, licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0)</p><h2>1. The only projection that is important is Web Mercator</h2><p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection">Web Mercator</a> is
probably the most popular projection that most people will run into, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albers_projection">Albers</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_cylindrical_equal-area_projection">Lambert</a>
equal-area projections are fairly common for when the projection needs to maintain
the area rather than the navigational direction (which is one of the main features
of the Mercator projection).</p><h2>2. All coordinates are latitude/longitude pairs</h2><p>In addition to latitude/longitude coordinates, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system">Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
coordinates</a>
are also fairly common. UTM splits the Earth into 60 zones, and then
further specifies northings and eastings in metres (as opposed to degrees, minutes and seconds).</p><p>The UTM notably omits the polar areas - which are covered by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_polar_stereographic_coordinate_system">Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS)
coordinate system</a>
instead.</p><h2>3. Latitude always comes before longitude in a coordinate pair</h2><p>While it is common to see items in (latitude,longitude) order, some formats
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">GeoJSON</a>) dictate that coordinates
follow (longitude,latitude) order instead. This matches the typical way coordinates
are specified in a Cartesian coordinate system: (x,y).</p><h2>4. A degree of latitude or longitude always represents the same distance</h2><p>In the Mercator projection, the Earth - which, in reality, is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid#Oblate_spheroids">oblate spheroid</a> -
is projected as a simple cylinder. This means that "parallel" longitude lines
meet at the poles, so the distance between degrees of longitude are much shorter
as they get closer to the poles than they are at the equator (~111 km).</p><p>The variance in latitude is not as large - but it still varies by about 1km going
from the equator to the poles.</p><h2>5. The shortest path between two points is a straight line</h2><p>The Earth isn't flat - as such, although your map may be projected to be flat,
the distance between two points needs to follow the curvature of
the Earth and can usually be approximated by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine formula</a>.</p><h2>6. Coordinates for a given landmark are always fixed</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift">Movements of the Earth's tectonic plates</a>
mean that the land masses are moving slowly with the passage of time.
For example, Australia has shifted about 1.8 metres from where it
was in 1994 (about 7 centimetres per year). This also means that <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/positioning-navigation/geodesy/datums-projections/gda2020">geocentric
datums</a>
have to be updated to account for these changes every once in a while.</p><h2>7. Given a pair of coordinates, you can plot it on a map</h2><p>In addition to coordinates, we also need to know the datum, which is
the coordinate system and its specific set of reference points on the Earth.
While most coordinates often follow the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS84 datum</a>,
care should be taken to ensure that the map and the coordinates plotted
are using the same datum.</p><h2>8. There is one global ellipsoid to base coordinates on</h2><p>Most modern datums are based on the WGS84
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>
as the surveys are often completed using GPS as a reference, but notably
Russia and China still base their local datums on different reference ellipsoids.</p><p>As a result, conversions to and from datums based on different
ellipsoids may result in inaccuracies and deviations and may be of concern
if you have to deal with GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou data at the same time.</p></div></div>]]>

As of this update, the post there erroneously labels this as an interview. It's not. Chris doesn't do interviews, except via an intermediary (which doesn't really work in an audio format), so the story is based entirely on my in-depth research and analysis. I hope you still enjoy it and learn something interesting. (I have stories on many other things that do involve interviews, though, like </strong><strong><a href="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/27" title="Episodes:27 - Links">1990 golf game Links</a></strong><strong>, Bungie's </strong><strong><a href="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/25" title="Episodes:25 - Pimps at Sea">fake game Pimps at Sea</a></strong><strong>, and </strong><strong><a href="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/22" title="Episodes:22 - Wololo">the "Wololo" sound effect</a></strong><strong> from Age of Empires.)</strong></p><p>Chris was only a design consultant on 2004 game RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, but its remastered "Complete" edition has just come out on Nintendo Switch and the PC version is free on the Epic Games Store right now (until October 2). The original two games are also still sold via the likes of Steam and GOG.</p><p>Transport Tycoon, meanwhile, lives on in open-source project <a href="https://www.openttd.org/" target="_blank">OpenTTD</a> and in a mobile port (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thirtyonex.TransportTycoon&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transport-tycoon/id634013256" target="_blank">iOS</a>) of the original game by Chris's company 31X.

<h3>(Partial) Transcript</h3>
<p><strong><em>[Most episode transcripts/scripts are reserved for my Patreon supporters (at least for the time being), but I like to give you at least a taster here — or in this case, the first half of the episode.]</em></strong></p><p><em>Welcome to the Life and Times of Video Games, an audio series about video games and the video game industry, as they were in the past and how they’ve come to be the way they are today. I'm Richard Moss, and this is episode 28, Transport Tycoon, or the tale of the great optimiser and his two greatest works.</em></p><p>We’ll get going in just a moment. </p><p>*pause for pre-roll ad/cross-promo slot*</p><p>***</p><p>You may have heard the expression that every overnight sensation is a decade in the making — a decade of hard work, toiling in obscurity…or <em>relative</em> obscurity, honing a talent, perfecting a craft, <em>optimising</em> a skill set and envisioning whatever it is that breaks through.</p><p>In reality the actual duration is rarely a decade — it’s five years or eight years or eighteen years, or however long it takes for the pieces to all fall into place: the talent, timing, and product. But the idea bears repeating: the greatest accolades, the greatest achievements, the greatest games are the product of hard work built atop years of invisible labour.</p><p>And such it was that Chris Sawyer, like John Romero, Carol Shaw, Gunpei Yokoi, and many others before and since — such it was that in 1994 Chris Sawyer suddenly shifted from a little-known (though well-respected) figure in the games industry, a programmer who converted Amiga games to the PC, to become an industry icon.</p><p>Nineteen-ninety-four was the year when his first original game was published, the year when big-name PC game publisher Microprose put his transportation-focused business simulation game Transport Tycoon, an incredible solo development effort, in a box and sold it in stores to widespread acclaim. </p><p><img alt="SCR1" src="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/scr1.jpg" width="866" height="362"><br><em>Transport Tycoon, the game that made Chris Sawyer into a games industry icon (</em><em><a href="https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=47&amp;t=29058" target="_blank">image source</a></em><em>)</em><br></p><div><p>The game itself had taken Chris just a year to develop, but the journey to making it had begun much earlier.</p><p>Chris had started programming as a teenager in 1981, largely out of curiosity, through trying to make things appear on the screen on a range of different computers he’d encountered. There was the Commodore PET at his high school, the Sinclair ZX81 demonstration unit in a W H Smiths store, and the Texas Instruments TI99/4A one of his neighbours owned, as well as the Commodore VIC-20 a different neighbour had. And eventually, after diligently saving up his pocket money, he’d become engrossed in a machine of his own, a Camputers Lynx, a now-forgotten, obscure-even-then 8-bit computer with fancier graphics and more horsepower than the leading systems of its day (the leading systems at the time being the Apple II, ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64).</p><p>Here, in 1983, is where the journey really starts — where Chris set off towards the lands where he’d make his name. And I find it fascinating how serendipitous this was — for, you see, Chris’s two great successes, Transport Tycoon and RollerCoaster Tycoon, were both made possible by his phenomenal systems knowledge; by his immense capacity to hand-code complex interactions of data at low levels of abstraction.</p><p>And here is where he began to learn those skills, to internalise them to the point of becoming natural talents. He later told Arcade Attack in an interview that he’d not had access to an assembler for that Lynx computer, so when he’d wanted to move beyond coding in BASIC he’d needed to write his programs byte-by-byte in machine code — the lowest-level programming language, the numerical instructions that computers themselves use. And with scant resources available to teach him these skills, he mostly figured it out on his own, just trying different things until he got his ideas to work. Always chasing the next exhilarating breakthrough.</p><p>Chris continued to dabble in machine code, though somewhat less than before, when he upgraded to a similarly-obscure machine called the Memotech MTX500, which actually did come with a built-in assembler, which enabled him to write programs in the abbreviation-heavy Z80 assembly language. Programs that, beginning in 1984, he very often had published commercially.</p></div><p><img alt="Memotech_MTX500-wide" src="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/memotech_mtx500-wide.jpg" width="1020" height="584"><br><em>The Memotech MTX500 (</em><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Memotech_MTX500.jpg" target="_blank">Image source</a></em><em>)</em><br></p><div><p>Chris had sent Memotech cassette tapes of some games he’d made through copying the designs of popular titles, like Missile Kommand, which was the 1980 Atari arcade game converted to the capabilities of the MTX500, using a mix of BASIC and machine code, with the name intentionally misspelled (a ‘k’ rather than a ‘c’) as though that somehow made his unapologetic, blatant clone of another’s work okay. </p><p>But this was the wild west of the computer games business, and Memotech weren’t much concerned. Or at least their games guy Jim Wills wasn’t much concerned, neither at this point nor a few months later when he left to start a company called Megastar Games. Jim liked Chris’s work enough to publish it, for meagre royalties but invaluable experience. And so Chris was commercially published with his unlicensed MTX500 versions of Missile Command, Q*bert, Manic Miner, and a few others.</p><p>After high school he enrolled in a computer science and microprocessor systems degree, where he studied the fundamentals of both software and hardware design in computers — an experience he found invaluable, as it taught him how to push computers further by learning how their hardware worked. And it taught him the theories behind the sorts of nitty-gritty software-systems things he’d already been practising at home: optimisation, sorting, algorithms, and even more varieties of machine code.</p></div><p><img alt="escape-from-zarcos-memotech-mtx500" src="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/escape-from-zarcos-memotech-mtx500.png" width="1044" height="788"><em><br>Escape from Zarcos, Chris Sawyer clone of Manic Miner for the Memotech MTX500</em><br></p><div><p>At home, meanwhile, he’d shifted over to the Amstrad CPC, which technologically-speaking wasn’t hugely different to the Memotech system he’d been on before — but it was a modest upgrade, and unlike his previous computers it was actually a popular system. And for Chris it was a gateway to the PC, because in the course of studying at university and making computer games on the side he wound up getting an Amstrad-made IBM-PC clone.</p><p>Chris had during this period been getting his games published through Ariolasoft, a German company with a UK subsidiary that promised him a job programming games for them once he graduated. Except some promises can’t be kept, especially in an industry that moves as fast as computer games publishing.</p><p>The home computer business was by that point deep into its transition from 8-bit to 16-bit hardware, and that transition came with adjustments to the standard of game graphics and design required, and to the way marketing and sales worked, and the cost of publishing, and so on, and Ariolasoft wasn’t doing too well at managing the transition. </p><p>So Chris didn’t have a job waiting for him after all, and he’d missed out on all the great electronics engineering jobs his classmates applied for. (Oops!) But not to worry — he’d made enough connections and enough headway as a programmer that he could get himself a business agent, and that agent in turn connected him to the booming Amiga-to-PC games porting industry.</p><p>He later said he’d thought it a “stop-gap” measure, just “a bit of fun” while he looked for more permanent employment in the electronics industry. But Chris took to his new conversions work like a duck to water. The kid who’d had to get creative and remain patient to make anything work on his Camputers Lynx machine now excelled in an environment where he had to contend with the vast gap in multimedia capabilities between the Amiga and the PC.</p><p>PCs of the day were pathetically inept as games machines, compared to a system like the Amiga. Whereas the PC had just a CPU, and maybe, in a minority of machines, a dedicated sound card like the SoundBlaster 16, every Amiga came with a custom chipset that contained audio and video co-processors that could take some strain off the …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="lf-text">
            <div>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>Do not enable <code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle</code>—it doesn’t even
exist anymore since Linux 4.12. Most of the time, <code>TIME-WAIT</code> sockets
are harmless. Otherwise, jump to <a href="#summary">summary</a> for the
recommended solutions.</p>
</div>
<p>The Linux kernel documentation is not very helpful about what
<code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle</code> and <code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse</code> do. This lack of
documentation opens the path to numerous tuning guides advising to set
both these settings to 1 to reduce the number of entries in the
<code>TIME-WAIT</code> state. However, as stated by the <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/buster/manpages/tcp.7.en.html" title="tcp - TCP protocol">tcp(7)</a> manual page,
the <code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle</code> option is quite problematic for
public-facing servers as it won’t handle connections from two
different computers behind the same <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr> device, which is a problem
hard to detect and waiting to bite you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable fast recycling of <code>TIME-WAIT</code> sockets.  Enabling this option
is not recommended since this causes problems when working with <abbr title="Network Address Translation">NAT</abbr>
(Network Address Translation).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will provide here a more detailed explanation on how to properly
handle the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state. Also, keep in mind we are looking at the
TCP stack of Linux. This is completely unrelated to <em>Netfilter</em>
connection tracking which may be tweaked in other ways.<sup id="fnref-netfilter"><a href="#fn-netfilter">1</a></sup></p>


<p>Let’s rewind a bit and have a close look at this <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state.
What is it? See the TCP state diagram below:<sup id="fnref-source"><a href="#fn-source">2</a></sup></p>
<figure><p><span><img alt="TCP state diagram" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/tcp/tcp-state-diagram-v2.svg" width="727" height="867" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>TCP state diagram</figcaption></figure>
<p>Only the <strong>end closing the connection first</strong> will reach the
<code>TIME-WAIT</code> state. The other end will follow a path which usually
permits it to quickly get rid of the connection.</p>
<p>You can have a look at the current state of connections with <code>ss
-tan</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> ss -tan <span>|</span> head -5
<span>LISTEN     0  511             *:80              *:*</span>
<span>SYN-RECV   0  0     192.0.2.145:80    203.0.113.5:35449</span>
<span>SYN-RECV   0  0     192.0.2.145:80   203.0.113.27:53599</span>
<span>ESTAB      0  0     192.0.2.145:80   203.0.113.27:33605</span>
<span>TIME-WAIT  0  0     192.0.2.145:80   203.0.113.47:50685</span>
</pre></div>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose<a href="#purpose" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>There are two purposes for the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most known one is to <strong>prevent delayed segments</strong> from one
    connection being accepted by a later connection relying on the
    same quadruplet (source address, source port, destination address,
    destination port). The sequence number also needs to be in a
    certain range to be accepted. This narrows a bit the problem but
    it still exists, especially on fast connections with large receive
    windows. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1337" title="RFC 1337: TIME-WAIT Assassination Hazards in TCP">RFC 1337</a> explains in details what happens when the
    <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state is deficient.<sup id="fnref-rfc1337"><a href="#fn-rfc1337">3</a></sup> Here is an example of
    what could be avoided if the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state wasn’t shortened:</li>
</ul>
<figure><p><span><img alt="Duplicate segments accepted in another connection" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/tcp/duplicate-segment.svg" width="512" height="524" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>Due to a shortened TIME-WAIT state, a delayed TCP segment has been accepted in an unrelated connection.</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li>The other purpose is to ensure <strong>the remote end has closed the
    connection</strong>. When the last <em>ACK</em> is lost, the remote end stays in
    the <code>LAST-ACK</code> state.<sup id="fnref-lastack"><a href="#fn-lastack">4</a></sup> Without the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state, a
    connection could be reopened while the remote end still thinks the
    previous connection is valid. When it receives a <em>SYN</em> segment (and
    the sequence number matches), it will answer with a <em>RST</em> as it is
    not expecting such a segment. The new connection will be aborted
    with an error:</li>
</ul>
<figure><p><span><img alt="Last ACK lost" src="https://d1g3mdmxf8zbo9.cloudfront.net/images/tcp/last-ack.svg" width="500" height="337" loading="lazy"></span></p><figcaption>If the remote end stays in LAST-ACK state because the last ACK was lost, opening a new connection with the same quadruplet will not work.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793" title="RFC 793: Transmission Control Protocol">RFC 793</a> requires the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state to last twice the time of the
<abbr title="Maximum Segment Lifetime">MSL</abbr>. On Linux, this duration is <strong>not</strong> tunable and is defined in
<code>include/net/tcp.h</code> as one minute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#define TCP_TIMEWAIT_LEN (60*HZ) </span><span>/* how long to wait to destroy TIME-WAIT</span>
<span>                                  * state, about 60 seconds     */</span><span></span>
</pre></div>

<p>There have been
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/2014/http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/244411" title="[RFC PATCH net-next] tcp: introduce tcp_tw_interval to specify the time of TIME-WAIT">propositions to turn this into a tunable value</a> but
it has been refused on the ground the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state is a good
thing.</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems<a href="#problems" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Now, let’s see why this state can be annoying on a server handling a
lot of connections. There are three aspects of the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>the slot taken in the connection table preventing <strong>new
   connections</strong> of the same kind,</li>
<li>the <strong>memory</strong> occupied by the socket structure in the kernel, and</li>
<li>the additional <strong>CPU usage</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of <code>ss -tan state time-wait | wc -l</code> is not a problem per
se!</p>
<h3 id="connection-table-slot">Connection table slot<a href="#connection-table-slot" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>A connection in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state is kept for one minute in the
connection table. This means, another connection with the same
<em>quadruplet</em> (source address, source port, destination address,
destination port) cannot exist.</p>
<p>For a web server, the destination address and the destination port are
likely to be constant. If your web server is behind an L7
load-balancer, the source address will also be constant. On Linux, the
client port is by default allocated in a port range of about 30,000
ports (this can be changed by tuning
<code>net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range</code>). This means that only 30,000
connections can be established between the web server and the
load-balancer every minute, so about <strong>500 connections per second</strong>.</p>
<p>If the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> sockets are on the client side, such a situation is
easy to detect. The call to <code>connect()</code> will return <code>EADDRNOTAVAIL</code>
and the application will log some error message about that. On the
server side, this is more complex as there is no log and no counter to
rely on. In doubt, you should just try to come with something sensible
to list the number of used quadruplets:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> ss -tan <span>'sport = :80'</span> <span>|</span> awk <span>'{print $(NF)" "$(NF-1)}'</span> <span>|</span> <span>\</span>
      sed <span>'s/:[^ ]*//g'</span> <span>|</span> sort <span>|</span> uniq -c
<span>    696 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.64</span>
<span>   1881 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.65</span>
<span>   5314 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.66</span>
<span>   5293 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.67</span>
<span>   3387 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.68</span>
<span>   2663 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.69</span>
<span>   1129 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.70</span>
<span>  10536 10.24.2.30 10.33.1.73</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The solution is <strong>more quadruplets</strong>.<sup id="fnref-outgoing"><a href="#fn-outgoing">5</a></sup> This can be done in
several ways (in the order of difficulty to setup):</p>
<ul>
<li>use <strong>more client ports</strong> by setting <code>net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range</code> to
   a wider range,</li>
<li>use <strong>more server ports</strong> by asking the web server to listen to several
   additional ports (81, 82, 83, …),</li>
<li>use <strong>more client IP</strong> by configuring additional IP on the load
   balancer and use them in a round-robin fashion,<sup id="fnref-bind"><a href="#fn-bind">6</a></sup></li>
<li>use <strong>more server IP</strong> by configuring additional IP on the web
   server.<sup id="fnref-others"><a href="#fn-others">7</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>A last solution is to tweak <code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse</code> and
<code>net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle</code>. Don’t do that yet, we will cover these
settings later.</p>
<h3 id="memory">Memory<a href="#memory" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>With many connections to handle, leaving a socket open for one
additional minute may cost your server some memory. For example, if
you want to handle about 10,000 new connections per second, you will
have about 600,000 sockets in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state. How much memory
does it represent? Not that much!</p>
<p>First, from the application point of view, a <code>TIME-WAIT</code> socket does
not consume any memory: the socket has been closed. In the kernel, a
<code>TIME-WAIT</code> socket is present in three structures (for three different
purposes):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A <strong>hash table of connections</strong>, named the “TCP established hash
    table” (despite containing connections in other states) is used to
    locate an existing connection, for example when receiving a new
    segment.</p>
<p>Each bucket of this hash table contains both a list of connections
in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state and a list of regular active
connections. The size of the hash table depends on the system

</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>set of lists of connections</strong>, called the “death row”, is used
    to expire the connections in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state. They are
    ordered by how much time left before expiration.</p>
<p>It uses the same memory space as for the entries in the hash table
of connections. This is the <code>struct hlist_node tw_death_node</code>
member of <code>struct inet_timewait_sock</code>.<sup id="fnref-deathrow"><a href="#fn-deathrow">9</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>hash table of bound ports</strong>, holding the locally bound ports
    and the associated parameters, is used to determine if it is safe
    to listen to a given port or to find a free port in the case of
    dynamic bind. The size of this hash table is the same as the size
    of the hash table of connections:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> dmesg <span>|</span> grep <span>"TCP bind hash table"</span>
<span>[    0.169962] TCP bind hash table entries: 65536 (order: 8, 1048576 bytes)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Each element is a <code>struct inet_bind_socket</code>. There is
one element for each locally bound port. A <code>TIME-WAIT</code> connection
to a web server is locally bound to the port 80 and shares the
same entry as its sibling <code>TIME-WAIT</code> connections. On the other
hand, a connection to a remote service is locally bound to some
random port and does not share its entry.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We are only concerned by the space occupied by <code>struct
tcp_timewait_sock</code> and <code>struct inet_bind_socket</code>. There is one <code>struct
tcp_timewait_sock</code> for each connection in the <code>TIME-WAIT</code> state,
inbound or outbound. There is one dedicated <code>struct inet_bind_socket</code>
for each outbound connection and none for an inbound connection.</p>
<p>A <code>struct tcp_timewait_sock</code> is only 168 bytes while a <code>struct
inet_bind_socket</code> is 48 bytes:</p>

October 1, 2020 | https://adamzerner.bearblog.dev/big-o-little-n/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adamzerner.bearblog.dev/big-o-little-n/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>I remember when I was first learning about hash tables. I thought I stumbled across an ingenious optimization for dealing with hash collisions. Before explaining my optimization, let me first briefly explain how hash tables work and what hash collisions are. I also made a video if you're interested.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9zhZB2KkM" title="Hash Tables"><img alt="" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/pM9zhZB2KkM/0.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Say that we have a hash that maps someone's name to their age. <code>"adam"</code> is <code>27</code>, so we want to enter that into our hash.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/qWdjbhM/Slice.png"></p>
<p>Here's what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"adam"</code> gets put through a hash function.</li>
<li>The hash function spits out <code>7</code>.</li>
<li><code>7</code> is the index of the array where we are going to store <code>"adam"</code>'s value.</li>
<li>So we store <code>27</code> into <code>array[7]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we run <code>hash.get("adam")</code> in the future and need to look up the value for <code>"adam"</code>, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>"adam"</code> through the hash function.</li>
<li>Get <code>7</code> as the output.</li>
<li>This means we have to look at <code>array[7]</code> to get the value.</li>
<li>So we look at <code>array[7]</code> to get our value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully if we have a key of <code>"alice"</code> or <code>"bob"</code> it'll hash to a different index. But... what happens if it hashes to the same index? That's called a hash collision.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/sJbJKnD/Slice.png"></p>
<p>A common approach is that if there's a collision, you store the values in a linked list.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/VJsSW3T/Slice.png"></p>
<p>Fair enough. That makes sense.</p>
<p>But wait!!! It takes <code>O(n)</code> time to look up a value in a linked list. Can't we use a binary search tree to speed that up to <code>O(log n)</code>???</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/R3Vrc10/Slice.png"></p>
<p>Or... can't we take it a step further and use a <em>hash inside of a hash</em> to get the lookup time all the way down to <code>O(1)</code>?!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/7CyYNWY/Slice.png"></p>
<p>I hate to say it, but however many years ago when I had these thoughts, there were a few moments where I thought I was a genius. Now when I look back at that former self, I facepalm.</p>
<p>It is true that going from a linked list to a BST to a hash takes you from <code>O(n)</code> to <code>O(logn)</code> to <code>O(1)</code> lookup time. However, since collisions are rare, <code>n</code> is going to be small. And when <code>n</code> is small, <code>O(n)</code> might be faster than <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<p>To understand why that is, think back to what Big-O really means. I think it helps to think about it as a "math thing" instead of a "programming thing". Consider two functions:</p>
<pre><code>f(n) = 4n + 1000
g(n) = 2n^2 + 5
</code></pre>
<p>Big-O of <code>f</code> is <code>O(n)</code> and Big-O of <code>g</code> is <code>O(n^2)</code>. We just focus on the part that "really matters". When <code>n</code> gets really big, the fact that it's <code>4n</code> doesn't really matter. Nor does the <code>+ 1000</code>.</p>
<p>But what about when <code>n</code> is small? Well, let's look at happens when <code>n</code> is <code>5</code>:</p>
<pre><code>f(5) = 4(5) + 1000 = 20 + 1000 = 1020
g(5) = 2(5^2) + 5 = 2(25) + 5 = 50 + 5 = 55
</code></pre>
<p>Look at that! The <code>O(n^2)</code> function is almost 20 times faster than the <code>O(n)</code> function!</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> is basically why they use a linked list instead of a BST or hash to handle collisions. Since <code>n</code> is small, Big-O isn't the right question to ask.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here's another example. I just wrote the following code while prepping for an interview:</p>
<pre><code>const isVowel = (char) =&gt; ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"].includes(char);
</code></pre>
<p>Normally I wouldn't think twice about it, but since interviewers care so much about time complexity, I stopped to think about whether it could be improved.</p>
<p>And it hit me that it's actually <code>O(n)</code>(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24660824">caveat</a>), because we've got an array and have to iterate over every element to see if the element matches <code>char</code>. It's easy to overlook this because we're using <code>includes</code> and not writing the code ourselves.</p>
<p>So then I thought that maybe we could use a hash instead to get <code>O(1)</code> lookup. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>const isVowel = (char) =&gt; {
  const vowels = {
    a: true,
    e: true,
    i: true,
    o: true,
    u: true,
  };

  return !!vowels[char];
};
</code></pre>
<p>But then I realized that this is the same mistake I made with the hash collision stuff however many years ago. <em><code>n</code> is small, so Big-O isn't the question we should be asking</em>. Here <code>n</code> is <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>I think that the array approach would actually be faster than the hash approach, even though it's <code>O(n)</code> instead of <code>O(1)</code>. The reason for this is called locality.</p>
<p>If you dive deep under the hood, when you look up an element in an array, the CPU actually grabs a bunch of adjacent elements as well as the one you wanted, and it stores the adjacent elements in a cache. So here when we look up <code>"a"</code> in the array, it'll probably grab <code>"a"</code>, <code>"e"</code>, <code>"i"</code>, <code>"o"</code>, and <code>"u"</code>. And so next time when we want to grab <code>"e"</code>, it can take it from the cache, which is a lot faster. This works because the elements in the array are close to each other in the physical memory. But with a hash, my understanding is that they wouldn't be so close, and thus we wouldn't benefit from this spatial locality effect.</p>
<p>I'm no low-level programming wiz so I'm not sure about any of this. That's ok, I think it's beside the point of this post. The real point of this post is that when you have a little <code>n</code>, Big-O doesn't matter.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You can learn the basics of JavaScript quickly. You don't need a engineering degree, or a front end bootcamp.</p><p>Learning the basics of JavaScript is enough to get started with modern frameworks like React.js. Once you know the basics, you can do some truly amazing things.</p><p>You can quickly spin up interactive prototypes.<br>You can use live data sets.<br>You can create web, mobile, and desktop apps.<br>You can define interfaces in high fidelity.<br>You can write scripts to automate daily tasks.<br>You can make plugins for design tools like Sketch and Figma.<br>You can build with modern frameworks like React.js.</p><p>You can't learn JavaScript in a day, but you can learn it quickly. The best way to learn is to build. This guide is meant to give you enough information to start building. </p><h2>Editor</h2><p><img src="https://react.design/assets/javascript/theme.png">
</p><p>Before we write any code, it's a good idea to get comfortable with your text editor. I'd recommend using a text editor like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> as you write JavaScript. They're both free and support lots of plugins to make things easier. You can also find lots of nice themes. Here's a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Framer.framer-syntax">theme</a> for VSCode that I like.</p><p>Learning keyboard shortcuts, and customizing the look of your editor will make for a much more enjoyable coding experience.</p><h2>Setup</h2><p>JavaScript is a scripting language that for our intents and purposes, will be executed by the browser.</p><p>There are multiple ways to include javascript inside your webpage. The way we will use javascript will be by including <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags right before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag. </p><pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE</span><span> </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span>    
<span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>// Javascript will go here</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello friend!"</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre><p>Weâ€™ll put our javascript inside here, but we could also reference an external file.
<code>console.log()</code> is a helpful tool for debugging. Here I'm writing "Hello Friend!" To the console. You an access the console in Chrome using the <code>CMD+Option+J</code> shortcut.</p><p><img src="https://react.design/assets/javascript/console.png">
</p><p>There are 5 core concepts in JavaScript that are important to understand.</p><p><strong>1. Variables</strong><br><strong>2. Data Structures</strong><br><strong>3. Loops</strong><br><strong>4. Conditionals</strong><br><strong>5. Functions</strong></p><h2>Variables</h2><p>Variables are containers that hold values. These values can take lots of different forms. If you wanted a variable to hold a number you could write it as <code>var num = 20;</code>. If I use <code>console.log(num)</code> it should show me the number twenty.</p><p>Variables can be referenced later. <code>var double = num * 2; // 40</code></p><p>Variables can hold lots of different data types. I want to discuss a few different common ways to hold data. There are primitive data types like numbers, which we used earlier, There are strings, which are just a way to store text, and booleans which are values that are either true or false.</p><pre><code><span>var</span><span> days </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>40</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// Number</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>var</span><span> label </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"Hello"</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// String</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>var</span><span> hidden </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// Boolean</span></code></pre><h2>Data Structures</h2><p>In addition to primitive data types there are others that have more complex structures. Two of these important types are objects (sometimes called object literals) and arrays. </p><p>Objects can be defined using curly braces. 
<code>var obj = {}</code></p><p>What goes inside the curly braces are a collection of key value pairs. The key goes first, followed by a colon, and then the value. </p><pre><code><span>var</span><span> obj </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  key</span><span>:</span><span> value
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>Keys are labels that help you find the data you want to store. Keys in a single object must be unique. Values can be any data type. Numbers, strings, arrays, and even other objects. 
Here's an example Object with multiple key value pairs in action:</p><pre><code><span>var</span><span> profile </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>	name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Philip'</span><span>,</span><span> 
</span><span>	age</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>25</span><span>,</span><span> 
</span><span>	contact</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>		twitter</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'philipcdavis'</span><span>,</span><span> 
</span><span>		email</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'reactfordesigners@gmail.com'</span><span>
</span><span>	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>Name, age, contact, twitter, and email are all different keys in this object. The values are all different and many have different value types. Some are strings, some are numbers, and some are other objects.</p><p>This nested structure is common and you will see it a lot when working with data sets.</p><p>There are two ways to access a value inside an object. The first way is sometimes called dot notation: <code>profile.name</code>. The second way is by using brackets <code>profile['name']</code>. Bracket notion is useful when your key name is dynamic.</p><p>The other data type thatâ€™s important to know about is the Array. You define an array with square brackets. </p><p><code>var myArr = [];</code></p><p>You can store any type of data inside these arrays and they don't need to all be the same type (though they usually are). An example array might look like this: </p><pre><code><span>var</span><span> teams </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>'lakers'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'nuggets'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'rockets'</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Instead of using keys, arrays use a built in index to keep track of location. The index of arrays starts at 0. If we wanted to access the second value of this array (nuggets) we could do so by typing <code>teams[1];</code></p><p>If your data was as simple as this, using objects and arrays might seem unnecessary. They start to shine when you have data sets that are larger. To work with more data, we'll probably want to use a loop</p><h2>Loops</h2><p>Loops enable you to run a block of code multiple times. You can use a loop with objects and arrays to execute a block of code on each item in the structure. </p><p>To loop through each value in an array you can use a for loop that executes a block. </p><pre><code><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span> i</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>&lt;</span><span>teams</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>// Block to be executed</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>What goes into the parenthesis determines how many times the block of code is executed. The first value is a counter variable. <code>i</code> is often used to refer to the fact that it's used as the index value of the array. We will start the counter at 0. </p><p>The next value is called the conditional. Once the conditional is false, the loop will end. We can set the value to be <code>i &lt; teams.length</code>. The <code>.length</code> is a helper value built into every array that will tell you how many items are in the array. Once the value of the counter is as great as the length of the array, we can stop looping. The last value <code>i++</code> is what we want to happen after our loop runs. We want our counter to increase in value by one every time the loop runs.</p><p>If we log a string, you can see that it will print out 4 times.
If we log the value i, you can see that it increments up. If you combine this incremented value i with our array, you can see how we can access each value in our array.</p><pre><code><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span> i</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span>i</span><span>&lt;</span><span>teams</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> 
</span><span>	</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>teams</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>There are other types of loops but they all are doing something pretty similar, running a block of code multiple times. Thatâ€™s the essential work of a loop.</p><h2>Conditionals</h2><p>Next up on our list is conditionals. The most common type of conditional is the if/else statement. </p><pre><code><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>conditional</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>	</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'the conditional evaluated to true'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>If the <code>conditional</code> value in the parenthesis evaluates to true, the block inside the first set of curly brackets is run, otherwise the else block is run.</p><p>Letâ€™s use it in combination with our loop to log only the first two items in our array. Because we donâ€™t need the else here, we can remove it, and weâ€™ll get the same result.</p><pre><code><span>for</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span> i </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>&lt;</span><span>teams</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span><span> i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span><span>	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>Youâ€™ll use these conditionals to to control what gets executed when.</p><h2>Functions</h2><p>Functions allow you to create reusable and modular code.</p><p>Another way to say it is that they are blocks of code than can be executed whenever they are needed. </p><p>Here's what one looks like</p><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>	</span><span>var</span><span> total </span><span>=</span><span> a </span><span>+</span><span> b</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>	</span><span>return</span><span> total</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span> </span></code></pre><p>Here we have a simple function that takes two input values, adds them together, and then returns the total. Weâ€™ll use generic names for our input arguments. You can name these pretty much whatever you want, but they will be used within our block so if your function is complex, itâ€™s good to have descriptive names. Because this is a pretty simple function we're using <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. </p><p>What we've created is a function declaration. In order to execute, or invoke our function we can call <code>add(2,50)</code>.
<code>console.log(add(2,50)) // 52</code></p><p><code>console.log</code> is itself a function. Functions can be stored in variables, objects, arrays, or even passed into other functions.</p><p>One other important thing to note about functions is how they affect variables inside them. If you define a variable within a function, the variable cannot be used outside the function. That's because javascript has a function based scope.</p><hr><p>Javascript is a really fun language to learn. If you feel comfortable with the material above you can do a lot! Most of JavaScript is just building on to these core concepts.</p><h2>Modern JavaScript</h2><p>In 2015 a set of new syntax and features were introduced that made writing JavaScript easier. Many of the following updates are meant to help you write code faster and cleaner. If you're using modern frameworks like React you'll often see them in examples.</p><h3>Const / Let</h3><p>This is just a new way to write variables. </p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> height </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>30</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> height </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>30</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p><code>const</code> values cannot be reassigned after the initial assignment. This is usually the default way of creating variables. </p><p><code>let</code> values can be reassigned but are scoped to conditionals, the same way all variables are scoped to functions. If you declare one inside an if/else statement it won't be available outside the statement.</p><h3>Arrow Functions</h3><p>This a shorthand for writing functions.
Instead of writing:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> a </span><span>+</span><span> b </span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>You can use an arrow function which looks like this:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> a </span><span>+</span><span> b</span></code></pre><p>If your function takes a single parameter you can omit the parenthesis.</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>getStyle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> a</span><span>.</span><span>style</span></code></pre><h3>Template Literals</h3><p>Previously is you wanted dynamic strings, you would insert values using the following syntax.</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> dynamicString </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"Hello my name is"</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> firstName </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>". Welcome!"</span></code></pre><p>Using template literals, you can use the backtick for strings, and <code>${}</code> to insert variables.</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> dynamicString </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>Hello my name is </span><span>${</span><span>firstName</span><span>}</span><span>. Welcome!</span><span>`</span></code></pre><h3>Imports and Exports</h3><p>Instead of using large javascript files, you'll often want to break your code into smaller modules and export anything that other modules need to access.</p><pre><code><span>// Colors.js</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> colors </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

  <h3>automatic-differentiation-worked-examples</h3>
  
<p>– forwards and reverse</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This article demonstrates how to perform source transformations on a program to generate forward mode and reverse mode derivative programs (automatic differentiation, or “AD”). My aim is to write the shortest possible article that communicates all the essential features of a source-to-source AD system with a particular focus on making the reverse mode transformation clear.</p>
<p>The goal of brevity means that a lot of possible commentary has been omitted. If you find this makes some part of the article hard to understand then please <a href="http://web.jaguarpaw.co.uk/~tom/contact">contact me</a> and I’ll do my best to clarify. In particular this article contains hardly any mathematical content at all. I hope that the reader who is familiar with multivariate calculus will be able to obtain an intuitive understanding of how AD relates to mathematical techniques he or she is already familiar with. A more in-depth description of the relationship will have to wait for another article.</p>
<h2 id="the-program">The program</h2>
<p>Let’s consider the following pseudocode program that performs some elementary arithmetic through a sequence of assignment statements.</p>
<pre><code>p = 7 * x
r = 1 / y
q = p * x * 5
v = 2 * p * q + 3 * r</code></pre>
<p><code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are not defined in the program so I’m going to informally consider them to be “inputs”; <code>v</code> is not used anywhere so I’m going to consider it to be the “output”. (I won’t burden the article by formalising these notions here.)</p>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>We’ll do a small amount of preparation to our original program which will preserve its behaviour and get it into a form in which it is straightforward to apply the automatic differentiation (AD) algorithms. It is possible to apply AD algorithms without doing these transformations first but then the AD algorithms would have to do equivalent operations implicitly. Doing these transformations first is a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a>.</p>
<h3 id="use-prefix-functions-with-exactly-one-argument">Use prefix functions with exactly one argument</h3>
<p>Let’s use prefix functions instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation">infix operators</a>. Infix operators are more familiar for arithmetic but the AD algorithms will be clearer to present if we use prefix functions. Additionally I want every function to have exactly one argument (although that argument may be a tuple). Single-argument style will make the reverse mode transformation much clearer (although it does not make any difference for forward mode). For example, <code>x1 + x2</code> would become <code>add (x1, x2)</code>. Our program becomes</p>
<pre><code>p = mul (7, x)
r = div (1, y)
q = mul (mul (p, x), 5)
v = add (mul (mul (2, p), q), mul (3, r))</code></pre>
<h3 id="no-nested-subexpressions">No nested subexpressions</h3>
<p>Next let’s convert to a form where every function is applied to (tuples of) variables and constants only, i.e.&nbsp;where there are no nested sub-expressions (besides potentially nested tuples). We assign each nested sub-expression to an intermediate variable. For example</p>
<pre><code>a = add (add (b, c), d)</code></pre>
<p>would become</p>
<pre><code>i = add (b, c)
a = add (i, d)</code></pre>
<p>The choice of <code>i</code> is arbitrary; it just has to be a variable that’s not used elsewhere in our program. This form without nested subexpressions is a lot like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-normal_form">ANF</a> from the field of functional compiler construction. It’s also a lot like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">SSA form</a> of assembly language. After removing nested subexpressions, our program becomes</p>
<pre><code>p = mul (7, x)
r = div (1, y)
i1 = mul (p, x)
q = mul (i1, 5)
i2 = mul (2, p)
i3 = mul (i2, q)
i4 = mul (3, r)
v = add (i3, i4)</code></pre>
<h2 id="differentiation-line-by-line">Differentiation line-by-line</h2>
<p>We have performed all the transformations needed to prepare our program and we are ready to proceed to differentiation. We will differentiate the program line-by-line, that is, both the forward mode and reverse mode differentiation algorithms will generate one line of derivative code for each line of input code. But what <em>is</em> the derivative of an assignment statement? For forward mode, the derivatives correspond quite closely to what you might be familiar with from a first multivariate calculus course..</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<h4 id="addition">Addition</h4>
<p>If a line of our pseudocode program is</p>
<pre><code>y = add (x1, x2)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivative line is</p>
<pre><code>dy = add (dx1, dx2)</code></pre>
<h4 id="multiplication">Multiplication</h4>
<p>If a line of our pseudocode program is</p>
<pre><code>y = mul (x1, x2)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivative line is</p>
<pre><code>dy = add (mul (x2, dx1), mul (x1, dx2))</code></pre>
<h4 id="division">Division</h4>
<p>If a line of our pseudocode program is</p>
<pre><code>y = div (x1, x2)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivative line is</p>
<pre><code>dy = add (div (dx1, x2), negate (mul (div (x1, mul (x2, x2)), dx2)))</code></pre>
<h2 id="forward-mode">Forward mode</h2>
<p>The forward mode transformation applies the appropriate differentiation rule to each line in the input program (listed on the left) to obtain a derivative line (listed on the right). To each line we apply exactly one rule and the form of the rule does not depend on any of the other lines.</p>
<pre><code>p = mul (7, x)   | dp = mul (7, dx)
r = div (1, y)   | dr = negate (div (dy, mul (y, y)))
i1 = mul (p, x)  | di1 = add (mul (dp, x), mul (p, dx))
q = mul (i1, 5)  | dq = mul (di1, 5)
i2 = mul (2, p)  | di2 = mul (2, dp)
i3 = mul (i2, q) | di3 = add (mul (di2, q), mul (i2, dq))
i4 = mul (3, r)  | di4 = mul (3, dr)
v = add (i3, i4) | dv = add (di3, di4)</code></pre>
<p>If we form a new program consisting of the sequence of assignments on the left followed by the sequence of assignments on the right then we have a program that calculates the forward derivative! The “inputs” of this program are <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code>. The “outputs” are <code>v</code> and <code>dv</code>.</p>
<p>(The derivatives of constants are zero and I’ve left terms that are zero out for simplicity.)</p>
<p>In fact we can be a little more clever. We can interleave the assignments, so an assignment from the left is immediately followed by its corresponding assignment from the right, that is</p>
<pre><code>p = mul (7, x)
dp = mul (7, dx)
r = div (1, y)
dr = negate (div (dy, mul (y, y)))
i1 = mul (p, x)
di1 = add (mul (dp, x), mul (p, dx))
q = mul (i1, 5)
dq = mul (di1, 5)
i2 = mul (2, p)
di2 = mul (2, dp)
i3 = mul (i2, q)
di3 = add (mul (di2, q), mul (i2, dq))
i4 = mul (3, r)
di4 = mul (3, dr)
v = add (i3, i4)
dv = add (di3, di4)</code></pre>
<p>This interleaving demonstrates an important property of the automatic derivative: that it uses space proportional to the space usage of the original program. Specifically, as soon as we no longer need a variable that was assigned in the original program we no longer need the corresponding <code>d</code> version either.</p>
<p>We can also see another important property of the forward derivative: it runs in time proportional to the run time of the original program (assuming that the derivative of every primitive runs in time proportional to the run time of the primitive itself).</p>
<h2 id="reverse-mode-requires-two-additional-ideas">Reverse mode requires two additional ideas</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve shown how to generate the forward mode derivative we can move on to the reverse mode derivative. Reverse mode requires two additional ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We need to convert our original program to “explicit duplication” form: if a variable is used more than once then we make that explicit in the structure of the program. This is unusual but straightforward.</p></li>
<li><p>We need to use a form of the derivative that will be unfamiliar to most readers. It will appear quite bizarre when seeing it for the first time but it is crucial to implementing the reverse mode derivative.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="explicit-duplication-form">Explicit duplication form</h2>
<p>Before applying the reverse mode AD transformation we will convert to “explicit duplication” form. Again, the transformation is not strictly required but if we omit it then the differentiation pass will have to do it implicitly. We take the ANF form of the program and insert explicit duplications (<code>dup</code>) for any variable that is used more that once. Recall that after removing nested subexpressions our program was</p>
<pre><code>p = mul (7, x)
r = div (1, y)
i1 = mul (p, x)
q = mul (i1, 5)
i2 = mul (2, p)
i3 = mul (i2, q)
i4 = mul (3, r)
v = add (i3, i4)</code></pre>
<p>We can see that <code>x</code> and <code>p</code> appear on the right hand side (i.e.&nbsp;are consumed) twice each. Therefore, they will need explicit duplication, so that each variable in the resulting program is used only once. With explicit duplication the program looks like</p>
<pre><code>(x1, x2) = dup x
p = mul (7, x1)
(p1, p2) = dup p
r = div (1, y)
i1 = mul (p1, x2)
q = mul (i1, 5)
i2 = mul (2, p2)
i3 = mul (i2, q)
i4 = mul (3, r)
v = add (i3, i4)</code></pre>
<p>(If a variable were used <span><em>n</em></span> times then we would have to insert <span><em>n</em> − 1</span> <code>dup</code>s for it. In our example no variable is used more than twice.)</p>
<p>Notice that now not only is every variable defined exactly once, but every variable is also <em>used</em> exactly once (except the inputs and outputs, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>v</code> – I won’t say more here about how exactly these seemingly special cases fit into the story). This property is important for a reason which will be explained when we come to generate the reverse mode program.</p>
<h2 id="differentiation-line-by-line-1">Differentiation line-by-line</h2>
<p>The line-by-line differentiation rules for generating the reverse mode need another article to explain thoroughly, but in this article I will hope to provide some basic intuition via examples and the informal notion that the reverse mode program calculates how sensitive the output is to different variables. For example, if the variable <code>y</code> appears in the original program then the variable <code>d_dy</code> will appear in the reverse mode program and measures “how sensitive the output is to small changes in <code>y</code>”. (I’ll abbreviate this to “<code>d_dy</code> is the sensitivity to <code>y</code>”.)</p>
<h3 id="examples-1">Examples</h3>
<h4 id="addition-1">Addition</h4>
<p>If a line of our pseudocode program is</p>
<pre><code>y = add (x1, x2)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivatives are</p>
<pre><code>d_dx1 = d_dy
d_dx2 = d_dy</code></pre>
<p>because the sensitivity to <code>x1</code> is the same as the sensitivity to <code>y</code> (and likewise for <code>x2</code>). This is written on a single line as</p>
<pre><code>(d_dx1, d_dx2) = dup (d_dy)</code></pre>
<h4 id="multiplication-1">Multiplication</h4>
<p>If a line of our program was</p>
<pre><code>y = mul (x1, x2)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivative line is</p>
<pre><code>(d_dx1, d_dx2) = (mul (x2, d_dy), mul (x1, d_dy))</code></pre>
<p>because the sensitivity to <code>x1</code> is <code>x2</code> times the sensitivity to <code>y</code> (and similarly for <code>x2</code>).</p>
<h4 id="duplication">Duplication</h4>
<p>If a line of our program was</p>
<pre><code>(x1, x2) = dup (x)</code></pre>
<p>then the derivative line is</p>
<pre><code>d_dx = add (d_dx1, d_dx2)</code></pre>
<p>because the sensitivity to <code>x</code> is the sensitivity to <code>x1</code> plus the sensitivity to <code>x2</code>.</p>
<h2 id="generating-reverse-mode-code">Generating reverse mode code</h2>
<p>Like forward mode before it, the reverse mode transformation applies the appropriate differentiation rule to each line in the input program (listed on the left) to obtain a …</p></div></div>
