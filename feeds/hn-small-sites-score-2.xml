<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>Pursuing a non-conventional path</h3><p>Between 2015 and 2020 I have participated in <a href="https://quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a> and <a href="https://numer.ai/">Numerai</a> tournaments. Being involved in these tournaments has led me to a <strong>very profitable journey</strong>: I made around $350k during these years.</p><p>Many people have reached out to me and asked how I did it. I decided to write this post to inspire others with this <strong>non-conventional path</strong>.</p><h4>Selling a Trading Algorithm</h4><p>In 2015 <strong>algorithmic trading</strong> was one of my interests. This is how I came across <a href="https://quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a>, a platform that provides data and tools so anyone can develop and test trading algorithms. After learning the basics and playing around with the platform I decided to submit an algorithm to their recently created tournament.</p><p>The algorithm was pretty basic but surprisingly it remained in the <strong>top 10 for a few weeks</strong>. I received many messages: companies suggesting to join them as a Financial Quant, people interested in my approach, and a few offers from people interested in buying the algorithm.</p><p>One of those potential buyers was particularly interested, shockingly enough, even after I explained him how simple my algorithm was. I eventually shared the code with him for free. Still, he expressed his desire to send me the amount he offered in the first instance. And that's how I made <strong>the first $2k out of participating in ML/financial tournaments.</strong></p><h4>Getting The Dream Job</h4><p>During these weeks I exchanged many emails with Apple employees, financial quants, people from Europe, Asia, or America. But the best interaction came from a guy from my town. He was building his own trading algorithm and was interested in my approach. I meet him a couple of times. Obviously, his knowledge was years ahead of where I was at that time.</p><p>Those meetings were very productive, especially for me. After discussing with him about our personal and professional interests, and how difficult it was to find good jobs in our city, he introduced me to my next employer. Of course, I was not aware of it at that time. He introduced me to the CEO of an ad-tech company, and at first glance I saw many things in common between this sector and <strong>high-frequency trading</strong>. The offered position (not publicly opened at that time) would also allow me to face and try to solve many machine learning, big data and architectural challenges.</p><p>After a few weeks and a couple of meetings, I decided that the company was a really good fit, a place where I would continue professionally growing and developing as a <strong>data scientist and engineer</strong>.</p><p>During years we worked on building a solid <strong>platform that led us to be acquired in 2018</strong>. The experience was great and the outcome even better. Including the exit bonus I made a big sum during this period.</p><h4>The Altcoins Trading Madness</h4><figure><img src="https://i.ibb.co/5c9snCN/Cf-DCZLm-WEAACt-ZS.jpg" alt="Numerai Tournament Leaderboard"></figure><p>In 2016, I discovered the <a href="https://numer.ai/tournament">Numerai Tournament</a>, "the hardest data science tournament on the planet" as they claim. Numerai is a weekly global <strong>data science tournament</strong> to solve the stock market. Data scientists work with clean, regularized, and obfuscated datasets provided by Numerai to create machine-learning models to predict the stock market. <a href="https://numer.ai/">Numerai</a> builds a meta model of the most unique and contributive predictions, and uses this to command the capital in its global equity hedge fund.</p><p>In early 2016 I had finished a <strong>few rounds in good spots</strong>, as you can see in the image. After a few months of actively participating, I ended 2016 with around 0.5 BTC. It was cool but it required too much of my time. I had other priorities, so I withdrew the earnings and left the tournament.</p><p>Almost a year later a post about a Numerai airdrop came across my timeline. After login back to my account I discovered I received 1800 NMR.</p><p>At that time, the amount was valued around $30k, so I initially decided to withdraw almost everything, but something changed my mind and I started <strong>buying and selling altcoins</strong>. After some back and forth, and some lucky movements, I ended accumulating a wallet valued around $100k.</p><p>2017 was arriving at his end and I took <strong>the last lucky movement</strong>, I withdrew half of that sum a few weeks before the bitcoin crash. I still hold the other half but it wasn't easy to stick to that decision during 2018, while cryptos prices continued decreasing.</p><h4>The Compound Effect</h4><p>In July 2018, I came back to Numerai Tournament. I made some submissions but I didn't take it seriously again until mid-2019.</p><p>Since then I have a <strong>cumulative return of +141%</strong>. I have built an algorithm with an average weekly return of +2%, which taking into account the compounding effect it translates to <strong>+180% annualized total return</strong>.</p><h4>What's next?</h4><p>I'm going to continue participating in the Numerai Tournament, if everything continues as it is now, it would provide a good income without requiring much effort. I will also continue taking <strong>small bets</strong>, experimenting with other projects, continue doing things I like, and <strong>learning in the process</strong>.</p><p>I share similar histories in Twitter, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/jrdi">follow me there</a> as I continue to document my journey.</p></div></div></div>]]>

October 20, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I've been using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a> for ~4 months worth of side projects, including a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus/tree">toy text editor</a> and an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/imp">interpreter for a relational language</a>. I've written ~10kloc.</p>
<p>That's not nearly enough time to form a coherent informed opinion. So instead here is an incoherent assortment of thoughts and experiences, in no particular order :)</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an introduction to zig - check out the excellent <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">language docs</a> or the new <a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> instead. I'll try to focus instead on things that are not immediately obvious from reading intro material.</p>
<p>The obvious point of comparison is to rust. For context, I've been using rust <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/three-months-of-rust/">since 2015</a>. Mostly in research positions writing throwaway code, but also ~14 months working on <a href="https://materialize.io/">a commercial database</a> which is ~100kloc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig is dramatically simpler than rust. It took a few days before I felt proficient vs a month or more for rust.</p>
<p>Most of this difference is <strong>not</strong> related to lifetimes. Rust has patterns, traits, dyn, modules, declarative macros, procedural macros, derive, associated types, annotations, cfg, cargo features, turbofish, autoderefencing, deref coercion etc. I encountered most of these in the first week. Just understanding how they all work is a significant time investment, let alone learning when to use each and how they affect the available design space.</p>
<p>I still haven't internalized the full rule-set of rust enough to be able predict whether a design in my head will successfully compile. I don't remember the order in which methods are resolved during autoderefencing, or how module visibility works, or how the type system determines if one impl might <a href="https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#what-are-the-orphan-rules">overlap another or be an orphan</a>. There are frequent moments where I know what I want the machine to do but struggle to encode it into traits and lifetimes.</p>
<p>Zig manages to provide many of the same features with a single mechanism - compile-time execution of regular zig code. This comes will all kinds of pros and cons, but one large and important pro is that I already know how to write regular code so it's easy for me to just write down the thing that I want to happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the key differences between zig and rust is that when writing a generic function, rust will prove that the function is type-safe for every possible value of the generic parameters. Zig will prove that the function is type-safe only for each parameter that you actually call the function with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this allows zig to make use of arbitrary compile-time logic where rust has to restrict itself to structured systems (traits etc) about which it can form general proofs. This in turn allows zig a great deal of expressive power and also massively simplifies the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't type-check zig libraries which contain generics. We can only type-check specific uses of those libraries.</p>
<pre><span>// This function is typesafe if there exist no odd perfect numbers
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number#Odd_perfect_numbers
fn foo(comptime n: comptime_int, i: usize) usize {
  const j = if (comptime is_odd_perfect_number(n)) "surprise!" else 1;
  return i + j;
}
</span></pre>
<p>This means zig also doesn't get the automatic, machine-checked documentation of type constraints that rust benefits from and may face more challenges providing IDE support.</p>
<p>This might harm the zig ecosystem by making it harder to compose various libraries. But <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a> has a similar model and in practice it has worked very well (<a href="https://youtu.be/dmWQtI3DFFo?t=1710">eg</a>, <a href="https://www.oxinabox.net/2020/02/09/whycompositionaljulia.html">eg</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig's comptime allows expressing <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">open multiple dispatch</a> as a library.</p>
<p>It should be relatively trivial to implement specialization the same way, which has been a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">work in progress</a> in rust for years and is critical to many optimizations in julia's math libraries.</p>
<p>Julia chose dynamic typing because it's very difficult to encode the types of various mathematical operations into a general schema (eg fortress <a href="https://youtu.be/EZD3Scuv02g?t=3011">struggled with this</a>). Zig's approach of not requiring general schemas but still type-checking individual cases may be an interesting sweet spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1350.html">2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses</a> to get a sense of the relative frequency of different causes of memory unsafety.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming that the zig programmer is using release-safe mode instead of the unfortunately named release-fast mode which disables all runtime safety checks.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-bounds Write (787/1350)</li>
<li>Out-of-bounds Read (125/1350)</li>
<li>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (119/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages primarily use bounds-checked slices and relegate pointer arithmetic to a separate type (<code>*T</code> in rust, <code>[*]T</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>NULL Pointer Dereference (476/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages require explicit annotations for nulls (<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> in rust, <code>?T</code> in zig) and require code to either handle the null case or safely crash on null (<code>x.unwrap()</code> in rust, <code>x.?</code> in zig).</p>
<p>Dereferencing/casting a null c pointer is undefined behavior in both languages, but is checked at runtime in zig.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer Overflow or Wraparound (190/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust catches overflow in debug and wraps in release. Zig catches overflow in debug/release-safe and leaves behavior undefined in release-fast.</p>
<p>Both languages allow explicitly asking for wraparound (<code>x.wrapping_add(1)</code> in rust, <code>x +% 1</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use After Free (416/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as all unsafe code obeys the aliasing and lifetime rules, rust protects completely against UAF.</p>
<p>Zig has little protection. The recently merged
<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/575fbd5e3592cff70cbfc5153884d919e6bed89f/lib/std/heap/general_purpose_allocator.zig">GeneralPurposeAllocator</a> avoids reusing memory regions (which prevents freed data from being overwritten) and reusing pages (which means that UAF will eventually result in a page fault). But this comes at the cost of fragmentation and lower performance and it also won't provide protection for child allocators using the GPA as a backing allocator.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both languages will insert implicit casts between primitive types and pointers whenever it is safe to do so, and require explicit casts otherwise. (With the odd exception that rust will not implicitly upcast numbers).</p>
<p>Both languages support generics which almost entirely avoids the need to cast void pointers.</p>
<hr>
<p>In rust the Send/Sync traits flag types which are safe to move/share across threads. In the absence of unsafe code it should be impossible to cause data races.</p>
<p>Zig has no comparable protection. It's possible to implement the same logic as Send/Sync in comptime zig, but without the ability to track ownership the rules would have to be much more restrictive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rust prevents having multiple mutable references to the same memory region at the same time.</p>
<p>This means that eg iterator invalidation is prevented at compile time, because the borrow checker won't allow mutating a data-structure while an iterator is holding a reference to the data-structure. Similarly for resizing a data-structure while holding a reference to the old allocation. Both examples are easy sources of UAF in zig.</p>
<hr>
<p>Neither language is able to produce stack traces for stack overflows at the moment (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51405">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1616">zig</a>)</p>
<p>In the future zig is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1006">intended</a> to statically check the maximum stack usage of your program and force recursive code to explicitly allocate space on the heap, so that stack overflows produce a recoverable OutOfMemory error rather than a crash.</p>
<p>This is not an academic problem - I've seen real-world crashes from recursive tree transformations in compilers (<a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/3996">eg</a>) and it's often painful to write the same logic without recursion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Undefined behavior in rust is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/what-unsafe-does.html">here</a>. It's worth noting that breaking the aliasing rules in unsafe rust can cause undefined behavior but these rules are not yet well-defined. So far this hasn't caused me any problems but it is a little unnerving.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> is an interpreter for rusts Mid-level Intermediate Representation which will detect many (but not all) cases of undefined behavior in unsafe rust. It's far too slow to use for the whole materialize test suite but was useful for unit-testing an unsafe module.</p>
<p>Undefined behavior in zig is defined <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior">here</a>. This list is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1966">probably incomplete</a> given that the core language is still under development.</p>
<p>Zig <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2301">aspires</a> to insert runtime checks for almost all undefined behavior when compiling in debug mode. So far all the easy cases are handled, which is already a dramatic improvement over c.</p>
<p>Zigs compile-time partial evaluation is done by an IR interpreter - it seems plausible that this could also be used as a miri-like tool in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>@import</code> takes a path to a file and turns the whole file into a struct. So modules are just structs. And vice-versa - if you have a large struct declaration you can move it into a file to reduce the indentation.</p>
<p>Zig doesn't care at all where you put files on the filesystem.</p>
<p><code>@import</code> is part of the compile-time execution system so things like platform-specific modules and configurable features can be specified in regular code rather than rust's limited set of <code>#[cfg(...)]</code> macros.</p>
<hr>
<p>Array, struct, enum and union literals can be anonymous - <code>.{.Constant = 1.0}</code> is an anonymous union with it's own type, but can be implicitly cast to any union with a <code>Constant: f64</code> field because they share the same structure.</p>
<p>In rust my code is littered with <code>use Expr::*</code> and I'm careful to avoid name collisions between different enums that I might want to import in the same functions. In zig I just use anonymous literals everywhere and don't worry about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anonymous literals are also nice when using structs to simulate keyword arguments. No need to find and import the correct type:</p>
<pre><span>fn do_things(config: struct {
  max_things: usize = 1000, // default value
  flavor: Flavor,
}) void {
  ...
}

do_things(.{.flavor = .Strawberry});
</span></pre>
<hr>
<p>There is a pattern that shows up a lot in the materialize codebase:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> constant </span><span>= </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(constant) </span><span>=</span><span> expr { constant } </span><span>else </span><span>{ </span><span>panic!</span><span>() }</span><span>;
</span></pre>
<p>It's common enough that many types have methods like <code>expr.unwrap_constant()</code>.</p>
<p>In zig:</p>
<pre><span>const constant = expr.Constant;
</span></pre>
<p>A similar pattern is:</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(</span><span>_</span><span>) </span><span>=</span><span> expr {
        </span><span>...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></pre>
<p>Again, many types get methods like <code>expr.is_constant()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> expr</span><span>.</span><span>is_constant</span><span>(…</span></pre></article></div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy">Privacy on the Internet</a> is important because privacy risks range from the gathering of statistics on users to more malicious acts such as the spreading of spyware and the exploitation of various forms of bugs (software faults). Many companies, such as Google, track which websites people visit and then use the information, for instance by sending advertising based on one's web browsing history. Sometimes prices on products are changed on the same website, depending on tracking information, and two people may view the exact same product on the exact same website yet be presented with very different prices.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This article isn't specifically about privacy issues only, it's about promises that are being broken, which might be about privacy. It is also about the lack of user freedom, as in the choice to enable or disable features, such as automatic updates, or forced usage of third party services, or software that the user generally is unaware of or don't have a say about.</p>

<p>Privacy as a subject regarding the usage of services on the Internet is a very difficult subject to deal with. Not only can it be difficult to actually define privacy, but it also requires a balance between freedom of choice by the users, security and usability. Naturally you need to be able to use the browser on the Internet and as such you will always leave some kind of trail behind, and this article is not about how you can hide your tracks. What I am addressing in this article are browsers that are either promoted as "privacy respecting" by the developers or in general are considered to be so, mostly due to misunderstanding or misinformation, while it is very clear they are not.</p>

<p>Some browsers either directly violate users by collecting telemetric data without consent, or you have to opt-out rather than opt-in, or they bounce around the Internet visiting places in the background without you knowing, using third party services that operates with a privacy policy you either cannot trust or that are directly violating your privacy, or they have integrated third party software that do some of these things.</p>

<p>I will try to keep this article updated with relevant information as much as possible. I know several other browsers exist, but if they are not mentioned on this list I have either not had a change to investigate them, they are closed source and completely irrelevant (such as Microsoft Edge or Opera), or they are not actively maintained, or they are irrelevant "one mans show" which cannot be trusted for some reason or another.</p>

<p>I will also <strong>not</strong> be looking at browsers that only work on Microsoft Windows or macOS, even if they are Open Source. Both Microsoft Windows and macOS are highly controversial and completely untrustworthy operating systems.</p>

<p>Also please note that just because the developers of a browser are promising that their browser is privacy respecting doesn't mean that you can trust the information. As you will see with the examples of some of the browsers below even developers some times compromise user privacy perhaps without even thinking about it.</p>

<p>I also want to make a strong advice to people recommending browsers to other people without investigation or knowledge. The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/">privacy related channel on Reddit</a> is filled with wrong recommendations regarding privacy respecting browsers and many people are merely guessing or blindly trusting the information the browser producers are publishing. Neither Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Chromium, Brave, Waterfox, or several of the other recommended browsers truly respect privacy. They all do some form of telemetry and/or privacy compromising actions without the user consenting to it or even knowing about it.</p>

<p>Also, privacy doesn't mean that you simply pull out telemetry from Firefox, rebrand it, and then ship it. Privacy is more than that. Unless the browser is automatically checking for an updated version, and the website isn't logging that request, it cannot be considered truly private if the browser starts bouncing around on the Internet visiting all kinds of places without the user has done anything more than open the browser up! Every time the browser makes a DNS request, that DNS request is in most cases logged unless the user actively does something to mitigate that - such as using a trusted VPN or non-logging DNS service. Furthermore, the Mozilla add-on CDN is logging user activity, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront">Amazon Cloudfront</a>, so if the browser visits these places without the user explicitly pushes a "check for updates" option, the browser is compromising user privacy. The point is that the user needs to have the choice to disable automatic updates of both browser and extensions and that nothing happens until the user actively has accepted that.</p>

<p>I intent to add more browsers to this list as time permits so keep coming back for more updated information. Also, if you discover any mistakes on my part, feel free to email me about it so that I can correct the information.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-clones">Third party clones</h2>
<p>Several third party clones of Firefox and Chromium exist that are branded and promoted as secure and privacy respecting alternatives that cannot fully be trusted for some reason or another. The code base for both Firefox and Chromium are huge and many skillful people work on the code every day. Having a "one mans show" or a small team of developers diverted clone running on your computer that are months behind security updates does not improve neither your privacy nor your security in any way.</p>
<p>Even when these small teams work fast they are still often many days behind security updates, which is a big problem. Just as an example, on January 23, 2018, Mozilla released Firefox 58 and Firefox ESR 52.6 with a bunch of security updates. Three days later, the Waterfox clone project was working on integrating these patches. On February 1, 2018, Waterfox 56.0.4 was released with these patches. Waterfox users had to wait nine days for security patches from a minor release!</p>

<h2 id="privacy-compromising">Privacy compromising browsers</h2>

<h3 id="firefox">Mozilla Firefox</h3>
<p>In the past I have always supported Mozilla and promoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a>, but Mozilla has made some pretty controversial decisions as of late and I no longer feel that Mozilla is an organization that deserves any support.</p>
<p>Firefox is promoted by Mozilla as a privacy respecting browser, but this is highly misleading. Firefox "phones home" every time you start it up even when you have disabled telemetry and automatic updates of extensions. Domains such as mozilla.org, cloudfront.net, firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com (see: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12</a>), autopush.prod.mozaws.net, detectportal.firefox.com and location.services.mozilla.com are visited each time you start Firefox.</p>
<p>In 2017 Mozilla made a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliqz#Integration_with_Firefox">deal with Cliqz</a> where approximately 1% of users downloading Firefox in Germany would receive a version with Cliqz software included. And in 2018 Mozilla revealed that they had no data on the number of Firefox installations with disabled Telemetry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, we need better insight into our opt-out rates for telemetry. We use telemetry to ensure new features improve your user experience and to guide Mozilla's business decisions. However, an unknown portion of our users do not report telemetry for a variety of reasons. This means we may not have data that is representative of our entire population.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mozilla then developed the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487578">Telemetry Coverage</a> system and distributed it to 1% of the Firefox installations. The system is automatically installed and designed to inform Mozilla whether telemetry is enabled in the browser.</p>
<p>Mozilla also <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/telemetry-collection-windows-default-browser-trend">developed a Windows-only scheduled task</a> which runs in the background once a day for each installation of Firefox installed on a computer running Microsoft Windows. The task collects information related to the system's current and previous default browser setting and the operating system locale and version.</p>
<p>This is a list of some of the things that Mozilla collects: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content</a>.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/">Mozilla website</a> we can read (when I originally started writing this article) that <q>We put people over profit</q>, and <q>a product to support user privacy</q>. We can also read in the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla manifesto</a>, in the fourth principle, that <q>Individuals' security and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.</q> However, with their decision to make Cloudflare the default DNS provider for DNS over HTTPS, they are definitely not supporting user privacy or putting people over profit!</p>
<p>DNS over HTTPS is by itself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxTdEEuyxHU">bad enough</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS#Criticism">highly criticized</a> with good reason, but combining it with a US based company like Cloudflare makes it even worse.</p>
<p>Cloudflare has made an <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/firefox/">agreement</a> with Mozilla that when it acts as a DNS resolver for Firefox, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS requests will be stored as part of Cloudflare's "temporary" logs which are permanently deleted within 24 hours.</li>
<li>Cloudflare will also collect and store the following information as part of its permanent logs:
<ul>
<li>Total number of requests processed by each Cloudflare co-location facility.</li>
<li>Aggregate list of all domain names requested.</li>
<li>Samples of domain names queried along with the times of such queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information stored in Cloudflare's permanent logs will be anonymized and may be held indefinitely by Cloudflare for its own internal research and development purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who has worked with DNS servers knows what goes into such logs and in order for Cloudflare to keep their promise they need to: Delete the DNS requests …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrapper"><div id="container"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>While HTTP/3 specification is still in the draft stage, the latest version of the Chrome browser already <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/10/chrome-is-deploying-http3-and-ietf-quic.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">supports it by default</a>
. With Chrome holding around 70% of browser market share, you could say HTTP/3 has gone mainstream.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/quic-logo.png" alt="QUIC logo"></p><p>The new revision of this foundational protocol aims to make the web more efficient, secure, and shorten the content-delivery latencies. In some ways, it’s a braver take of HTTP2: similar goals addressed by replacing the underlying TCP protocol with a new, purpose-built protocol QUIC. The best way to explain the benefits of QUIC is to illustrate where TCP falls short as a transport for HTTP requests. And to do that, we’ll start at the very beginning.</p><h3 id="http-the-original">HTTP. The Original.</h3><p>When Sir Tim Berners-Lee formalized the design of a simple <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one-line hyper-text-exchange protocol</a>
in 1991, TCP was already an old, reliable protocol. The original definition document of what later became known as HTTP 0.9 specifically mentions TCP as a preferred, albeit not exclusive, transport protocol:</p><blockquote><p>Note: HTTP currently runs over TCP, but could run over any connection-oriented service.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, this proof-of-concept version of HTTP had very few similarities to HTTP we now know and love today. There were no headers and no status codes. The typical request was as simple as <code>GET /path</code>. The response contained only HTML and ended with the closing of the TCP connection.
Since browsers were not yet a thing, user was supposed to read HTML directly. It was possible to link to other resources, but none of the tags present in this early version of HTML requested additional resources asynchronously. A single HTTP request delivered a complete, self-sufficient page.</p><h3 id="emergence-of-http10">Emergence of HTTP/1.0</h3><p>In subsequent years the internet has exploded, and HTTP evolved to be an extendable and flexible general-purpose protocol, although transporting HTML remained its chief specialty. There are three critical updates to HTTP that enabled this evolution:</p><ul><li>introduction of methods allowed the client to identify the type of action it wants to perform. For example, POST was created to allow client sending data to the server to process and store</li><li>status codes provided a way for client to confirm that the server has processed the request successfully, and if not - to understand what kind of error has occured</li><li>headers added an ability to attach structured textual metadata to requests and responses that could modify the behavior of the client or server. Encoding and content-type headers, for example, allowed HTTP to transfer not just HTML, but any type of payload. “Compression” header allowed the client and server to negotiate supported compression formats, thus reducing the amount of data to transfer over the connection</li></ul><p>At the same time, HTML advanced to support images, styles, and other linked resources. Browsers were now forced to perfrom multiple requests to display a single web page, which the original connection-per-request architecture was not designed to handle. Establishing and ending a TCP connection involves a lot of back-and-forth packet exchange, so it is relatively expensive in terms of latency overhead. It didn’t matter much when a web-page consisted of a single text file, but as the number of requests per page increased, so did the latency.</p><p>The picture below illustrates how much overhead was involved in establishing a new TCP connection per request.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http1-tcp-overhead.png" alt="TCP connection requires three requests to establish connection and four to close it cleanly"></p><p>A “connection” header was created to address this problem. Client sends a request with “connection: keep-alive” header to signal intent to keep the TCP connection open for subsequent requests. If server understands this header and agrees to respect it, its response will also contain the “connection: keep-alive” header. This way, both parties maintain TCP channel open and use it for subsequent communication until either party decides to close it. This became even more important with the spread of SSL/TLS encryption, because negotianting an encryption algorithm and exchanging cryptographic keys requires an additional request/response cycle on each connection.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http1-keepalive.png" alt="A single TCP connection can be reused for multiple requests with “connection: keep-alive” header"></p><p>At the time, many of the HTTP improvements appeared spontaneously. When a popular browser or a server app saw a need for a new HTTP feature, they would simply implement it themselves and hoped that other parties would follow the suit. Ironically, a decentralized web needed a centralized governing body to avoid fragmentation into incompatible pieces. Tim Berners-Lee, the original creator of the protocol, recognized the danger and founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994, which together with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) worked on formalizing stack of internet technologies. As the initial step to bring more structure to the existing environment, they documented the most common features used in HTTP at the time and named the resulting protocol HTTP/1.0. However, because this “specification” described varied, often inconsistent techniques as seen “in the wild”, it never received a status of a standard. Instead, the work on the new version of the HTTP protocol has begun.</p><h3 id="standardization-of-http11">Standardization of HTTP/1.1</h3><p>HTTP/1.1 fixed inconsistencies of HTTP/1.0 and adjusted the protocol to be more performant in the new web ecosystem. Two of the most critical changes introduced were the use of persistent TCP connections (keep-alive’s) by default and HTTP pipelining.</p><p>HTTP pipelining simply means that client does not need to wait for the server to respond to a request before sending subsequent HTTP requests. This feature resulted in even more efficient use of bandwidth and reduced latencies, but it could be improved even more. HTTP pipelining still requires from server to respond in the order of requests received, so if a single request in a pipeline is slow to fulfill, all subsequent responses to a client will be delayed accordingly. This problem is known as head-of-the-line blocking.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http11-blocking.png" alt="Since large-picture.jpg was requested first, it’s blocking the delivery of the style.css"></p><p>At this point in time, the web is gaining more and more interactive capabilities. Web 2.0 is just around the corner, some webpages include dozens or even hundreds of external resources. To work around the head-of-the-line blocking, and to decrease page loading speeds, clients establish multiple TCP connections per host. Of course, the connection overhead never went anywhere. In reality, it got worse, since more and more applications encrypt HTTP traffic with SSL/TLS. So most browsers set the limit of maximal possible simultaneous connections in an attempt to strike a delicate balance.</p><p>Many of the larger web-services have recognized that existing limitations are too restricting for their exceptionally heavy interactive web-applications, so they “gamed the system” by distributing their app through multiple domain names. It all worked, somehow, but the solution has been far from elegant.</p><p>Despite a few shortcomings, the simplicity of HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 has made them widely successful, and for over a decade no one has made a serious attempt to change them.</p><h3 id="spdy-and-http2">SPDY and HTTP/2</h3><p>In 2008 Google released the Chrome browser, which rapidly gained popularity for being quick and innovative. It has given Google a strong vote on matters of internet technologies. In the early 2010s, Google adds support for its web protocol SPDY to Chrome.</p><p>HTTP/2 standard was based on SPDY with some improvements. HTTP/2 solved the head-of-the-line blocking problem by multiplexing the HTTP requests over a single open TCP connection. This allowed server to answer requests in any order, client could then re-assemble the responses as it received them, making the whole exchange faster within a single connection.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http2-multiplexing.png" alt="style.css was returned before the large-picture.jpg, becuase of HTTP/2 multiplexing"></p><p>In fact, with HTTP/2 server can serve the resources to a client before it even asked for it! To give an example, if the server knows that client will most likely need a stylesheet to display an HTML page, it can “push” the CSS to the client without waiting for a corresponding request. While beneficial in theory, this feature rarely seen in practice, since it requires a server to understand the structure of the HTML it serves, which is rarely the case.</p><p>HTTP/2 also allows compressing request headers in addition to the request body, which further reduces the amount of data transferred over the wire.</p><p>HTTP/2 solved a lot of problems for the web, but not all of them. A similar type of head-of-the-line problem is still present on the level of TCP protocol, which remains a foundational building block of the web. When a TCP packet gets lost in transit, the receiver can’t acknowledge incoming packages until the lost package is re-sent by a server. Since TCP is by design oblivious to higher-level protocols like HTTP, a single lost packet will block the stream for all in-flight HTTP requests until the missing data is re-sent. This problem is especially prominent on an unreliable connection, which is not rare in the age of ubiquitous mobile devices.</p><h3 id="http3-revolution">HTTP/3 revolution</h3><p>Since issues with HTTP/2 can not be resolved purely on the application layer a new iteration of the protocol must update the transport layer. However, creating a new transport-layer protocol is not an easy task. Transport protocols need to be supported by hardware vendors and deployed by the majority of network operators, which are reluctant to update because of the costs and efforts involved. Take IPv6 as an example: it was introduced 24 years ago and is still far from being universally supported.</p><p>Fortunately, there is another option. UDP protocol is as widely supported as TCP but is simple enough to serve as a building block for custom protocols running on top of it. UDP packets are fire-and-forget: there are no handshakes, persistent connections, or error-correction. The primary idea behind HTTP3 is to abandon TCP in favor of a UDP-based QUIC protocol. QUIC adds the necessary features (those that were previously provided by TCP, and more) in a way that makes sense for the web environment.</p><p>Unlike HTTP2, which technically allowed an unencrypted communication, QUIC strictly requires encryption to establish a connection. Additionally, encryption is applied to all data …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>That's it.</p>
<h3 id="running"><a href="#running" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Running</h3>

<p>This starts the server on port 1234. then players can connect to it with any tool that does tcp sockets. For example netcat:</p>

<h3 id="joining-the-game"><a href="#joining-the-game" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Joining the game</h3>
<p>Players can only join while the game is in the pre-game lobby state. People are asked for a name and then end up in the lobby chat. One player is the admin, usually the first person to connect. That person can execute the /start command to start round. Other chat commands are described in /help</p>
<p>After starting the round one of the players is assigned the imposter role, all other players are assigned the crewmate role. After that the game moves to the playing state</p>
<h3 id="the-playing-stage"><a href="#the-playing-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The playing stage</h3>
<p>In the playing state the players get a <code>#</code> prompt. At this point people can't chat to eachother anymore and can only run commands (without / prefix)</p>
<p>Everyone starts in the cafeteria, everyone gets 7 tasks randomly assigned. You can check your tasks with the <code>check tasks</code> command. You complete your tasks by moving to the room the task is in and typing the full task name, this is case sensitive.</p>
<p>You can see the room you're in by running the <code>examine room</code> or <code>e</code> command. This will also show you where you can move to from the current room and which crewmates are in the room with you. You can move to other rooms by using the <code>go [roomname]</code> command.</p>
<p>The <code>map</code> command shows an ascii art diagram of the map as reference.</p>
<p>If you are the imposter your main mission is not to complete the tasks but to murder all the crew without anyone figuring out you're the imposter. You can use the <code>murder crewmate</code> command to kill a crewmate that's in the same room as you. If there are multiple one will be chosen at random and the other crewmates will be notified someone died in the room with them.</p>
<p>If somebody notices a dead body in the room they can use the <code>report</code> command to halt the playing and move everyone to the discussion stage. It is also possible to trigger the discussion stage by going to the cafeteria and using the <code>press emergency button</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="the-discussion-stage"><a href="#the-discussion-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The discussion stage</h3>
<p>If a body has been found or a meeting has been called everyone gets thrown in the discussion state. At this point everyone can see who is still alive. Then there's a chatroom which is limited to 50 messages in total, so use the chat wisely. While/after chatting it is possible to either vote to throw someone off the ship or to skip using <code>/vote [number]</code> or <code>/skip</code>. You can also use <code>/list</code> to see who has not voted yet.</p>
<p>After everyone has voted either the game moves directly back to the playing stage or someone gets thrown off. After the player has been ejected it will be visible if it was the imposter (and then the game has been won by the crew) or if someone innocent was ejected. Then the game moves back to the playing stage.</p>
<p>The crew can win by having everyone complete all the tasks or by voting out the imposter. The imposter can win by killing all the crew or by making the crew vote out all their crewmates.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                
<audio controls="controls"><source src="https://azumbrunnen.me/audio/chatbot-is-dead" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>



<p>Personal websites are usually like old books in a shelf. They languish, accumulate dust, and their wrinkles and cracks become more apparent over time. About 3 years ago I embarked on a simple experiment that would end up prolonging the shelf-life of my website by an unusually large margin.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, it seemed like Conversational UI was poised to take over the world. We saw Quartz turning news into a conversation, WeChat being featured as the poster-child of a post application world, iMessage turning into an unnecessarily complex mess, and chatbots popping up like mushrooms in moist forests.</p>



<p>Of course, any trend gaining so much traction and interest needs to be taken seriously. As such, I decided to familiarize myself with the topic, and turned my website into a chatbot.</p>



<p>Instead of being greeted by the internationally standardized greeting every designer used at some point in their career, there was no bold, dramatically oversized, and deep black sans-serif reading: <em>Hi, I’m a designer.</em> (To be fair, I didn’t use Proxima Nova either)</p>



<p>Instead, a couple of chat bubbles exuberantly ushered onto the canvas to greet users as if we had all been long time friends.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-animated.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Conversational intro</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was witty, new, and slightly awkward. People would send messages that ranged from simple chit chat, to deep philosophical topics, to downright disturbing and ridiculous insults.</p>



<p>The experiment got featured on Hackernews, Medium, was used in psychological studies conducted by Dan Ariely’s team, and the source code was ripped and edited by various startups to fit their needs. One business in the Bay Area had an idea to use it to sell flowers in a conversational way. It looks like they went out of business.</p>



<p>The reaction and feedback was surprising to say the least. It was an idea so simple, so silly, that the outcome was in many ways unexpected. After all, the only one who really cares about your website, is usually yourself.</p>



<p>That didn’t stop me from revamping my website and kill the very thing that had turned it into a micro-celebrity before. With the death of my old chatbot, some angry emails by schools who are using it as a reference for “creative” web design, and a good amount of time that has passed ever since, I wanted to take a step back and set the record straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2>When chatbots matter</h2>



<p>So let’s be honest with ourselves for a moment: <em>when did you actually ever enjoy talking to a chat bot?</em> And I’m not talking about the type of bots you talk to when you’re bored, but about those that provide a deeper purpose.</p>



<p>It turns out that the answer is, at least for most of us, almost never.</p>



<p>I love you Intercom, except when I don’t. 99% of time I don’t want to talk to a silly and obtrusive avatar popping up from some corner of the screen before I even had a chance to check out what’s going on. Somehow, I can’t help but think others feel the same.</p>



<p>In fact, we do know that others feel the same. Chat heads jumping at us unasked, are the quintessential equivalent of the infamous sales clerk who eagerly talks to us upon entering a store.</p>



<p>To further add to the challenges: as soon as users go off-script, chat bot’s don’t just become awkward and unpredictable—they turn into little sociopaths that might rub users the wrong way.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="346" src="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma.png" alt="" srcset="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma.png 400w, https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma-300x260.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption>UX Chat.me —&nbsp;Conversational UX News</figcaption></figure>



<p>The moment you create a chat bot is the moment you allow customers to have a conversation with <em>your brand</em>. Not with yourself, not with your friend, but with an uber entity—a symbol—that represents everything you and your team stand for. That’s not a step to be taken lightly.</p>



<p>This simple conversational entity can be a fun tool to engage with people but depending on how the conversation goes, it can quickly turn into a misrepresentation of the values of your team and your company. So building a chat bot should never be the default choice, but an intentional one.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s worth asking yourself the following three questions before venturing into this space:</p>



<h3>1. Is your use case simple enough to be solved through chat?</h3>



<p>Conversation is incredibly complex and it’s challenging enough to keep it on track in the real world. If the use case isn’t simple, chances are, chat bots are not the right tool for the job.</p>



<h3>2. Is your NLP capable and sophisticated enough?</h3>



<p>There are two types of bots: pre-scripted bots with a range of default answers users can choose from, and Natural Language Processing based ones.</p>



<p>Choosing the right one is hard. While pre-scripted can feel too limiting, NLP can break at every corner. Often times, teams quickly fall into the trap of spending a huge amount of time focusing on personality and silly jokes, instead of solving the problem users hired you for in the first place.</p>



<p>Therefore, building on top of the first point above, within the conversational landscape, simple always wins.</p>



<h3>3. Are your users actually in chat based environments?</h3>



<p>Chat bots work best where users already are. If your users are primarily spending time in messaging platforms where bots and micro-apps can be seamlessly embedded, great. That can serve as an effective and natural way to engage with your audience because it matches the “be where users already are” principle.</p>



<p>If on the other hand, people come to your website, a medium that has made great strides to provide content in a non-linear and quick way, it often unnecessarily slows users down. </p>



<hr>



<h2>Farewell chatbot</h2>



<p>I don’t want to discredit chat bots as a paradigm. They have their use in certain industries, medium, and work well for a specific set of use cases. The important part is being deliberate, rather than jumping ship blindfolded.</p>



<p>So whereas turning my website into a chat was a fun experiment, I ultimately feel like it has slowly turned into a fad. I got fooled by the trend, and as a by-product became part of the trend itself.  Fads come and go, and as they get refined and re-interpreted, they ultimately find their true purpose. What we’re left with is the age old insight that it’s only through experimentation, that we can unlock concepts and ideas that last.</p>



<p>Rest in peace chat bot, long live chat bots.</p>

        <p>A survey conducted by u/PM_ME__UR_CANCER</p>
        <p><img src="https://747anon.github.io/blm-survey/img/github.png" width="200px" alt="Github"></p>
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div><p>
                Hello!

                These are the results of a survey I posted recently, which aimed to ask the Github userbase what their
                thoughts on the controversial change of the default branch on Github (and by extension, Git) from 'master'
                to an alternative phrase like 'main' or 'trunk'.

                The name change was proposed as a response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, demanding equal rights
                and restructure of the American police system in response to the violent, tragic and reckless murders of
                innocent black men, women and children at the hands of police.
                
                </p><p>
                This proposed change has divided opinions within Github's user base. Github has claimed that the use of the word
                'master' has connotations to slavery in many countries, and it is being changed to make black developers feel
                more comfortable on the platform. However, many others have argued that the change is meaningless to the cause,
                distracts the public from the actual issues faced by real black people, and that the change breaks CI solutions
                and other habits. However, many others also support the change, believing that it is expanding inclusivity, and
                it is also a chance to change the name of the branch to something more meaningful or a name which expresses the
                branch's purpose more clearly.

                </p><p>
                In the wake of this, I decided to create this survey to ask the users of Github directly what they thought about
                the change. I also decided to collect information about the responder's ethnicity, country of residence and gender,
                in order to gauge the demographics which were mainly for and against the change.

                The survey spanned many different countries, reaching people who identified with around 16 different
                ethnic groups. The survey was also taken by several people who did not identify as either male or female.
                However, the majority of people who responded were white, and the most prevalent gender identity to respond
                was male, followed up by females. This was expected based on how the majority of people involved in computer
                science (and therefore, users of Github) are white males. Despite this however, many users chose not to
                disclose their gender identity, so the true distribution is not known.

                Perhaps unsurprisingly, the United States came in with the most responses by 29.5%, followed closely by many
                European countries. I did not list all countries in Europe, but many responses from other countries in Europe
                responded, taking up about 29% of all responses. Based on the ethnic data, I'm guessing most of these are from
                countries like Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, and so on. In hindsight, I probably should have included more
                countries in the list.

                The general opinion for most users is that they are <b>against</b> this change. 70% of all participants said
                that they are against the change, with only 15.7% being in support of the change. The other 14.3% fall under
                'Maybe' and 'Don't care', though their actual opinions are usually mixed and lean towards one of the two main
                options. Based on the written responses from users who were asked to explain their responses, most reasoning
                for their responses is as follows:
                </p><p>
                <b>For</b></p></div><ul>
                    <li>It is outdated terminology, and changing it from 'master' to some other alternative in order to create
                        a more inclusive space is worth the effort.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an opportunity to pick a more meaningful name which better expresses what the branch actually does.
                        It is difficult to understand exactly what 'master' means on first encounter, whereas something like 'main'
                        would make much more sense.
                    </li>
                    <li>The name 'master' simply doesn't make sense to some users. It is now legacy terminology, and holding onto
                        it would simply be impractical.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some are not bothered either way, but feel that if individuals are offended by it they are supportive of
                        changing it to something else.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Against</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This action is being taken as a form of 'virtue signalling', Github and Microsoft merely did this in order
                        to jump onto a bandwagon while the Black Lives Matter movement was gaining momentum on social media.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several African Americans who responded stated that it was <i>more</i> offensive to change it, since it
                        comes across as white people "thinking we are "vulnerable" and need protecting" from a word which they
                        understand has multiple meanings in different contexts.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an impractical change which will break workflows, continuous integration (CI) setups and several other
                        automated scripts which will require manual fixing later.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using the word 'master' depends on the context being used. In Git, it is widely understood that the word
                        'master' is used to mean master copy (the original copy which all derivatives are made from), and nobody
                        associates the word in this context with it's master/slave connotation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several git tutorials and walkthroughs will become obselete.</li>
                    <li>It is introducing politics into a website which is not and has not ever been involved in politics, and it
                        is creating a social issue where there actually isn't one to begin with.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                It is clear that most users believe it is an unnecessary change, which breaks automated workflows, is insensitive
                given the current political landscape in the world, offensive to the group of people they are trying to be inclusive
                of, and suggests that Github and/or Microsoft are simply only interested in doing this to gain favor in public opinion.
            
                <p>
                However, some users also believe that it is time to rid the industry of questionable terminology, which could possibly
                offend certain people, is confusing and unclear in its meaning given the context it is used in, and should be
                swapped out with clearer and less ambiguous terminology.

                </p><p>
                Those who were in support of the change were asked to pick from a list of alternative names for the branch which they
                preferred, or suggest their own. The most popular one chosen by participants was 'main' with 47.6% of votes, followed
                by 'trunk' with 14.3%. Several other names were suggested which are listed below.

            <h2>Correlations</h2>
            <p>
                I originally ran this survey with the goal of discovering some kind of correlation between the different demographic
                groups which make up Github's user base, and how positive/negative their support is in relation to this issue. I also
                wanted to see which group was most supportive of the change, which group was least supportive, and how much the 
                response changed between ethnicities, genders and countries.

                Something I was not expecting when gathering the data for this survey is that every single African American who
                answered the survey responded 'No' in support of the change. Not only that, when asked to explain their reasoning,
                all of them sounded fairly spiteful towards Github and it's executives, since they felt that these decisions were
                made by white executives who didn't actually consider whether it offended them or not, and these responses suggest
                that they were more offended by Github feeling the need to change it in the first place.
                
                </p><p>
                You can also see that most of the users in support of this change are of either caucasian or asian descent, while
                more marginalised groups like africans, indians, hispanics and otherwise are almost universally against the changes,
                reflecting that the main ethnic group which feels the need to change it (and take offense to it) are white.

<p><strong>In the first of the “Hitchhiker’s Guide to DRM” series, we define</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>what DRM (Digital Rights Management) is,</strong></li><li><strong>and why it plays an important role in ensuring fair use of digital resources through a combination of encryption, access control technology, and business rules.</strong></li></ul>








<h2><span id="The_Tale_of_Two_Boys"></span>The Tale of Two Boys<span></span></h2>



<p>Ram and Shyam were 7th graders who loved passing notes to each other during class. An inseparable duo, their notes contained the latest school gossip, computer game cheat codes, and cricket match scores.</p>



<p>Their notes used to pass through several of their classmates’ hands in their journey because they sat far away from each other in class. But, the boys weren’t worried about others learning their secrets because they trusted their classmates.</p>



<p>However, one sad day, one of their classmates opened one of their notes and broke their trust!! Delighted by the juicy gossip in the note, he used it to take Ram and Shyam’s lunch money.</p>

<p>Having lost all of his lunch money, Ram thought long and hard about sending his notes securely to Shyam and before long, Ram had an idea.</p>



<p>“How about using a code language to write my notes?”</p>



<p>Excellent idea, he thought to himself and set about creating a substitution code (1 for A, 2 for B, and so on). The following day in class, Ram used his new code language to write a secret message and send it to Shyam.</p>



<p>The note made its way to Shyam through the hands of several curious (&amp; nosy) classmates, and none of them could crack the code.</p>



<p>But, when Shyam got the message, he looked perplexed and thought to himself –</p>



<blockquote><p>What are these numbers, squiggly lines, and alphabets? Is Ram testing his new pen, or was he hit on the head with a cricket ball?</p></blockquote>



<p>Ram stared at Shyam’s puzzled face with equal bewilderment and suddenly realized his mistake. He had forgotten to send Shyam the key to the code!</p>



<p>So, Ram wrote down the code on a piece of paper and sent it to Shyam, who used it to decode the note.</p>



<p>Job well done, Ram thought to himself.</p>



<p>They didn’t know that one of their classmates had copied down the coded message and now had the codebook. For the second day in a row, Ram and Shyam lost their secrets and their lunch money.</p>



<p>They realized that they needed to transmit the code securely each time they used code or changed it.</p>



<p><strong>But how would they do that?</strong></p>



<h2 id="what-did-ram--shyam-do"><span id="What_Did_Ram_Shyam_Do"></span>What Did Ram &amp; Shyam Do?<span></span></h2>



<p><strong><em>Narrator:</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>The problem faced by the boys is a classic problem in data transmission. It is easy to use a codebook, create a secret message, and send it to the recipient but, how do you send the codebook to the recipient and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands?</em></p>



<p>Then one night, Shyam had a brainwave. He called Ram and said –</p>



<p><strong>Shyam:</strong>&nbsp;Hey – suppose we ask Hari to join us in note passing? We’ll ask him to keep the codebook safe in his schoolbag. Each time you or I need to write or read a message, we’ll ask Hari for the codebook. What do you think?</p>



<p><strong>Ram:</strong>&nbsp;Hey – that could work! But, will Hari agree to this?</p>



<p><strong>Shyam:</strong>&nbsp;Yea – I thought of that too. Every time we ask him for the codebook, let’s give him a chocolate.</p>



<p><strong>Ram:</strong>&nbsp;Ah – excellent idea!</p>

<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;So, the boys decided to bring in their friend Hari into their plans and asked him to be a “trusted” third-party. And, his duties were to –</p>



<ol><li>invent a new code every day to reduce chances of someone cracking it and</li><li>provide the code’s key to only Ram and Shyam in a way that nobody else can open and read it.</li></ol>



<p><strong>And the boys had to give him a bar of chocolate each time they asked for the codebook.</strong></p>



<p>Yummy price to pay for privacy, huh?</p>



<h2 id="digital-rights-management-drm"><span id="Digital_Rights_Management_(DRM)"></span>Digital Rights Management (DRM)<span></span></h2>



<p>In reality, what our creative 7th graders invented was a Digital Rights Management (DRM) system that not only provided security for their content (notes) but also allowed them to set some rules.</p>



<p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a method of protecting your content while having the flexibility to chose who gets to consume it via business rules and a secure, protected communication protocol.</p>



<p>For example, you could set rules to,</p>



<ul><li>block people from certain countries,</li><li>allow access to the content for a certain period,</li><li>prevent a user from casting the movie onto a screen,</li><li>block free users from accessing premium content,</li><li>block playback on specific devices,</li><li>etc.</li></ul>



<p>DRM plays a vital role in reducing piracy and ensuring that content creators can monetize their efforts.</p>



<p>But, remember this –&nbsp;<strong>DRM is not the same as encryption</strong>.</p>



<p>DRM is a system or solution that</p>



<ul><li>uses encryption to protect the content</li><li>uses specialized techniques to <strong>securely store and deliver</strong> the encryption/decryption keys&nbsp;<em>(codebooks in our 7th graders’ example)</em> and use the keys to decrypt the content in a way that it doesn’t get into the wrong hands. </li><li>allows the content publishers to set business rules and control who can consume their content (expiry times, etc.).</li></ul>



<p>We’ll learn more about this in future articles.</p>



<h2 id="back-to-our-7th-graders"><span id="Back_to_Our_7th_Graders"></span>Back to Our 7th Graders<span></span></h2>



<p>Now let’s go back and look at the simple solution that our 7th graders invented, which provided</p>



<ul><li>a high-security level through daily renewal and code rotation.</li><li>authentication and rights management (read, write permissions)</li><li>a well-defined pricing model.</li></ul>



<p>The truly remarkable part about this scheme is that as Ram and Shyam get more popular in school, they can allow a few other classmates to only “read” their messages and not “write” any messages.</p>



<p>All they’d need to do is go to Hari, give him the names and photos of their “newly trusted” friends, and ask Hari to allow them only to read the messages.</p>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>if</strong>&nbsp;the boys’ messages get super-popular, they can ask Hari to</p>



<ul><li>block or allow access to classmates based on where they sit in class:&nbsp;<em>front-benchers not allowed</em>&nbsp;<strong>(geo-blocking)</strong></li><li>Create a set of special notes and charge their classmates two chocolates to read them. All they need to do is tell Hari their subscribers’ names.&nbsp;<strong>(paid usage / subscribers / freemium model)</strong></li><li>deny access to messages that are more than 2 hours old (stale news!)&nbsp;<strong>(expiry date &amp; time of day restriction)</strong></li></ul>



<p>And so on. Amazing, right?</p>



<p>A simple technique to prevent others from reading their messages has now turned into a full-blown business with</p>



<ul><li>heavy-duty encryption and</li><li>business rules that decide access and usage rights.</li></ul>



<h2 id="commercial-drm-solutions"><span id="Commercial_DRM_Solutions"></span>Commercial DRM Solutions<span></span></h2>



<p>Commercially, there are many trusted DRM technologies such as Microsoft’s PlayReady, Google’s Widevine, and Apple’s FairPlay. And there are DRM vendors who provide additional infrastructure around these DRM solutions by adding more business rules, analytics, and tools for publishers.</p>



<p>In future articles, we’ll examine the differences between them and see where they are applicable.</p>



<p>Until then, take care, and see you soon!</p>



<p><strong>Note: DRM is seen as a contentious topic with people on both sides of the fence. This series of articles is a technology-explainer and stays clear of the other debates on DRM.</strong></p>

<img src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" alt="thumbnails ffmpeg" title="thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image">
</figure>


<p>There are several easy ways to take screenshots/thumbnails of movies using FFmpeg. But why do this in the first place?</p>



<ol><li>You might want to generate thumbnails for your videos and show those thumbnails to the user when he scrolls through the video. </li><li>Or, you might want to compare two videos by doing a side-by-side comparison – this is quite common in video compression research. </li></ol>



<p>FFmpeg offers very simple techniques to extract screenshots or thumbnails at any position of the video (or rather, a way to dump frames at any point you choose). </p>



<p>Let’s see how! </p>




<h2><span id="Single_Screenshot/Thumbnail_Using_frames_v"></span>Single Screenshot/Thumbnail Using <code>-frames:v</code><span></span></h2>



<p>First, let’s understand how to take a single screenshot or thumbnail using FFmpeg. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -ss 00:00:03 -frames:v 1 foobar.jpeg</code></pre>



<p>Understanding this is very simple! Here goes – </p>



<ol><li><code>-ss</code> is the seek command and it can be used to seek to the right position. For accurate seeking, you need to use output seeking and not input seeking (i.e., putting <code>-ss</code> before the input sequence). The syntax for specifying the time is <code>HH:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS</code>. For example, you can tell FFmpeg to seek to&nbsp;<code>01:02:03</code>&nbsp;– i.e., the 3rd second of the 2nd minute of the 1 hour of the movie!</li><li><code>-frames:v 1</code> tells FFmpeg to take only 1 screenshot. Note that, <code>-vframes</code> is deprecated. </li><li>then, you mention the name of the output file (<code>screenshot_10.jpg</code>). </li></ol>



<p>Simple, wasn’t it? Now that you know how to produce a single thumbnail or screenshot, let’s move to the next section where we understand how to create regular or periodic thumbnails.</p>



<h2><span id="Periodic_Screenshot/Thumbnail_with_Resizing"></span>Periodic Screenshot/Thumbnail with Resizing<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is another common use case that FFmpeg can solve easily – <strong>how do you take screenshots/thumbnails at regular intervals, and store them to JPG files after resizing them?</strong></p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that can take care of creating a thumbnail and resizing it for you. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input1080p.mp4 -r 1 -s 1280x720 -f image2 screenshot-%03d.jpg</code></pre>



<p>The <code>-r</code> command sets the output frame rate (=1) and <code>image2</code> is an image file muxer that is used to write video frames to image files. Using the <code>-s 1280x720</code> command, we can resize the video frames before writing them as images. Note, that the input video is a 1920x1080p video.</p>



<p>The above command will take a screenshot every 1 second. The screenshots would be named <code>001</code>, <code>002</code>, etc. because we have specified the formatting as <code>%3d</code>.</p>



<p>However, in my experience, I have found this technique<strong> to be not frame-accurate</strong>.</p>



<p>In the next section, let’s look at a more accurate way of extracting thumbnails. </p>



<h2><span id="Screenshot/Thumbnail_every_10_seconds"></span>Screenshot/Thumbnail every 10 seconds<span></span></h2>



<p>As an extension of the previous section, let’s do a quick exercise and learn how to create a thumbnail every 10 seconds using FFmpeg. </p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -vf "select='not(mod(n,300))',setpts='N/(30*TB)'" -f image2 thumbnail%03d.jpg</code></code></pre>



<p>Here, </p>



<ol><li>we use the <code>select</code> filter to extract a frame if the expression in single-quotes evaluates to non-zero. If the expression is zero, then <code>select</code> filter discards that frame.</li><li><code>mod(A,B)</code>&nbsp;returns the modulus (remainder after division) result after dividing A by B. So, if we divide 0 by 300, we get 0. Then, 1/300 is 1, and so on. </li><li><code>not</code> inverts this result. So, if the modulus is zero, then the final result is <code>1</code>. If the modulus is non-zero, then the result is evaluated to <code>zero</code>. </li><li>Based on this <code>not</code> operation, the <code>select</code> filter picks up a frame. </li></ol>



<p>The sequence I am using has a frame-rate of <code>30 fps</code>. And, I want a frame every 10 seconds. So, I have to choose a frame out of every 300 frames, right? That is why I used <code>select='not(mod(n,300))'</code></p>







<p>Depending on your sequence’s frame-rate, you can modify the command line shown. If you don’t know your video’s frame-rate, you can use <code>ffprobe</code> to find out. </p>



<pre><code>ffprobe -show_entries format=duration globe-with-timestamp.mp4</code></pre>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>There you have it – multiple easy ways to generate thumbnails and screenshots using FFmpeg. You can choose to take single screenshots or periodic ones with a highly frame-accurate technique! </p>

<p><i>After every crisis, some of the uncertainty becomes a part of our new reality. How, then, do you adapt and thrive when change is not a choice but inevitability? Let’s see.</i></p><p>Can you believe that Netflix is over two decades old?</p><p>The company has responded to changes (dot-com crash, global financial crisis, COVID-19) in a manner that in every period it seemed it belonged to those times, and sometimes even ahead of them. This once exclusively DVD-by-mail company started to build a streaming service in the early 2000s when most homes didn’t even have internet with enough bandwidth. Anticipating a shift in technology it sensed well in-advance how the consumption of media would change. The results? It has grown from 10m subscribers in 2010 to more than 160m in 2020.</p><p>We are good at finding solutions for today, but when it comes to the future, it’s human nature to see things in a state of positive permanence. Instinctively we tend to underestimate the likelihood of negative events. And this makes us not so good at preparing for uncertainty, much less manage it.</p><p>Successful businesses prepare for the unknown and use uncertain times as a chance to rethink their working norms. The throes of COVID-19 have sent a reminder for business leaders that continual re-examination of ongoing practices and assumptions is paramount.</p><p><b>Here’s a guide to help business strategists act amid uncertainty – and leverage the times to up their adaptability quotient and position themselves for success. </b></p><h4>Resilience: An Antidote for Business Uncertainty</h4><p>Uncertainty brings outcomes we never predicted or saw coming – whether it be a fire breakout and pipe burst or global pandemic. The problem deepens when you are left in limbo and can’t tell for how long the adversity will last, such as the coronavirus pandemic where businesses are still wondering about the shape and extent of economic recovery, and long-term impact on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/insights">business models</a> and consumer behavior. After all, what do you hold onto when you make plans in uncertainty? </p><p>In such times, resilience can become a valued characteristic for businesses.</p><p>It is not possible for anyone to be fully prepared for the unknown. But resilient organizations learn to expect the unexpected. It helps them rebound more quickly than others and take first-mover advantage of many opportunities that emerge. </p><p>Resilience is not the resistance to change, but one’s ability to embrace change. And be ready for it. It is reflected in how you react to the uncertainty; how fast you bounce back; and in what health do you remain in afterward. Instead of attempting to preserve what worked in the past, resilient leaders push past their fears, brainstorm new ideas, and embrace large-scale disruption. </p><p>In nutshell, resilience is a sign of an organization’s capacity to come back stronger than ever after having been knocked down by uncertainty. </p><p>But, how do you do that? How do you ensure you that adverse situations bend you, and not break you?</p><p>Resilience starts where new perspective meets experience. It is cumulated in how you look at change. </p><p>Finding a way to rise from the ashes requires rewiring your thinking for resilience and reorganize. We suggest three steps to achieve that.</p><p><img src="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/images/survive-adapt.jpg"></p><p> First, make peace with uncertainty. Understand what has changed, what led to it, and the need to get your business back on its foot, instead of staying down and defeated. Then, change your perspective. Swap your question of why this is happening to what it is trying to teach me. Finally, make changes to your present and prepare yourself to better handle the adversity in the future. Focus on growing with new strategies in place.</p><p> Leaders must understand the value of each step for developing resilience in the organization. Those who just rebound and survive may fall into the same trap again when faced with adversity the next time.</p><h4>Ten Sage Advices to Respond to COVID-19 Uncertainty</h4><p> When facts on the ground are incomplete and in flux, what you need to put in place an operational business is experimentation. Develop a culture of responding to uncertainty by rapidly hypothesizing, testing, learning from new trials, and adapting to the models that work. Here are a few actions <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/insights/at-crossroads-taking-a-platform-approach-to-business">global business leaders</a> can take in this pandemic to beat the uncertainty blues and become resilient and agile.</p><ul><li><p><b>Operate with a sense of personal safety.</b> Great leadership is always about emotional connection. In this pandemic, as a primary responsibility, ensure that everyone in your organization is safe, secure, and healthy.</p></li><li><p><b> Achieve a level of business continuity.</b> Being functional, staying afloat, and carrying on is crucial in any uncertainty. Find a way to keep going on. Use virtual medium and collaborative tools. Focus on optimizing continuity thereafter.</p></li><li><p><b> Show signs of life.</b> Make your clients and customers know you are well and available.</p></li><li><p><b>Be less promotional &amp; more comforting in your messaging.</b> You can take either a direct marketing approach or you can be more sensitive by deploying a “hope all is well” campaign and the likes. Instead of a sales pitch, most global leaders are opting to touch base by asking about customers’/clients’ wellbeing and informing them of their availability lest they need their product or services.</p></li><li><p><b>Go multichannel and focus on customer-centricity.</b> Make a zero-tolerance declaration in your organization on any internal silos against customer-centricity. Ensure that your employees imbibe that in customers are the top priority in these times. Furthermore, don’t limit yourself to one channel for communication and operations. Experiment to find one or multiple best channels that best suit your needs.</p></li><li><p><b> Stay away from the herd mentality.</b> What is working for one company may not work for you. Find your new normal as you adapt every day. Mercilessly examine your weaknesses and vulnerabilities to become stronger for the long run. Destruct archaic practices to rebuild.</p></li><li><p><b>Keep a cool head.</b> It’s not uncommon for the dropping numbers to get your nerves. Don’t panic in these situations. It’s needless. Take a step back and see what you are left with. Gratitude for what you have can open a new world of possibilities. Look toward the long-term for more motivation.</p></li><li><p><b> Organize for rapid decision-making.</b> Uncertainty catches one off-guard. If you aren’t prepared, a crisis will overwhelm you. Distribute leadership responsibilities across your organization such that your employees are self-motivated and empowered to make decisions and operate with speed. A large part of this change is to give yourself (as an organization) the permission to be wrong in case things go south.</p></li><li><p><b>Make your offerings relevant to the times.</b> Use the uncertainty to gauge where customers’ propensities lie or would change in the future. Leverage new mediums and products/services of their choice to redesign your offerings and innovate.</p></li><li><p><b>Collaboration is the key to build resilience.</b> Startups are seen as a threat by incumbents, and vice-versa. However, a variety of collaborations between startups and incumbents can help each party survive, adapt, and thrive. Right collaboration would make it easy for both to raise capital, reduce cost, and position for growth. Forge joint ventures, or project-based relationship to come up with disruptive value propositions.</p></li></ul><h4> To Sum</h4><p> What type of leadership does uncertainty demand? The answer lies in resilience and agility. Enduring hard times are about leveraging, and not reacting to the turbulence around you. Lead by preparing your teams and organization to recreate the future with you. Adopt a new perspective to carve new normal, set a new vision, and imbibe new practices.</p><p><b> Business strategists who successfully lead their organizations through uncertainty not only survive, but also shields them from future disruptions by growing their adaptability quotient.</b></p>

  <p><span>03 Oct 2020</span></p><p>Disney Animation’s Moana island dataset is a production-scale scene with memory requirements that make it challenging to render. This post summarizes some of those challenges, and describes how the <a href="https://github.com/chellmuth/gpu-motunui">GPU-Motunui</a> project is able to efficiently render the scene on a consumer-grade GPU with less than 8GB of memory. <a href="#renders">Click here</a> to skip ahead to the results.</p>

<h2 id="the-moana-island">The Moana island</h2>

<p>In 2018, Disney Animation released the Moana island dataset to the rendering research community. Compared to traditional research scenes, the scale of the Moana island scene is massive: the scene contains 90 million quad primitives, 5 million curves, and more than 28 million instances. All told, the island consists of over 15 billion primitives, weighing in at just under 30GB of geometry files.</p>

<p>The shots included with the dataset are beautiful, and showcase the amazing imagery that can be created by combining the best artists in the world with path tracing techniques and modern hardware. Here are two reference images, rendered with Disney’s proprietary Hyperion renderer:</p>

</div>

<h2 id="gpu-motunui-project">GPU-Motunui Project</h2>

<p>The goal of the GPU-Motunui project is to render all the Moana shots efficiently and accurately on a consumer-grade graphics card. There are two main challenges to accomplishing this with the Moana dataset. First, with a typical graphics card having only 8GB of memory, an out-of-core rendering solution is required to handle the large amounts of geometry. Second, the scene’s textures are provided in the Ptex format, and Ptex doesn’t have a publicly available CUDA implementation. This project currently only solves the first problem, and Ptex texture lookup is done on the CPU (although conveniently its cost is fully hidden by being computed concurrently with GPU shadow ray tracing).</p>

<p>The Hyperion reference images are impossible to match exactly; for example the varying brown and green colors along the palm tree fronds in the palmsCam shot are not provided in the dataset. Other features of the scene are possible to render but out of my initial scope, notably subdivision surfaces and their displacement maps, and a full Disney BSDF implementation.</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://www.render-blog.com/assets/hyperion-unique-palmsCam.png" alt="Example of an unreproducible material variation on the palm tree frond"></p><p>Example of an unreproducible material variation on the palm tree frond</p>
</div>

<p>All ray tracing operations are run through Nvidia’s OptiX 7 API. This means GPU-Motunui gets the full benefits of available RT cores and a world-class BVH implementation. The following sections describe how GPU-Motunui maps dataset assets to OptiX data structures, and how GPU-Motunui’s out-of-core rendering solution works.</p>

<h3 id="scene-representation">Scene representation</h3>

<p>The Moana scene makes widespread use of multi-level instancing. In OptiX, this requires a three-level hierarchy of acceleration structures to manage: two levels of IASs, and a base level of GASs (Instance Acceleration Structures and Geometry Acceleration Structures, respectively). GPU-Motunui makes use of OptiX’s AS compaction and relocation APIs to further reduce memory usage.</p>

<p>The isHibiscus element makes a good example of how a typical element in the scene is organized and built. The tree is assembled from a base model in one Wavefront .obj file (containing the trunk and branches), and four primitives: one flower and three leaf models (each with their own .obj file).</p>

<div>

<p>Left: The four simple primitives that will be instanced to fill out the hibiscus tree <br>Right: The base trunk and branches model </p>
</div>

<p>In OptiX, each of these models has an associated GAS, and each GAS can be subdivided into multiple build inputs. Build inputs are used to map sections of the model to information needed at shading time by indexing into OptiX’s shader binding table. These GASs form the bottom level of the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Next, an IAS is used to build the full isHibiscus element. This IAS is in the middle level of the hierarchy. The figure below shows each primitive’s instances in isolation, and combined to make the full element:</p>

<div>

<p>Left: Isolated instances for each primitive<br>Right: Full isHibiscus element</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, a second IAS is built to track all of the element’s instances present in the scene. This second IAS is the top level of the instance hierarchy.</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://www.render-blog.com/assets/isHibiscus-instanced-elements.png" alt="The shotCam view rendered with only isHibiscus instances"></p><p>The shotCam view rendered with only isHibiscus instances</p>
</div>

<p>Although the isHibiscus element has a typical structure, there are some more complicated elements included in the dataset. The isCoral element, for example, has different base geometry and instanced primitives for each of its element instances, but the underlying primitive geometries are shared across all the element instances.</p>

<p>The Moana GAS and IASs alone require 18.5 GB, well past the memory budget of my 8GB RTX 2070. Because OptiX has no native support for out-of-core rendering, the traditional OptiX pipeline had to be put aside for a custom-made solution.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-core-rendering">Out-of-core rendering</h3>

<p>To solve the out-of-core rendering problem, GPU-Motunui divides the scene’s geometry into different sections, and ray traces each separately, while tracking the closest hit. Replacing a traditional device trace call with a host loop comes with many design consequences to the renderer, from asset loading to the core path tracing loop that sends rays through the scene.</p>

<p>Before rendering, the asset loading process allocates a large chunk of GPU memory (currently 6.7GB). A custom allocator is implemented that manages this block of memory. It is responsible for allocating two types of memory: output and temporary. Output memory is allocated from the left of the block, and is used for OptiX structures. Temporary memory is managed on a stack from the right end of the memory block. Managing the temporary memory this way ensures that the output structures are always tightly packed.</p>

<p>After elements are processed into their accelerator structures on the GPU, their used memory is snapshotted onto the host, and the allocator is cleared. The process is repeated until all of the scene’s geometry is processed, resulting in the host managing a list of GPU memory snapshots. The figure below shows an example layout of GPU memory that could be snapshotted:</p>

<div>
  <p>GPU memory layout after loading the isHibiscus element.<br>(Dotted arrows show that an IAS holds instances of the pointed-at AS)</p>

</div>

<p>As mentioned above, when it comes time to ray trace, each snapshot is processed in a loop. This means a call to <code>cudaMemcpy</code> and <code>optixLaunch</code> for each snapshot. A global buffer is maintained that indicates the depth of the current closest intersection. This value is used as the <code>tmax</code> parameter for the CUDA kernel’s call to <code>optixTrace</code>, and a successful intersection will update the depth buffer for the next launch.</p>

<p>In a traditional OptiX path tracer, the entire render loop can run in device code inside a single call to <code>optixLaunch</code>; i.e., a successful intersection will lead to more BSDF and shadow rays being traced in the same kernel launch. Because GPU-Motunui’s design mandates multiple launches for tracing each path segment, the render loop is pulled out into host code. While this potentially diminishes OptiX’s ability to efficiently schedule program execution, it also opens up opportunties for optimization, such as running Ptex texture lookups on the CPU concurrently with GPU kernels and I/O.</p>

<h3 id="shading">Shading</h3>
<p>As with any OptiX application, GPU-Motunui makes use of the shader binding table (SBT). SBT records contain pointers to normal buffers and material attributes. The underlying data for the normal buffers is stored alongside OptiX acceleration structures and included in geometry snapshots. This ensures that GPU memory is never wasted on unreachable normal buffer data.</p>

<h2 id="renders">Renders</h2>
<p>Included below are GPU-Motunui renders of the six scenes included in the dataset. shotCam is the slowest to render at 18.2 seconds per sample at 1024x429 resolution, and took just over five hours total for the final image. All shots are 1024spp, capped at a maximum of five bounces, and were run on an Nvidia RTX 2070.</p>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>The initial implementation of the renderer required 42.6 seconds per 1spp on the shotCam scene. A few optimizations combined to make significant reductions in rendering time, cutting each pass down to 18.2 seconds (a 57.3% reduction).</p>

<h4 id="cpugpu-concurrency">CPU/GPU concurrency</h4>
<p>Tracing shadow rays on the GPU in parallel with Ptex lookups on the CPU cut rendering time by 23.4%. It was disappointing to be forced to do texture lookups on the CPU, but the time savings make up for it.</p>

<h4 id="multiple-ptex-caches">Multiple Ptex caches</h4>
<p>Parallelizing the Ptex lookups and using multiple Ptex caches eliminated texture lookups as a bottleneck to the system; shadow ray casting time fully dominates the texture lookup. Empirically, spawning two threads per core (totaling 12 on an Intel i7-8700K) and sharing three Ptex caches comfortably reduced the texture lookup time beneath the shadow ray budget. This improved the time savings to a 33.9% reduction over the baseline.</p>

<h4 id="pinned-memory">Pinned memory</h4>
<p>The acceleration structure snapshots are all saved to pinned host memory. Switching from normal to pinned host memory increased the transfer throughput from 7.73 GB/s to 11.84 GB/s, cutting the baseline render time by 19.5%.</p>

<h2 id="future-steps">Future Steps</h2>
<p>Getting this scene running on my RTX 2070 card was a very fun and rewarding project, but there are still many improvements to be made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implementing the Disney BSDF</li>
  <li>Rendering subdivision surfaces along with displacement mapping</li>
  <li>More efficiently packing the acceleration structures, and optimizing ray tracing throughput</li>
  <li>Experimenting with how various research results hold up on production scenes (e.g., testing select path guiding techniques)</li>
</ul>

Although <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> is a strong choice if you have paying subscribers, it is impossible to beat static hosting for a simple blog. Static sites are fast, secure, and free.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of my reasoning and approach - from editing in Ghost's world-class UI to deploying for free on a static hosting provider like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>I was looking for a blogging solution that met these requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Slick UI:</strong> Even though I use vim and markdown daily, I prefer a Medium-like freeform writing experience.</li><li><strong>Self-hosted: </strong>Full control of my content with no vendor lock-in, paywalls, or subscription pop-ups.</li><li><strong>High availability:</strong> I should never receive a monitoring alert for my personal blog.</li><li><strong>Exceptional performance:</strong> I want the page to load fast!</li><li><strong>Secure and low-maintenance:</strong> After supporting dozens of WordPress sites over more than a decade, I have grown weary of hacked plugins and frequent patching cycles.</li></ul><h2 id="static-ghost-io-">Static Ghost.io 👻</h2><p>Even though I use markdown every day in my work, I prefer the WYSIWYG writing experience of a web UI. Ghost's UI is fantastic!</p><figure><img src="https://www.nedmcclain.com/content/images/2020/10/nm_ghost.png"></figure><p>The main drawback of Ghost is the same as WordPress: every request depends on a database. Each time a user visits a page on the site, the following steps take place:</p><ol><li>The web server passes the end user's request to a running application server (Node.js for Ghost, PHP for WordPress).</li><li>The application server analyzes the incoming request and dispatches requests to the database for necessary content (MySQL for Ghost).</li><li>The application server renders the content from the database into a web page.</li><li>The web server passes the resulting page back to the end user.</li></ol><p>This architecture requires significant compute and memory resources on both the application server and database server. &nbsp;It is susceptible to performance issues due to spikes in demand. And achieving high availability requires a database cluster and web load balancer. Lots of distinct parts to deploy, secure, and operate.</p><p>The advent of the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> architecture has brought static sites into the limelight. By moving steps 2 and 3 <strong>to the beginning</strong>, Ghost can generate each page on the site <strong>in advance</strong>. Then, it's easy to upload the static site to a free or almost-free hosting provider (see below for suggestions).</p><blockquote>Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers. - JAMstack</blockquote><p>Static sites have a significantly smaller attack surface than sites driven by databases and application code. Bugs, vulnerabilities, and build issues can be identified by the build phase, rather than when the site is live. </p><p>You get the rich editing of Ghost while enjoying all of the operational and cost advantages of a static JAM site:</p><ul><li>Never worry about scaling when traffic spikes.</li><li>Never apply a critical security patch at midnight.</li><li>Who cares if your Ghost database is temporarily down?</li></ul><h2 id="making-ghost-static">Making Ghost Static</h2><p>First, setup a <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/setup/">private Ghost instance</a> to use for editing, formatting, and peer review. This can be a very small VM, since it doesn't have to serve any production traffic. Defying traditional best-practices, it's even safe to co-locate MySQL on the same system! <a href="https://valet.ghost.org/">Ghost(Valet)</a> is very reasonably priced if you need a hand with this step.</p><p>You can secure access to this system with a firewall or VPN. A better approach is to use an authentication proxy like <a href="https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy">oauth2-proxy</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium">pomerium</a> for a user-friendly, "zero trust" solution.</p><p>Then, use Ghost Static Site Generator (<code>gssg</code>) &nbsp;to create a static mirror of the site that is hosted by Netlify:</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator"><div><p>Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator</p><p>Generate a static site from ghost and deploy using a CI - Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator</p><p><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"><span>GitHub</span></p></div><p><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19606031?s=400&amp;v=4"></p></a></figure><p><code>gssg</code> will spider your local Ghost site, creating a fully static copy.

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>So first off a personal update – last year, I got laid off the day I returned from maternity leave! Within a half hour of returning to my desk! Whew boy! It was a blessing in disguise in some ways, because 1) I’d been thinking for some time I could be more effective in a consulting role and 2) as part of my severance package, I got to attend a General Assembly coding bootcamp.</p>

<p>I ended up auditing the bootcamp because wow, it demands a ton of sacrifice with the end goal of getting a developer job. In contrast, I am happy to do a bit of scripting on the side, work with developers, and improve their experiences. Nonetheless, I worked through all the lectures, did a few homework assignments, and got a lot out of it. Not the least of which is that I validated my existing coding skills, gained deeper insight into the “junior developer” persona, and reaffirmed my conviction that tailoring your developer experience and docs to junior developers is a <strong>Good Thing</strong>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of big takeaways I’d like to share:</p>

<h3 id="everyone-is-a-junior-developer">Everyone is a junior developer</h3>

<p>Well, no, not actually … but every developer has to learn new concepts.  And yes, of course, as you gain experience as a developer, “totally new” concepts get rarer and rarer. Still, there’s a lot of learning:</p>

<p>Some developers must learn a breakneck pace (think of all the Javascript frameworks coming out all the time! Those front-end folks have to sprint just to stay in place). Others face big disruptions to their coding world only occasionally (your Enterprise Java programmer with a 20 year career in monolithic app development who now lives in a brave new world of microservices, CI/CD, devops, oh my!)</p>

<p>I felt I experienced this disruption myself as part of the coding bootcamp. Up till then, my background was in writing Python scripts, and in documenting big Java applications in a analytics microservices context. I knew about RedHat, Docker, Kubernetes, Spark, Lucene, Cassandra, etc.</p>

<p>Now, I was learning about a whole new world: the ecosystems, the mindset, the business of ….  JavaScript.  Like probably many people outside the JavaScript world, I was fooled by the “script” part of the name – especially since I’d only used JavaScript myself to write macros in an XML docs tool.  Now I realize it’s <a href="https://www.javaworld.com/article/2886368/java-vs-nodejs-an-epic-battle-for-developer-mindshare.html">epic battle</a> between Java and JavaScript. And while I haven’t fallen in love (Python, you still have my heart), I had lots of “oh, that’s neat!” moments. I also recognized that my learning curve was not dissimilar to that of experienced – but JavaScript-naïve – developers.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my main point:</p>

<h3 id="we-should-all-design-for-the-junior-developer">We should all design for the junior developer</h3>

<p>Creating experiences with a junior developer in mind forces you to discard your comfy assumption that everyone’s drunk your product Kool-aid. If you assume you’re writing for someone who’s technically savvy and can learn quickly, but who knows nothing about your world, you’re positioning yourself to vastly decrease your developer onboarding friction. And if you assume that your “junior developer” is super impatient because they have, like, 10 other things on the docket to learn about, then you’ll learn to answer up front the question: “why should I care? Why should I do this work?”</p>

<p>It’s a fine line to tread, assuming not too much about technical knowledge, but also not coming across as condescending or silly (like, at the level of “open a terminal by taking the following steps…”). Still, I think it’s actually quite achievable. For example, it’s quite low effort to provide high-level context for coding instructions. Even something as simple as “Clone this repository and open a terminal at the local directory location” is a direction that often gets left out in GitHub readmes…but it really shouldn’t be left out.  And it never hurts to link to frameworks’ getting started guides, even if you don’t want to provide the details yourself. At the very least, no one is likely to roll their eyes at it, and it helps your reader understand what level of granularity your instructions will provide.</p>

<p>When I look for inspiration, I think the <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">React newbie tutorials</a> do an outstanding job of introducing junior developers to React, helping them understand why they should care, and explicitly stating their audience. I also really love (who doesn’t) the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register">Stripe developer onboarding</a> experience.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think I came away from the coding bootcamp more confident that I <em>am</em> a junior developer. And while I’d never make the classic UX mistake of thinking I am the user, still – my confusions, my pain points in learning about a product– these are things that other developers likely share.</p>

<h3 id="postscript-fun-with-javascript">Postscript: Fun with Javascript!</h3>

<p>I’ll end on another personal note. The coding bootcamp turned out to be quite serendipitous, because I took on contracting work that immediately benefited from my new knowledge. I’d just learned about Express, and now here I was, entering a pull request to change the authentication method for an Express server. I’d just learned about React, and now here I was, wading into a web UI to change some text. It’s always nice when you can put what you’ve learned to immediate use.</p>

<p>
Somewhere in the concrete canyons of New York City a
recently formed rock group is using the name Jim Jones and
the Suicides. Irreverent and disarming, the name reflects
the new trend in punk rock, to take social issues head on.
Cynicism about the Jonestown deaths and its social
parallels abound in the lyrics of today's music. The
messages are clear because we all know the story.

</p><div><p>
In fact, people today recognize the name "Jonestown"
more than any other event, a full 98% of the population.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn1">1</a>]</span>
The television and printed media were filled with the news
for more than a year, even though the tale read like
something from the <i>National Enquirer</i> tabloid. But
despite all the coverage, the reality of Jonestown and the
reasons behind the bizarre events remain a mystery. The
details have faded from memory for most of us since
November 18, 1978, but not the outlines. Think back a
moment and you'll remember.

<br>
<a name="p1">
</a></p><p>

<b>
<span face="arial,helvetica">
You Know the Official Version
</span>
</b></p></div><p>
A fanatic religious leader in California led a
multiracial community into the jungles of remote Guyana to
establish a socialist utopia. The People's Temple, his
church, was in the heart of San Francisco and drew poor
people, social activists, Blacks and Hispanics, young and
old. The message was racial harmony and justice, and
criticism of the hypocrisy of the world around his
followers.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn2">2</a>]</span>

</p><p>
The Temple rose in a vacuum of leadership at the end of
an era.  The political confrontations of the 60s were
almost over, and religious cults and "personal
transformation" were on the rise. Those who had preached a
similar message on the political soap box were gone, burnt
out, discredited, or dead. The counter-culture had
apparently degenerated into drugs and violence. Charlie
Manson was the only visible image of the period. Suddenly,
religion seemed to offer a last hope.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn3">3</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Even before they left for the Jonestown site, the
People's Temple members were subjects of local scandal in
the news.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn4">4</a>]</span> Jim Jones claimed these exposés were
attacks on their newly-found religion, and used them as an
excuse to move most of the members to Guyana.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn5">5</a>]</span> But
disturbing reports continued to surround Jones, and soon
came to the attention of congressional members like Leo
Ryan. Stories of beatings, kidnapping, sexual abuse and
mysterious deaths leaked out in the press.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn6">6</a>]</span> Ryan decided
to go to Guyana and investigate the situation for himself.
The nightmare began.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn7">7</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Isolated on the tiny airstrip at Port Kaituma, Ryan and
several reporters in his group were murdered. Then came the
almost unbelievable "White Night," a mass suicide pact of
the Jonestown camp. A community made up mostly of Blacks
and women drank cyanide from paper cups of <i>Kool-Aid</i>,
adults and children alike died and fell around the main
pavilion. Jones himself was shot in the head, an apparent
suicide. For days, the body count mounted, from 400 to
nearly 1,000. The bodies were flown to the United States
and later cremated or buried in mass graves.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn8">8</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Temple member Larry Layton is still facing charges of
conspiracy in Ryan's murder. Ryan was recently awarded a
posthumous Medal of Honor, and was the first Congress
member to die in the line of duty.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn9">9</a>]</span>

</p><div><p>
Pete Hammill called the corpses "all the loose change
of the sixties."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn10">10</a>]</span> The effect was electric. Any
alternative to the current system was seen as futile, if
not deadly. Protest only led to police riots and political
assassination. Alternative life styles and drugs led to
"creepy-crawly" communes and violent murders.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn11">11</a>]</span> And
religious experiments led to cults and suicide. Social
utopias were dreams that turned into nightmares. The
television urged us to go back to "The Happy Days" of the
apolitical 50s. The message was, get a job, and go back to
church.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn12">12</a>]</span> The unyielding nuclear threat generated only
nihilism and hopelessness. There was no answer but death,
no exit from the grisly future. The new ethic was personal
success, aerobics, material consumption, a return to
"American values," and the "moral majority" white Christian
world.  The official message was clear.

<b>
<span face="arial,helvetica">
But Just Suppose 
<br>
It Didn't Happen That Way...
</span>
</b></p></div><p>
The headlines the day of the massacre read: "Cult Dies
in South American Jungle: 400 Die in Mass Suicide, 700 Flee
into Jungle."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn13">13</a>]</span> By all accounts in the press, as well as
People's Temple statements there were at least 1,100 people
at Jonestown.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn14">14</a>]</span> There were 809 adult passports found
there, and reports of 300 children (276 found among the
dead, and 210 never identified). The headline figures from
the first day add to the same number: 1,100.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn15">15</a>]</span>
The original body count done by the Guyanese was 408, and this figure
was initially agreed to by U.S. Army authorities on
site.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn16">16</a>]</span>
However, over the next few days, the total of reported dead began to
rise quickly. The Army made a series of misleading and openly false
statements about the discrepancy. The new total, which was the official
final count, was given almost a week later by American authorities as
913.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn17">17</a>]</span>
A total of 16 survivors were reported to have returned to the
U.S.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn18">18</a>]</span> Where were the others?

</p><p>
At their first press conference, the Americans claimed
that the Guyanese "could not count." These local people had
carried out the gruesome job of counting the bodies, and
later assisted American troops in the process of poking
holes in the flesh lest they explode from the gasses of
decay.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn19">19</a>]</span> Then the Americans proposed another theory --
they had missed seeing a pile of bodies at the back of the
pavilion. The structure was the size of a small house, and
they had been at the scene for days.  Finally, we were
given the official reason for the discrepancy -- bodies had
fallen on top of other bodies, adults covering
children.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn20">20</a>]</span>

</p><p>
It was a simple, if morbid, arithmetic that led to the
first suspicions. The 408 bodies discovered at first count
would have to be able to cover 505 bodies for a total of
913. In addition, those who first worked on the bodies
would have been unlikely to miss bodies lying beneath each
other since each body had to be punctured. Eighty-two of
the bodies first found were those of children, reducing the
number that could have been hidden below others.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn21">21</a>]</span> A
search of nearly 150 photographs, aerial and close-up,
fails to show even one body lying under another, much less
500.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn22">22</a>]</span>

</p><p>
It seemed the first reports were true, 400 had died,
and 700 had fled to the jungle. The American authorities
claimed to have searched for people who had escaped, but
found no evidence of any in the surrounding area.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn23">23</a>]</span> At
least a hundred Guyanese troops were among the first to
arrive, and they were ordered to search the jungle for
survivors.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn24">24</a>]</span> In the area, at the same time, British Black
Watch troops were on "training exercises," with nearly 600
of their best-trained commandos. Soon, American Green
Berets were on site as well.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn25">25</a>]</span> The presence of these
soldiers, specially trained in covert killing operations,
may explain the increasing numbers of bodies that
appeared.

</p><p>
Most of the photographs show the bodies in neat rows,
face down. There are few exceptions. Close shots indicate
drag marks, as though the bodies were positioned by someone
after death.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn26">26</a>]</span> Is it possible that the 700 who fled were
rounded up by these troops, brought back to Jonestown and
added to the body count?<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn27">27</a>]</span>

</p><p>
If so, the bodies would indicate the cause of death. A
new word was coined by the media, "suicide-murder." But
which was it?<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn28">28</a>]</span> Autopsies and forensic science are a
developing art. The detectives of death use a variety of
scientific methods and clues to determine how people die,
when they expire, and the specific cause of death. Dr.
Mootoo, the top Guyanese pathologist, was at Jonestown
within hours after the massacre. Refusing the assistance of
U.S. pathologists, he accompanied the teams that counted
the dead, examined the bodies, and worked to identify the
deceased. While the American press screamed about the
"Kool-Aid Suicides," Dr. Mootoo was reaching a much
different opinion.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn29">29</a>]</span>

</p><p>
There are certain signs that show the types of poisons
that lead to the end of life. Cyanide blocks the messages
from the brain to the muscles by changing body chemistry in
the central nervous system. Even the "involuntary"
functions like breathing and heartbeat get mixed neural
signals. It is a painful death, breath coming in spurts.
The other muscles spasm, limbs twist and contort. The
facial muscles draw back into a deadly grin, called
"cyanide rictus."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn30">30</a>]</span> All these telling signs were absent
in the Jonestown dead. Limbs were limp and relaxed, and the
few visible faces showed no sign of distortion.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn31">31</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Instead, Dr. Mootoo found fresh needle marks at the
back of the left shoulder blades of 80-90% of the
victims.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn32">32</a>]</span> Others had been shot or strangled. One
survivor reported that those who resisted were forced by
armed guards.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn33">33</a>]</span> The gun that reportedly shot Jim Jones
was lying nearly 200 feet from his body, not a likely
suicide weapon.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn34">34</a>]</span> As Chief Medical Examiner, Mootoo's
testimony to the Guyanese grand jury investigating
Jonestown led to their conclusion that all but three of the
people were murdered by "persons unknown." Only two had
committed suicide they said.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn35">35</a>]</span> Several pictures show the
gun-shot wounds on the bodies as well.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn36">36</a>]</span> The U.S. Army
spokesman, Lt. Col. Schuler, said, "No autopsies are
needed. The cause of death is not an issue here." The
forensic doctors who later did autopsies at Dover,
Delaware, were never made aware of Dr. Mootoo's
findings.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn37">37</a>]</span>

</p><p>
There are other indications that the Guyanese
government participated with American authorities in a
cover-up of the real story, despite their own findings. One
good example was Guyanese Police Chief Lloyd Barker, who
interfered with investigations, helped "recover" 2.5
million for the Guyanese government, and was often the
first to officially announce the cover stories relating to
suicide, body counts and survivors.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn38">38</a>]</span> Among the first to
the scene were the wife of Guyanese Prime …</p></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

October 19, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I've been using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a> for ~4 months worth of side projects, including a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus/tree">toy text editor</a> and an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/imp">interpreter for a relational language</a>. I've written ~10kloc.</p>
<p>That's not nearly enough time to form a coherent informed opinion. So instead here is an incoherent assortment of thoughts and experiences, in no particular order :)</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an introduction to zig - check out the excellent <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">language docs</a> or the new <a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> instead. I'll try to focus instead on things that are not immediately obvious from reading intro material.</p>
<p>The obvious point of comparison is to rust. For context, I've been using rust <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/three-months-of-rust/">since 2015</a>. Mostly in research positions writing throwaway code, but also ~14 months working on <a href="https://materialize.io/">a commercial database</a> which is ~100kloc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig is dramatically simpler than rust. It took a few days before I felt proficient vs a month or more for rust.</p>
<p>Most of this difference is <strong>not</strong> related to lifetimes. Rust has patterns, traits, dyn, modules, declarative macros, procedural macros, derive, associated types, annotations, cfg, cargo features, turbofish, autoderefencing, deref coercion etc. I encountered most of these in the first week. Just understanding how they all work is a significant time investment, let alone learning when to use each and how they affect the available design space.</p>
<p>I still haven't internalized the full rule-set of rust enough to be able predict whether a design in my head will successfully compile. I don't remember the order in which methods are resolved during autoderefencing, or how module visibility works, or how the type system determines if one impl might <a href="https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#what-are-the-orphan-rules">overlap another or be an orphan</a>. There are frequent moments where I know what I want the machine to do but struggle to encode it into traits and lifetimes.</p>
<p>Zig manages to provide many of the same features with a single mechanism - compile-time execution of regular zig code. This comes will all kinds of pros and cons, but one large and important pro is that I already know how to write regular code so it's easy for me to just write down the thing that I want to happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the key differences between zig and rust is that when writing a generic function, rust will prove that the function is type-safe for every possible value of the generic parameters. Zig will prove that the function is type-safe only for each parameter that you actually call the function with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this allows zig to make use of arbitrary compile-time logic where rust has to restrict itself to structured systems (traits etc) about which it can form general proofs. This in turn allows zig a great deal of expressive power and also massively simplifies the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't type-check zig libraries which contain generics. We can only type-check specific uses of those libraries.</p>

}
</span></pre>
<p>This means zig also doesn't get the automatic, machine-checked documentation of type constraints that rust benefits from and may face more challenges providing IDE support.</p>
<p>This might harm the zig ecosystem by making it harder to compose various libraries. But <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a> has a similar model and in practice it has worked very well (<a href="https://youtu.be/dmWQtI3DFFo?t=1710">eg</a>, <a href="https://www.oxinabox.net/2020/02/09/whycompositionaljulia.html">eg</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig's comptime allows expressing <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">open multiple dispatch</a> as a library.</p>
<p>It should be relatively trivial to implement specialization the same way, which has been a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">work in progress</a> in rust for years and is critical to many optimizations in julia's math libraries.</p>
<p>Julia chose dynamic typing because it's very difficult to encode the types of various mathematical operations into a general schema (eg fortress <a href="https://youtu.be/EZD3Scuv02g?t=3011">struggled with this</a>). Zig's approach of not requiring general schemas but still type-checking individual cases may be an interesting sweet spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1350.html">2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses</a> to get a sense of the relative frequency of different causes of memory unsafety.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming that the zig programmer is using release-safe mode instead of the unfortunately named release-fast mode which disables all runtime safety checks.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-bounds Write (787/1350)</li>
<li>Out-of-bounds Read (125/1350)</li>
<li>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (119/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages primarily use bounds-checked slices and relegate pointer arithmetic to a separate type (<code>*T</code> in rust, <code>[*]T</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>NULL Pointer Dereference (476/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages require explicit annotations for nulls (<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> in rust, <code>?T</code> in zig) and require code to either handle the null case or safely crash on null (<code>x.unwrap()</code> in rust, <code>x.?</code> in zig).</p>
<p>Dereferencing/casting a null c pointer is undefined behavior in both languages, but is checked at runtime in zig.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer Overflow or Wraparound (190/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust catches overflow in debug and wraps in release. Zig catches overflow in debug/release-safe and leaves behavior undefined in release-fast.</p>
<p>Both languages allow explicitly asking for wraparound (<code>x.wrapping_add(1)</code> in rust, <code>x +% 1</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use After Free (416/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as all unsafe code obeys the aliasing and lifetime rules, rust protects completely against UAF.</p>
<p>Zig has little protection. The recently merged
<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/575fbd5e3592cff70cbfc5153884d919e6bed89f/lib/std/heap/general_purpose_allocator.zig">GeneralPurposeAllocator</a> avoids reusing memory regions (which prevents freed data from being overwritten) and reusing pages (which means that UAF will eventually result in a page fault). But this comes at the cost of fragmentation and lower performance and it also won't provide protection for child allocators using the GPA as a backing allocator.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both languages will insert implicit casts between primitive types and pointers whenever it is safe to do so, and require explicit casts otherwise. (With the odd exception that rust will not implicitly upcast numbers).</p>
<p>Both languages support generics which almost entirely avoids the need to cast void pointers.</p>
<hr>
<p>In rust the Send/Sync traits flag types which are safe to move/share across threads. In the absence of unsafe code it should be impossible to cause data races.</p>
<p>Zig has no comparable protection. It's possible to implement the same logic as Send/Sync in comptime zig, but without the ability to track ownership the rules would have to be much more restrictive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rust prevents having multiple mutable references to the same memory region at the same time.</p>
<p>This means that eg iterator invalidation is prevented at compile time, because the borrow checker won't allow mutating a data-structure while an iterator is holding a reference to the data-structure. Similarly for resizing a data-structure while holding a reference to the old allocation. Both examples are easy sources of UAF in zig.</p>
<hr>
<p>Neither language is able to produce stack traces for stack overflows at the moment (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51405">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1616">zig</a>)</p>
<p>In the future zig is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1006">intended</a> to statically check the maximum stack usage of your program and force recursive code to explicitly allocate space on the heap, so that stack overflows produce a recoverable OutOfMemory error rather than a crash.</p>
<p>This is not an academic problem - I've seen real-world crashes from recursive tree transformations in compilers (<a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/3996">eg</a>) and it's often painful to write the same logic without recursion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Undefined behavior in rust is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/what-unsafe-does.html">here</a>. It's worth noting that breaking the aliasing rules in unsafe rust can cause undefined behavior but these rules are not yet well-defined. So far this hasn't caused me any problems but it is a little unnerving.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> is an interpreter for rusts Mid-level Intermediate Representation which will detect many (but not all) cases of undefined behavior in unsafe rust. It's far too slow to use for the whole materialize test suite but was useful for unit-testing an unsafe module.</p>
<p>Undefined behavior in zig is defined <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior">here</a>. This list is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1966">probably incomplete</a> given that the core language is still under development.</p>
<p>Zig <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2301">aspires</a> to insert runtime checks for almost all undefined behavior when compiling in debug mode. So far all the easy cases are handled, which is already a dramatic improvement over c.</p>
<p>Zigs compile-time partial evaluation is done by an IR interpreter - it seems plausible that this could also be used as a miri-like tool in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>@import</code> takes a path to a file and turns the whole file into a struct. So modules are just structs. And vice-versa - if you have a large struct declaration you can move it into a file to reduce the indentation.</p>
<p>Zig doesn't care at all where you put files on the filesystem.</p>
<p><code>@import</code> is part of the compile-time execution system so things like platform-specific modules and configurable features can be specified in regular code rather than rust's limited set of <code>#[cfg(...)]</code> macros.</p>
<hr>
<p>Array, struct, enum and union literals can be anonymous - <code>.{.Constant = 1.0}</code> is an anonymous union with it's own type, but can be implicitly cast to any union with a <code>Constant: f64</code> field because they share the same structure.</p>
<p>In rust my code is littered with <code>use Expr::*</code> and I'm careful to avoid name collisions between different enums that I might want to import in the same functions. In zig I just use anonymous literals everywhere and don't worry about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anonymous literals are also nice when using structs to simulate keyword arguments. No need to find and import the correct type:</p>
<pre><span>fn do_things(config: struct {
  max_things: usize = 1000, // default value
  flavor: Flavor,
}) void {
  ...
}

do_things(.{.flavor = .Strawberry});
</span></pre>
<hr>
<p>There is a pattern that shows up a lot in the materialize codebase:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> constant </span><span>= </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(constant) </span><span>=</span><span> expr { constant } </span><span>else </span><span>{ </span><span>panic!</span><span>() }</span><span>;
</span></pre>
<p>It's common enough that many types have methods like <code>expr.unwrap_constant()</code>.</p>
<p>In zig:</p>
<pre><span>const constant = expr.Constant;
</span></pre>
<p>A similar pattern is:</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(</span><span>_</span><span>) </span><span>=</span><span> expr {
        </span><span>...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></pre>
<p>Again, many types get methods like <code>expr.is_constant()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> expr</span><span>.</span><span>is_constant</span><span>(…</span></pre></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For better onboarding retention, get users to add value to your product as quickly as possible.</p><p>How?</p><h2>1. Create shortcuts to show only the relevant information (screen by preferences).</h2><p>Spotify asks users to select their favorite artists instead of going to dashboard:</p><figure id="w-node-213b4e788a3d-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8809c116cb645d12bb4594_spotify-onboarding.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you are a SaaS&nbsp;company that sells form building software, you could for example, ask what type of form the person is looking to create, then based on that selection provide an appropriate form template. This helps the user accomplish their task more quickly and they are more likely to stick with you after they've seen the value of your product.</p><h2>2. Take out unnecessary steps or save them for after the user has added value.</h2><p>SproutSocial does this well by instantly prompting to connect to social media accounts FIRST, and only then asking for additional information.</p><figure id="w-node-7da55c5c0f57-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f880ef541456e5a30b5034b_SproutSocial%20Additional%20Connections.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>First the user is asked to connect their social profiles (this instantly populates their dashboard with valuable insights)</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-ac84d3ff6921-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f880272ff20a95ceb04363c_sproutsocial.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Then the user is asked to answer some questions that will help SproutSocial segment their audience. Notice how there were no massive forms to fill out - this is key.</figcaption></figure><h2>3. Try checklists which encourage user to take small steps to engage with your product or add their own value.</h2><p>There are all sorts of ways to present this (header notice, widget, embedded, welcome email)</p><figure id="w-node-ef9c31814aa4-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88028112b0af3c3a1e504b_checklist.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. Gamify with progression. Start them off with some steps already completed.</h2><p>If you are already using a checklist in your app's dashboard, you can start them off with some progress already made so that the user doesn't feel like they are starting from zero. </p><p>For example, you can cross off an item they've already completed (see above screenshot). </p><p>You could start them off at 20% instead of 0% when it comes to completing various steps to get to the "aha" moment of your product.</p><p>In multi-step onboarding you could visually indicate that the first step is already finished (presumably the 1st click to the form).</p><h2>5. Assist with templates - so user only has to modify contents.</h2><p><a href="http://pory.io/">Pory.io</a> is great at this. Instead of just dropping you off to let you figure out the tool on your own, they provide you with starting templates.</p><figure id="w-node-129cbdb09480-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8802a8b78d93b942995c83_Pory.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If templates do not apply, you could add placeholder content so people know how to edit and where to start. Templates are a great way to get people to skip all the busy work of starting from scratch and provide a semi-finished starting point. </p><p>Canva does an excellent job by allowing people to select an asset they wish to create, and present fully-designed examples that only require some tweaking.</p><h2>6. If integrating with other tools, show personalized how-to videos specific to the integration.</h2><p>Most SaaS&nbsp;companies add their integration instructions in support documents. If the user has to leave your dashboard and hunt down support docs, they could just as easily go do something else. </p><p>By providing relevant integration videos within the dashboard, you keep the user engaged and more likely to finish the setup.</p><p>Memberstack provides a handy Webflow integration tutorial for people who are building in Webflow.<br></p><figure id="w-node-b21132cc9f9c-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8802dd24f28319c733480d_memberstack.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>7. Try adding integrations into the onboarding flow after they've already created an account</h2><p>If your tool or app integrates with other popular platforms, consider adding those integrations into the onboarding flow. </p><p>You often see companies have an "integrations" tab or section in their app, but very few add those to onboarding. </p><p>We can bypass the standard behavior and ask the user to integrate with a popular tool in a multi-step onboarding process. They have the option to skip, but once they add a one or two click connection, they are more likely to get hooked or have a chance to expose your product to everyone at their company.</p><h2>8. Reward with points and prizes if appropriate.</h2><p>Duolingo gives users virtual "lingots" which encourage user to keep going in order to collect enough to spend them.</p><figure id="w-node-ef0778b73aac-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8803008701da7f3ec23ae7_duolingo-lingots.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>9. Provide the benefit of your product first, then ask user to create an account to save their work</h2><p><a href="http://priar.io/">Priar.io</a> does this by letting you preview their product with YOUR content before hitting "Generate link" to create an account.</p><figure id="w-node-6eeed1f77289-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88032af52d301ff3d87f39_piar.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>10. If product benefits from multiple people using it, prompt user to invite those people.</h2><p>BetterUptime prompts you to invite your colleagues as additional users:</p><figure id="w-node-3a1237c05f92-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88034b16cb640d52bb33e6_better-uptime.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>11. Gift them with an upgraded version of their selected price tier, or gift full access.</h2><p>Netflix does this well by offering a free upgrade at the time of the trial.</p><figure id="w-node-ecd982c93506-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8803bff7e683308565cef1_41.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure></div></div>]]>

                <div><p>Ants are one of the most successful groups of animals on the planet, occupying anywhere from temperate soil to tropical rainforests, desert dunes and kitchen counters. They’re social insects and their team-working abilities have long since been identified as one of the key factors leading to their success. Ants are famously able to lift or drag objects many times their own weight and transport these objects back to their colony. But with previous research having focused on the social aspects of an ant colony, looking at an individual ant has been somewhat neglected. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) and Sorbonne University in Paris have investigated why individual worker ants are so strong by taking X-ray images and creating 3D models of their thorax – the central unit of their bodies – to analyze their muscles and internal skeleton. <a href="https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12983-020-00375-9" target="_blank">Their study, published in<em> Frontiers in Zoology</em></a>, examines the hypothesis that loss of flight in worker ants is directly connected to the evolution of greater strength.</p>

<p>“Worker ants evolved from flying insects,” said Professor Evan Economo, who leads OIST’s <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/bbu" target="_blank">Biodiversity and Biocomplexity Unit</a>. “We’ve always assumed that losing flight helped to optimize their bodies for working on the ground, but we have much to learn about how this is achieved.”</p>

<p>Being able to fly might be a common dream amongst people but the reality of flight is that it puts strong constraints on the build of a body. In flying insects, the wing muscles occupy a major part of the thorax – sometimes more than 50%. This means that other muscles, which are used to support and move the head, legs, and abdomen are constrained and squeezed up against the exoskeleton.</p>

<p>But once the constraints of flight are removed, all that space in the thorax is open, which, the researchers surmised, would allow the remaining muscles to expand and reorganize.</p>

<p>Previous research in this area had focused on the external structure of ants but, with the technology available at OIST, the researchers were able to gain a highly detailed picture of what was going on inside the thorax. The aim was to analyze the general features common across all ants, rather than focus on the specialization of certain species. To do this, the researchers did a detailed analysis of two distantly related ant species, including both the wingless workers and the flying queens, and confirmed their findings across a broader sample of species.</p>

          <p>Both workers and queens (larger and with wings) are shown in the image above.</p>

          </div>
  </div>
  </div>

<p>They used advanced X-ray technology to scan the internal and external anatomy, like CT scans used in a hospital, but at much higher resolution. From these scans, the researchers mapped all the different muscles and modeled them in 3D. The result was a comprehensive image of the inside of the thorax. They then compared findings from these two species to a range of other ants and wingless insects.</p>

<p>As predicted, the researchers found that loss of flight had allowed for clear-cut reorganization of the thorax. “Within the worker ant’s thorax, everything is integrated beautifully in a tiny space,” said the late Dr. Christian Peeters, lead author of this paper, who was a research professor at Sorbonne University. “The three muscle groups have all expanded in volume, giving the worker ants more strength and power. There has also been a change in the geometry of the neck muscles, which support and move the head. And the internal attachment of muscles has been modified.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, when looking at wingless wasps, the researchers found that these insects had responded to the loss of flight in a completely different way. Wingless wasps are solitary and consume food as they find it. On the other hand, ants are part of a colony. They hunt or scavenge for food that then needs to be carried back to the nest for the queen and younger nestmates, so it makes sense that there was a selection pressure to promote carrying ability.</p>

<p>Ants have been studied for centuries in terms of their behavior, ecology, and genetics but, the researchers emphasized, this story of strength has, so far, been somewhat overlooked. The next step is to develop more detailed biomechanical models of how different muscle groups function, do similar research on the mandible and legs, and explore the diversity seen between ant species.</p>

<p>“We’re interested in what makes an ant an ant and understanding the key innovations behind their success” explained Professor Economo. “We know that one factor is the social structure, but this individual strength is another essential factor."</p>

<p>Alongside Professor Economo and Dr. Peeters, the research group included Dr. Roberto A. Keller from University of Lisbon and OIST, Mr. Adam Khalife from Sorbonne University and OIST, Dr. Georg Fischer and Mr. Julian Katzke from OIST, and Dr. Alexander Blanke from University of Cologne.</p>

<h2><a id="intro" name="intro">INTRO</a></h2>

<p>The vast majority of people on earth argue in a <em>destructive </em>fashion. Debates, especially in online spaces, are viewed as a battle of the wits in which egos are put on display and there can be only one "winner".</p>

<p>Instead, we should be arguing in a <em>constructive </em>fashion: treating arguments as an opportunity to expand knowledge, finding points of disagreement, and collaborating towards a common truth.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I used to be a destructive arguer. When I was younger, my goal in any argument was not to learn something new, but rather to assure my superiority over what I felt to be the clear stupidity of the other side. I even used to save screenshots of debates I had on various forums and social media platforms, returning periodically to reminisce about past skirmishes in which I "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trigger-the-libs">owned the conservatives</a>".</p>

<p>Luckily, several years spent abroad gave me a different perspective. I realized that in the small-sided debates I used to engage in back home, my positions lacked the nuance and context of the greater world. For the first time, I began to do deep research on how to think — and argue — &nbsp;more clearly, drawing from concepts from philosophy, psychology, and behavioral economics.</p>

<p>This widened outlook led me to see arguments as a chance to build value, rather than destroy it. Instead of going through the mental anguish of battle, I now follow a collaborative approach to debate that I'd like to share in this guide in hopes that it will inspire others to argue more constructively.</p>

<p>Note that the content in this guide will focus on arguments about public issues, like politics and religion, as opposed to personal issues, like "you need to communicate more" or "you haven't done the dishes in weeks". Though there is overlap between the two, interpersonal arguments are much more complex and require more nuance than this guide can provide, plus there are already a ton of great resources out there that explore these topics more thoroughly.</p>

<h2><a id="mindset" name="mindset">MINDSET</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span><em>&nbsp;"An argument should be a collaboration between two people to find the truth."</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I had to distill this guide down to one sentence, it would be the above. Even if you forget the individual tenets and strategies this guide has to offer, as long as you are treating any given argument as a collaboration in search of truth, you can't go wrong.</p>

<p>Arguing more effectively requires detaching yourself from the idea of "winning" in the traditional sense. Instead, you should declare victory when you have argued in good faith and kept an open mind.</p>

<p>True collaboration requires that both parties open an investigation into why they may be wrong and consider changing their beliefs. Which brings us to the three core tenets of a constructive debate mindset:</p>

<h3>Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind <a href="#Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind" id="Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind" name="Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>Was there ever a time in which you had a deeply-held belief about something, but slowly came to realize that you were wrong? Maybe you thought a past partner was "the one", or you were devoted to a religious faith. Or perhaps something as simple as believing in Santa Claus.</p>

<p>What's to say that couldn't happen with the other deeply-held beliefs, given enough evidence?</p>

<p>Go into every debate with the mindset that you may not know everything about the topic at hand, and in fact <em>may be wrong</em>.</p>

<p>If you successfully acknowledge that you may be wrong, it follows that you must then be willing to change your mind. Having the humility to admit that your mind has been changed is one of the most honorable positions in a good faith debate.</p>

<h3>Arguments Are Not Soldiers <a href="#Arguments Are Not Soldiers" id="Arguments Are Not Soldiers" name="Arguments Are Not Soldiers"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>In a war, all soldiers take an oath to fight for their own side, no matter what amount they agree with its principles. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer">Eliezer Yudkowsky once observed</a> that in political debates, arguments were treated like soldiers: "<em>Once you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it's like stabbing your soldiers in the back.</em>"</p>

<p>Because most people go into debate with a war-like mentality, they feel they must fly the flag for all points that <em>their</em><em> side</em> supports, regardless of how much they actually agree with them.</p>

<p>The red state gun-owner must be pro-religion, anti-abortion, anti-drugs, anti-tax, and skeptical of gender issues.</p>

<p>The blue state Subaru-owner must be anti-religion, pro-abortion, pro-drugs, pro-tax(ing-the-rich), and concerned about gender issues.</p>

<p>Most annoying is that given the societal expectations for this divide, being for or against one issue immediately assigns you to a "side" in the views of everyone involved. Breaking out of this Arguments as Soldiers mindset involves two steps:</p>

<p>1. Do not be afraid to agree with the arguments of the other side when they strike you as reasonable, and critique the arguments of your own side when they strike you as unreasonable (better yet, try not to have a side).</p>

<p>2. On the flip side, avoid stereotyping your debate partner based on one opinion. If you are engaging with someone in debate for the first time, assume that they agree with you on every other position than the one they are defending, until proven otherwise.</p>

<h3>There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil <a href="#There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil" id="There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil" name="There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p><em>Brace yourself, Star Wars references incoming:</em></p>

<p>In a given debate, almost everyone thinks they are a member of the Jedi order, fighting for all that is virtuous and good in the universe. Yet for every Jedi, there's a Sith out there <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llLKar19XhA">who thinks that the Jedi are evil</a> and wrong and that <em>they</em> are actually the ones fighting for virtue and good. Remember that this person might even be <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, you are not a full agent of good, and your debate partner is not an agent of evil, or vice versa. You are simply citizens of the galaxy who happen to be operating with different sets of information. Look at the situation from a different perspective: if you were raised with Sith beliefs from childhood, don't you think you might believe the exact same things a Sith would?</p>

<p>In debate, your goal should not be to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMNKwZTv1d0">strike down the side of evil with all your hatred</a>, but rather work together with them to uncover the true facts about the universe, and in doing so perhaps change both your perspectives.</p>

<h2><a id="mindset" name="prework">PRE-WORK</a></h2>

<p>It would be great if choosing to pursue the path of arguing constructively was just a matter of changing your mindset overnight, but as Carl Sagan once said: <a href="https://youtu.be/BkHCO8f2TWs?t=9">"If you wish to bake an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."</a></p>

<p>In the same vein, if you wish to improve the constructiveness of the debates you engage in, you must first spend time re-inventing your entire mind.</p>

<p>This is because our mind is constantly working against us, plagued by ancient errors from the times in which we lived in caves and hunted woolly mammoths. These errors work against us in the form of cognitive biases and logical fallacies, which hinder our ability to clearly see reality and engage in sound debate.</p>

<h3>Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases <a href="#Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases" id="Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases" name="Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>Cognitive biases are limits and mistakes in human judgement that prevent someone from acting rationally. They are present in every aspect of human life, and in tense situations like arguments, they tend to appear more often as emotions are heightened and the brain gets overloaded.</p>

<p>Common examples that relate to debates are <em>confirmation bias</em>, or the tendency of humans to seek out information that confirms existing beliefs, and <em>ingroup bias</em>, or the tendency to agree more strongly with people that appear to be part of our "tribe", but there are over 100 identified biases, and it's worth reading through the Wikipedia article on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">most common cognitive biases</a> so you can recognize when they might be clouding your thinking.</p>

<h3>Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies <a href="#Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies" id="Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies" name="Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>In part caused by cognitive biases, logical fallacies are errors in argument that give off an air of decisiveness, despite making points that don't hold up to logical scrutiny. While these are often used unintentionally, due to bias, carelessness, or ignorance, unfortunately, they can also be wielded intentionally by a shrewd debate partner.</p>

<p>Common examples in debate include the <em>false dilemma fallacy</em>: "you're either with us or against us", and the <em>slippery slope fallacy</em>: "if we allow the gays to marry, what's next: plants?" Just like cognitive biases, there are a large number of identified logical fallacies, and it's worth it to review the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies">entire list</a>, so you can spot them in your own arguments and in those of others.</p>

<h2><a id="debatebreakdown" name="debatebreakdown">BREAKING DOWN A DEBATE</a></h2>

<p>To the untrained eye, a debate might look like two or more parties trading argumentative points back and forth. But interestingly, these points can almost perfectly be classified into a few categories. Understanding these categories, and why some types of arguments are better than others, is crucial for learning how we and those whom we engage with in debate might shape their points. In a brilliant post called <em><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/08/varieties-of-argumentative-experience/">Varieties of Argumentative Experience</a></em>, Scott Alexander does just this, illuminating and labeling practically every part of a debate. The post itself is basically required reading, but is long-ish<em>,</em> so I will summarize here.</p>

<p>Think of a debate as a pyramid: <a href="#debatepyramid" id="debatepyramid" name="debatepyramid"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></p>

<p><img alt="" height="548" src="http://liamrosen.com/Pyramid%20of%20Argumentative%20Experience.svg" width="978"></p>

<p>In general, the lower on the pyramid you are, the worse debate you're having. The goal should be to start as high as possible and continue to work your way towards the top.</p>

<p>Debates on twitter and other forms of social media are almost guaranteed to never rise above the lower dotted line, as these platform don't allow for more nuanced debate. Everything above the higher dotted line is our gold standard: two intelligent, charitable, and versed debaters can successfully maintain a debate at this level until some form of resolution.</p>

The researchers compared the apps’ predictions of when buses would arrive to actual arrival times. &nbsp;They then calculated how long commuters would wait at a stop if they used different tactics to time their arrival.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Relying on the bus app garnered the worst results</h2><p>The absolute worst way to catch the bus was to use use what the researchers called the “greedy tactic,” which is the one used by many transit apps. This is where commuters time their arrival at the stop based on when the app says the bus will arrive.&nbsp;</p><p>People who followed this strategy were likely to miss the bus about three-fourths of the time, the study showed.&nbsp;</p><p>“The greedy tactic in common transit apps is the worst strategy,” the authors write, “even worse than showing up at a bus stop arbitrarily.”</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3maYDx8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Commuters</a> achieved slightly better results by using the app, but adding some extra time as an insurance buffer.

And these apps generally don’t check the buses’ location often enough to get accurate real-time information.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why long waiting times matter</h2><p>Waiting time for buses is an important issue, the authors said. Commuters cite long waiting times as one of the top reasons for not using public transportation.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also a safety concern for people to not have to wait for long periods, especially at night. And having people rushing through busy streets because they are late for a bus is also unsafe.&nbsp; Furthermore, for many people, missing buses can jeopardize their jobs or important health care appointments.&nbsp;</p><p>The authors said that said the bus apps could be more helpful by taking advantage of the data used in this study to make better recommendations.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856420307229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Does real-time transit information reduce waiting time?

    <li>You're all calculating churn rates wrong</li>
</ol>

        

        
        <p>
            Many smart people will tell you to obsess over your churn rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/churn_rate_formula2.png" alt="churn rate=(customers lost in month)/(customers at start of month)">
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Andreessen Horowitz, this number is <a href="https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/">one of the top 16 metrics</a>
            to measure a SaaS startup by. Well, sorry Andreessen, and sorry Horowitz, but this just isn't right.
        </p><p>
            It's counterintuitive, but it's a statistical fact: This number actually <b>tells you nothing useful about churn</b>,
            but really relates to the age of the subscriptions you have.
            It will in most cases go down on it's own, and, absurdly, the only way to keep it from going down is to have very
            high growth. So the number will literally <b>only look <i>bad</i> if your business is doing extremely <i>well</i></b>,
            and optimizing for it will be directly counter-productive.
            The error here is a simple statistical mistake that is easy to make, and luckily also easy to understand and avoid.
        </p><p>
            If you run a subscription based SaaS business, you're likely very concerned with how long you can keep your
            customers. We're a JavaScript exception tracking service, and the health of this business is fully determined by how many
            customers we bring in, and how long we can keep them. On the surface, <i>churn rate</i> may seem like a natural proxy for changes
            in <i>customer lifetimes</i>. Let's dig into why that is not true.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The false assumption
        </h2>
        <p>
            Computing a churn rate <b>assumes that a customer is equally likely to leave at any time</b>, no matter how long they've
            been subscribed to you. This is almost certainly not true. In fact, as we will see, having a constant churn probability over time
            essentially implies that you'll <i>never have long term customers</i>.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/expon.png" alt="Hazard function (churn) and the implied survival function (from an Exponential distribution)">
            <figcaption>If a user has a constant churn probability over time, this implies that customer lifetimes come from an Exponential distribution.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            If you have a constant churn of <code>c</code> per month, the probability that a customer stays subscribed for <code>n</code> months is <code>(1-c)^n</code>. This implies that customer lifetimes come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">Geometric distribution</a>. If customers can quit the subscription at any time, we have continuous time and should use the continuous time analogue, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">Exponential distribution</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What your churn is actually like, with help from K. S. Lomax
        </h2>
        <p>
            The problem is, your customer is not equally likely to cancel their subscription at any time. Most likely, you have a situation where the drop-off in customers is higher in the first few days than it is later. This is even more so if you have a free trial period for your product.
        </p><p>
            If the churn probability gets lower the longer the customer has been subscribed, you could model that as <code>c/(t+1)</code>, where
            <code>t</code> is the timestep (e.g. number of days the customer has been subscribed), and <code>c</code> is some constant.
            In this case, this implies that customer lifetimes comes from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomax_distribution">Lomax distribution</a>.
            This is equivalent to a Pareto distribution shifted to start at 0.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What your churn is actually like, with help from Waloddi Weibull
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you suspect that churn probability per day may <i>increase</i> the longer a user has been subscribed, the Lomax distribution won't
            work for you. Instead you could enlist the help of Swedish statistician Waloddi Weibull.
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution">Weibull distribution</a> can express both decreasing,
            flat, and increasing probabilities of a customer quitting. This makes it a popular choice for modeling customer lifetimes.
        </p>

            Optimizing for a falsehood will lead you astray
        </h2>
        <p>
            Now let's see why properly modeling this is important.
        </p><p>
            Let's measure churn the wrong way, and see where it takes us.
            Let's say customer lifetimes come from a Lomax distribution. Let's also say you have a business that is in terrible shape, where
            the number of new sign ups per day is falling by one per day. How will this look on the churn rate? We can simulate it and find out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind, in each of the examples below we simulate lifetimes from the same customer lifetime distribution,
            and this distribution <b>does not change</b> over time.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/shrinking_business.png" alt="Shrinking business, churn appears to fall">
            <figcaption>With a shrinking business, churn appears to improve because subscriptions are getting fewer and older.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            This is clearly a dying business, yet the churn rate graph is looking great! <b>
                The churn rate per day is falling steadily,
                even if we know that there is no change in customer lifetimes in our model.
            </b>
        </p><p>
            So what's going on? This sharp fall in churn rate is a consequence of the fact that we're not getting new customers.
            Because we're not growing, a bigger share of our customers have been around for a long time, which
            means they're less likely to churn, which means our daily churn graph goes down more than it would otherwise.
            This change on the population level happens despite there being no change in underlying individual customer lifetimes.
        </p><p>
            Let's change this into a scenario where your business is experiencing insane growth. We'll keep the customer lifetimes exactly the same,
            but change it so that the number of new sign ups per day is growing superlinearly.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/Blog//images/blog/churn/growing_business.png" alt="Growing business, churn appears to be flat">
            <figcaption>With a growing business, churn rate appears to not change, only because most subscriptions are new.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Even if the customer lifetimes are unchanged from before, the churn rate graph here is flat. An investor would frown and say
            we're doing nothing to improve how well we retain our customers. In reality, the only reason the graph looks "bad" has nothing to
            do with churn, it is because we're doing insanely well at getting new sign ups.
        </p><p>
            <b>
                If you are steering yourself and your team on the basis of this metric, you're rewarding yourself for stifling growth
                and punishing yourself for growing.
            </b> Obviously, this is 100% counterproductive.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How the h*** do we measure churn then?
        </h2>
        <p>
            As you might have guessed from the previous paragraphs, we should model the <i>distribution of customer lifetimes</i>,
            and we should do it in a <i>statistically sound way</i>. Lomax and Weibull distributions are good choices of model.
        </p><p>
            The part where this gets tricky is that we'll have two types of data: The customers that have quit, and the customers
            that are still subscribed. It's only our ex-customers that give us a total lifetime to work with. For our still-subscribed
            customers, we only know that their subscription has lasted up until now, and we don't know how much longer it will last
            into the future. In statistical lingo, we have what is called <i>right-censored data</i>.
        </p><p>
            Luckily there's a way to use all our data, even from our still-subscribed customers.
        </p>


        <h2>
            Weibull or Lomax?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Choosing between Weibull or Lomax (or any other distribution) has no simple answer. Weibull is more flexible
            in that it can express growing, shrinking and flat churn probabilities. However, this expressive power will
            not help you if your data is fundamentally Lomax-like. First and foremost, base your choice
            on your knowledge of the business that you're in. If you have any prior knowledge about how churn probabilities
            will develop, base your choice of distribution on that. There are also various
            <a href="https://www.weibull.com/hotwire/issue71/relbasics71.htm">goodness of fit</a> tests you could use to
            inform this decision. The truth is, any choice of distribution will be wrong to some degree, so you need to make
            a judgment call as to what fits your situation the best, based both on both your data and your prior knowledge.
            For the purposes of the rest of this post, we'll just fit both distributions and disregard the question of
            which suits us the best.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Let's do some proper statistics
        </h2>
        <p>
            The probability distributions we'll model are defined by their parameters.
            We want to find the parameters that fit the data best. To start, we want to make a guess at these parameters,
            and have a way to tell how good our guess was. Luckily, we have a statistically sound way of knowing how good a guess
            is given the data we have. Extra luckily, this is also true when we have censored data.
            This function that tells us how likely our parameters are given the data we have is called the Likelihood function.
            We get it by looking up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density function</a>
            value for the uncensored data points and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_function">survival function</a> value
            for each of the censored data points, and multiplying all these values together.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>“Computers are all made out of logic gates”. We’ve heard that saying before. We also have a sense that logic gates are very simple machines, analogous to light switches even. This raises the question: <em>how exactly do kind-of-light-switches come together to form computers</em>? How does “storing a variable” or “calling a function” translate into logic gates going on or off? </p><p>On a journey to answer that question, I discovered J Clark Scott’s excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers-ebook/dp/B00F25LEVC" target="_blank">“How do It Know?</a>”. He starts with NAND gates and takes you on a journey to build a computer using them.</p><p>I liked his book so much that I took his schematic for RAM, and simulated it in Clojure. In this essay, I’ll guide you through doing just that: we’ll simulate NAND gates, and use about <em>14 thousand</em> of them to build 256 bytes of RAM.</p><p>Going through this simulation ingrained an “aha” feeling in me: watching 14 thousand little machines chug away makes you feel that whoever uses a computer is a wizard. A wizard with an army of millions of machine servants doing billions of little jobs for them every second. I hope it gives you the same feeling. 🙂</p><p>To grok this essay, you need to understand this picture:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NDk4LTdhY2RkMzgwLTBjOTItMTFlYi04NWQ2LTZmOWEzNGE2NmU5Zi5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>This describes a NAND gate. A NAND gate is a machine that has two input wires. If both input wires have a “high” charge (represented as 1), the output charge is “low” (represented as zero). With any other combination of input charges, the output charge is high.</p><p>Notice that the wires carry a charge, but we choose to interpret <em>meaning</em> in the charge. “high charge” means 1, and “low charge” means 0. Nothing changes in the machine, this is just something we decided as humans (1).</p><p>On the left you see a circuit diagram. You can read it as input wires <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> carrying charges into the <code>NAND</code> gate. The <code>NAND</code> gate has a wire <code>c</code>, carrying the output charge. For all the circuit diagrams we’ll draw, you can read them as electricity “flowing” from left to right, or top to bottom.</p><p>On the right is a “truth” table for a NAND gate. This is just a fancy name for summarizing every state a <code>NAND</code> gate can be, based on the input wires.</p><p>Now, we can start even lower than a <code>NAND gate</code>, but this machine is simple enough. It can’t be so hard to build something that turns off when two inputs are turned on. You don’t have to take my word for it though, you can search up “building a NAND gate with transistors”, and come back when you’re convinced. </p><p>Time to code! 🙂</p><p>First things first, we need some way to represent the state of our circuit. We know that our RAM will be built completely from <code>NAND</code> gates, so let’s take inspiration from one:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NTI0LTg0NTczYjgwLTBjOTItMTFlYi05NWMyLWJlMWQ4MzFlNTg5MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If we look at this example we can see that:</p><ol><li>We have wires. </li><li>Wires have charges.</li><li>We hook wires together with NAND Gates</li></ol><p>Here’s one way we can map that to a data structure in Clojure: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-state-v0 {</span><span>:charge-map</span><span> {</span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:c</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>}</span>
<span>                  </span><span>:nand-gates</span><span> [{</span><span>:ins</span><span> [</span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span>]</span>
<span>                                </span><span>:out</span><span> </span><span>:c</span><span>}]})</span></code></pre><p>We can use keywords to represent our wires. We can also keep a map that tells us the charges of our wires. Finally, we can keep a list of NAND gates, which tell us how these wires connect. </p><p>Fine enough way to represent our circuit for now! Let’s create a few functions that can help us manage this representation:</p><pre><code><span>; update state v0</span>
<span>; ---------------</span>

Let’s try them out in the REPL:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>charges</span><span> (</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> empty-state</span>
<span>               (</span><span>set-charge</span><span> </span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>; =&gt; {:charge-map {}, :nand-gates [{:ins [:a :b], :out :c}]}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We can now “wire” up a circuit. Let’s run some electricity through it.</p><p>To figure out how to simulate electricity into our circuit, let’s remember our diagram again:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NTU3LTk0NmYxYjAwLTBjOTItMTFlYi05NGZkLTNlM2JkMzI5OWYwNC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>One way we can model this is to imagine that electricity is like water: It “flows” from sources into wires, and “triggers” all the devices that are connected to those wires.</p><p>With a model like that, here’s what would happen if a charge was “triggered” on <code>a</code>:</p><ol><li>First, <code>a</code>‘s charge would update. </li><li>After that <code>a</code> ‘s charge would transfer to all the NAND gates that are connected to it. In this case, it would be our one NAND gate above.</li><li>Each NAND gate would then recompute its charge, and if it changed, trigger its output wire in turn. In our case that’s <code>c</code> </li><li>If <code>c</code> was connected to other <code>NAND</code> gates, those gates would trigger, and the process would continue.</li></ol><p>Now, this is a very naive view of how electricity works (2), but it’s good enough for us to model RAM!</p><p>Let’s translate this into code.</p><p>To do that, we need a way to model what a <code>NAND</code> gate does:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> nand-output [a b]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>=</span><span> a b </span><span>1</span><span>) </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>nand-output</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

<span>; =&gt; 0</span></code></pre><p>Our <code>nand-output</code> function takes two input charges, and produces the output charge that a <code>NAND</code> gate would produce.</p><p>Next, we need a function to find all the <code>NAND</code> gates that are connected to a specific wire:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> dependent-nand-gates [state wire]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>filter</span><span> </span>

<span>; =&gt; ({:ins [:a :b], :out :c})</span></code></pre><p>This searches all of our <code>NAND</code> gates in our circuit, and finds the ones which are connected to a specific wire.</p><p>With that, we have what we need to implement <code>trigger</code>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>declare</span><span> trigger-nand-gate)</span>

			    	<p>Have you ever experienced your laptop fan becoming loud simply by viewing a web page? The most likely culprit are the ads on the page.</p>

<p>Magic Lasso Adblock blocks ads, privacy trackers and unnecessary JavaScript on web pages. By removing these items, pages are smaller and battery life sees a big improvement.</p>

<p>Having efficient, light and simple pages reduces a web browser’s energy use, including its’ use of the CPU and graphics processor. When there’s less to load, render and interpret, a web browser is faster and also uses less battery. Let’s take a closer look at how much an impact this can make.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="what-impacts-battery-life">What impacts battery life?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ads are the most frequent user of battery life.</strong> Ads use a lot of network resources to load and also significantly use the CPU to display complex animations or video. Many web pages include multiple ads which reduces battery life further.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although not as impactful as ads, <strong>tracking scripts also impact battery life.</strong> Many of these scripts are bloated; adding extra page weight and extra loading time. For no benefit to the user. Tracking scripts can also slow pages by recording usage as you interact.</p>
  </li>

    <p>Many web apps now use <strong>complex JavaScript frameworks</strong> that may impact battery life. Although necessary for an app to function, due to their use of non-native code they are not always efficient users of the CPU. Both web pages and some apps such as Microsoft Teams and Slack use JavaScript heavily, which quickly drains your device’s battery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years, <strong>hidden crypto-mining scripts</strong> have been included on approximately 0.2% of all web pages. The majority of pages execute crypto-mining without user consent. <a name="how-many"></a>These scripts are especially heavy users of the CPU, slow down browsing and unnecessarily use battery life and energy.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-many-unnecessary-ads-exist-on-common-pages">How many unnecessary ads exist on common pages?</h3>
<p>Advertisements and tracking scripts, like any other website element, adds page weight and loading time to web pages. Even once a page has loaded, many scripts are running constantly, increasing the ongoing energy use while you read page content.</p>

<p>On a popular website such as The Verge, these unnecessary elements add 4.96 MB of page weight to each and every page load.<a name="how-can-improve"></a></p>

<p><strong>That’s 62% of the total page weight spent on features that don’t assist you as a reader.</strong></p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-improve-my-battery-life">How can I improve my battery life?</h3>
<p>The easiest way to remove all of these unnecessary elements is to use an ad blocker. By default, Magic Lasso Adblock removes all advertisements and tracking scripts. In addition, the Battery Boost feature blocks many heavy JavaScript frameworks and stops hidden background crypto-mining scripts.</p>

<p>To see how much of a difference this makes, we did some tests. You’ll see the results below.</p>

<p>Using a selection of random pages from the top News and Media websites in the US (as reported by SimilarWeb), we automated loading, viewing and scrolling of the page to replicate a normal user.</p>

<p>Then we recorded the time until 10% battery life remained, both with Magic Lasso enabled and disabled.</p>

<p><strong>Magic Lasso Adblock with Battery Boost reduced energy consumption by over 50%.</strong> <a name="what-else"></a>That gives you twice as much battery life to use your device on each charge when doing heavy web browsing.</p>

<h3 id="what-else-can-i-do-to-improve-web-browsing-battery-life">What else can I do to improve web browsing battery life?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In Safari on the Mac, <strong>disable auto-playing videos</strong>. This reduces battery use while browsing on many sites that play videos automatically. Available in Preferences &gt; Websites &gt; Auto-Play. If you want to view the video you can just tap to play instead.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Reader mode by default</strong> to make many news sites a more pleasant and lightweight experience. Safari includes a useful Reader mode which shows an article’s content and removes any distracting surrounding navigation and ads. It doesn’t work for all sites but is helpful for websites with articles that your read often. Enable this on the Mac in Safari Preferences &gt; Websites &gt; Reader. In Safari on iOS, it can be set in the Address bar &gt; Aa &gt; Website Settings.</li>
  <li>When battery life is getting low on your iPhone or iPad, <strong>enable Low Battery mode.</strong> Available in the Control Centre and also in Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Low Power Mode, this temporarily reduces any background activity which extends your battery until you can charge it.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Wifi.</strong> When Safari accesses data on an iPhone or iPad, a Wi-Fi connection uses less power than a mobile network. So keep Wi-Fi on at all times. To turn on, go to Settings &gt; Wi-Fi.</li>
  <li>Finally, <strong>adjust your screen brightness.</strong> A bright screen uses a surprising amount of the overall battery of your device. <a name="try-magic-lasso"></a>Therefore you can dim the screen or turn on Auto-Brightness to extend battery life.</li>

          <p><em>A short tutorial on how to design a menu navigation toggle with only CSS</em></p>
        
        <p>When thinking through navigation designs for mobile devices sometimes the best option is to store away the content behind a toggle button. This button would then display the menu items upon interaction. Let me show you how to create such an element with only CSS - no need for JavaScript today!</p>

<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin</h2>

<p>I would like to point out that the concept of “toggling” the main menu (even for mobile) is not always the best solution. If you’re interested, you can take a look at a previous article I wrote explaining why: <a href="https://uglyduck.ca/hamburger-menu-alternative/">Using Hamburger Menus? Try Sausage Links</a></p>

<p>Now that we have mentioned possible pitfalls of relying so heavily on toggle menus, let’s build one!</p>

<h2 id="our-final-product">Our Final Product</h2>

<p data-height="372" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="bradleytaunt" data-slug-hash="mdEEvEX" data-pen-title="Menu Toggle with Pure CSS">

  Menu Toggle with Pure CSS</a> by Bradley Taunt (<a href="https://codepen.io/bradleytaunt">@bradleytaunt</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>


<h2 id="the-html">The HTML</h2>

<p>To implement this design you really don’t need much in terms of HTML:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A single <code>checkbox</code> input</li>
  <li>A <code>label</code> that corresponds to the <code>checkbox</code></li>
  <li>A <code>nav</code> element to house our unordered list items</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;!-- The checkbox input &amp; label partner --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"checkbox"</span> <span>id=</span><span>"menu-toggle"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;label</span> <span>for=</span><span>"menu-toggle"</span><span>&gt;</span>Menu<span>&lt;/label&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;!-- The navigation we wish to toggle --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;nav&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;ul&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Home<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>About<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Articles<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Colophon<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>""</span><span>&gt;</span>Contact<span>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/nav&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<h2 id="the-css">The CSS</h2>

<p>The first thing we need to do is “hide” the <code>checkbox</code> input element. It’s important to avoid using <code>display: none</code> or <code>visibility: hidden</code> in order to achieve this. Those CSS properties can negatively impact accessibility (specifically screen readers). So we will be relying on the <code>position</code>, <code>z-index</code> and <code>opacity</code> properties to help us out.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Set the input position to absolute, send it off screen with zero opacity */</span>
<span>input</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"checkbox"</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>-9999px</span><span>;</span>
    <span>opacity</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>position</span><span>:</span> <span>absolute</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then we give our corresponding <code>label</code> a minor face-lift to make it appear more button-like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Minor visual styling to make the label more button-y */</span>
<span>label</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>border</span><span>:</span> <span>1px</span> <span>solid</span> <span>currentColor</span><span>;</span>
    <span>border-radius</span><span>:</span> <span>4px</span><span>;</span>
    <span>cursor</span><span>:</span> <span>pointer</span><span>;</span>
    <span>padding</span><span>:</span> <span>10px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For our main <code>nav</code> element, we want to set it’s position to <code>absolute</code> in order to avoid any janky page rendering issues that might occur when toggling the menu:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Set nav to absolute (avoids odd page rendering space pop-in) */</span>
<span>nav</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>opacity</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>position</span><span>:</span> <span>absolute</span><span>;</span>
    <span>z-index</span><span>:</span> <span>-2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The last step is to actually <em>show</em> the menu if the user toggles the <code>checkbox</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* Show nav when checkbox is checked */</span>
<span>input</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"checkbox"</span><span>]</span><span>:checked</span> <span>~</span> <span>nav</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>opacity</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>z-index</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It might not look like much, but you now have a fully functional menu toggle - <strong>made with pure CSS</strong>!</p>

<h2 id="with-great-power">With Great Power…</h2>

<p>Although this design is very simple to implement, please remember to use these types of menus wisely. Just because you <em>can</em> do something, doesn’t always mean you <em>should</em>.</p>

Things are out of joint in the delta of the Mekong, Southeast Asia’s largest river. Rising sea levels and subsiding land are threatening to flood the area.</p><br><div><p>
Simultaneously, the annual Monsoon inundations are delayed more and more often, while still retreating early, and leaving local fields parched.</p><p>But why? Let’s unravel a complex tangle of reasons, with climate change at its core.</p></div><p>
Deltas have always been hubs of human development. Ancient civilizations flourished in the Nile and the Ganges deltas. Today, <a text="half a billion people" url="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=138738&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news" href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=138738&amp;org=NSF&amp;from=news">half a billion people</a> call deltas home—even though they cover only 1% of the earth’s land surface. With rich crops and abundant fish, deltas are crucial to food security and economic development.</p><p>However, deltas are also extremely vulnerable.</p><p>Located at the intersection of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, a delta’s entire existence depends on a delicate balance of factors: Temperature. Freshwater and saltwater. Precipitation and river flow.</p><p>In the Mekong delta, this balance has been disturbed. As a consequence, the delta of Southeast Asia’s largest river is both sinking and drying out at the same time. While ever-rising waves lap away at the coastline, and higher sea levels push salty water into the delta, severe droughts are leaving the landscape parched.</p><p>But what exactly causes this double threat? And what can be done about it?</p><p>The answers to these questions are as complex as the environmental and political problems casting their shadows over the region.</p><p>At the heart of the issue: Climate change.</p><h2 id="living-with-the-river">Living with the River</h2><p>Springing from the vast Tibetan plateau at the foot of the Himalayas, the Mekong river winds its way over 2,700 miles through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.</p></div><div><p>The Mekong River and its Delta</p><p>From the Tibetan plateau through six countries: China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam</p><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/sinking-delta/static/images/overview.png" idyll="[object Object]"></p><div><div><p>SOURCE</p><p>Christina Orieschnig</p></div><p>Parametric Press</p></div></div><div><p>The abundant fertility of the Mekong delta is based on the annual Monsoon cycle.</p><p>Fed by torrential rains, the Mekong begins to swell in June, overbrimming its banks and inundating the surrounding floodplains. The land remains underwater for several months, until the flood begins to recede in October or November.</p></div><div><p>A Landscape: Flooded and Dry</p><p>Satellite images of the same area during the dry and wet seasons show a stark contrast: One image shows lush, green fields. The other, wide expanses of open water.</p></div><div><p>Far from being a disaster, these inundations are welcomed by the local inhabitants.</p><p>During the wet season, the delta is replenished. Fish populations explode. Water infiltrates the soil, dusty from months of little to no precipitation, and is stored in canals and lowland areas.</p><p>The sediments left behind at the end of the wet season are full of nutrients. In the rich, muddy earth that emerges from the receding floods, farmers plant rice and vegetables, marking the beginning of the new agricultural year.</p></div><div><p>A Dry Season Landscape</p><p>Side branches of the Mekong wind their way through the landscape in mid-March.</p><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/sinking-delta/static/images/67_lq.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"></p><div><div><p>SOURCE</p><p>Christina Orieschnig</p></div><p>Parametric Press</p></div></div><div><p>This cycle is so deeply ingrained in the consciousness and identity of the people that it forms the basis of some of the region’s most important cultural traditions. In Cambodia, the Water Festival (Bon Om Touk) is celebrated in November. It marks the beginning of the flood recession with fireworks, boat races and nautical parades.</p><p>These traditions reach back to the Khmer empire of the 9<sup>th</sup>–15<sup>th</sup> century. They illustrate the central importance of the yearly flood pulse for the delta, and how it has been rooted in local consciousness for hundreds of years.</p><p>Today, the hydrological balance in the delta is shifting.</p><h2 id="droughts,-dams,-and-the-distribution-of-rain">Droughts, Dams, and the Distribution of Rain</h2><p>Officially, the arrival of the 2019 flood was two weeks late.

As the flood curves of the Mekong water levels show, the 2019 flood pulse was only about half as long as in past years.</p></div><div><p>Mekong River Water Levels at North End of the Delta</p><p>The flood peak of the 2019 wet season occured much later and was much shorter than in previous years.</p><div><div><p>SOURCE</p><p>Mekong River Commission</p></div><p>Parametric Press</p></div></div><p>The combined effects of the late arrival and short duration of last year’s flood reverberated through the landscape in a cascade of negative impacts.</p><div><p>Comparing Flood Extents Using Radar Data</p><p>Data from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission run by the European Space Agency (ESA) shows the flooded areas (in black) of early August 2019 in stark contrast to those of the previous year. Sentinel-1's Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can penetrate the thick layer of clouds covering the region during this period.</p></div><p>While farmers did mostly succeed in growing crops directly after the flood, many of them faced worries for the rest of the agricultural year.</p><div><p>The list of causes is a long one, ranging from a dam cascade being built upstream to land use changes in the entire Mekong basin.</p><p>Climate change, too, is a critical factor.</p><p>To begin with, average temperatures in Southeast Asia have risen continuously over the last few decades, in line with global warming. In Vietnam, the annual average temperature rise has been <a text="0.1 °C per decade since 1900" url="https://www.ipcc.ch/apps/njlite/ar5wg2/njlite_download2.php?id=9112" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/apps/njlite/ar5wg2/njlite_download2.php?id=9112">0.1 °C per decade since 1900</a>, ramping up to 0.14 °C per decade towards the end of the century. Summer temperature increases are even higher, with average monthly temperatures climbing by 0.1–0.3 °C per decade.</p><p>But higher temperatures are not the only contributor to the droughts that have struck the region in recent years.</p></div><p>Meteorological experts trace the immediate cause for this back to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Approximately occurring every four years, El Niño is a global weather event with impacts on local weather. It is caused by a change in temperature distributions in the Pacific Ocean. Oceanic and atmospheric conditions interact to invert the usual east-west direction of ocean surface winds. Now blowing from west to east, they drive warm equatorial waters towards the eastern Pacific. This, in turn, has impacts on weather patterns such as the Monsoon rains over Southeast Asia.</p><div><p>Yearly rainfall in the Mekong basin since 1981</p><p>In El Niño years, there is generally less cumulative rainfall in the river basin.

In Southeast Asia, 2015/16 saw a drought similarly severe as that of 2019. This period also saw the strongest-ever El Niño event, also referred to as a Super El Niño.</p><div> <p>Highlighted are the years in which wet season rainfall was affected by El Niños, according to the 3-month mean of the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) published by NOAA.</p></div><div><div><p>SOURCE</p><p>Precipitation: CHIRPS, ENSO: NOAA ONI</p></div><p>Parametric Press</p></div></div><div><p>El Niño is a periodic natural phenomenon, which has been continuously observed over the past 120 years. But here, climate change enters the equation for the second time.</p><p>Scientists warn that global warming could exacerbate El Niño to make the events positively devastating. A <a text="study published in Nature Geoscience" url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0353-3" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0353-3">study published in Nature Geoscience</a> in 2019 assessed the last 400 years of El Niño on the basis of coral reef growth. Its results show that in recent decades, the events have grown both more frequent and more severe.</p><p>Climate change is thought to be a major contributing factor.</p><p>The effects of anthropogenic climate change on the Mekong basin are undeniable. But humans also have more direct impacts on the delta, which further aggravate floods droughts.</p><p>First and foremost, hydropower projects have been increasingly damming up the Mekong and its tributaries.</p><div><p>Hydropower development on the Mekong and its tributaries</p><p>The first dams were built in the 1960s, and for decades both the number of dams and the amount of river water they held back remained limited.

But in the early 2000s, the number of dams and their capacity skyrocketed. In 2005, there were 16 dams on the Mekong and its tributaries. Today, there are nearly 100. Another 30 are currently under construction.</p><p>Overall, hydropower stations in the Mekong basin have the potential to generate 13,000 MW of electricity—more than enough to power the whole of New York City.

<p><span>As technological advances continue to build out the digital economy it is perhaps ironic that physical locations still seem to matter so much. Slack and Twitter and Zoom and a host of various collaboration software products have facilitated our ability to communicate with people from all around the world. And yet, up-and-coming founders will still pay 3x the national average in rent so that they can live in Silicon Valley or Manhattan. Despite our ever-improving virtual tools, the triumph of the city is not reversing anytime soon. And the countries with the most vibrant tech clusters will get to decide the pace and the direction of the future. We need both a better understanding of how tech clusters form and how we can maximize their benefits.</span></p>
<h3><b>Why and how do tech clusters form?&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Economists and urbanists talk a lot about the significance of clustered networks of individuals and firms working and living together in a shared environment. All else equal, having more smart people interacting leads to more ideas which leads to more innovation which leads to more growth. The whole ecosystem of product designers, scientists, engineers, supply chain managers, investors, and academics ends up creating more than the sum of their parts. These </span><a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/"><span>agglomeration effects</span></a><span> occur in cities across the world, but the US has had a unique geopolitical advantage in having the premier industrial clusters for essential technologies like software development and machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span>Defined </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.3.50"><span>formally</span></a><span>, we could say that an industrial or tech cluster is a geographic region with a disproportionate share of economic activity, high-skilled technical employment, granted patents, and R&amp;D funding when compared to their share of the national population. Less formally, we could say that tech clusters are in the cities where the most interesting conversations and cutting-edge applications in a particular field are happening.</span></p>

<p><span>San Francisco is the archetypal example, but Boston, Seattle, Austin, and Denver all meet this threshold as well. Larger cities like New York and Los Angeles are more ambiguous, as their share compared to population size is not disproportionate, but narrowing the analysis to a subregion like Manhattan or Santa Monica would likely turn up a traditional tech cluster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Historically, clusters have been pivotal in driving long-term US growth and for creating innovations that improve the lives of billions of people around the globe. As economists </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.3.50"><span>William Kerr and Frederic Robert-Nicoud</span></a><span> summarize, there has been a continual movement of leading tech clusters over time in the US. In the 1800s, Lowell, Massachusetts was the center for textile mills relying on water power. By the early 1900s, Cleveland, Ohio was instrumental in pushing forward the frontier on electricity and steel. Detroit, Michigan, of course, developed into the powerhouse for automobile manufacturing in the mid-1900s.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, US tech clusters are the envy of the world. There are only four </span><a href="https://howmuch.net/articles/companies-trillion-dollar-club"><span>trillion dollar companies</span></a><span> in the world. Two of them are based near San Francisco (Apple and Alphabet), and two near Seattle (Amazon and Microsoft). Of the </span><a href="https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/#view/12"><span>global top 30</span></a><span> Internet firms, 14 are based in SF alone.</span></p>
<p><span>The effects that these clusters have on innovation and productivity growth are quite impressive, even on the individual level. Enrico Moretti </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26270"><span>models their impact</span></a><span>: “a computer scientist moving from the median cluster in computer science (Gainesville, FL) to the cluster at the 75th percentile of size (Richmond, VA) would experience a 12.0% increase in productivity, holding constant the inventor and the firm. In biology and chemistry, a move from the median cluster—Boise, ID—to the 75th percentile cluster—State College, PA—is associated with a productivity gain of 8.4%, holding constant the inventor and the firm.” And as the clusters get larger and more specialized, the productivity boosts also get larger.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While the benefits and significance of tech clusters are fairly well established, what is less well known is precisely how tech clusters originate and why they end up in the specific places they do. That software clustered near San Francisco was not inevitable, that auto manufacturing clustered in Detroit was not fate, that semiconductor fabrication today clusters in Taiwan is not preordained. So how do clusters arise?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the past, clusters would frequently populate around a specific natural resource that was necessary for the operation of the tech in question, i.e. natural harbors, coal and iron deposits, fast-flowing streams. But the ultimate resources for technology development today are the human minds that can come up with and then implement new ideas. So tech clusters today are mostly about attracting and organizing talented humans in cities they would actually want to live in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>More formally, to become a tech cluster today, a location needs:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>An anchor organization as a first-mover in getting high-skilled talent in a particular field to come to a region (usually a firm or a university)&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>An urban environment in which firms and workers in adjacent sectors can benefit from large knowledge spillovers as new advances and technical approaches diffuse across the region quickly</span></li>
<li><span>The development of high-velocity labor markets where workers with deep technical expertise can quickly start, join, or leave various firms</span></li>
<li><span>A social scene that is animated by a particular industry or technology area such that the conversations happening in local bars are some of the best in the world for that subfield</span></li>
<li><span>A sufficient supply of industry-specific resources (venture capitalists, relevant scientific or manufacturing infrastructure, government contracts)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>A good bit of luck</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>It’s worth emphasizing that the development of a cluster is a process rather than a flip that is switched at a specific moment in time. A location may not have all of these elements right at the very beginning but will need to quickly develop them if it wants to have staying power beyond an initial flash in the pan. Also complicating things, some of these factors suffer from a chicken-or-the-egg problem as it is much easier to attract specialized capital and interested young people to a region once the cluster already exists.</span></p>
<p><span>The historical accidents of particular government policies can sometimes serve as a tiebreaker among competing destinations. One reason that Silicon Valley may have become the primary driver for software development rather than the Boston area is California’s decision to </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/2/13/14580874/google-self-driving-noncompetes"><span>not enforce non-compete agreements</span></a><span>. While not necessarily the intention, this accelerated both the degree of knowledge spillovers and the velocity of labor markets in the region. Today, top developers at large tech companies frequently leave to start competitors and help cutting-edge practices and the more promising technical approaches diffuse quickly throughout the region. This may be frustrating for the particular firms losing out, but it makes the larger tech cluster more vibrant and dynamic. And by increasing the number of approaches attempted to solve an issue, it increases the odds of a breakthrough innovation happening.</span></p>
<p><span>But tech clusters don’t necessarily last forever. As an industry matures and becomes more established it tends to be less reliant on the kind of rapid experimentation and ideation that is facilitated so well by tech clusters. As that happens, an industry may disperse over a larger set of regions, or be subsumed into a more traditional urban agglomeration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unsurprisingly, it seems to be the case that the development of a new </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w11093"><span>general-purpose technology</span></a><span> is usually a prime candidate for allowing new tech clusters to form. But interestingly, there may be a bias towards slightly smaller cities that can operate as more a blank slate for the fledgling industry than can a large, established city.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Looking at the emergence of auto manufacturing as an example, despite having fewer initial entrants and a smaller population, activity started to concentrate in smaller cities like St. Louis, Cleveland, Indianapolis, and in the ultimate winner, Detroit. According to </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.3.50"><span>Kerr and Robert-Nicoud</span></a><span>, this smaller city advantage may have been due to the higher physical proximity of engineers, production line managers, and funders as it was easier to share prototypes, run experiments, and circulate ideas between the relevant stakeholders. These smaller regional hubs may have been able to provide more attention and financial resources to these new firms because there was simply less competition.</span></p>
<p><span>This should not be all too surprising when we consider the softer, cultural aspects that make up an attractive tech cluster. It seems likely that the culture of a city made up disproportionately of geneticists and CRISPR scientists might differ from that of petroleum engineers and fracking specialists. Having a separate city is useful for establishing a different culture and offers a type of specialization that can attract a separate set of weird, ambitious young people that will form the backbone of a cluster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The conversations in the bars and social scenes of San Francisco feel </span><i><span>very different</span></i><span> from those in the financial district of NYC because the types of people attracted to those cities are very different. To truly become a cluster for a particular field, a city essentially has to reach some critical density of conversations in the social scene to be …</span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/algae/static/images/algae-cover.jpg"></p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has published six assessment reports on future climate scenarios with recommended methods of reducing carbon in the atmosphere. The most common of these reports focus on methods by which we can reduce the rate of global warming by 1.5–2°C per year. Scientists use these levels as a benchmark: scientists estimate that 1.5–2°C of warming <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/were-almost-out-of-time-the-alarming-ipcc-climate-report-and-what-to-do-next/">over the next 10 years</a> will cause irreversible changes to Earth’s climate. In 2017, we breached the 1°C warming mark.</p><p>The IPCC has outlined four potential pathways for how the world can avoid these dramatic changes to our environment. According to their research, if we want a chance of staying below 1.5°C, it won’t be by simply reducing emissions—we also need to be actively removing CO₂ from the atmosphere. All of the IPCC’s pathways that would lead to a world below 1.5 degrees of warming <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-ipccs-special-report-on-climate-change-at-one-point-five-c">require</a> <strong>both reducing and removing CO₂</strong>.</p><div><p>A dire scenario</p><p>The IPCC uses four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to to demonstrate the effects of action or inaction on CO₂ levels in the atmosphere.

Methods of reduction you’ve likely heard of—solar panels, windmills, plant-based diets. At a global scale, these changes would reduce the amount of energy we use and limit our reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p><span><span><div><hr><div><p>Get updates from the Parametric Press</p></div><hr></div></span></span></p><p>On the other side are methods of removal—things that actively suck carbon dioxide out of our atmosphere. Carbon removal includes things like planting more trees and other plants that naturally absorb CO₂. A carbon removal plan might also include newer technologies that use something called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (usually called BECCS, but more on that later).</p><p>This is a story about how we could get there; a story about trees and algae and giant human-sized bioreactors; and ultimately, a story about how maybe our solutions, no matter how innovative, should really be reflecting the natural world around us.</p><h2 id="the-hope-of-a-trillion-trees">The hope of a trillion trees</h2><p>At Davos earlier this year, the World Economic Forum announced a <a text="plan to plant one trillion trees" url="https://www.1t.org/" href="https://www.1t.org/">plan to plant one trillion trees</a> over the next decade. The campaign received widespread approval and enthusiasm from attendees, and even received backing from President Trump through a <a text="recent executive order" url="https://www.axios.com/trump-one-trillion-trees-climate-change-forestry-1f4c32b7-9514-410b-a4dc-b2c6ecee72e0.html" href="https://www.axios.com/trump-one-trillion-trees-climate-change-forestry-1f4c32b7-9514-410b-a4dc-b2c6ecee72e0.html">recent executive order</a> to promote tree planting. (This may seem surprising coming from the man who notoriously <a text="withdrew" url="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html">withdrew</a> the US from the Paris Agreement on global climate action.)</p><p>But as we’ll see, the possibility of even planting a trillion trees may be more of a political pipedream than an achievable reality.</p><p>A plan for more trees in the world does give us some reason to celebrate. According to a <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/natures-make-or-break-potential-for-climate-change/">study</a> comparing natural climate solutions, the top two methods for cost-effectiveness and carbon reduction are 1) planting more trees (reforestation) and 2) keeping the trees we have now from being destroyed (avoided forest conversion).</p><p>The “trillion” target for number of new trees planted is also supported by research: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76">The global tree restoration potential</a>, a study published last year in <em>Science</em>, claimed that planting 1.2 trillion tree saplings on 1.7 billion hectares could remove “two-thirds of all the emissions from human activities that remain in the atmosphere today.” For scale, this would be the equivalent of reforesting an area of land the size of the United States plus Canada combined.</p></div><div><p>Trees, and plants in general, are very good at the <em>removing CO₂ part</em> of our fight against irreversible climate change. Many people categorize this as a viable carbon sequestration method. But there’s a problem with planting a trillion trees: we first need the amount of land to do it. We also need to keep them alive long enough to help us.</p><h2 id="a-trillion-trees-fall-short">A trillion trees fall short</h2><p>Shortly after releasing the study claiming that 1.7 billion hectares of new forests could drastically reduce emissions, the authors of the study received <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6463/eaay8060/tab-pdf"> a series of sharp rebuttals</a> from the scientific community. Critics claim that the study drastically overestimated the amount of carbon sequestered by trees; alternative models suggest it’s closer to half of what was projected.</p><p>But model estimates aside, the trillion tree plan has a few other significant drawbacks, most important being time and scale. Let’s look at time first.</p><p><span><span>
  Bigger, older trees <a href="https://www.pacificforest.org/ee-old-trees-store-more-carbon-more-quickly-than-younger-trees/">have been shown</a> to be more effective than young trees at reducing CO₂ in the atmosphere. The key is in the leaves: the more time a tree has to generate leaves, the more photosynthesis can happen!</span></span></p><p>Travel booking app Hopper <a href="https://media.hopper.com/news/introducing-hopper-trees">announced</a> earlier this year that for every flight booked through their app, they will donate money to plant four trees. Their back-of-the-envelope math estimates that one tree will sequester around a metric ton of carbon dioxide, which would offset a return trip from a single passenger in the air on a cross country flight. But there’s a problem: Trees don’t spring into the earth fully grown, sucking their max amount of carbon out of the atmosphere.</p><p>Best case estimates show that it will take <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615102/tree-planting-is-a-great-idea-that-could-become-a-dangerous-climate-distraction/">around 25 years</a> before the amount of carbon sequestered matches the amount of carbon emissions for a single person’s share on a single flight (some trees can take up to 100 years to mature fully). So while the strategy may be effective, it won’t help us much in the ~10 years estimated by the IPCC that we have left to prevent irreversible changes to the climate. In fact, a team of scientists at NASA <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2927/examining-the-viability-of-planting-trees-to-help-mitigate-climate-change/">estimate</a> that reforesting 1.7 billion hectares of new trees could take between one and two thousand years.</p></div><div><p>The second obstacle for tree planting is scale. Researchers claim that the available land we have across the world to plant more trees equals about the size of the entire United States (the study from <em>Nature</em> would require land the size of the US <em>plus</em> Canada). But this planting goal also assumes the best case scenario in which humans 1) willingly convert existing land to forests and 2) protect forests with a renewed vigor.</p><p>To take a specific example, let’s look at a single country. The United Kingdom has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. A <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/ccc-one-fifth-of-uk-farmland-must-be-used-to-tackle-climate-change">report</a> this year found that in order to reach that goal, the UK would need to commit 20% of its current farmland to dedicated carbon capture and storage uses. And to have a chance at reaching their targets, they need to start doing that, more or less, right now.</p><p>Converting farmland is not an isolated effort either: Reducing traditional crops by around 20% means the government will also count on people to adopt low-carbon farming practices, reduce food waste, and make diet changes described as “a 20% shift away from beef, lamb and dairy to alternative protein sources.”</p><p>If you apply this concept across the world, the amount of farmland we need to convert is daunting. According to the IPCC report, over 70% of Earth’s ice-free land is being used or shaped by human activity. Around 25–30% of this usable land is going straight to producing food, raising cattle, growing cotton for clothes, and energy production.</p><p>On top of all this, if somehow we did find the 1.7bn hectares of suitable land to plant these trees, we would also need to protect them. When trees die, they release all the CO₂ they have eaten up back to the atmosphere. Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-deforestation/brazil-amazon-deforestation-soars-to-11-year-high-in-2019-idUSKBN1XS1PK">rose by nearly 30% in 2019</a>. On the other side of the globe, bushfires in Australia emitted<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/13/australias-bushfires-have-emitted-250m-tonnes-of-co2-almost-half-of-countrys-annual-emissions"> nearly half</a> of the country’s annual emissions—and that’s on top of Australia’s usual CO₂ output.</p><h3 id="can-you-remove-all-the-co₂-with-trees?">Can you remove all the CO₂ with trees?</h3><p>To fully understand the complications around relying on trees to save the planet, it’s useful to look at how this actually plays out with a simulation. The interactive version is embedded below, but first a few pointers:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/algae/static/images/sim-preview-2.png"></p></div></div><p>Each <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> red dot represents a unit of CO₂. Some studies estimate that a single tree can remove up to 48 lbs CO₂ per year. When a tree sequesters CO₂, it stores this unit as a <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> blue dot. But sadly, sometimes trees are felled, burned, or just die naturally...</p><div><div><p><img src="https://parametric.press/issue-02/algae/static/images/sim-preview-3.png"></p></div></div><p>When a tree does die, it releases all the CO₂ it removed back into the atmosphere. The simulation keeps track of these “deforestation” events, so when an old tree dies, it releases all the dots it once removed from the air. It also tracks how many years we have left to make meaningful changes (as noted earlier, it’s somewhere between 10–30 years depending on who you ask).</p><p>Plant a forest to see how many trees it would take to remove all the CO₂ bubbles. But be careful: When you lose a tree, you also lose the CO₂!</p></div><div><p>As the simulation illustrates, trees are a vital tool to fighting climate change. But when left unprotected, they can end up recycling the same CO₂ over and over again, never having the time to permanently store it away. Previously <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> sequestered CO₂ returns to <span idyll="[object Object]">■</span> historic CO₂. Trees will capture, release, capture, release—and without deforestation prevention, the cycle goes on.</p><p>Planting trees is unquestionably a good idea, but it’s likely not the “silver bullet” solution to fighting climate change. It is simply not enough on its own. We also need to be pursuing new technologies and methods of capturing carbon from the atmosphere, like direct carbon capture from the air. And maybe, we might find inspiration for tackling one of humanity’s biggest technical challenges in one of Earth’s smallest life forms: algae.</p><h2 id="how-algae-removes-co₂-from-the-atmosphere">How algae removes CO₂ from the atmosphere</h2><p>You’ve probably seen algae before—it’s floating about on ponds and washing up on shores as kelp seaweed. It takes many different forms, though. Algae can be as small as 0.2mm in picoplankton and as large as 60m long in the form of giant sea kelp. And incredibly, when you take all the types of algae together, this family of flora produces about half of all oxygen on the planet.</p></div><div><p>In recent years, there has been a …</p></div></div>

  <p>To recognise a chair or a dog, our brain separates objects into their individual properties and then puts them back together. Until recently, it has remained unclear what these properties are.

          The human brain breaks down the environment into a total of 49 properties, which are sufficient to categorise all objects. Depending on how similar the observed object is to a known category, it is then recognised as a dog or, for instance, a piece of furniture.

<p>We live in a world full of things that we have to identify and classify into different categories. Only when you are able to identify the things around you, you can communicate with others about them and act in a meaningful way. If we see something in front of us that we recognise as a chair, we can sit on it. Once we have identified an object as a cup, we can lift it up and drink from it.</p>
<p>In order to carry out this mapping and make sense of our environment, we have to constantly compare the input to our senses with the information we have already learned. To do this, the brain breaks down an object into its individual properties, compares them with those that are already known, and puts these properties back together. Depending on how similar the observed object is to a known category, it is then recognised as a piece of furniture or a vessel. So far, however, it has remained unclear how we consider things to be similar or less similar. In other words, what are the characteristics that make us recognise objects?</p>
<p>Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, USA, have now identified a set of 49 properties that allow us to determine almost all objects, i.e. the properties underlying their so-called mental representation. This representation reflects the format into which the brain translates a stimulus. In the case of an object, it is composed of, for example, colour, shape and size, but perhaps also of the fact that it "is natural", "can move", "is valuable" or "is animal-related". The researchers had been looking for the set of dimensions that were interpretable and minimally sufficient, i.e. that contained as few properties as possible and yet were enough to describe everything.</p>

<p>"Our results show that it actually takes surprisingly few dimensions to characterise all objects in our environment," says Martin Hebart, first author of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00951-3" target="_blank">article describing these results</a>. The human brain breaks down the environment into a total of 49 properties, which are sufficient to categorise all objects. "From these dimensions we can also infer what is perceived as particularly similar or what is perceived as particularly typical for a category," the neuroscientist continues. Whether, for example, a mussel or a dog is perceived as a more typical animal. "Fundamentally, this explains the basic principles of our thinking about objects."</p>
<p>However, the results could also be used for medical purposes. Until now, it was believed that patients who cannot identify certain animals because of brain damage would not be able to recognise animals as a whole. But it is possible that the patient has a deficit in recognising the characteristic "fluffy" that is a property of many animals. This may then lead to other forms of therapy.</p>
<p>The scientists investigated these relationships with the help of almost 2,000 pictures of objects representative of most things encountered in our environment.&nbsp; They then showed study participants three of the pictures at a time, for example, koala, dog and fish, but also koala, doormat and pretzel. From each of these, the participants were asked to choose the “odd one out”, the one that they perceived to be most different from the other two. In the case of koala, doormat, and pretzel, for some this might have been the koala, because, unlike the other two, it is a living creature or is considered "not flat". For others, it might have been the pretzel, because doormats and koalas are fluffy or you can only eat the pretzel. Yet for others, it might be the doormat, because it is made of inorganic material. This means that the answers are not always clear, but they highlight the relevant properties to find out all the core dimensions of objects.</p>
<p>The researchers tested almost 1.5 million combinations of three objects with the help of nearly 5,500 participants. From this, they developed a computational model which they used to calculate which object was most likely to be chosen to be the odd one out. The more often two objects are left in, the more similar they are. It turned out that their model enabled the scientists to predict the similarity of two objects very precisely. But it also provided the 49 core dimensions that enable us to categorise our world according to simple criteria.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we are thrilled to announce the Turing Pi V2. We’ve been collecting a massive amount of information, synthesizing all of it in product variations, and thinking about what steps we should do next. Today we are going to announce only some of the fundamental details about the V2. We are still working on checking some of the hypotheses, but believe me, the other parts of the announcement will be exciting too. We will disclose more closer to opening orders.</p><p>After we released the original 7 nodes Turing Pi, we had many questions. What to do next, how to increase the product’s value, what compute modules to choose, how many nodes, etc. We decided to determine the minimal cluster block size with options to connect hard drives and extension boards. The cluster block should be a self-sustained base node and with ample scope of scale. Next, we wanted the minimum cluster blocks to have an option to connect and form cluster federations and, at the same time, be cost-efficient and easy to scale. The speed of scale should be higher than connecting regular computers on the network and cheaper than the typical server hardware. Another thing, the minimum cluster units should be compact enough, mobile, energy-efficient, cost-effective, and easy to maintain. This is one of the key differences between server racks and everything related to them.</p><h3>Number of nodes</h3><p>To determine the minimal cluster unit, we started by picking the optimal number of nodes. By simple logical judgments, we realized that a 4 nodes cluster is the best option. One node is not a cluster. Two nodes, not enough – 1 master and 1 worker doesn’t give too many options to scale within the block, especially for heterogeneous options. Three nodes look better but still limited to scale the block. We decided to choose 4 nodes option. More than 4 nodes would be either more expensive for PoC or challenging to fit into the mini ITX form factor.</p><p>We believe 4 nodes is a golden median because:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The more affordable production cost of the cluster board and allows getting a more affordable fully equipped cluster as a result</li><li>A more solid architecture with 1 main node and 3 workers</li><li>More heterogeneous variations with general-compute + accelerated-compute</li></ul><h3>Compute modules</h3><figure><img width="1024" height="621" src="https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-1024x621.jpg" data-src="https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-1024x621.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-1024x621.jpg 1024w, https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-768x466.jpg 768w, https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-1536x932.jpg 1536w, https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-600x364.jpg 600w, https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1.jpg 1973w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-1024x621.jpg 1024w, https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-768x466.jpg 768w, https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-1536x932.jpg 1536w, https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1-600x364.jpg 600w, https://turingpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/03-1.jpg 1973w"><figcaption>Turing Pi Compute Module with Raspberry Pi 4 support</figcaption></figure><p>While searching the compute modules, we opened a whole market—various modules with 128 MB RAM to 8 GB RAM. We are expecting to see 16 Gb RAM options soon too. For hosting cloud-native apps on the edge, 1 GB of RAM is already not enough, and the recent appearance of modules with 2, 4, and even 8 GB of RAM provides good space for growth. We also considered options with FPGA modules for machine learning but decided to hold on to this because the software ecosystem is still not mature enough. While studying the compute modules market, we came up with ​​creating a unified compute module interface that we are implementing in the Turing Pi 2. This will allow connecting compute modules from other manufacturers and also combine different purpose modules to solve specific tasks.</p><p>Today we are announcing V2 support for the Raspberry Pi 4 Compute Module (CM4), including Lite and 8 GB RAM versions.</p><figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center"><strong>General-Purpose Modules</strong></th><th data-align="center"><strong>Cores</strong></th><th data-align="center"><strong>RAM, GB</strong></th><th data-align="center"><strong><strong>Storage, GB</strong></strong></th><th data-align="center"><strong>Network, Gbps</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.1-lite</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">SD</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.2-lite</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">2</td><td data-align="center">SD</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.4-lite</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">SD</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.8-lite</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">8</td><td data-align="center">SD</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.1-8</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">8</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.2-8</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">2</td><td data-align="center">8</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.4-8</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">8</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.8-8</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">8</td><td data-align="center">8</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.1-16</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">16</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.2-16</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">2</td><td data-align="center">16</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.4-16</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">16</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.8-16</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">8</td><td data-align="center">16</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.1_32</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">1</td><td data-align="center">32</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.2_32</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">2</td><td data-align="center">32</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.4_32</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">32</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">pi4.8_32</td><td data-align="center">4</td><td data-align="center">8</td><td data-align="center">32</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Turing Pi Compute Modules</figcaption></figure><h3>Peripherals</h3><p>After determining the compute modules vendor and the number of nodes, we started to study the PCI bus option. The PCI bus is a standard for peripheral devices, and it is found in almost all compute modules. We have several nodes and ideally so that each node can share PCI devices in concurrent request mode. For example, if a hard drive is connected to the bus, it is available to all nodes. We started looking for PCI switches with multi-host support and found that none of them fit our requirements. These solutions were mostly limited to 1 host or multi-hosts, but no concurrent endpoints request mode. The second problem is the high cost of $50 or more per chip. In the Turing Pi 2, we decided to postpone experiments with PCI switches and return to this later as we mature. So far, we decided to assign a role for each node along the path: the first two nodes are exposed to mini PCI express port, the third node is exposed to 2-ports 6 Gbps SATA controller. You can use the network file system within the cluster to access hard drives from other nodes. Why not?</p><h3>Sketches &amp; result</h3><p>We decided to share some sketches of how the minimal cluster unit evolved over time through discussions and observations.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td

With V2, it’s affordable to start a proof-of-concept and scale as you grow, gradually migrating applications that are more cost-effective and practical to host on the edge. Cluster blocks can be linked together and form larger clusters. This can be done sequentially without interrupting already established processes. There are already a huge number of business applications to<a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> host apps locally</a>.</p><h4>ARM Workstation</h4><p>With up to 32 GB of RAM per cluster unit, the first node can be used to run the desktop version of the OS, for example Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS. The remaining 3 nodes can be used for compilation, testing, debugging tasks, and development of cloud-native solutions for ARM clusters.</p><p>The Turing V2 cluster is architecturally similar to the AWS Graviton clusters. The CM4 processor uses the ARMv8 architecture. You can build images and applications for AWS instances of Graviton 1 and 2, which are known to be much cheaper than x86 instances.</p><figure></figure><p>Turing V2 can easily be included in the existing clusters (cloud or on-premises) and shared with other participants using Kubernetes RBAC.</p><h3>Wrapout</h3><p>The Turing Pi 2 is more functional than V1 and we also expect it to be cheaper to manufacture.</p><p>We are very grateful to everyone who supported us and baked the Turing Pi project by purchasing the Turing Pi V1. The Turing Pi 2 wouldn’t be possible without your support. As a way to thank our supporters, we will offer 25% off for the Turing Pi 2 for everyone who purchased the V1.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s it for now. We hope you are excited about the upcoming V2 which we plan to release next year. We will post more updates on the progress along the way. Stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]>

What determines how successful you are is how quickly you're able to react to what happens in the world.”</em></p><p>Sean Harper is the CEO and co-founder of Kin Insurance, a Chicago-based home insurance start-up focused on using technology to offer homeowners the lowest rates as quickly as possible. He does so in an industry known for moving slowly. “We believe in creating meaningful change for homeowners who need our solution the most,” Harper says of Kin. Prior to founding Kin in 2016, Harper founded Fee Fighters, later sold to Groupon, and TSS-Radio, an e-commerce company. Prior to Kin, both Harper and co-founder Lucas Ward consulted for top financial companies, including several for PNC.&nbsp;</p><p>Kin offers home insurance in Florida and California, both states known for their catastrophe exposure. Kin recently closed a $35 million Series B funding round led by Commerce Ventures, which brings its total funding to date to $90 million.&nbsp;</p><p>In this interview:</p><ul><li>How Harper moved from consulting to start-ups to founding Kin</li><li>The 3 criteria Harper wanted in creating a start-up</li><li>How Kin innovates compared to legacy insurance companies</li><li>Kin’s entry into catastrophe insurance coverage</li><li>Why Kin is better at underwriting insurance than legacy companies</li><li>The future of insurance online and the value of real customer service</li><li>Kin’s culture, early experiments and what Kin is focusing on next&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>I would love to hear about your background and how you came about founding Kin.</strong></p><p>My co-founder Lucas and I have been doing online financial services for a long time. We just sort of fell into the start-up thing and realized we liked it a lot. The great thing about consulting gigs is you get to see a lot of stuff that big companies aren't doing very well. We really enjoy doing start-ups because you can start with a blank sheet of paper and do it the right way. If you're a software geek, which we both are, you look around for problems that are easy for you to solve. Financial services are easy to solve because it's all online. There's no physical product to worry about. And we're good at online stuff. And really I think if you look at the core of a bank or an insurance company or stock trading company, they're actually software companies, but they're not very good at software. We’re a few companies in now. We’re good at it now, building financial companies from scratch.</p><p><strong>Were you in or around the insurance area at all?</strong></p><p>Almost all the consulting I did was in financial services and the same for Lucas. We worked at, between the two of us, probably three of the five top P&amp;C financial companies. Basically, Lucas and I had come out of selling our companies and we were kicking around for two and a half years trying to come up with our big idea. In the meantime, we were doing interim gigs for private equity backed companies. We didn't want to sell technology to big financial institutions because their adoption cycles are so slow. We wanted to go direct to the consumer and beyond that, we were looking for three criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>First, I wanted to be in a large and homogenous market. Second, I wanted it to be a market where it was very inefficient. I didn't want to have to win on underwriting at the onset, because it's really hard to win on underwriting until you have data. Now we have a bunch of data. And we have a huge underwriting advantage over our competitors, but on day one, I didn't want to have to do that because it's a good way to get blown up. The third thing I wanted was for there to be new data sources available for pricing and underwriting.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn't just look at insurance. We looked at all financial services. We found catastrophe-exposed homeowners insurance. It fits all those criteria. It's a $40 billion market and growing fast to extraordinarily inefficient expense ratios. The amount of money that's wasted is about 40% of every dollar they collect. And there's just a ton of data out there – the weather that's around the home, geography, the neighborhood, the construction.&nbsp;</p><p>Most insurance companies are underwriting on the same 20 to 40 fields of data that's all self reported or agent reported. They're basically doing it the same way they've been doing it for 100 years. The business model has changed and the main way it's changed since we've climbed our way up the stack is we started as a digital broker, similar to a company like Zebra or Gabi, and then we became an MGA, which is sort of a virtual insurance company. And then last year, we actually formed our own insurance entity. We did that because it's really hard to raise enough money to start an insurance company on day one. We had to build our way to it. We learned a lot at each stage that made us know we were ready to go to the next stage.</p><p><strong>You operate on this specific segment of the home insurance market: catastrophe-prone homes.</strong></p><p>In the United States, there's about 100 billion dollars of premium spent every year on homeowners insurance. It's growing 3% to 4% a year, and of that 100 billion, 40 billion of it is catastrophe exposed. It's a huge niche and it is clear that the weather is getting worse. Let’s hope we can reverse that, but it's not going to happen overnight. We're going to need to deal with it by having good insurance that allows us to spread the risk out, ready to deal with it by investing and hardening our homes to make them more weather resilient. So, we find our work meaningful because we're working on insurance for people who need it. And I think it's only a matter of time. Here in Chicago, we're pretty sheltered from extreme weather, but it is affecting more and more places. And so even more of the market will end up being catastrophe exposed next year and year after year.</p><p><strong>Why are you guys better at underwriting your home insurance than someone else?</strong></p><p>We are much more efficient at administering and servicing. We talked about the cost structure before. About 60% goes to pay claims and about 40% goes to other stuff. For us, that 40% is more like 8%, so we're just very efficient. We don't pay brokers. Brokers occupy about 17% of that 40%. We're very efficient at marketing and we have a very good tech system. Your average insurance company spends about 5% of premiums for their IT on an ongoing basis. Yet, their biggest problem is their tech doesn't work. We’re also really good now at understanding the physical properties of the home and the micro environment around it. We know the difference in risk between being the second house off the water and the fourth house off the water in California. Are you right next to the brush land or is there a road between you and the brush land? Because it makes a huge difference. And we're able to ingest all this data and understand on a micro basis which homes are more or less risky. Then we're able to price it properly.</p><p><strong>What’s stopping a legacy insurer from utilizing the same types of data that you do?</strong></p><p>In theory, nothing. In fact, four years ago, the way we came up with this idea was by going around and talking to a lot of people from the industry and finding all the smart things that they wish they could do but couldn't. At the core, every insurance company actually is a software company. We have a really cutting edge policy administration system, our core processing system. It's leaps and bounds better than what any of our competitors have. It does exactly what we need it to do and it's really easy to change. So if we want to launch a new product or add a new data source, these are the kinds of things that might take us hours and take our competitors years. What determines how successful you are is how quickly you're able to react to what happens in the world. Our competitors are not able to react quickly.</p><p><strong>You said that you're able to issue new products at a faster rate. What are some examples?</strong></p><p>We saw an opportunity to do insurance for manufactured homes, a very underserved market, in Florida, which is also underserved because of its catastrophe exposure. We actually launched that product in less than a month, including regulatory approval, and that&nbsp;doesn't happen in insurance.</p><p><strong>A surprising amount of insurance is still being sold through physical agents, not online. How do you view that? Is the wind ultimately blowing in your direction for insurance being purchased online?</strong></p><p>I just turned 40 so I'm sort of borderline millennial and I was sure I was building this for people my age and younger. Amazingly – we realized this three months after we launched and it's still true – our average customer is in their mid 50s. It shouldn't be that surprising. The average age of a homeowner is late 40s, and in Florida, it's higher. But then you start talking to these people and the thing is, they all bank online. Their retirement accounts are all online; they all have the Capital One or Amex credit card. Even they think it's weird to buy insurance at a store.&nbsp;</p><p>We do a lot of customer support on the phone and via email with a real human. Being techie does not mean that you need to be inhuman. If you think about our name, it's Kin. That's family. I don't send automated messages to my children. I talk to them in person. That's how families act with each other. So it doesn't need to be impersonal just because it's tech-based. That's a really big part of who we are. We like having this human element. A home is somebody's biggest asset for the most part. It's nice to be able to ask a person a question like, “Hey, I saw this on the website. Can you explain that to me?” So that actually is a huge role in our customer experience.</p><p><strong>How’s business been in the past five or six months, given that most of the current climate has changed?</strong></p><p>There's been no impact on consumer demand. Probably the biggest impact for us has been operationally. We've been operating remotely. We're located in Tampa and Chicago and we like our office. We like hanging out with each other. We like going for drinks after work. We like playing ping pong. We like working on the …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>It has been a big year for realizing the limits of technology for interacting with people. Gamers have known this for a long time. Lag, disconnections, and coordination issues were problems in gaming since the start. There is a platform that has gone a long way in solving those problems: Discord.</p>



<p>Discord allows people to talk and chat online. Servers are created by anybody to talk about anything, usually, it is a friend group or a shared interest. They contain chat channels (kind of like Slack) and voice channels that are always on and allow people to join and leave whenever they want.</p>



<p>The competition between internet communication platforms is fierce. Discord wasn’t early to voice channels or group chats. They weren’t unique for targeting their offering to gamers. Other platforms have the same features as them. Yet they are a multi-billion dollar business. How? To borrow an idea from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/@sarahtavel/how-to-build-an-enduring-multi-billion-dollar-business-hint-create-a-10x-product-recast-3527df2b8fcb" target="_blank">Sarah Tavel</a>, they built a 10x better product AND capture more value from it.</p>



<h2>10x Better</h2>



<p>Voice chat sucked for a long time. Skype, which was long the most popular option, was a mess. It forced you to call people. Servers went down often. The application crashed. Chats were all over the place. There is a good reason people do not use Skype and it is because it sucks.</p>



<p>There were other competitors like IRC, TeamSpeak, Mumble, Ventrilo. All had basically the same features, voice calls, and chat. Each suffered from a combination of problems like:</p>



<ul><li>Complicated setup process. Any new member must also go through a setup process.</li><li>Paid hosting. No one wanted to pay when there were free options. Especially true as servers grow.</li><li>Unclear benefits. Convincing one person was not enough, you needed to convince your whole group of the benefits of switching.</li><li>Weird ideological reasons. Your platform was your tribal affiliation, switching means abandoning your tribe. Everyone looked down on people who didn’t use the same platform as them (even if it was jokingly).</li></ul>



<p>Discord launched in May 2015, long after the competitors listed above. They are now more successful than those same competitors. They did so by making the experience 10x better:</p>



<ul><li>Discord requires nearly no setup. Starting a server on Discord takes two clicks. Creating channels is two clicks. It works instantly and all the time.</li><li>Discord is free.</li><li>It is easy to switch to Discord. Inviting people is two clicks and a paste. Joining a server (once you have an account) is two clicks. It is so simple you don’t even think about it.</li><li>Non-core features like emoji support, reactions, bots, integrations, video calls, and screen-sharing all work as well as you could ask.</li><li>Big community servers for games, fanbases, organizations, hobbies, and more.</li></ul>



<p>Improvements in each of these areas add up to a 10x better experience than other platforms. I complain about Discord way less than I complain about Skype. There are benefits for everyone on Discord, which makes it a 10x experience both for groups and individuals.</p>



<p>On top of being 10x better, the core features are free. This causes an obvious business problem, how do you make money? There isn’t an obvious place to put ads. Competitors often charge by the member, but that incentivizes against growth. Discord figured out a way to incentivize growth while capturing value from large and small groups. </p>



<h2>Sell Status to Capture Value</h2>



<p>It took Discord a long time to figure out monetization (and they still are figuring it out). Venture capital allowed them to experiment with ideas such as selling games and membership. Neither worked perfectly, but they pointed in the right direction. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/06/30/discord-was-once-the-alt-rights-favorite-chat-app-now-its-gone-mainstream-and-scored-a-new-35-billion-valuation/#article-0-topx-1:~:text=Discord%20is%20on%20track%20to%20top,Discord%20groups%20that%20they%20belong%20to." target="_blank">Forbes estimated</a> they are “on track to top $120 million in sales this year (2020)… up from around $70 million last year.”</p>



<p>To understand Discord’s monetization, look at their history. The founders previously started game companies and were <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)#cite_ref-vb_2015_funding_9-0:~:text=%5D%20Their%20first%20product%20was%20Fates,and%20based%20on%20more%20modern%20technology.%5B" target="_blank">inspired by free-to-play games like League of Legends.</a> Games like League of Legends sell status. It is free-to-play but you can buy “skins” to make your character look different. If you have a cool or expensive skin, it means you care more about the game. It raises your status. Discord does the same.</p>



<p>Discord allows users to raise their status through a subscription called Nitro. It provides quality improvements (file size and video quality), special profile upgrades (more emojis, animated profile photos, custom tags), and most importantly, the ability to “boost” a server.</p>



<p>Boosts raise a user’s status in both small and large servers. They allow you to either improve your friend’s online hangout and your communities’ experience by unlocking custom emotes, cosmetic features, and quality improvements. For users, it puts an icon next to their name saying they contribute and gives them a special booster role on the server. In short, it is a way for someone to pay to stand out.</p>

<p>You can buy boosts separately from Nitro at $5 per month or $50 per year. Perks come in uneven tiers: Level 1 is 2 boosts, Level 2 is 15 boosts, Level 3 is 30 boosts. It is unlikely “friend group sized” servers get past two boosts, but large servers often pass thirty. Some examples:</p>

<p>Here are 14 popular servers accounting for nearly $250,000 in revenue per year. There are tons more, all with varying amounts of boosts. People are willing to pay to stand out, even when there is no obvious benefit. This is universal.</p>



<p>Every community needs a place to communicate online. Discord has the best offering, and it is free. Other platforms either force you to pay by the member or have a flat rate paid by the community host. Discord doesn’t require either. Servers can grow as large as they want for free, moderators and admins don’t have to pay, and Discord still makes money.</p>



<p>As communities continue to grow on Discord, the money Discord makes from those communities goes up as well. Flat rates and tiers limit this. Communities want to grow, Discord provides them with an easy and effective way to do that. Users want status, Discord gives them a shortcut. This aligns incentives better than advertising or paid memberships do.</p>



<hr>



<p>Discord won by building 10x better spaces for communities. By selling status, they have also managed to capture more value from those communities than other platforms.</p>



<p>Discord won the competition for the gaming chat platform of choice, and now it wants to be the platform for all internet communities. This means they will be competing with the “big dogs” like Slack, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, and Epic. Their free-to-play, pay-for-status monetization model is a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Discord is a successful company. The question becomes how successful can they become? The key is the number of internet communities who choose Discord as their home. By creating a better product than competitors and being free for growth, Discord puts itself in an excellent position to continue to succeed moving forward.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">


          

            <p>About a lifetime ago (5 years), I wrote a <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2015-12-14-yubikey-howto/">tutorial on how to
configure my Yubikey for OpenPGP signing, SSH authentication and SSH
2FA</a>. In there, I used the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/">libpam-oath</a>
PAM plugin for authentication, but it turns out that had too many
problems: <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=807992">users couldn't edit their own 2FA tokens</a> and I had to
patch it to <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=807990">avoid forcing 2FA on all users</a>. The latter was merged
in the Debian package, but never upstream, and the former was never
fixed at all. So I started looking at alternatives and found the
<a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam/">Google Authenticator libpam plugin</a>. A priori, it's designed to
work with phones and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator">Google Authenticator app</a>, but there's no
reason why it shouldn't work with hardware tokens like the
Yubikey. Both use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-based_One-time_Password_algorithm">standard HOTP protocol</a> so it should "just
work".</p>

<p>After some fiddling, it turns out I was right and you <em>can</em>
authenticate with a Yubikey over SSH. Here's that procedure so you
don't have to second-guess it yourself.</p>






<p>On Debian, the PAM module is shipped in the <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/google-authenticator">google-authenticator</a>
source package:</p>

<pre><code>apt install libpam-google-authenticator
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to add the module in your PAM stack somewhere. Since I
only use it for SSH, I added this line on top of <code>/etc/pam.d/sshd</code>:</p>

<pre><code>auth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok
</code></pre>

<p>I also used <code>no_increment_hotp debug</code> while debugging to avoid having
to renew the token all the time and have more information about
failures in the logs.</p>

<p>Then reload ssh (not sure that's actually necessary):</p>

<pre><code>service ssh reload
</code></pre>



<p>To create a new key, run this command on the server:</p>

<pre><code>google-authenticator -c
</code></pre>

<p>This will prompt you for a bunch of questions. To get them all right,
I prefer to just call the right ones on the commandline directly:</p>

<pre><code>google-authenticator --counter-based --qr-mode=NONE --rate-limit=1 --rate-time=30 --emergency-codes=1 --window-size=3
</code></pre>

<p>Those are actually the defaults, if my memory serves me right, except
for the <code>--qr-mode</code> and <code>--emergency-codes</code> (which can't be disabled
so I only print one). I disable the QR code display because I won't be
using the codes on my phone, but you would obviously keep it if you
want to use the app.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the encoding (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548#section-5">base32</a>) produced by the
<code>google-authenticator</code> command is not compatible with the token
expected by the <code>ykpersonalize</code> command used to configure the Yubikey
(<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548#page-8">base16</a> AKA "hexadecimal", with a fixed 20 bytes length). So you
need a way to convert between the two. I wrote a program called
<a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/scripts/blob/master/oath-convert">oath-convert</a> which basically does this:</p>

<pre><code>read base32
add padding
convert to hex
print
</code></pre>

<p>Or, in Python:</p>

<div><pre><span>def</span> <span>convert_b32_b16</span><span>(</span>data_b32<span>):</span>
    remainder <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>data_b32<span>) %</span> <span>8</span>
    <span>if</span> remainder <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
        <span># XXX: assume 6 chars are missing, the actual padding may vary:</span>
        <span># https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3548#section-5</span>
        data_b32 <span>+=</span> <span>"======"</span>
    data_b16 <span>=</span> base64<span>.</span><span>b32decode</span><span>(</span>data_b32<span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>data_b16<span>) &lt;</span> <span>20</span><span>:</span>
        <span># pad to 20 bytes</span>
        data_b16 <span>+=</span> b<span>"</span><span>\x00</span><span>"</span> <span>* (</span><span>20</span> <span>-</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span>data_b16<span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> binascii<span>.</span><span>hexlify</span><span>(</span>data_b16<span>).</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span><span>"ascii"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the code assumes a certain token length and will not work
correctly for other sizes. To use the program, simply call it with:</p>

<pre><code>head -1 .google_authenticator | oath-convert
</code></pre>

<p>Then you paste the output in the prompt:</p>

<pre><code>$ ykpersonalize -1 -o oath-hotp -o append-cr -a
Firmware version 3.4.3 Touch level 1541 Program sequence 2
 HMAC key, 20 bytes (40 characters hex) : [SECRET GOES HERE]

Configuration data to be written to key configuration 1:

fixed: m:
uid: n/a
key: h:[SECRET REDACTED]
acc_code: h:000000000000
OATH IMF: h:0
ticket_flags: APPEND_CR|OATH_HOTP
config_flags: 
extended_flags: 

Commit? (y/n) [n]: y
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you must NOT pass the <code>-o oath-hotp8</code> parameter to the
<code>ykpersonalize</code> commandline, which we used to do in the <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2015-12-14-yubikey-howto/">Yubikey
howto</a>. That is because Google Authenticator
tokens are shorter: it's less secure, but it's an acceptable tradeoff
considering the plugin is actually maintained. There's actually a
<a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam/issues/20">feature request to support 8-digit codes</a> so that limitation might
eventually be fixed as well.</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam/issues/186">Google Authenticator people</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-personalization/issues/169">Yubikey people</a>
for their support in establishing this procedure.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Experienced programmers have tales to tell about the things they had to do to test and debug their applications. They agree on one thing: The bad ol’ days of development are best left in the past.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d been typing my code into a Model 33 teletype keyboard for a while, and I was anxious to see if my application worked. The teletype was attached to a General Electric model 225 computer located at Dartmouth College. The language that I was using, late in the summer of 1964, was <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/commands.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dartmouth BASIC</a>.</p>
<p>I typed “RUN” and almost immediately the printer came to life. “WHAT?” it said. I printed out the program code and found what I thought might be a mistake. I typed in the code again (I hadn’t yet discovered the <code>OLD</code> command), typed <code>RUN</code>, and waited. Seconds later, I got the response. “WHAT?” the printer said. Somebody at GE apparently decided that I’d wasted enough of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/nets/timesharing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their time-share time</a>, because I never got another chance.</p>
<p>But what I <em>did</em> experience was the challenge of debugging software, especially in the old days when QA tools didn’t exist, there was little help because almost no one at the time had ever written a program in BASIC, and I didn’t really know what I was doing anyway.</p>
<p>Other languages were similarly limited. When I managed programmers in a COBOL shop years later, debugging consisted of creating vastly long print-outs, taping them to the walls, and documenting the program flow with colored pencils. It was during one such session in the mid-1980s when an unhappy voice from the back of the room began excoriating me for using COBOL.</p>
<p>Standing there, petite and trim, was an elderly Admiral who was clearly not impressed. “You should be using C,” <a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/grace-murray-hopper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Admiral Grace Hopper</a> told me. Admiral Hopper, who designed FLOW-MATIC, the immediate precursor to COBOL, clearly didn’t think her work was the right answer to serving the military. She was right, of course, but I didn’t have the appropriation to pay for changes.</p>
<h3>Printfs and other joys</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/6-ways-to-improve-your-debugging-skills/">debugging and testing</a> software was like that even at the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Depending on the language and the application, developers usually had to create their own tools in order to determine what a program was doing as it executed. There were some exceptions, such as the <a href="https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Consumer/Archive-Byte-IDX/IDX/80s/88-90/Byte-1990-Vol-15-No-11-Fall-OCR-Page-0250.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardware-assisted debuggers from Periscope</a> in the late 1980s and early 1990s. And debuggers like the one built into the <a href="http://www.aztecmuseum.ca/intro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manx Aztec C compiler</a> could generate symbol tables that could be fed into SID, a debugger from Digital Research for CP/M-80. But each of the early testing tools required brute-force effort, such as setting breakpoints, running step-by-step at the source code level, and dumping the call stack.</p>
<p>Finding out when loops worked as intended and exited when they were supposed to sometimes meant embedding errors at specific points in the code; the crash and subsequent memory dump would show the state of execution at the time.</p>
<p>“This then allowed the programmer to examine all aspects of the program at a point in time,” says zOS programmer Mark Jacobs discussing software debugging in the old days.</p>
<p>Bruce Marold, now retired, once worked in software development. He had similar experiences working on a Fortran IV project. “My first major software project was on a timesharing Fortran IV on a teletype with no debugging resources at all. Even worse, Fortran seemed to be aggressively non-modular. Sometimes GOTO was unavoidable. I had to use brute force to locate glitches.” Marold had to calculate results in the biostatistical application by hand to verify that his program was getting the right answer.</p>
<p>There were other approaches. Some programmers embedded printf commands in their code to stop execution so they could examine the state of the machine – and many still do! Farther back, programmers would single-step through a program, watching indicator lights on the computer’s front panel to follow program execution.</p>
<p>George Dinwiddie, an independent software development consultant, tells of having to build his own circuit emulator. “Every time I had to edit code, I had to burn new <a href="https://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/input-output-and-memory/eprom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPROMs</a>,” Dinwiddie said. “I made an emulator to avoid that. The next week, instead of doing four iterations of finding a problem and editing code, I was able to do a couple dozen because I didn’t have to burn EPROMs.”</p>
<h3>An entire herd of yaks to shave</h3>
<p>QA testing is hard enough, but in earlier eras, developers and testers had little debugging support. Developers had to create their own testing methods and debugging tools, <a href="https://seths.blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which consumed more time</a>. Plus, a lack of common test methods and procedures hurt accuracy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things have changed. Perhaps the biggest change is the idea that <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-importance-of-planning-your-tests/">developers should plan for testing</a> in the first place. “Figuring out how you’re going to test before you build it is a huge advance,” says Dinwiddie. “With software you can build in tests.”</p>
<p>Preparing for testing leads to the ability to automate testing. “When I got the idea of ‘test first,’ in 2000, it really changed the way I thought about creating software,” Dinwiddie says. “Instead of seeing if it worked, I changed to the idea of asking the code to do what I wanted it to do.” Now he can worry about what he wants to accomplish, and then perform testing in little steps.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.”—Brian W. Kernighan</p></blockquote>
<p>“The most significant difference between software testing in the past and present is the <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/automated-functional-testing-101/">reliance on automated testing</a>,” says Yaniv Masjedi, CMO of <a href="https://www.nextiva.com/">Nextiva</a>, a voice-over-internet-protocol company. “The perception that manual testing is more accurate and gives fewer errors is an obsolete concept of the past. Modern testing software can provide the same output at a much faster pace without compromising test quality.”</p>
<p>Mostly, testing took longer – which meant it was slower to roll out new versions. “In the past, software testing was slower because it involved testing the software with little historical data and limited technology to automate tests,” says Denis Leclair, VP engineering at Trellis. Testing takes time today because historical data can predict possible outcomes. “It is now possible to automate software tests, which reduces the time spent overall in the software testing process,” he adds.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that some older aspects of testing aren’t still useful. “In the past, there were <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-reasons-why-qa-needs-humans/">more interactions between members of the software testing process</a>, and these regular meetings develop many innovative strategies to test software,” says Leclair. “If applied today, software testing will see significant developments based on constant knowledge sharing.”</p>
<p>While there is some nostalgia for the challenges of the good ol’ days, developers acknowledge that software development and testing has improved – not the least of which is hiring dedicated QA staff rather than waiting for users to file bug reports.</p>
<p>Of course most testing today avoids the intellectual team-building that happened while developers tried to figure out why their applications failed. That’s not all gone. Instead, those challenges have moved to designing reliable, mostly automated, testing. There may be less drama that way, but the result is a better product.</p>
<blockquote><p>Naturally, at Functionize we think we offer a better path for anyone who wants to test software, automate test suites, and ensure application quality. Won’t you take a few minutes to <a href="https://www.functionize.com/test-creation/">explore its features</a> and learn more?</p></blockquote>

<p>When I realized that I cannot apply common image processing pipelines in medical images, I was completely discouraged. Why does such functionality not exist? So, I made up this post for discouraged individuals who, like me, are interested in solving medical imaging problems.</p>

<p>We have already discussed medical image segmentation and some initial background on <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-coordinates/" target="_blank">coordinate systems </a>and DICOM files. My experience in the field leads me to continue with data understanding, preprocessing, and some augmentations. As I always say, if you merely understand your data and their particularities, you are probably playing bingo. In the field of medical imaging, I find some data manipulations, which are heavily used in preprocessing and augmentation in state-of-the-art methods, to be critical in our understanding. To this end, I provide a notebook for everyone to play around. It performs transformations on medical images, which is simply a 3D structured grid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The accompanying notebook on google colab can be found <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fyU_YaZUO3B5qVzBJwGoYZ6XVvVLog30?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Data</strong>: We will play with 2 MRI images that are provided from nibabel (python library) for illustration purposes. The images are stored as nifty files. But before that, let’s write up some code to visualize the 3D medical volumes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The images will be shown in 3 planes: sagittal, coronal, axial looking from left to right throughout this post.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole tutorial, we will extensively use a function that visualizes the three median slices in the <strong>sagittal, coronal, and axial</strong> planes respectively. Let’s write some minimal function to do so:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nothing more than matplotlib’s “<code>imshow"</code> and numpy’s array manipulations. For the record, medical images are a single channel and we visualize them in grayscale colors.</p>

<p>The two images that we will use to play with a plethora of transformations can be illustrated below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>show_mid_slice</span><span>(</span><span>epi_img_numpy</span><span>,</span> <span>'first image'</span><span>)</span>
<span>show_mid_slice</span><span>(</span><span>anatomy_img_numpy</span><span>,</span><span>'second image'</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<em>The initial brain MRI images that we will use.</em></p>

<p>Now we are good to go! Let’s commence with resize and rescale in medical images. Yeap, it’s not exactly the same.</p>

<h2 id="1-medical-image-resizing-downup-sampling">1. Medical image resizing (down/up-sampling)</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.scipy.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scipy</a> library provides a lot of functionalities for multi-dimensional images. Since medical images are three dimensional, a lot of functionalities can be used. This time we will use <strong>scipy.ndimage.interpolation.zoom</strong> for resizing the image in the desired dimensions. This is similar to downsampling in a 2D image. The same function can be used for interpolation to increase the spatial dimensions. As an illustration, we will double and half the original image size.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep in mind that in this kind of transformation the ratios are usually important to be maintained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You probably don’t want to lose the anatomy of the human body :)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>scipy</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This kind of scaling is usually called isometric. Honestly, I am not a big fan of the scipy’s terminology to use the word zoom for this functionality.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-image-processing/resized-mri-images.png" alt="resized-mri-images">
<em>Downsampled and upsampled image by a factor of 2</em></p>

<p>It is very common to downsample the image in a lower dimension for heavy machine learning.</p>

<p>Note that there is another type of resizing. Instead of providing the desired output shape, you specify the desired voxel size(i.e. voxel_size=(1,1,1) mm). Nibabel provides a function called resample_to_output(). It works with nifti files and not with numpy arrays. Honestly, I wouldn’t recommend it alone since the resulting images might not have the same shape. This may be a problem for deep learning. For example to create batches with dataloaders the dimension should be consistent across instances. However, you may choose to include it in a previous step in your pipeline. It can be used to bring different images to have the same or similar voxel size.</p>

<h2 id="2-medical-image-rescaling-zoom--inout">2. Medical image rescaling (zoom- in/out)</h2>

<p>Rescaling can be regarded as an affine transformation. We will randomly zoom in and out of the image. <strong>This augmentation usually helps the model to learn scale-invariant features.</strong></p>

<p>It is important to see that the empty area is filled with black pixels (zero intensity).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note here that the surrounding air in medical images does not have zero intensity. Black is really relative to medical images.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next one on the list is 3D rotation.</p>

<h2 id="3-3d-medical-image-rotation">3. 3D Medical image rotation</h2>

<p>Rotation is one of the most common methods to achieve data augmentation in computer vision. It has also been considered a self-supervised technique with remarkable results [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07728" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spyros Gidaris et al.</a> ].</p>

<p>In medical imaging, it is an equal import functionality that has also been used from self-supervised pretraining [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02241" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xinrui Zhuang et al. 2019 </a>]. A simple random 3D rotation in a given range of degrees can be illustrated with the code below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>random_rotate3D</span><span>(</span><span>img_numpy</span><span>,</span> <span>min_angle</span><span>,</span> <span>max_angle</span><span>):</span>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/medical-image-processing/rotation3d.png" alt="rotation3d">
<em>Random 3D rotation</em></p>

<p>We simply have to define the axis and the rotation angle. As scaling provided the model with more diversity in order to learn scale-invariant features, rotation aids in learning rotation-invariant features.</p>

<p>Next in our list is image flipping.</p>

<h2 id="4-3d-medical-image-flip">4. 3D medical image flip</h2>

<p>Similar to common RGB images, we can perform axis flipping in medical images. At this point, it is really important to clarify one thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we perform augmentations and/or preprocessing in our data, we may have to apply similar operations on the ground truth data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, if we tackle the task of <a href="https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-deep-learning/" target="_blank">medical image segmentation</a>, it is important to flip the target segmentation map. A simple implementation can be found below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>random_flip</span><span>(</span><span>img</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>):</span>

<em>The initial image as a reference and two flipped versions</em></p>

<p>Observe that by flipping one axis, two views change. The first image on top is the initial image as a reference.</p>

<h2 id="5-medical-image-shifting-displacement">5. Medical image shifting (displacement)</h2>

<p>Here I would like to tell something else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rotation, shifting, and scaling are nothing more than affine transformations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes I implement them by just defining the affine transformations and apply it in the image with scipy, and sometimes I use the already-implemented functions for multi-dimensional image processing.</p>

<p>In order to use this operation in my data augmentation pipeline, you can see that I have included a wrapper function. The latter basically samples a random number, usually in the desired range, and calls the affine transformation function. Below is the implementation for random shifting/displacement.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><h2>Introducing</h2><h2>Incognito Email Addresses</h2><h2>2020-10-18</h2><p>We use email for everything – from our banking, healthcare, and government accounts, to online shopping, entertainment, and talking with friends and family.</p><h3>The Problem</h3><p>Email is an incredible tool – but widespread use of our personal email addresses has made them a profitable target for advertisers and criminals.</p><h4>Advertisers</h4><p>For advertisers, your personal data is a gold mine and your email address is the perfect tool to identify you.</p><p>Your personal email address is globally unique, and it's become second nature to share it freely with service providers, retailers, and other organizations. However, that means any two companies that both have your personal email address can easily trade information about you.</p><p>Recently, it has become common for companies to sell our personal information. Even governments are starting to sell your personal information – both the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evjekz/the-california-dmv-is-making-dollar50m-a-year-selling-drivers-personal-information">California DMV</a> and the <a href="https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/i-team-investigates/i-team-florida-dmv-sells-your-personal-information-to-private-companies-marketing-firms">Florida DMV</a> have been found selling citizens' private data to make money.</p><h4>Criminals</h4><p>For criminals, your inbox is a doorway to identity and financial theft.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.phishingbox.com/assets/files/images/Verizon-Data-Breach-Investigations-Report-DBIR-2019.pdf">Verizon Data Breach Report</a>, 94% of malware is sent over email and 31% of all data breaches included a phishing element. Attackers know that if a well-disguised email (often masquerading as a trusted source, or using leaked information associated with your personal email address) arrives in your inbox, there's a good chance you'll click the link, or open the file — which is often all they need to hook you as their next victim.</p><h3>The Solution</h3><p>Anonymous, service specific, and replaceable email addresses – incognito addresses.</p><p>Many email providers have spam blockers, but they don't catch all unwanted mail, and spam is only one barrier to a quieter, safer inbox. Incognito addresses fill in the security and privacy gap where existing email providers fall short.</p><h4>Anonymous</h4><p>Using an anonymous email address for each online service (e.g. bigstore.com, socialbook.com, videobox.com) gives you more control over which companies have access to your online identity. Email address anonymity makes it difficult for advertisers to share and sell your data without your consent, and it makes it difficult for criminals to deploy personalized or targeted attacks.</p><h4>Service Specific</h4><p>By creating a unique, anonymous email address for each online service, you make it impossible for advertisers or criminals to create identifying associations with your email alone.</p><p>In addition, using a unique email address for each service enables Owl Mail to alert you if any inbound emails are from an unexpected sender – preventing spam from reaching your inbox, and illuminating when companies may have had a data breach or sold your incognito email address.</p><h4>Replaceable</h4><p>If your personal email address is sold by a company, or leaked in a data breach, there isn't much you can do in response. Your family, friends, and co-workers reach you at that address, so it's difficult to abandon. All you can do is hope your email service is winning the war on your always-increasing spam.</p><p>In contrast, incognito addresses are easily destroyed and replaced. If you discover an incognito address has been leaked, just delete and replace it – stop spam before it begins!</p><h3>The Future</h3><p>Incognito address are a major step toward better privacy and security online. But, that's just the start. At Owl Mail, we plan to build the world's best email tools – creating a spam, phishing, and malware free experience with easy-to-use end-to-end encryption to all of your messages.</p><p>We hope you are as excited about quieter, safer email as we are.</p><p><span><a href="https://owlmail.io/sign-in">Try Incognito Addresses</a></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>The regular Git users amongst you will be familiar with the diff output that breaks down into “hunks” like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@@ -24,7 +24,7 @@</span> class TicketPdf
     ApplicationController.render(
       "tickets/index.html.haml",
       layout: "tickets",
<span>-      assigns: { tickets: tickets }
</span><span>+      assigns: { tickets: tickets, event_name: event_name }
</span>     )
   end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first line (starting <code>@@</code>) is known as the hunk header, and is there to help orientate the change. It gives us the line numbers for the change (the numbers between the <code>@@..@@</code>), but also a textual description for the enclosing context where the change happened, in this example <code>"class TicketPdf"</code>. Git tries to figure out this enclosing context, whether it’s a function, module or class definition. For C-like languages it’s pretty good at this. But for the Ruby example above it’s failed to show us the immediate context, which is actually a method called <code>tickets_as_html</code>. That’s because out of the box Git isn’t able to recognise the Ruby syntax for a method definition, which would be <code>def ticket_as_html</code>.</p>

<p>What would be more useful is to see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@@ -24,7 +24,7 @@</span> def tickets_as_html
     ApplicationController.render(
       "tickets/index.html.haml",
       layout: "tickets",
<span>-      assigns: { tickets: tickets }
</span><span>+      assigns: { tickets: tickets, event_name: event_name }
</span>     )
   end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it’s not just Ruby where Git struggles to figure out the correct enclosing context. Many other programming languages and file formats also get short-changed when it comes to the hunk header context.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it’s not only possible to configure a custom regex specific to your language to help Git better orient itself, there’s even a pre-defined set of <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/userdiff.c">patterns for many languages and formats right there in Git</a>. All we have to do is tell Git which patterns to use for our file extensions.</p>

<p>We can do this by defining a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes"><code>.gitattributes</code></a> file inside our repo that maps the Ruby file extensions to the diff pattern for Ruby:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>*</span>.rb <span>diff</span><span>=</span>ruby
<span>*</span>.rake <span>diff</span><span>=</span>ruby
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some open source projects define their own <code>.gitattributes</code> file. There’s <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/.gitattributes">one in Rails</a>. There’s even <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/.gitattributes">one in the Git source</a> that enables the diff patterns for Perl and Python.</p>

<h2 id="configure-a-global-gitattributes-file">Configure a global .gitattributes file</h2>

<p>Instead of adding a <code>.gitattributes</code> file to every repo we can configure a global <code>.gitattributes</code> file. Just create a <code>.gitattributes</code> file in your home directory, fill it with all the file formats you are interested in and point Git at it:</p>

<pre><code>  <strong>$ git config --global core.attributesfile ~/.gitattributes</strong>
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve put together an <a href="https://gist.github.com/tekin/12500956bd56784728e490d8cef9cb81">example .gitattributes file</a> with some common file formats to get you started.</p>

<p>I have no idea why Git doesn’t have these file format patterns configured by default. Thanks to Tom whose <a href="https://twitter.com/tomstuart/status/1304401459069452290">exasperated tweet</a> brought this non-obvious feature to my attention.</p>

October 19, 2020 | https://hodovi.ch/blog/optimizing-postgres-full-text-search-django/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://hodovi.ch/blog/optimizing-postgres-full-text-search-django/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Postgres provides great search capability out of the box. For the majority of Django apps there is no need to run and maintain an ElasticSearch cluster unless you need the advanced features ElasticSearch offers. Django integrates nicely with the Postgres search through the built in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/postgres/">Postgres module</a>.</p>
<p>For small data sets the default configuration performs well, however when your data grows in size the default search configuration becomes painfully slow and we need to enable certain optimizations to keep our queries fast.</p>
<p>This page will walk you through setting up Django and Postgres, indexing sample data and performing and optimizing full text search.</p>
<p>The examples go through a Django + Postgres setup, however the advice is generally applicable to any programming language or framework as long as it uses Postgres.</p>
<p><strong>If you're already a Django veteran you can skip the first steps and jump right into the optimization.</strong></p>

<li><a href="#measuring">Measuring the performance improvement</a></li>
<li><a href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-setup"><a id="project-setup"></a>Project setup</h2>
<p>Create the directories and setup the Django project.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>mkdir django_postgres
<span>cd</span> django_postgres
python -m venv venv
<span>source</span> venv/bin/activate
pip install django
django-admin startproject full_text_search
<span>cd</span> full_text_search
./manage.py startapp web
</pre></div>


<p>Now we'll need to install 3 dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>psycopg2: the Postgres client library for Python</li>
<li>wikipedia: a client library to retrieve Wikipedia articles</li>
<li>django-extensions: to simplify debugging of SQL queries</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span></span>pip install psycopg2 wikipedia django-extensions
</pre></div>


<p>We also need to run Postgres locally. I'll use a dockerized version of Postgres here since it's easier to set up, but feel free to install a Postgres binary if you'd like.</p>
<p>Open <code>full_text_search/docker-compose.yml</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>---</span>
<span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>'2.4'</span>
<span>services</span><span>:</span>
  <span>postgres</span><span>:</span>
    <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>postgres:11-alpine</span>
    <span>ports</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>'5432:5432'</span>
    <span>environment</span><span>:</span>
      <span># Set the Postgres environment variables for bootstrapping the default</span>
      <span># database and user.</span>
      <span>POSTGRES_DB</span><span>:</span> <span>"my_db"</span>
      <span>POSTGRES_USER</span><span>:</span> <span>"me"</span>
      <span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>:</span> <span>"password"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The project structure should now look like the output below. We'll ignore the venv directory as that is packed with files and irrelevant for now.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ tree -I venv
.
└── full_text_search
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── full_text_search
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── __pycache__

        │   └── __init__.py
        ├── models.py
        ├── tests.py
        └── views.py

<span>5</span> directories, <span>15</span> files
</pre></div>


<p>We will modify the default database settings to use Postgres instead of SQLite.  In settings.py change the <code>DATABASES</code> attribute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DATABASES</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"default"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"ENGINE"</span><span>:</span> <span>"django.db.backends.postgresql"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"NAME"</span><span>:</span> <span>"my_db"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"USER"</span><span>:</span> <span>"me"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"PASSWORD"</span><span>:</span> <span>"password"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"HOST"</span><span>:</span> <span>"localhost"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"PORT"</span><span>:</span> <span>"5432"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"OPTIONS"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"connect_timeout"</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>},</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We will also modify our <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> to include a few apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>django.contrib.postgres</code> the Postgres module for Django which is required for full text search</li>
<li><code>django_extensions</code> to print SQL logs when executing queries in Python</li>
<li>our <code>web</code> app</li>
</ul>
<p>Open <code>full_text_search/settings.py</code> and modify:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>INSTALLED_APPS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>'django.contrib.admin'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'django.contrib.auth'</span><span>,</span>

    <span>'django.contrib.sessions'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'django.contrib.messages'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'django.contrib.staticfiles'</span><span>,</span>
    <span># Added apps below</span>
    <span>'django.contrib.postgres'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'django_extensions'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'web'</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Start Postgres and Django.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>cd</span> full_text_search
docker-compose up -d
./manage.py runserver
</pre></div>


<p>If we open our browser and enter http://localhost:8000 we should see a successful installation.</p>
<p>[image "django_installation_complete.png" not found]</p>
<h2 id="creating-models-and-indexing-sample-data"><a id="creating-models"></a>Creating models and indexing sample data</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a model which represents a Wikipedia page. For simplicity we'll use two fields: title and content.</p>
<p>Open <code>full_text_search/web/models.py</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Page</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span><span>max_length</span><span>=</span><span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>unique</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    <span>content</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>TextField</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now run the migrations to create the model.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>cd</span> full_text_search
./manage.py makemigrations <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./manage.py migrate

<p>We'll use a script to index random wikipedia articles and save the contents to Postgres.</p>
<p>Edit <code>web/index_wikipedia.py</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>logging</span>
<span>import</span> <span>wikipedia</span>

</pre></div>


<p>Now let's run our script to index Wikipedia. There will be errors when running the script, but don't worry about those as long as we manage to store a few hundred articles. The script will take a while to run so grab a cup of coffee and return in a few minutes.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>./</span><span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>shell_plus</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>web.index_wikipedia</span> <span>import</span> <span>index_wikipedia</span>

<span>#</span>
<span>## A bunch of errors will be show here, ignore them.</span>

<span>183</span>
</pre></div>


<h2 id="optimizing-the-search"><a id="optimizing-search"></a>Optimizing the search</h2>
<p>Now suppose we want to allow users to perform a full text search on the content.  We'll interactively query our dataset to test the full text search. Open a Django shell session:</p>

<p>Django performs two preparatory queries and finally executes our search query.  Looking at the last query we can at first glance see that the execution was ~315ms for the query execution and serialization alone. That's it far too slow when we want to keep our page load speeds in the double digits in milliseconds.</p>

<p>We can see that although the planning time is quite fast (~3ms) the execution time is very slow at ~220ms.</p>

</pre></div>


<p>We can note that the query performs a sequential scan over the entire table in order to find matching records. We can likely optimize the query by using an index.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Filter</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>to_tsvector</span><span>(</span><span>COALESCE</span><span>(</span><span>content</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>::</span><span>text</span><span>))</span> <span>@@</span> <span>plainto_tsquery</span><span>(</span><span>'football'</span><span>::</span><span>text</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally the query normalizes the <code>content</code> column from text to a tsvector using <code>to_tsvector</code> in order to perform the full text search.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WHERE</span> <span>to_tsvector</span><span>(</span><span>COALESCE</span><span>(</span><span>"web_page"</span><span>.</span><span>"content"</span><span>,</span> <span>''</span><span>))</span> <span>@@</span> <span>(</span><span>plainto_tsquery</span><span>(</span><span>'football'</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>tsvector</code> type is a tokenized version of our text which normalizes the search column (more on tokenization <a href="https://www.compose.com/articles/indexing-for-full-text-search-in-postgresql/#tokenization">here</a>). Postgres needs to perform this normalization for every row and each row contains an entire Wikipedia page. This is both a CPU intensive and slow operation.</p>
<h3 id="specialized-search-column-and-gin-indexes"><a id="specialized-column"></a>Specialized search column and gin indexes</h3>
<p>In order avoid on-the-fly casting of text to tsvectors we'll create a specialized column which is used only for search. The column should be populated on inserts or updates. When querying is performed we'll avoid the performance penalty of casting types.</p>
<p>Since we can now have a tsvector type we are also able to add a gin index to speed up the query. The gin index ensures that the search will be performed with a indexed scan instead of a sequential scan over all records.</p>
<p>Open our <code>web/models.py</code> file and make modifications to the Page model.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/tiago.jpg" alt="tiago"></p>

<p>This photo was me a year ago to the day, selling the company I founded five years before.</p>

<p>I thought I’d write some notes about the process and the story.</p>



<p>Until today, there has never been anything more challenging in my life that I have done than running BinaryEdge.</p>

<p>I moved to Switzerland 7 years ago and opened BinaryEdge a little over a year after getting here.</p>

<p>I still remember sitting down with my friend Pekka Jackli and telling him: “I want to open a company that does internet scanning, but I don’t know how to do it. Can you help me ?” (He jumped immediately at the challenge and ended up being a co-founder.)</p>

<p>I had previously founded a security research group (called PTCoreSec) that played around with the idea of internet scanning, so I thought it was time to pick that up again.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/ptcoresec.png" alt="ptcoresec"></p>

<p>To make sure everyone understands the situation I was in, I decided to open BinaryEdge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In a country I had just arrived at (1 year is not enough to adapt)</li>
  <li>In a country where I do not speak any of the native languages.</li>
  <li>Never having gone to business school or read a single business book</li>
  <li>Not having any close friends or people I could go to in the country that could provide advice on running a startup</li>
  <li>Having my family to take care of as we moved here for a job</li>
</ul>

<p>Some might wonder why on earth, I would take on this challenge under these conditions instead of trying to make them more optimal first. But here I was just a few years after beating cancer and being stuck in a bed for one year. It had left me with this weird feeling that I had just wasted that one year of my life doing “nothing”, so even if the situation wasn’t perfect, my energy was at an all-time high, if cancer couldn’t stop me, well nothing could.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/me.jpg" alt="fuck cancer"></p>

<p><strong>PS: Fuck Cancer!</strong></p>

<p>After I spoke with Pekka, we immediately got started figuring out how we would register the company and how we would get some funding.</p>

<p>Pekka introduced me to Till Spillmann, a lawyer-entrepreneur that I had to convince to invest in something that didn’t even exist back then other than in the format of a prototype and PowerPoint!</p>

<p>Sitting down with Till, I showed him evidence that we were doing something different and the problems we wanted to solve (these have changed over the years, and we have slowly refined some of our approaches); I convinced Till to be the first official investor.</p>

<p>This was a great win for team BinaryEdge. Till brought what is typically called smart-money. He brought the needed capital that allowed us to get a small group of developers to start putting together the platform’s first version and all his knowledge and resources as a lawyer.</p>

<p>We started building a better internet scanning platform, improving the types of data we collect and onboard new enterprise customers. (I will go into more in-depth details of the ups and downs of this in a future post!)</p>

<p>At some point, I remember sitting down with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/halvarflake">Thomas Dullien</a>, and asking him for some advice, which ended up with him being the next and last investor ever into BinaryEdge. To this day, bringing Thomas onboard is one of my proudest achievements as there has been no one that has given me as good help or advice as he has. He had already gone through the experience of opening a startup and selling it, so he was the one person that just “got me” and all the headaches and complications I was going through. If you can get Thomas as a friend, investor, or advisor, do it. He is a wonderful human being!</p>

<p>During most of the time of BinaryEdge, I always had a second full-time job. The money BinaryEdge generated was to grow BinaryEdge. I took a salary at the beginning to keep things on track and going but then ended up feeling like the money could be better used to grow the team faster and that I could just deal with having two jobs.</p>



<p>From the moment I met Joshua Motta, I knew joining Coalition to go work with him in some capacity was in my future. When he initially floated the idea by me of Coalition acquiring BinaryEdge (Coalition had already been a customer for a while), we were in a situation where we had the option to raise a funding round or get acquired (by Coalition or 2 other parties that had shown interest), and I had to make a decision.</p>

<p>Our objective was to go down the cyber-insurance path and build a platform to sell cyber-insurance if we had fundraised. This was known to most people as we had already started blogging about it. Cyber insurance is a type of business I was a big believer in from the first day I heard about it, not how the market predominantly currently works but rather the revolutionary way we do it at Coalition and that we wanted to do ourselves.</p>

<p>We had a few other acquisition opportunities on the table from current customers; however, I did not believe we would have been a good fit. I felt strongly I needed to believe in the company that was acquiring us and their business model.</p>

<p>After about two months of the initial conversation, Joshua flew to Zürich and sat down with me Pekka and Till, while Thomas joined remotely. He explained who Coalition was, why they wanted to acquire us, and <a href="https://www.coalitioninc.com/blog/why-we-acquired-binaryedge">the secret master plan</a>.</p>

<p>The fit was perfect, the desire was there by both parties, and with that, we triggered the next phase, which brought the hard part of the process—due diligence. Looking at how much ahead of the market Coalition was business wise made it an easy decision on what I wanted for BinaryEdge.</p>

<p>For about two months, a team of people and lawyers from Coalition passed a comb over every document I signed, every decision I made and asked a LOT of questions. To say that this is a stressful situation is to put it lightly.</p>

<p>Having an M &amp; A Lawyer in the team helped a lot as he knew this process like the back of his hand, which enabled us to get through the diligence at a fantastic pace (compared to some of the stories I have read before).</p>

<p>As it is now public, we ended up being acquired, and we joined the Coalition team; and a few days after the first photo at the beginning of this post, we got on a flight to the USA for the first offsite.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/be-us.png" alt="offsite"></p>

<p><img src="https://www.balgan.world/assets/img/be-coalition.jpg" alt="offsite2"></p>

<p><strong>So what do we do these days?</strong></p>

<p>I became the General Manager for Customer Security at Coalition. I run the BinaryEdge Enterprise business and build tools to protect our policyholders and bridge the collection done by our team with the underwriting, data, and security team at Coalition.</p>

<p>Florentino flourished into a fantastic engineering manager and runs the engineering team associated with the scanning engine (the team has grown quite a bit since). It has been a privilege to see him evolve over the years.</p>

<p>Tom works with me on growing our enterprise business  (If I were to say Florentino is my right hand, Tom would be my left) while also doing a lot with me on the product management and planning.</p>

<p>Ana continues her career as a data scientist (she is one of the people in my life I admire the most, thinking about how before BinaryEdge she had never written a single line of code to being the amazing data scientist she is today just makes me proud).</p>

<p>Marco was a dad and moved to the data science team as a data engineer to help with faster integration of our data. He was the best CTO one could have asked for and just want BinaryEdge needed.</p>

<p>This team is what made all of this possible, and I will forever be thankful to them for everything they did. They made my dream theirs, and I will forever be indebted to them for that. When the going gets tough, the tough get going, and this group was the reflection of that. There was no quitting on us.</p>

<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Opening a startup forces you to learn specific skills, fast, that otherwise you probably wouldn’t care about. Invoicing, accounting, planning, dealing with banks, customers, partnerships, etc…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After you go through it, a lot of things become more comfortable in life. To get to the point of where you’re feeling pressure or panic takes a lot more than it did before because while you’re running your startup, it will happen that you will go through those feelings, and you will have to figure out how to solve them or get out of those situations (often on your own!).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going from being someone’s employer to employing people is a HUGE shift in your life. Having people you’re responsible for and salaries to pay or having investors who gave you money and that you need to show hope that they will get a return is a level of responsibility that I am not sure anything else in life can prepare you for. (Speaking on a phone with a customer that is &gt;10 days late with a payment while having to be polite is one of the hardest things you might ever do).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working on something you founded makes it that the highs are just acceptable but the lows are really deep. Use the wins as small as they are to come out from low moments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running a remote team is hard. Back then there weren’t really any founder resources on how to do it properly and we had to figure out a lot on our own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The entrepreneur life is not as glamorous as a lot of the blogs, youtubers and others make it seem. It is hard, the grind to close customers and get paid is long (sometimes months long if you’re into enterprise software business) and you need to convince a bunch of strangers to join you on this crusade that is your vision as part of your team.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p>I’ve had a few people ask me what “comes next”, if I’m looking for investment for my next startup or just the general “Are you ever opening a startup again?”.</p>

<p>My focus is on growing and executing a vision that I get to have the honor of building and planning for, so what is next is Coalition.</p>

<p>I love my job, if you’ve interviewed with me lately you will have heard me say “I have the best job in the world” and the reason for that is that I still get to build <a href="https://asm.binaryedge.io/">amazing products</a> while working with a team that has more than doubled in size and that makes it an absolute pleasure to wake up each morning and get to work.</p>

<p>My team is everthing for me, all the cool stuff I get to …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

		<h2 id="003">0:03</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p>Today I’m going to have a conversation with Brian Nigito, essentially, about the technological underpinnings of the financial markets, and some of the ways in which those underpinnings differ from what you might expect if you’re used to things like the open Internet and the way in which cloud infrastructures work. We’re going to talk about a lot of things, but there’s going to be a lot of focus on networking, and some of the technologies at that level, including things like IP multicast. </p><p>Brian Nigito is a great person to have this conversation with because he has a deep and long history with the financial markets. He’s worked in the markets for 20 years, some of the time he spent working at the exchange-level where he did a lot of the foundational work that led to the modern exchange architectures that we know today. He’s also worked on the side of various different trading firms. For the last eight years, Brian’s been working here at Jane Street and his work here has covered a lot of different areas, but today, he spends a lot of time thinking about high performance, low latency, and especially network level stuff. </p><p>So let’s dive in. I think one thing that I’m very sensitive to is a lot of the people who are listening, don’t know a ton about the financial markets and how they work. And so just to get started, Brian can give a fairly basic explanation of what an exchange is.</p></div>

<h2 id="122">1:22</h2>

<p>I think when you hear about an exchange, you can think of lots of different kinds of marketplaces. But when we talk about an exchange, we’re talking about a formal securities exchange. And these are the exchanges that the SEC regulates, and they meet all of the rules necessary to allow people to trade in securities. So when we use that loosely, yeah, it’s pretty different than your average flea market. Supposed to be anyway.</p>

<h2 id="146">1:46</h2>

<p>That’s obviously a function which, once upon a time was done with physical people in the same location, right? Those got moved into more formal, more organized exchanges with more electronic support. Then eventually there’s this kind of transformation that’s happened essentially over the last 20 years, where the human element has changed enormous amount. Now, humans are obviously deeply involved in what’s going on, but the humans are almost all outside of the exchange and the exchange itself has become essentially a kind of purely electronic medium.</p>

<h2 id="217">2:17</h2>

<p>Yeah, it’s a really interesting story because you have examples of communication technologies and electronic trading, going back to the late ’60s, but probably more mid-‘70s (I’m being a little loose with dates) but it was kind of always present. But the rule set was not designed to force people to operate at the kinds of timescales that electronic systems would cause you to operate at. It was rather forgiving. So you know, if somebody on the floor didn’t want to deal with then electronic exchange, the electronic exchange had to wait. Over the past 10 to 15 years, that’s kind of flipped and so generally, we favor, always accessible electronic quotations.</p>

<h2 id="305">3:05</h2>

<p>To step back a little bit. The exchanges are the places for people to meet and trade, as you said, to advertise their prices. And for people to transact with each other. Other than people who are buying and selling, what are the other people who interact at the exchange level, what are the other kind of entities that get hooked in there.</p>

<h2 id="319">3:19</h2>

<p>So you have, obviously the entities who either in their own capacity or on behalf of other people are transacting securities, but then you have financial institutions that are clearing and guaranteeing those trades, providing some of the capital or leverage to the participants who are trading, they obviously want to know what’s going on there. You have other exchanges, because the rule set requires the exchanges to respect each other’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_quote">quotations</a> – in this odd way, there’s a web where the the exchanges are customers of each other. And you may also have various kinds of market data providers. So those quotes that reflect the activity on the exchange are eventually making their way all the way down to what you might see scrolling on the bottom of the television or your brokerage screen or financial news website, etc. I guess they even make it all the way down to the printed page when the Wall Street Journal prints transaction prices.</p>

<h2 id="410">4:10</h2>

<p>So what does this look like at a more systems level? What are the messages the different participants are sending back and forth?</p>

<h2 id="416">4:16</h2>

<div><p>The most primitive sorts of things are you have orders or instructions, there are other platforms where we have quotes and we may use that loosely, but we’ll just say orders. An order would just say that I would like to buy or sell, let’s say, a specific stock, and I’d like to do so at no worse than this price, and for no more than this quantity, and that may mean I could get filled at a slightly better price than that. I could get filled for less [quantity] than that. I could get filled not at all. </p><p>That order could basically check the book immediately and then come right back to me if there’s nothing to be done. Or it can rest there for some nonzero amount of time where it could advertise and other people may see it and choose to interact with it. And then obviously, I can withdraw that interest or cancel it. So when we talked about orders or cancels, those go hand in hand. </p><p>Finally, there’s execution messages where if you and I intersect on our interest I want to buy you want to sell or vice versa, then the exchange is going to generate an execution to you. And to me, saying that that happened and the terms of that trade.</p></div>

<h2 id="522">5:22</h2>

<div><p>One of the key properties here is that you have a fairly simple core set of messages, this basic data structure at the heart of it called “the book,” which is the set of orders that have not been satisfied. And then people can send messages to add orders and remove orders. And then if two orders <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross.asp">cross</a>, if there are two orders that are compatible, where a trade can go up, then an execution occurs and the information flows out. </p><p>There’s a fairly simple core machine at the heart of it but then lots of different players who want different subsets of information for different purposes. There are people who are themselves trading, who want to see of course, their own activity and all the detail about that. And they also want to see what we call “market data,” that kind of public anonymized version of the trading activity so you can see what are the prices there are out there that are advertised for you to go and transact against. </p><p>In the end, you need to build a machine that’s capable of running this core engine, doing it at sufficient speed, doing it reliably enough… Maybe a thing that’s not apparent if you haven’t thought about it is: there’s like a disturbing dizzying amount of money at stake. And oh my God, you do not want to lose track of the transactions, right? If you say like, “Oh, you guys did this trade,” and then you forget about it and don’t report it, or you report to one side and not the other, terrible things happen. So reliability is a key thing.</p></div>

<h2 id="635">6:35</h2>

<p>Yeah and I think to go back, there’s lots of different consumers, lots of different participants. And I think the key word there is there’s lots of <em>competing</em> participants. So one thing you didn’t mention in there is disseminating all that information fairly. So trying to get it to everybody at the same time is a real challenge and one that participants are studying very, very carefully and looking for any advantage they can technologically within the rule set, etc. So that extra layer of competition sort of makes the problem a little more complicated, and a little more challenging.</p>

<h2 id="710">7:10</h2>

<p>This fairness issue is one that you’ve seen from the inside working on early exchange infrastructure at Island and Instinet, which eventually became the technology that NASDAQ is built on. Early on, you guys built an infrastructure that I think didn’t have all the fairness guarantees that modern exchanges happen today. Can you say more about how that actually plays out in practice?</p>

<h2 id="729">7:29</h2>

<div><p>When working on the Island system, it was very close, originally, to sort of “fair” in that you had the same physical machines, you had an underlying delivery mechanism, which we’ll talk about, that was very fair at getting it to those individual machines. And then you were sending copies of orders or instructions after going through one application to everyone. So you were all passing through about the exact same amount of work and the about the exact same number of devices. But it was actually very inefficient, we were using thousands of machines that were mostly idle. </p><p>So once we started trying to handle multiple clients on a single machine, it exposed some obvious and silly problems. The naive implementation where people would connect, we would collect all of those connections. And then when we had a message, we would send them on the connections serially, often in the order in which people connected. Well, that immediately led to thousands of messages per second before the exchange open where somebody tried to be the very first connection in that line. </p><p>Then you start sort of round-robining, so you know, you start from one and then the next time around, you start from two etc, etc, to try to randomize this. And then you had people who were connecting to as many different ports as they could and taking the fastest of each one. And so these incentives are very, very strong, and we’d like to use machines to their fullest, but to literally provide each participant their own unique machine for each connection starts to get ridiculous as well.</p></div>

<h2 id="904">9:04</h2>

<p>Where did that lead you? How did you end up resolving that problem?</p>

<h2 id="907">9:07</h2>

<p>A lot of these were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a> protocols. In those days, we actually had a decent number …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>The core of a product manager's job is to make change happen by influencing stakeholders without exerting power over them. It is not an easy task. But it is much more approachable with the right tools. </span></p> <p><span>Here I have curated some powerful principles and practical tips from the field of psychology as well as experts trained in persuasion so that you can rally support behind your ideas. </span></p> <p><span>Persuasion is the focus of this post. Other topics such as building the right product and making robust decisions are out of scope (to be covered in future posts). </span></p> <p><span>It should go without saying, but use these techniques wisely. Always do what's right for the product and for your customers.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Facts Are Overrated</span></h3></p> <p><span>We like to think we are perfectly logical and rational beings. But we are not. Humans tend to make decisions based on (often hidden) biases and emotions. </span></p> <p><span>By all means, bring facts and data to the table wherever possible. But don't expect facts alone to change people's minds. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Reciprocation</span></h3></p> <p><span>We are hardwired to reciprocate favours. If you want a partner's cooperation tomorrow, do that person a favour today. But offer real value, not just as a means to get what you want.</span></p> <p><span>Another way in which reciprocation can work to your advantage is starting with a bigger (exaggerated) ask that is likely to get rejected. Then concede to a smaller request. It is more likely to work than when presented on its own.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Persuasion Still Works Even if the Person Recognizes the Technique</span></h3></p> <p><span>In a way, this is similar to optical or audio illusions. Even if you know certain psychological effects are at play, it is hard to resist. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>What you Think More About Becomes More Important</span></h3></p> <p><span>When you devote mental energy to an idea, you remember it better. In your mind, it becomes more important. For this reason, intentional "errors" in your message (such as a typo in your email) can make the message rise in importance, even as the errors attract criticism (which is a form of attention). </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Repetition is Persuasion</span></h3></p> <p><span>Repetition is persuasion.</span></p> <p><span>Repetition is persuasion.</span></p> <p><span>Repetition is persuasion.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Commitment and Consistency</span></h3></p> <p><span>The moment we make a decision, there is a tendency to justify the wisdom of our choice and find reasons to dismiss the other options. From this point, cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias are at play. </span></p> <p><span>Trivial requests increase the likelihood of compliance to larger requests.

    <p>As of today, Windows trusts 322 root certificates issued by 122 different organizations from 47 countries. This number is quite high, and has been steadily growing over the last few years. And it turns out many of those certificates are not needed at all by the vast majority of Windows users, can be distrusted with no ill effects of any sort.</p>

<p>Each of these CAs is given tremendous power over your Internet traffic, so it makes great sense to minimize the number of CAs your computer trusts. 
One simple way to achieve this goal is to replace the default Windows list of root CAs with the much stricter Mozilla trust list, which includes 142 roots (52 organizations - 21 countries). An even stricter option is using the Google CTL, which currently includes just 127 root certificates (48 organizations - 21 countries). For the vast majority of users, applying either set is a great way to reduce your exposure to unnecessary CAs, with no negative impact whatsoever.</p>

<p>Replacing the default Windows list of root CAs with the Mozilla or Google trust lists can be done manually, but is extremely time-consuming and error prone. 
The free version of RootIQ(*) offers a much simpler way to perform this system change:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1. Use the Quick select dropdown to select the Mozilla trust set
2. Right-click the selection and click Invert selection
3. Right-click the selection and click Distrust
   Click Yes on the confirmation dialog
   This will distrust all roots that are not part of the Mozilla trust set, except for any Microsoft OS-critical roots.
4. Use the Quick select dropdown to select the Mozilla trust set (again)
5. Right-click the selection and Trust
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://nsa40.casimages.com/img/2020/10/17/201017023914436079.png" alt="img123"></p>

<p>As of this writing, on a standard Windows 10 system, you will end up with 145 trusted roots (rather than 322 roots for the default Microsoft CTL)</p>

<p>(*) RootIQ, our own root certificate manager for Windows, is now <a href="https://www.metasudo.com/">available</a>. A free version of RootIQ is available for home and evaluation use.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <section>
          <p><strong>You should use punctuation in Slack.</strong> You should also use complete sentences and proper grammar. You should expand acronyms<sup>[1]</sup> and — when communicating emotion — even mix in some emoji for effect. You should do that not just in Slack, but in all of your professional communication.</p>

<hr>

<p>Written communication is hard, but in the digital world we work in it’s also vital. Sadly, the style of communication that services like Slack incentivize is awful.</p>

<p>To voice an opinion before the conversation moves on, you type fast and use abbreviations and hit send even with misspellings. You think one message at a time. You bounce between different threads and become easily distracted.</p>

<p>There are some obvious downsides to this fast and loose style. Most notably, it interrupts more productive work and deters deep thinking. But one large and often overlooked downside is the impact it has on others.</p>

<h2 id="externalities">Externalities</h2>

<p>When you use an obscure initialism or take shortcuts on grammar and spelling, it may save you a couple seconds. The problem is those small savings are often outweighed by the cost born by your audience.</p>

<p>Every person who reads your message spends some finite period of time interpreting what you’re saying. Setting aside the possibility that a sloppy message might lead the reader to an incorrect interpretation, it’s harder to parse messages written hastily — messages with poor grammar, misspellings, minimal punctuation, obscure acronyms, or delivered a few words at a time.</p>

<p>As an example, assume you send the following message to a Slack channel with 10 other people in it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>anyone know the latest on cai
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And further assume that “cai” refers to an internal project: <strong>C</strong>rusade <strong>A</strong>gainst <strong>I</strong>nitialisms. By writing in all lower case, using an initialism to refer to the project, and omitting the question mark, you’ve saved yourself two words and a handful of extra keystrokes. Under the most generous assumptions, say that translates to five seconds in savings. That’s a lot!</p>

<p>But let’s now examine the impact the shortcuts have on your 10-person audience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two people thought “cai” was a typo and spent several moments trying to guess what you actually meant to type before realizing you were referring to the internal project. <em>Cost: 20 seconds</em></li>
  <li>Two people didn’t know what “cai” stood for. One spent three minutes tracking it down on the internal wiki, and the other sent a private message to another team member to ask. <em>Cost: 4 minutes</em></li>
  <li>One person ignored your ask because they didn’t realize it was a question when scanning the channel. <em>Cost: Priceless</em></li>
  <li>Five people understood what you meant but still had to mentally expand the initialism before internalizing your ask. <em>Cost: 5 seconds</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Your 5 seconds of savings amounted to roughly 4.5 <em>minutes</em> of cost spread across your audience. Sure, this is a contrived example and sure there are cases where the cost is lower, but the point stands: <strong>your communication shortcuts are costly</strong>.</p>

<p>In economics, this phenomena is referred to as a negative externality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A negative externality is the cost that affects a third party who did not choose to incur that cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every time you take a communication shortcut, you are inflicting a micro-externality on your audience. The more egregious the shortcut, the larger the externality; the larger your audience, the more times the externality is multiplied and the larger the overall cost.</p>

<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>

<p>If you’re communicating with a close friend and choose to use shorthand, you’re probably fine. Not only will your friend probably be accustomed to it (i.e. the externality will be small), but the audience is also small (i.e. the total cost will be small). In this case, it’s entirely possible your shorthand saves you more time than it costs your friend.</p>

<p>However, when you’re communicating in a one-to-many setting such as email or Slack, and particularly in a professional setting, sloppy writing<sup>[2]</sup> has real consequences. It prioritizes your time above the time of <em>every other person</em> that will be reading that message and might misinterpret your intent or tone. In aggregate, it is a net drain on productivity at your company.</p>

<p>So use proper spelling and grammar. Write out your entire thought before hitting send. Expand acronyms. Use punctuation.</p>

<p>A period, even at the end of “Do it,” communicates, “I’ve said everything I wanted to say.”</p>

<hr>

<p>[1] For the sticklers out there, this includes initialisms as well as acronyms.</p>
<p>[2] The term "sloppy" might sound harsh, but I chose it deliberately. Not everyone speaks the company language (e.g. English) natively, and for them using proper spelling or grammar might be challenging to say the least. The argument here is scoped to people who have some degree of mastery over the language but are being <em>sloppy</em> with their written communication, which is to say "careless and unsystematic; excessively casual".</p>

October 19, 2020 | https://stefan-marr.de/2020/10/irrationally-annoyed/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://stefan-marr.de/2020/10/irrationally-annoyed/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>I started writing this post when being very very annoyed by <a href="https://blog.sigplan.org/2020/10/12/from-heavy-metal-to-irrational-exuberance/">this blog post</a> on the SIGPLAN blog.
I could not understand how “THE SIGPLAN” blog
could simply write 30 years of
programming language research out of existence,
only barely acknowledging Self and JavaScript.
It felt like <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">duty called</a>…</p>

<p>Though, after multiple rounds of edits,
I am now assuming that there’s simply an issue of awareness.
What follows is therefore an attempt to raise awareness on the various
academic but also industrial efforts around the performance of dynamic languages.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: this blog post isn’t attempting to be complete in any way,
but I hope it provides enough pointers for people interested in
<em>language implementation technology for dynamic languages</em>
to go deeper and possibly even contribute.</p>

<h2 id="languages-vs-language-implementations">Languages vs. Language Implementations</h2>

<p>Before going into technical details,
it is important to start distinguishing between
a language and its implementation.
Especially, when we talk about programming language research,
these two are rarely the same.</p>

<p>While the languages mentioned in the post (Python, R, PHP) all have
“standard” implementations, which are the by far most widely used ones,
they are far from the only implementations.
Let’s just pick three for each language:
There are PyPy, IronPython, and Jython for Python,
pqR, Renjin, and FastR for R,
as well as HippyVM, PeachPie, and Quercus for PHP.</p>

<p>They all have benefits and drawbacks. And perhaps are not even 100% compatible,
but various groups of people clearly spent a lot of time and energy on
more optimized language implementations. Some of these implementations have
state-of-the-art just-in-time compilers and can reach performance competitive
with JavaScript, which itself is certainly competitive with for instance Java,
and only slightly behind “metal” languages in some, and ahead in other benchmarks.</p>

<p>How do I know? I didn’t benchmark all of these language implementations,
but I worked on comparing compilers across languages with the <a href="https://github.com/smarr/are-we-fast-yet/">Are We Fast Yet project</a> [<a href="https://stefan-marr.de/downloads/dls16-marr-et-al-cross-language-compiler-benchmarking-are-we-fast-yet.pdf">5</a>].
One important insight here is that language design can definitely have
a performance impact. But, the ingenuity of compiler writers
and language implementers has eliminated all major performance hurdles
in the last 30 years.</p>

<p>This means, claims about the <em>languages</em> for instance them
being “all notoriously slow and bloated” and “not designed to be fast or space-efficient”
are rather misguided.</p>

<p>Just-in-time compilation technology as used for JavaScript, Java, Python
and others is very effective, and not particularly language-specific.
Some of the key techniques have been known
for 30 years, <a href="https://stefan-marr.de/2020/08/optimizing-the-unoptimizable-using-old-ideas/">as I discussed elsewhere</a>.
Others, such as <a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/research/pubs/html/bolz_diekmann_tratt__storage_strategies_for_collections_in_dynamically_typed_languages/">storage strategies</a>, <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43823/">mementos</a>,
and <a href="http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/Research/Papers/Stadler14/Stadler2014-CGO-PEA.pdf">partial escape analysis</a> are much more recent and help with many issues.
Perhaps interesting to note is that storage strategies were actually
first done in PyPy, and are now pretty much standard in just-in-time compiling
VMs for a whole range of languages, including JavaScript.</p>

<p>Though, one may argue that these techniques have not been successful enough,
because people don’t use the language implementations actually benefiting from
them.</p>

<p>Fine, but I believe this is only partially a technical problem.
Some of it is a social issue, too.</p>

<p>Others have spent time on identifying potential reasons
of why people do not pick up our research. For instance, Laurie wrote blog posts
on why not more users are happy with our VMs [<a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/why_arent_more_users_more_happy_with_our_vms_part_1.html">1</a>, <a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/entries/why_arent_more_users_more_happy_with_our_vms_part_2.html">2</a>].</p>

<p>Given the claim that JavaScript is somehow exceptional,
I would argue that JavaScript was lucky in a way.
JavaScript was hilariously slow to start with.
For V8 this meant that they didn’t have to worry about making “startup performance”
worse. Their baseline native code compiler
produced code that was much better than the JavaScript interpreters
back then. Perhaps unfortunately, Python has a surprisingly fast interpreter,
which gives VMs such as PyPy quite a challenge.
Still, it is not impossible to beat such interpreters and have
just-in-time compiling VMs that have also good startup performance.
Examples are indeed modern JavaScript VMs, but also much smaller
and less well funded projects such as <a href="https://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a>,
which has an incredibly fast interpreter and a very effective just-in-time compiler.
But indeed, it takes time and effort to build these systems,
which contrary to the claims in the blog post,
are indeed invested in these languages.</p>

<h2 id="is-python-doomed-of-course-not">Is Python doomed? Of course not!</h2>

<p>So, what about Python then?
The blog post picks up a claim that Python is incredibly slow when it comes
to matrix multiplication. And later, without much context claims that PyPy
is perhaps 2 times faster than Python, but sometimes slower.</p>

<p>One could have asked the PyPy community,
or looked at <a href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2018/06/repeating-matrix-multiplication.html">their blog</a>. PyPy doesn’t have auto-vectorization as far as I know,
so, indeed, it has a hard time reaching the performance of vectorized code,
but it is much faster than what’s implied.
Such broad claims are not just unjustified and bad style,
they are also painfully unscientific.
No, Python is not necessarily slow and bloated.
<a href="https://bibliography.selflanguage.org/_static/implementation.pdf">Maps</a>,
<a href="http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/14">Hidden Classes</a>,
and <a href="https://chrisseaton.com/rubytruffle/pppj14-om/pppj14-om.pdf">object shapes</a>
make it possible to store even integers rather efficiently.
With the previously mentioned
<a href="https://tratt.net/laurie/research/pubs/html/bolz_diekmann_tratt__storage_strategies_for_collections_in_dynamically_typed_languages/">storage strategies</a>,
this works extremely well for your hugh array with integers, too.</p>

<p>Now, perhaps more important is the questions whether auto-vectorization is something
dynamic languages simply can’t support.
Again, there’s no fundamental reason why VMs for dynamic languages can’t support it.
The <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/">GraalVM</a> supports auto-vectorization
and can speedup JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and other dynamic languages with it.
Key techniques are speculative compilation, type feedback, object shapes, and
storage strategies.
With them, optimistic compilers can vectorize even
the code of dynamic languages.
For good measures, I should probably also mention <a href="https://jjfumero.github.io/publications/">Juan Fumero’s work</a> around using just-in-time compilation for dynamic languages to target GPUs.</p>

<h2 id="are-dynamic-languages-single-threaded">Are Dynamic-Languages Single Threaded?</h2>

<p>This one, I do indeed take personally.</p>

<p>First of all, being effectively single threaded can be a Good Thing™.
Why would you want to deal with shared memory race conditions?
This is a language design question. So in the end a matter of taste.
And, if one really wants to, <a href="http://stefan-marr.de/downloads/comlan-de-koster-et-al-domains-sharing-state-in-the-communicating-event-loop-actor-model.pdf">some forms of shared memory are possible,
even without introducing all its drawbacks</a>.</p>

<p>That aside, Python, R, and others have fairly nice ways of supporting parallelism, including multiprocess approaches.
And, to blow my own horn a little more, if you really want shared memory multithreading, you can have that efficiently, too with our work on thread-safe object models [<a href="https://stefan-marr.de/downloads/oopsla16-daloze-et-al-efficient-and-thread-safe-objects-for-dynamically-typed-languages.pdf">3</a>] and thread-safe storage strategies [<a href="https://stefan-marr.de/downloads/oopsla18-daloze-et-al-parallelization-of-dynamic-languages-synchronizing-built-in-collections.pdf">4</a>] .</p>

<h2 id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>To sum up: yes, metal languages will continue to be important, but so will the irrational exuberance languages. We as a community should lead the way in developing systems (at the hardware and software levels) that will make them run faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, we should. And the PL community spent a lot of effort doing this for the last 30 years.
So, please join us. We are out there and could use help!</p>

<p><a href="https://mplr2020.cs.manchester.ac.uk/index.php/mplr/program">MPLR</a> has a keynote coming up titled “Hardware Support for Managed Languages: An Old Idea Whose Time Has Finally Come?”.

<p>And of course, SPLASH is around the corner, too.
With <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/dls-2020">DLS</a> and <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/home/vmil-2020">VMIL</a>, SPLASH has a strong history of providing venues for discussing
the implementation of dynamic languages.
OOPSLA, as in the past, has pretty cool papers on <a href="http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla20-j.pdf">dynamic</a> <a href="https://www.o1o.ch/about/assets/cd.pdf">language</a> <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/details/splash-2020-oopsla/50/Hidden-Inheritance-An-Inline-Caching-Design-for-TypeScript-Performance">implementation</a>.</p>

<p>Other relevant venues include for instance <a href="https://2019.ecoop.org/series/ICOOOLPS">ICOOOLPS</a> and <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/series/MoreVMs">MoreVMs</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://stefan-marr.de/2020/06/efficient-and-safe-implementations-of-dynamic-languages/">Introduction to Efficient and Safe Implementations of Dynamic Languages</a> has many pointers
to research, some of which also made it into <a href="https://stefan-marr.de/tmp/bibtex.html">some early overview of the field</a>.</p>

<p>For questions or difference in opinion, find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/smarr/">@smarr</a>.</p>

<h2 id="post-scriptum">Post Scriptum</h2>

<p>Part of my annoyance with the blog post is its dismissive and condescending tone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of these so-called “scripting languages” are essentially moribund, like Perl (1987)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems a completely unnecessary point to be made.
It is also unclear how this is assessed. The Perl community is active,
but yes, a lot of effort went into
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2019/08/is-perl-6-being-renamed.html">Raku</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, it describes “JavaScript is an outlier”, refers to the
“monoculture [of] (the browser)”, and says there’s “no need for compatibility with legacy code”.
JavaScript is certainly an interesting special case,
and indeed, as acknowledged, browsers just happen to have attracted a lot of funding.
But a monoculture? In which sense? At least in the past,
“the browser” itself was rather diverse. When it comes to backwards compatibility,
the number one design goal of Ecma TC39, the group designing JavaScript,
is “don’t break the web”.</p>

<p>And of course, browsers themselves are incredibly complex “legacy systems”.
To get a taste, I’d recommend to listen to <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/details/dls-2019/dls-2019/1/Untangling-the-web-Memory-management-in-Chrome-s-web-platform-implementation">Michael Lippautz</a>
talking about how C++ and JavaScript interact.</p>

<h2 id="post-post-scriptum">Post Post Scriptum</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python programmers need to distinguish between time and memory spent in pure Python (optimizable) from time and memory spent in C libraries (not so much). They need help tracking down expensive and insidious traffic across the language boundaries (copying and serialization).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3201898">We could also try to get rid of it instead.</a>
Or give more power to people like <a href="https://kar.kent.ac.uk/76576/">Stephen Kell</a>,
and avoid copying/serialization in a different way.</p>

Kubernetes that! Do you even deploy clusters?"</p><p>So what does Kubernetes actually mean and how should your engineering team be using it in your day-to-day software development job?*</p><p>*<em>Spoiler Alert: <strong><strong>You</strong></strong> might not directly interface with k8s, but your DevOps team probably is, or at least they should be thinking about it if you are not a fan of the 3pm War Room deployment every Monday.</em></p><p>First, Kubernetes is a very unique word. Where does it come from, you might be asking. Often mispronounced, the real backstory of what Kubernetes means starts with a translation. The name originates from Greek, meaning helmsman (you can see that referenced in the logo) or pilot. Google Translate gives the <a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&amp;op=translate&amp;sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;text=%CE%BA%CF%85%CE%B2%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82">modern Greek pronunciation</a>, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/j6dv9u/well_this_explains_everything/g7zufar/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Reddit explains the common pronunciation</a> as more similar to ancient Greek. Either way, Flavor Flav puts his own spin on it <a href="https://youtu.be/QxvmO-QlxJQ?t=27">here</a>.</p><p>Okay, now on to the technical stuff. First, let's define Kubernetes.</p><blockquote><strong>Kubernetes</strong> is a DevOps software development tool built and supported by Google to enable teams to simplify the management of deploying updates and services in a distributed system.</blockquote><p>Phew, that is a lot of techie words, but to simplify that: Gone are the days for having to have one giant compute machine on Amazon to support all your running containers. (Or worse, multiple identical giant compute machines holding everything imaginable because you needed more services that help user John_63_xyz to see his dashboard and upload his profile photo... okay, you get the point.)</p><p>Next, containers. A container is a standardized unit of software. If you are hung-up on what containers are, I strongly encourage you to give <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">this article</a> by Docker a read and then come back. You can also peek the graphic below.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/10/container-what-is-container.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The advantages of running containerized code are innumerable and it is well established as an industry best practice, but in short: <strong>Containerization</strong> allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely than before.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/10/container_evolution.svg"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>With traditional methods, code is developed into a specific computing environment that when transferred to a new location often results in bugs and errors.</p><p>Containerization also reduces wasted resources because each container only holds the application and related binaries or libraries. Simply by allowing more containers in the environment without the need for more servers, containerization increases scalability up to 100 times that of traditional VM environments.</p><p>Getting back to Kubernetes and what it is, it is a tool used for container orchestration. Meaning that it is one point of reference that you can "talk to" to access ANY of the services that you have running on your Kubernetes cluster. Even if those services are across different machines. Pretty great, yeah?</p><h2 id="so-what-does-kubernetes-do-exactly"><strong>So What Does Kubernetes Do Exactly?</strong></h2><p>EVERYTHING... for deployment and maintenance needs. Historically (not speaking ftp), the deployment process looked something like this:</p><ol><li>Code review is approved and changes are merged into master</li><li>ssh into your Amazon EC2 instance holding the git repo for your application</li><li>cd into your project directory</li><li>^C to stop application</li><li>git pull origin master</li><li>&lt;application start command&gt;</li><li>Hope it works out 🤞</li></ol><p>Over the years, the process has improved with Docker and docker-compose to run images of the application in containers instead of the application on bare metal, but it still follows the same steps as above.</p><p>Alternatively, if using Kubernetes, you can run <code>kubectl apply -f {deployment yaml}</code> to directly target ALL services on ALL machines of the specified type in your deployment yaml file and apply the new image(s) from your local machine (depending on the privileges you setup for the connection to your cluster).</p><p>On top of it being one line, it applies the update in a rollout fashion, meaning that it shuts down the services one at a time as it applies the new changes.</p><h3 id="what-if-i-need-to-add-new-services-not-defined-in-the-cluster"><strong>W<strong><strong>hat </strong></strong>i<strong><strong>f I </strong></strong>N<strong><strong>eed to </strong></strong>A<strong><strong>dd </strong></strong>N<strong><strong>ew </strong></strong>S<strong><strong>ervices </strong></strong>N<strong><strong>ot </strong></strong>D<strong><strong>efined in </strong></strong>the<strong><strong> </strong></strong>C<strong><strong>luster?</strong></strong></strong></h3><p>Simple, create a new deployment yaml file for the new service and run the apply command.</p><h3 id="what-if-i-need-more-than-one-of-the-same-service">What if I Need More Than One of the Same Service?</h3><p>Even easier, each service (called a deployment) has a number of pods representing the number of "service instances" that are running that application. Just set that value to be greater than 1, or even better set the "autoscaling" limit to be the maximum number of service instances you want running at a time and let Kubernetes scale the number of instances up and down based on traffic.</p><h3 id="is-there-a-limit-on-the-number-of-services-that-i-can-run">Is There a Limit on the Number of Services That I Can Run?</h3><p>Yes and no. Your Kubernetes cluster manages which machines (called nodes) the new pods get deployed to (and yes you can pair up applications that need to be together), which isn't a problem until there isn't enough space on any of the nodes you have allocated to your cluster. You can correct this by adding more nodes, so the sky and your wallet are the limit.</p><h2 id="how-do-i-setup-a-kubernetes-cluster-for-my-application">How Do I Setup a Kubernetes Cluster for My Application?</h2><p>There are a number of ways for setting up a Kubernetes cluster for your application ranging from bare metal to managed cloud provider solutions. In this article I'm going to point you in the right direction for setting up a managed solution in each of the major cloud providers as well as how to use The Ops Platform to make your life simpler, observable, and streamlined like a <a href="https://cto.ai/blog/slack-control-plane-for-devops-workflows/">Control Plane</a>.</p><h3 id="amazon-web-services-aws-eks"><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS) EKS</strong></h3><p>According to AWS's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">documentation</a>, there are 2 ways to create a new EKS managed Kubernetes cluster. The first being an officially supported CLI developed by Weaveworks called <code>eksctl</code>. With eksctl, you can spin up a new managed cluster with reasonable defaults just by running <code>eksctl create cluster</code>.</p><p>Pretty easy right? You can also customize the settings on the cluster via the command line or a configuration yaml if you know what you are doing, which adds some complexity. From their <a href="https://eksctl.io/">website</a> it looks like this tool does the heavy lifting from the setup side, but doesn't provide any abstractions over <code>kubectl</code> for pod or deployment maintenance.</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>$ eksctl create cluster

<p>Each of these creators was prolific. And each produced some incredibly high-quality work. In creative fields, quality and quantity are <em>not</em> mutually exclusive.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <a href="https://www.animalz.co/blog/content-marketing-strategy/">B2B content strategy</a>, we've all come to accept that we need to "slow down" and focus on quality. Because quantity, the thinking goes, had its moment already. After all, it wasn't so long ago that platforms like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn rewarded content creators who churned out tons of content. Content teams cranked out as much as they could. But it became a race to the bottom and before long, social networks decided giving away free traffic was bad for business.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Content marketers, by and large, moved their focus to a more established and reliable distribution channel. Someplace where quality can thrive and traffic comes in slowly and predictably over time: <strong>organic search</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite Google's imperfections, most writers I know are far happier writing for search than social. Pieces are worked on for a week or a month instead of an afternoon. Clickbait headlines are passed over in favor of depth and comprehension.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what if we all overcorrected? What if prolific writing actually does work? What if quality or quantity isn't a one-or-the other decision? Could content teams benefit from upping their output?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote><p>For about six months in 2015, I was the world's most productive content marketer.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wrote, edited, and published one article per day. These weren't light pieces either. They were heavily-researched deep dives, anywhere from 800 to 3,500 words. Four years later, many of them still rank on the first page of search results for competitive terms like "creative juices", "asynchronous communication," and "tools to start a business."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>An article in the New Yorker recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/was-e-mail-a-mistake" target="_blank">linked to one</a> of these pieces. My first week on the job I was interviewed on a national radio show about one of them. Our approach worked and before long, the <a href="https://idonethis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="iDoneThis (opens in a new tab)">iDoneThis</a> site grew to 400,000 monthly pageviews. This strategy isn't for everyone, but it can work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One piece per day. Here's how I did it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Structure Your Day to Enable Creative Work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“In effect I had two workdays each day, one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's.”—Paul Graham.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I must have read Paul Graham’s famous “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule</a>” piece, where he suggests structuring a day into two blocks of time. One block is for focused creative work, the “maker” side, the other is for the “manager” part of your role like meetings and email.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could never have made this work without the maker/manager approach. Writing just requires so much focus and momentum. It’s like pushing a flywheel. It’s hard to get it started, but once it’s spinning it’s hard to stop. You’re best off starting and stopping only once per day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here was what my daily schedule looked like:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>7:30-8am:</strong> This was a quick skim of email and Slack. I’m talking 15-20 minutes of sitting with a cup of coffee and making sure nothing set on fire overnight or needed my immediate attention. I’m not trying to clear out inboxes yet, just hoping to let the caffeine kick in and give myself some assurance that I can safely slide into maker mode for the next few hours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>8am-12pm:</strong> The first half of the day was full-on writing mode. Saying you can start and finish anything in just half a day sounds ambitious. And it is when that time’s full of distractions and email. But think about four uninterrupted hours. That’s a lot of time. What’s the last thing you totally focused on for four hours?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I intentionally structured maker time so it would end at lunch. Lunch is a nice finish line and dividing point for the day. It helps to have a few minutes to reset yourself before switching to manager mode. I’d get away from my desk, stretch out, take a walk, have something to eat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other bonus of putting writing time before lunch was that I could always delay lunch and buy myself an extra 60 or 90 minutes of writing time if I needed it. I didn’t quit until I had a draft written, read, read, read again, edited, read again, and in a place where I was confident publishing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>12-12:30pm:</strong> Like I said, lunch. Also, get outside, walk the dog, meet a friend for coffee. Reset my thoughts. This was a fully remote team, so getting some sunshine and seeing other humans was super important.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1-5:30pm: </strong>Manager time. Even though the top line in my job description would have been “write blog posts,” there was a lot of work that wasn’t writing which I needed to make time for. Like running our email program, promoting the content, tracking performance, 1:1s with my manager, answering email and Slack, uploading and scheduling content into WordPress. I was also the only person in a marketing role in this startup, so you naturally wind up wearing a lot of hats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Manager time typically didn’t take 4.5 hours, thankfully. And there was one more, really key activity during this time that I’ll get to in the next section.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Set Strict Rules for Your “Maker” Time</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were two things I really didn’t want to happen during writing time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The <strong>first</strong> was that I would sit down in the morning without knowing what I’d be working on, and waste my maker time trying to figure that out.</li><li>The <strong>second</strong> was that I’d start working on a piece, spend half a day on it, realize I didn’t have a strong enough idea and have to scrap it entirely. A lot of pieces sound good as a pitch, but fall apart once you try actually writing it. I didn’t want this to happen.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To keep both these fears at bay, I developed a strict “validated topics only” rule. That extra time during manager block that I mentioned? Researching and validating. This was for finding research, brainstorming, combing thought ideas and topics, finding the ones with potential and doing enough initial legwork to know the piece would actually hold up. Any extra time after regular manager activities was used for this.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To keep my system working, I always made sure to <strong>over-communicate the process.</strong> This was a remote team, and a small team, so I had some built-in protection against interruptions. But I still found it helpful to over-communicate my process. I’d talk about the system multiple times with managers and colleagues. I’d set my Slack status to something like “focusing on writing until noon,” I’d block my calendar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re going to try this, you’ve got to commit, and you’ve got to over-communicate. It simply won't work without large chunks of time every single day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Create a Workflow to Support Your Strategy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like I said, validating before writing was a huge part of making this work. Most content teams have some workflow that goes like this: Ideas, Writing, Editing, Published. I think there’s a missing step between ideas and writing, and that’s <em>validating</em>. Maybe it’s my newspaper background, because when I was a reporter I could never just grab an idea and start writing. I’d have to validate that idea with my editor. Often they would even need to validate it with the other editors in a morning planning meeting before giving me the green light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m a big fan of Trello for managing content workflows. My Trello columns looked like this:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Ideas</li><li>Validating</li><li>Validated</li><li>Writing and editing</li><li>Ready for Wordpress</li><li>Scheduled in Wordpress</li><li>Published</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll just talk about the first three steps, since they are the most important. Why’s that? In any production system, flaws become more costly the further they move down the line. So it’s always more important, and cheaper, to catch errors as early in the production process as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Ideas:</strong> The first column—"Ideas"—was wide open. I’m a proponent of big backlogs and a “no bad ideas” approach. Every idea, even ones you think are bad or half-baked, go on there. A year from now that bad idea might weave together with two new ideas and turn into something great. Large backlogs are a secret weapon for a content program. </li><li><strong>Validating:</strong> The next column—"Validating"—was way more selective. These are topics where I felt like there was potential, and in a less-efficient system I might have just started writing right from here. The idea in "Validating" is to take topics from gut feel to a place where I’ve got some evidence the topic is sound and I’m confident enough to spend a day writing. </li><li><strong>Validated:</strong> From here, topics either move on to "Validated" or back to "Ideas." "Validated" became the column I could pull from at the beginning of each maker block. I could start my day knowing I had a strong topic that wouldn’t fall apart, I had research to work from</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This process wasn't complicated, but it was vital to the success of our strategy. It ensured that I had a distraction-free environment with a team who knew what I was doing. Most of all, it gave me time to write prolifically. And the more I wrote, the better I understood what content drove traffic and leads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>As software teams, we know how important it is to have the right tool for any given job. After all, we’re the people who actually <em>build</em> the tools used for all kinds of jobs.</p>



<p>And now, as more companies make digital transformations, there’s mounting pressure to build better apps, faster. Software teams are expected to get more and more agile, which requires teamwork from development and operations teams to increase their build velocity and deliver new, better solutions —&nbsp;faster than ever before.</p>



<p>You already know that’s where DevOps practices come in. Agile methodologies are the key to delivering the constantly increasing speed and quality that’s now expected. But what DevOps tool is right for the job? When software teams have so many choices, how do they know they’re using the best tool for the job?</p>



<p>Two of the biggest names in the game are Azure DevOps and GitHub, so let’s take a look at both, their similarities and differences, pros and cons, and see which one is actually the better tool for developers.</p>



<h2>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: What are the differences?</h2>



<p>When you get down to the bare basics of each of them, Azure DevOps and GitHub Projects are both project management tools for development teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Azure DevOps</strong> is a collection of services for teams to share their code, track their work, and deploy and ship software. Some of the products included in Azure DevOps are:</p>



<ul><li>Azure Boards</li><li>Azure Pipelines</li><li>Azure Repos</li><li>Azure Artifacts</li></ul>



<p>What sets Azure DevOps apart from the many tools available to developers and software teams is its extended features for supporting continuous delivery/integration (CI/CD). Azure DevOps comes with a pretty robust set of features, including:</p>



<ul><li>Agile tools, like kanban boards, backlogs, and scrum boards</li><li>Reporting via dashboards, widgets, and Power BI</li><li>Git, which is a free repository with unlimited private hosting and pull requests</li></ul>



<p>Azure DevOps has also long supported other Microsoft products, and offered cloud-specific development services like cloud build and cloud testing.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong>GitHub </strong>is a massive, open-source code repository that has long been a favorite for sharing and collaboration among teams. It features some of the best source control management the internet has to offer, along with cloud-based code sharing and social networking among an expansive community of developers all over the world.</p>



<p>While Microsoft has spent the last few years making moves to make Azure DevOps more open-source friendly, GitHub has always been designed that way. Think of it like “social coding” —&nbsp;users can work together on projects, share projects for experimentation and specialization, and use the platform to share ideas and find new collaborators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GitHub’s list of features is also pretty stacked, including:</p>



<ul><li>Cod management in both private and public repositories</li><li>Code workflow via GitHub Actions, GitHub Packages, code reviews, pull requests, and protected branches</li><li>Excellent security and compliance tools, from customizable security alerts and automated code scanning to audit logs and LDAP</li><li>A marketplace for finding integrations like build tools, issue trackers, and more</li></ul>



<p>Both Azure DevOps and GitHub are Microsoft products, and when Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018, it went straight to work at adding integration features that would allow Azure DevOps users to use GitHub as well. Despite how seamlessly the two toolsets can integrate now, though, there are still users who prefer one or the other. To fully understand how to choose between Azure DevOps, GitHub, or both, you need to understand the pros and cons of each.</p>



<h2>Azure Devops vs GitHub: Pros and Cons</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://stackshare.io/stackups/azure-devops-vs-github-enterprise">reviews</a> from users, there are plenty of pros and cons to consider with both Azure DevOps and GitHub tools.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps Pros and Cons</h3>



<p>Let’s start with Azure DevOps.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Azure DevOps Pros and Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td>– Complete, flexible, and powerful set of tools<br>– Huge ecosystem of extensions<br>– One-stop-shop for all tools teams need for agile methodology and DevOps<br>– Constantly improving<br>– Free for five or fewer users<br>– Supports open source</td><td>– Some users describe it as a “Jack of all trades, master of none”<br>– Expensive for large teams</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3>GitHub Pros and Cons</h3>



<p>And now for GitHub’s pros and cons.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>GitHub Pros and Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td>– Constant new features useful for developers<br>– Brings social aspects into programming<br>– Fast and easy version control<br>– Industry standard for open source projects<br>– Extremely affordable</td><td>– The UI is not as simple as some other tools, meaning there can be a learning curve to use</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As you can see, real users think both these tools have a lot of pros, and not too many cons. So which one is actually better? Let’s take a look at how they stack up in different areas.</p>



<h2>How Do Azure DevOps and GitHub Compare?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Choosing the right tool for your team means evaluating both Azure DevOps and GitHub in a number of important areas. Here’s how they stack up against one another.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Included Features</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>When it comes to their features and capabilities, both Azure DevOps and GitHub are powerful, stacked toolsets. Both are comprehensive and feature-rich, allowing teams to share and track their projects and code, opening doors for collaboration across teams, and creating an environment for quickly building software with CI/CD in mind.</p>



<p>We’ve already discussed a lot of the features that make both Azure DevOps and GitHub stand out in a sea of tools developers can choose from, so we’ll just say this: These are both pretty comprehensive and formidable sets of tools for teams of all sizes that come with useful integrations, collaboration support, and other features that make them powerful and attractive to all software teams.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Ease of Use</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>Both Azure DevOps and GitHub should be reasonably simple for the average software team to learn and use. They both have attractive, elegant interfaces as well as simple integrations with tools that should already be familiar to many developers.</p>



<p>It all depends on your team, though, and for some types of development, there may be a learning curve involved with either Azure DevOps or GitHub. While neither tool is <em>difficult</em> to use, they’re also not perfectly intuitive. However, to help combat this, both tools offer tutorials and courses, like GitHub’s fun <a href="https://lab.github.com/">Learning Lab</a>.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Community Support</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>When it comes to community support, GitHub almost has to come out on top just because of the way it was designed: As a social, collaborative platform. Simply because of that, GitHub has some of the best community support there is in this industry.</p>



<p>But Azure DevOps users aren’t on their own by any means. While Azure DevOps products don’t quite have the same social support, Microsoft does have Azure DevOps virtual assistants who are available to help customers with questions. And if you need more support, you can purchase an Azure Support Plan.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Release Rate</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub: 5/5</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>Azure DevOps is a tool that’s been around (in many different iterations) for some time. Formerly known as Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team System, Azure DevOps sees regular releases and feature additions as users’ needs shift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, GitHub has evolved over its lifespan. It started as an online, social code repository, and has since grown into the suite of tools it contains today. Still, GitHub sees multiple new releases each month, including essentials like security updates, and new features as needed.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Pricing</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>For many teams, the cost is a major consideration when it comes to choosing the tools you’ll use in the long-term. Both Azure DevOps and GitHub offer different pricing plans and models depending on what a team might need.</p>



<p>Azure DevOps has per-user licenses available for purchase, and also sells bundles of services or individual units of usage. The Basic Plan costs $6 per user per month, and gives your users access to Pipelines, Boards, Repos, and Artifacts. Adding Azure’s Test Plans service increases the price pretty significantly, up to $52 per user per month.</p>



<p>GitHub, on the other hand, is widely viewed to be a more affordable option. All public, open-source projects can be hosted for free, and private repository plans start at $7 per month for personal use, up to $21 per user per month for enterprise plans.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: API, Extensibility, and Third-Party Integrations</h3>



<p><em>Azure DevOps</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p><em>GitHub</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating5-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>Both Azure DevOps and GitHub allow for interfacing with their platforms via API very seamlessly. They also both offer extensive marketplaces of third-party integrations, from your favorite chat tools like Slack and HipChat to CI/CD tools like Semaphore and Travis CI.</p>



<p>There is a wide range of outside tools that communicate well with Azure DevOps, including REST APIs, command-line tools, web-based tools, desktop client developers, and more.</p>



<p>And GitHub Apps and Actions is where users can find a similarly wide variety of tools and solutions that integrate seamlessly with GitHub.</p>



<h3>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Security</h3>

<p><em>GitHub: 4/5</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="303" height="72" src="http://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs.png 303w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rating4-blog-vs-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px"></figure>



<p>And finally, there’s the question of security — a pretty important consideration for most software teams. For this, we’ll turn to some security experts: UpGuard, which <a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/what-are-security-ratings">creates objective, data-driven security ratings</a> for online companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UpGuard rates Microsoft’s Azure website at <a href="https://www.upguard.com/instant-security-score/report?c=azure.microsoft.com">751 points out of 950</a>, which is a B rating.</p>



<p>GitHub is rated slightly higher at <a href="https://www.upguard.com/instant-security-score/report?c=github.com">789 points out of 950</a>, which is also a B rating.</p>



<h2>Azure DevOps vs GitHub: Which Tool Is Better?</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>In 1935, a gentleman called Alonzo Church came up with a simple scheme that could compute…just about anything. His scheme was called Lambda Calculus. It was a phenomenal innovation, given that there weren’t even computers for him to test out his ideas. Even cooler is that those very ideas affect us today: anytime you use a function, you owe a hat tip to Mr. Church. </p><p>Lambda Calculus is so cool that many hackers use it as their secret handshake — a “discreet signal” if you will. The most famous, of course, is PG’s Y Combinator. In this essay, we’ll find out what it’s all about, and do things with functions that we’d never have imagined. In the end you’ll have built just about every programming concept: numbers, booleans, you name it…just with functions.</p><p>City dwellers who drive SUVs rarely consider their cars as ferocious machines that traverse rocky deserts and flooded rivers. It’s the same with programmers and functions. Here’s what we <em>think</em> functions do:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> square (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>*</span><span> x x)))</span></code></pre><p>Safe, clean, and useful. We’re so accustomed that it would surprise us to find the myriad of ways we can bend functions to do just about anything. </p><p>Let’s step out into the wilderness a bit. Say you wanted to make a data structure for pairs: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> pair (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>(</span><span>first</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 0</span>
<span>(</span><span>second</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>How would you do it? It’s sensible to use a map or a class or a record to represent a pair. But…you could use functions too.</p><p>Here’s one way we can make a pair:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                   (</span><span>fn</span><span> [selector]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>selector</span><span> a b))))</span></code></pre><p>No maps or classes…it just returns a function! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-pair (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>ex-pair</span>
<span>; =&gt; #object[church_factorial$church_pair...</span></code></pre><p>Now  our <code>ex-pair</code> takes a <code>selector</code> argument. What if we ran ex-pair with this selector:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>ex-pair</span><span> (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span></code></pre><p>Well, <code>(ex-pair (fn [a b] a))</code> would expand too: </p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a) a b)</span></code></pre><p>Which would return… <code>a</code>! </p><p>That just gave us the <code>first</code> value of our pair! We can use that to write a <code>church-first</code> function:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-first-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-first (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                    (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-first-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-first</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 0</span></code></pre><p>And do something similar for second: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-second-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] b))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-second (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-second-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-second</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>We just used functions to represent pairs. Now, since the grammar for Lisp is just a bunch of pairs plopped together, that also means we can represent the grammar of Lisp…with just functions!</p><p>What we just did was analogous to a city dweller driving their SUV…on a snowy day. It gets a <em>lot</em> crazier. </p><p>We said we could represent <em>everything</em>. Let’s go ahead and try it! </p><p>Here’s what can do. Let’s take a function we know and love, and implement it from top-to-bottom in Lambda Calculus.</p><p>Here’s factorial: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> factorial-clj [n]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> n)</span>
<span>    </span><span>1</span><span> </span>
<span>    (</span><span>*</span><span> n (</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> n)))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 120</span></code></pre><p>By the end of this essay, we’ll have built factorial, only with functions.</p><p>To do this, I want to come up front and say I am cheating a little bit. In Church’s Lambda Calculus, there is no <code>def</code>, and all functions take one argument. Here’s all he says: </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjA4LTc0M2VkMDgwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05YTI2LTFlMGUyOWFmNDQ0MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>In his rules, you define anonymous functions by popping a little <code>λ</code> in front. What follows is the argument, following by a  <code>.</code> .After the <code>.</code> is the application.</p><p>This is very much akin to a single-argument anonymous function in Clojure: <code>λ x. x</code> =&gt; <code>(fn [x] x)</code></p><p>We could follow those rules, but writing factorial like that is going to get hard to reason about very quickly. Let’s tweak the rules just a little bit. The changes won’t affect the essence of Lambda Calculus but will make it easier for us to think about our code. Here it goes:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjE3LTc5OWMxYjAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05N2U5LWY0ZDIxZGE2YmJkOC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>1<!-- -->)<!-- --> for a single argument function, <code>(fn [x] x)</code> maps pretty well to Church’s encoding. We can go ahead and use it as is.</p><p>2<!-- -->)<!-- --> Since Church’s lambdas only take one argument, For him to express a function with two arguments, he has to write <em>two</em> anonymous functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>λ</span><span> f. λ x. f x)</span></code></pre><p>This would map to:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f] (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>But, nesting our functions like this can get annoying in Clojure <sup>1</sup>. To make life easier for us, we’ll allow for multi-argument functions:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>3<!-- -->)<!-- --> Finally, Church has no concepts of variables outside of what’s provided by a function definition. </p><p>For him to express </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>make-pair</span><span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>He would have to “unwrap” <code>make-pair</code></p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>λ</span><span> a. λ b. λ selector . selector a b)</span>
<span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>To keep our code sane, we’ll allow for <code>def</code>, but with one rule: </p><p><strong>You can use</strong> <strong><code>def</code></strong> <strong>, as long as you can “replace” it with an anonymous function and nothing breaks.</strong> </p><p>For example, imagine if <code>make-pair</code> <em>referenced itself</em>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> make-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                 (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> ...)))</span></code></pre><p>This would break because if we replaced <code>(def make-pair …)</code> with an anonymous function, there would be no variable called <code>make-pair</code> anymore! </p><p>That’s it, these are our rules. With that, we’re ready to make factorial! </p><p>The first thing we need is the concept of a number. How can we do that? </p><p>Church thought of a pretty cool idea. What if “numbers”, where higher-order functions with two arguments:  a function <code>f</code>, and a value <code>v</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> zero (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v] v))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> one (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>zero</span><span> f v))))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p><strong>We can figure out what number each function represents by “counting” the number of times</strong> <strong><code>f</code></strong> <strong>was composed.</strong> </p><p>For example, 0 would compose <code>f</code> zero times: it would just return <code>v</code>.  1, would compose f once: <code>(f v)</code>. 2 would compose twice: <code>(f (f v))</code>, and so on. </p><p>To help us see these numbers in our REPL, let’s create a quick converter function: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [church-numeral]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> inc </span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Since a church numeral composes <code>f</code> the number of times it is called with <code>v</code> as the first argument, all we need to see what number it is in Clojure, is to provide <code>inc</code> as <code>f</code> and <code>0</code> as <code>v</code>! Now <code>2</code> would do <code>(inc (inc 0))</code> for example, and get us the corresponding Clojure number.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [zero one two])</span>
<span>; =&gt; (0 1 2)</span></code></pre><p>Cool! </p><p>Take a look at how we wrote two: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p>What we did here,  is <em>delegate</em> f’s composition to the numeral before (in this case <code>one</code> ), and then just called <code>f</code> <em>one more time.</em> </p><p>What if we abstracted the <code>one</code> out?</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-inc</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> f v))))) </span></code></pre><p>Voila. Give this function a numeral, and it will return a new numeral that calls <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. We’ve just discovered <code>inc</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> one)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>3</span></code></pre><p>Cool.</p><p>Now that we have this function, we can also write a quick helper to translate Clojure numbers to these numbers:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> int-&gt;church-numeral</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [clojure-int]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> clojure-int)</span>
<span>      zero</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> clojure-int))))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>5</span></code></pre><p>That’ll come in handy for our REPL.</p><p>Next up, we need a way to “decrement” a number. Well, with <code>inc</code> we create a numeral that composes <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. If we can make some kind of function that composes <code>f</code> <em>one less time,</em> then we’d have <code>dec</code>! </p><p>To do that, we’ll need to go on a short diversion.</p><p>Remember our <code>pair</code> data structure? Let’s create a function for it (we’ll use this in just a moment below): <code>shift-and-inc</code>.  All it would do, is take pair of numbers, and “shift” the pair forward by one:</p><p>For example, applying <code>shift-and-inc</code> to <code>(0 1)</code>,  would produce <code>(1 2)</code>. One more time, it would produce <code>(2 3)</code>, and so on. </p><p>Sounds simple enough: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> shift-and-inc (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>church-pair</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)))))</span></code></pre><p>Bam, we take a pair. The second item is shifted over to the first positions and is replaced with its <code>inc</code>ed friend. Let’s try it out:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> [p (</span><span>shift-and-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> one two))]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [(</span><span>church-first</span><span> p) (</span><span>church-second</span><span> p)]))</span>
<span>; =&gt; (2 3)</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm!</p><p>Now that we have <code>shift-and-inc</code>, what if we did this: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-dec</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-first</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> shift-and-inc</span>
<span>                      (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> zero zero)))))</span></code></pre><p>Remember that our <code>church-numeral</code> would call <code>shift-and-inc</code> N times, representing its numeral value. If we started with a pair <code>(0, 0)</code>, then what would the result b, if we composed <code>shift-and-inc</code> <code>N</code> times?</p><p>Our result would be the pair <code>(N-1, N)</code>. This means that if we take the first part of our pair, we have <code>dec</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-dec</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>)))</span>
<span>; =&gt; 9</span></code></pre><p>Nice.</p><p>Next up, multiplication. Say we multiply <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>. We’d need to produce a church numeral that composes <code>f</code>, <code>a * b</code> times. To do that, we can leverage the following idea:</p><p>Say we made a function <code>g</code>, which composes <code>f</code> <em>b</em> times. If we fed that function to <code>a</code>, it would call <code>g</code>, <em>a</em> times.  </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjI2LTdmOTFmYzAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05MmY2LTVlZDdhNzA0YWE1MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If <code>a</code> was “2” and “b” was 3, how many times would <code>f</code> get composed? Well, <code>g</code> would be composed twice. Each time <code>g</code> is composed, <code>f</code> is composed 3 times. That comes out to a total of 6 times!</p><p>Bam, if we did that, it would represent multiplication.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-*</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [num-a num-b]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>num-a</span><span> (</span><span>partial</span><span> num-b f) v))))</span></code></pre><p>Here, <code>(partial num-b f)</code> represents our <code>g</code> function. </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-*</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>) (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>25</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm! </p><p>We’ve got numbers, we’ve got <code>*</code> and we’ve got <code>dec</code>. Next up…booleans! </p><p>To do this, we need to be creative about what <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> is. </p><p>Let’s say this. Booleans are two argument functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-true (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>
<span>                   </span><span>when-true</span><span>))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-false (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>
<span>                    </span><span>when-false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>They take a “true” case and a “false” case. Our <code>church-true</code> function would return the true case, and <code>church-false</code> function would return the false case. </p><p>That’s it. Surprisingly this is enough to handle booleans. Here’s how we could convert them to Clojure bools.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-bool-&gt;bool [church-bool]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-bool</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Our <code>church-true</code> would return the first argument (true), and our <code>church-false</code> would return the second one! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-bool-&gt;bool</span><span> church-true)</span>
<span>; =&gt; true</span>
<span>(</span><span>church-bool-&gt;bool</span><span> church-false)</span>
<span>; =&gt; false</span></code></pre><p>Do they look familiar? …</p></span></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><section><p>This post was originally part of my series on <span>Python for Feature Film</span> on <a href="http://www.dgovil.com/">my personal site</a>, but is being ported here with minor changes. The dates have been adjusted to match release dates for the projects.</p></section><p>Python is a programming language that has become integral to the movie making process over the last few years. There’s rarely an animated feature or visual effects film, if any, that hasn’t had Python play a large part in getting it to the screen</p><p>When people think about movies, even programmers often think about the artistry involved in bringing those images to life. However, the technical side of the film industry is something that often goes unnoticed outside a small group of people.</p><p>To that end, I’ve written a few blog posts about how I’ve used Python on several major films that I’ve been lucky enough to work on. Hopefully this shows how much it contributes to the entire life of a movie.</p><p>I’ve also recently released a course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-maya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Udemy</a> to teach artists how to learn Python For Maya since it’s becoming an increasingly valuable skill in the industry. These blog posts serve as companion material to the course as well.</p><p>With that intro out of the way let’s continue…</p><section></section><hr><h2 id="what-is-python">What is Python?</h2><p>Some of you may not be familiar with Python.</p><p>Python is a programming language designed to be very easy to read and write. It’s incredibly popular in the feature film industry as well as other groups, like mathematics, science and machine learning.</p><p>You can learn more about Python on <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the official website</a>.</p><p>It’s important to note that today, the film industry is largely still tied to Python 2.7. There is a concerted effort in 2020 to move over to Python 3, and
we should start seeing larger Python 3 adoption starting in 2021 and moving forward.</p><hr><h2 id="the-feature-film-pipeline">The Feature Film Pipeline</h2><p>The biggest use of Python is in our feature film pipeline.</p><p>This is an image that describes the pipeline at most major studios.
The Pipeline is the arrows that link each department together. It’s responsible for making sure that data flows between each department and that everyone can play well together.
It’s also responsible for the toolsets in each department so that the artists themselves can work efficiently, but for now lets focus on the inter-department flow.</p><div>

    </span></p><figcaption>An overview of the Film Production Pipeline</figcaption></div><p>Here you can see the various stages of a visual effects film or animated feature. Studios may differ slightly from this, but it’s the general workflow.</p><p>The storyboards/footage/previs represent the data we get, and Compositing/Lighting are the last stages of the film for us.
Visual Effects Films differ slightly from animated films because you have to deal with the extra added element of film footage in the form of plates.</p><div><figcaption>A more visual demonstration of this graph is in this video of the making of Ratatouille by Pixar</figcaption></div><p>The Pipeline is responsible for getting the data between departments. Here’s the gist of how it works (though it is more organic a process than the one described):</p><ul><li>We get data from the client or story artists in form of plates, previsualization (previs) or storyboards that tell us what is happening in the scene.</li><li>Modeling look at all of this and generate 3D models of all the assets that will be required.</li><li>Rigging take the modelled assets for characters and apply a virtual skeleton to make it animatable.</li><li>Matchmove are in charge of creating virtual cameras that match the ones used to shoot the film as well as any standin characters or geometry</li><li>Layout take the rigs, and either create their own cameras or take matchmoves cameras and set up the scene. They’re the equivalent of a virtual director of photography.</li><li>The scene is then handed off to Animation, who are the equivalent of the actors. They are in charge of the movement of the characters, and bring the inanimate skeletons to life.</li><li>CharacterFX are in charge of all the technical parts of animation. Muscle simulations, making cloth move realistically, the hair, grass etc… all comes from CharacterFX.</li><li>FX then handle the non animation related effects. Whether it be destruction, fire, voxelization, etc… there’s a lot that FX is in charge of.</li><li>While this is happening, Texturing are in charge of giving color to the 3D Assets so they aren’t just grey objects.</li><li>Shading then takes these textures and gives the assets a material that tells it how light should interact with it.</li><li>Matte Painting are the department we use when it is not logical or feasible to build an environment. We realistically can only build so much, and past that point it’s more efficient to have someone make a very high quality painting instead.</li><li>This all gets funnelled into Lighting who are in charge of adding lights to the shot and rendering the image out. They also do a little bit of compositing to sweeten the image. On an animated feature this may be the end of the show.</li><li>On a visual effects show, we have to prepare the plates by either removing unwanted elements, removing noise or removing the lens warp. This is handled by Plate Prep,also known as RotoPaint.</li><li>Finally everything goes to Compositing who take all the images and integrate our CG renders into the actual film plate. On a visual effects show, this will be the last stage.</li></ul><p>We use Python to tie all these bits together.
In the next section I’ll go over publishing before moving onto describing how Python is used for the individual departments.</p><h3 id="publishing-and-asset-management">Publishing and Asset Management</h3><p>This is pretty much the core of traditional pipeline, to make sure assets can be shared between departments and be tracked.</p><p>The first part of this is Asset Publishing.</p><p>When a department deems it’s work ready, it decides to publish it so the next department in the chain can consume it. For example modeling exports models, but does animation export animation? Well that depends on who is consuming it. This is dependent on whether it needs to be interactive past this point or not.</p><p>For geometry  we often just publish as a geometry cache using Alembic  which is a industry standard developed by Imageworks and ILM so that we can have a consistent cache format.
For point cloud data, we either use Alembic or OpenVDB, for images we tend to use tiff’s or OpenEXR.
Soon the industry will probably also standardize on a universal scene format from Pixar called OpenUSD.</p><p>Anyway  the idea is to generally keep the data in the most efficient format possible, while allowing for easy interchange. Cache data is often best because you really only take an IO hit, which is cheap, versus a deformation hit, which can be very expensive.</p><p>This all gets really complex though. Artists don’t need to know where their data is coming from or going to, or even how it gets there. They just need to be able to load it in and publish it out.</p><p>This is the pipeline. We develop the UI’s and the tools to do this in a very user friendly manner.</p><div>
  <p><img src="https://www.gfx.dev/e49c8aaf611022c8415419e9f49e3d71/pyblish.gif" alt="Pyblish is a similar but open soruce frontend that is featured here for reference"></p>
    <figcaption><a href="https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-qml">Pyblish</a> is a tool by Marcus Ottosson that is similar to many publishing tools in studios</figcaption></div><p>To publish data, the user just has to open a publish UI that will validate their assets against some tests, and then send it off to the machine farms where the conversion to one of the open formats happens.</p><p>To ingest the published data, we similarly just have an asset browser that lets the artist pick which asset they want. Often they just see a thumbnail and description. The details are irrelevant to most artists.</p><p>Because these publishing and asset management systems need to be common to multiple apps, we develop them in Python and Qt (PyQt or PySide) , which allows us to reuse our code without recompiling for each application and makes it easy to rapidly add functionality where needed.</p><p>This is common to pretty much every department, so I figure it warrants its own section here rather than repeating for each.</p><hr><h3 id="modeling">Modeling</h3><p>Modeling is the department in charge of creating the 3D source geometry used by every other department.
Often there are quite a few repetitive tasks involved in regards to placing or editing geometry, or even just managing the scene.</p><div>

    </span></p><figcaption>A wireframe of a 3D model. This is Blender's Susan mesh.</figcaption></div><p>This is where Python comes in handy. Most 3D packages have a Python API that lets you do program everything that you would do manually.</p><p>So instead of spending 10minutes creating a simple asset, you can script it up and then just click a button when you need it next time. That 10 minutes saved really adds up, and over the course of a project you may be saving hundreds of hours that could be better focused on building more complex assets that require artistic input.</p><p>For example, in  my course  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-maya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Python For Maya</a> I go over creating a simple gear using Python as well as creating a simple UI so that you can specify how many teeth the gear has and how long they will be.</p><p>This can get more complex though with using Python to create custom deformers or interactive tools, like this demo from Hans Godard demonstrates.</p><div><figcaption>Hans Godard has made some really interesting Python based modeling utilities.</figcaption></div><hr><h3 id="rigging">Rigging</h3><p>Rigging’s job is to create a skeleton for the character geometry so that it can deform, just like a real human would.</p><p>Of course that’s an over simplification.
Rigging is also essentially creating the interface that animators use to bring these creatures to life, but they also have to make sure that any movement happens convincingly.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>As I dabbled in SEO and content marketing, I quickly ran into a problem: I had way more content ideas to write about than there was time for.</span></p> <p><span>An article about a not-too-complicated topic would take me 2 hours to write, plus research and editing. But some of these topics weren't all that interesting, and I didn't want to spend all my time writing. </span></p> <p><span>I needed a way to scale this.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Outsourcing </span></h3></p> <p><span>The first thought was to hire freelance writers. In this case, I could focus on finding topics and outlining them and have others flesh these out into complete articles. This is a common practice among content marketers. </span></p> <p><span>I hired three writers from different countries on Upwork to write about different topics. The cost came down to about $10 for a 700-word article. The turnaround was fast too. But the quality wasn't immediately publishable. I would still have to spend a lot of time editing the drafts myself, on top of the overhead of working with the writers.</span></p> <p><span>At this point, the hacker in me said, "that's it, I'm turning my attention to automation."</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Generating Content with </span> <strike>GPT-3</strike> <span> GPT-2</span></h3></p> <p><span>The first content automation approach was to use a generative language model given a prompt. </span> <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/" target="_blank"><span>OpenAI's GPT-3</span></a> <span> has been making waves with the huge model and cool demos, so it was a good place to start.</span></p> <p><span>At the time of writing, I didn't have access to GPT-3 (by the way, if anyone can hook me up that'd be great). Instead, I used </span> <a href="https://huggingface.co/gpt2" target="_blank"><span>Hugging Face</span></a> <span>'s implementation of GPT-2, which was similar but with fewer parameters. </span></p> <p><span>I would give it an article prompt, say the title or first sentence I had in mind, and GPT-2 would spit out a plausible-sounding paragraph. The output read like human writing, which was good. But it was too free-form and off-topic for my use case. Playing with the model parameters that I could tweak didn't help with this either.</span></p> <p><span>I needed more control over the output topics.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Trying Production Services</span></h3></p> <p><span>Then I thought, maybe there are more production-ready services I could use. Sure enough, I came across </span> <a href="https://contentyze.com/" target="_blank"><span>Contentyze</span></a> <span> on an </span> <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/175-przemek-chojecki-of-contentyze" target="_blank"><span>IndieHackers podcast</span></a> <span> episode and was excited to try it out. </span></p> <p><span>It promised a lot on the landing page. And it had an interface that was easy to use. But the outputs just weren't usable. It just seemed like a wrapper on top of the language models I already tried.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Paraphrasing a Paragraph </span></h3></p> <p><span>I thought of a different approach. What if I took existing content, automatically paraphrased it, and added my unique angle at the end?</span></p> <p><span>I could take the content that ranked on the first page of Google for my topic and repurpose it as a starting point for my draft. And to simplify the problem, I could start with paraphrasing one paragraph (or sentence) at a time. </span></p> <p><span>And if I could crack this, this would be immediately useful for content writers and college students alike.</span></p> <p><span>This direction seemed promising!</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Syntax-guided Controlled Generation of Paraphrases (SCGP)</span></h3></p> <p><span>I skimmed the latest natural language processing (NLP) research for the task of automatic paraphrasing. The first paper that caught my attention was the </span> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08417" target="_blank"><span>Syntax-guided Controlled Generation of Paraphrases (SCGP)</span></a> <span> paper (2020) by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science, Microsoft Research, and Google.</span></p> <p><span>It worked like this: given an input sentence (the sentence to be paraphrased) and an exemplar sentence, the model would "generate syntax conforming sentences [conforming to the exemplar] while not compromising on relevance". They even </span> <a href="https://github.com/malllabiisc/SGCP" target="_blank"><span>included the code</span></a> <span> and a pre-trained model. </span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/sgcp.png"></p>  <p><span>Big promise from a strong team. Let's give it a try!</span></p> <p><span>And...the output was disappointing. I took the pre-trained model and ran it on the test data they provided (that is, not even using my own content). The results were far from even correct sentences. Here's one example:</span></p> <p><em>Input Sentence: why do some people like cats more than dogs ? 
</em></p> <p><em>Exemplar Sentence: why do some people develop food allergies later in life ? </em></p> <p><em>Output Paraphrase: why do some people prefer dog puppies more than dogs in ?</em></p> <p><span>Fancy approach on paper, but this wouldn't fit my use case.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Word Embedding Attention Network (WEAN)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>The model would use word embeddings (vector representation) to capture the meanings of the words and generate words from decoding the embeddings. That sounded great in theory.</span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/wean.png"></p>  <p><span>In practice though, the outputs still weren't good enough. Using their pre-trained model, the outputs resembled correct sentences, but only for very simple phrases. For more meaningful sentences, often the model would not paraphrase at all. That is, the output would look exactly the same as the input. That was a deal-breaker for this use case since I couldn't just plagiarize other people's content.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3></p> <p><span>This was my first foray into delegating my writing. Many approaches I took sounded great in theory, but the outputs just weren't good enough at the time of writing. Though directionally I still think this is promising, as the automated techniques get more sophisticated. </span></p> <p><span>To this end, there are a few more ideas I can try: </span></p> <p><li><span>Run the paraphrase model outputs through a grammar-checking API. At least then I would eliminate the grammatical errors.</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Train models some more with my custom data, or tweak the model architecture to apply more constraints to the text generation.</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Try GPT-3 when I get access to it.</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Generate content from underlying structured data.</span></li></p> <p><span>Thanks for reading this much.</span></p>

<p>My friend sent a picture to our group chat complaining about the subtitles on his video.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.sharparam.com/2020/10/19/2020-10-19_00-53-28-310.png" alt="weird subtitle"></p>
<p>He assumed this was due to the OCR program used to generate the subtitles. Naturally he was confused how it managed to interpret <code>'s</code> as two random chinese glyphs. I was interested and asked him to extract the subtitles so that we could search for more occurences.</p>
<p>It turns out, there were plenty of places where <code>'s</code> was properly written in the subtitles, but 20 places where there were two random chinese glyphs. They were not all the same two glyphs. The resulting glyphs were always consistent with what the original text was.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>I have no idea what could have caused this replacement. There are plenty of words in the subtitle file that have apostrophes without a problem. I thought it might be an encoding problem, since the replacement for l was one codepoint before m.</p>
<p>The offset between the character for <code>m</code> and <code>U+6A93</code> was <code>0x6a26</code>, same for <code>l</code> and its replacement. The offset for <code>s</code> was <code>0x6a27</code> which just confused me even more.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to take a look at the rest of the subtitles to see what they can find, you can find them <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/GQh3168K">here</a>. Email me or post in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24826807">hacker news thread</a> if you find anything!</p>

    <p>TL;DR: These are the 3 major steps we took to reduce our memory footprint (0.2Gb instead of 4Gb) and the time to generate the reports (2m instead of 15m):</p>

<ul>
  <li>streamed the data directly to disk with <a href="https://github.com/felixbuenemann/xlsxtream">xlsxtream</a>;</li>
  <li>switched the memory allocator to <a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a>; and</li>
  <li>selected only what we needed, while avoiding ActiveRecord when pulling large amounts of data from the database</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="our-setup">Our setup</h2>

<p>Our main app used to be a rather big Rails monolith (235 Models, 220 Controllers, …) that was running on Heroku for the last few years.</p>

<p>Recently, we moved towards developing all new stuff as a smaller (micro) services alongside this monolith.
But hosting these smaller applications on Heroku quickly became too expensive, so we began to slowly migrate them to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">AWS EKS (AWS Managed Kubernetes Service)</a>.</p>

<p>After a while only our monolith remained on Heroku, so we decided to move it too.</p>

<p>Since there are parts of our monolith that are not so majestic, we expected some problems. Our biggest concern was reporting and its memory usage.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-history">Reporting history</h2>

<p>Reporting was developed in the early days of BetterDoc. Everything started as a simple HTML table. When the need to export them to Excel arose, we added a simple button to download the CSV report. That turned out to be error prone, so we switched to generating <code>.xlsx</code> files instead using the <a href="https://github.com/randym/axlsx">axlsx gem</a>. We also started to generate the reports in the background and upload them to our secure storage. Everything was working great until one day reports stopped coming.</p>

<p>We quickly realised that our Sidekiq jobs were lost. We were using Standard 2x dynos with 1GB of memory and it was not enough anymore to generate reports. We quickly scaled to Performance M dyno with 2.5GB of memory and everything was working again. Performance M dynos are 4 times more expensive than Standard 2x so we needed to fix our reports. We had other priorities so we just wrote a script that will auto scale worker dynos while reports are generated. This turned out to be good enough for the time being (we only needed bigger dyno for a few hours during the week), so we never came around to implement a real fix. 🥴</p>

<h2 id="migration-to-aws">Migration to AWS</h2>

<p>When we started the migration from Heroku it took almost 15 minutes to generate the biggest report. In this time the worker consumed more than 4GB of memory. We were scaling to Performance L dynos to make it work.</p>

<p>Pseudo code for the report was looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Axlsx</span><span>::</span><span>Package</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>p</span><span>|</span>

    <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connection</span><span>.</span><span>uncached</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>Inquiry</span><span>.</span><span>reporting</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:appointments</span><span>,</span> <span>:iterations</span><span>).</span><span>find_each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>inquiry</span><span>|</span>
        <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>add_row</span><span>(</span><span>values_for_report</span><span>(</span><span>inquiry</span><span>))</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>p</span><span>.</span><span>serialize</span><span>(</span><span>"report.xlsx"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="step-1-stream-to-excel">Step 1: Stream to Excel</h2>

<p>We were using <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Batches.html#method-i-find_each">find_each</a> so that <code>ActiveRecord</code> objects got initialized in batches instead of all at once. But <a href="https://github.com/randym/axlsx">axlsx</a> still built up the whole report in memory before writing it disk. To avoid this we switched to the <a href="https://github.com/felixbuenemann/xlsxtream">xlsxtream</a> gem which streams the rows to disk instead of writting them all at once. Luckily for us, the authors of <a href="https://github.com/felixbuenemann/xlsxtream">xlsxtream</a> were smart to keep the API very similar to <a href="https://github.com/randym/axlsx">axlsx</a> so the required changes were minimal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Xlsxtream</span><span>::</span><span>Workbook</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"report.xlsx"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>wb</span><span>|</span>
  <span>wb</span><span>.</span><span>add_worksheet</span><span>(</span><span>name: </span><span>"Some report"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>sheet</span><span>|</span>
    <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span><span>.</span><span>connection</span><span>.</span><span>uncached</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>Inquiry</span><span>.</span><span>reporting</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:appointments</span><span>,</span> <span>:iterations</span><span>).</span><span>find_each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>inquiry</span><span>|</span>
        <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>add_row</span><span>(</span><span>valuse_for_report</span><span>(</span><span>inquiry</span><span>))</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This change was enough to keep memory usage in a 2Gb - 2.5GB range and we were pretty confident that this should be enough to make it work on AWS. We migrated our monolith, tested everything on staging and everything worked fine. 👍</p>

<h2 id="step-2-reduce-memory-fragmentation">Step 2: Reduce memory fragmentation</h2>

<p>Soon after deploy to production we got a ticket reported that some reports were not being generated. Our Sidekiq workers were killed and restarted cause they were reaching memory limits. Generating the reports kept our workers busy for a longer period of time, so they were using a high number of threads. We were already aware of <a href="https://www.mikeperham.com/2018/04/25/taming-rails-memory-bloat/">ruby’s memory fragmentation issue</a> when using multiple theads, so we decided to try <a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a>. In a few hours we had jemalloc running in production and reports were succesfully generated with memory usage below 1.5GB. 💪</p>

<h2 id="step-3-optimize-the-data-retrival">Step 3: Optimize the data retrival</h2>

<p>While working on first 2 fixes we also spent some time thinking if we could replace ActiveRecord. ActiveRecord is a feature rich ORM but it is not a good fit for pulling large amount of “raw” data from the database. We decided to try <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a> instead.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/classes/Sequel/Model.html">Sequel::Model</a> we were able to reuse existing decorators and make the switch as simple as possible.</p>

<p>In the previous ActiveRecord-based version we also were fetching a lot of columns - due to eager loading some associations (<code>Inquiry.reporting.includes(:appointments, :iterations)</code>)  - but only used a small subset of them for the actual report. As such we made sure to only load columns which were strictly needed for any given report.</p>

<p>With this the final (pseudo) code was now looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Reports::Inquiry</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>Sequel</span><span>::</span><span>Model</span>
  <span>one_to_many</span> <span>:appointments</span><span>,</span> <span>class: </span><span>"Reports::Appointment"</span>
  <span>one_to_many</span> <span>:iterations</span><span>,</span> <span>class: </span><span>"Reports::Iteration"</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>decorate</span>
    <span>Inquiry</span><span>::</span><span>ReportDecorator</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>dataset</span> <span>=</span> <span>Reports</span><span>::</span><span>Inquiry</span>
  <span>.</span><span>select</span><span>([</span><span>:only</span><span>,</span> <span>:needed</span><span>,</span> <span>:columns</span><span>])</span>
  <span>.</span><span>eager</span><span>(</span>
    <span>appointments: </span><span>proc</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>ds</span><span>|</span> <span>ds</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>:id</span><span>,</span> <span>:inquiry_id</span><span>,</span> <span>:scheduled_date</span><span>)</span> <span>},</span>
    <span>iterations: </span><span>proc</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>ds</span><span>|</span> <span>ds</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>:id</span><span>,</span> <span>:inquiry_id</span><span>,</span> <span>:data</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>Xlsxtream</span><span>::</span><span>Workbook</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"report.xlsx"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>wb</span><span>|</span>
  <span>wb</span><span>.</span><span>add_worksheet</span><span>(</span><span>name: </span><span>"Some report"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>sheet</span><span>|</span>
    <span>dataset</span><span>.</span><span>paged_each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>inquiry</span><span>|</span>
      <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>add_row</span><span>(</span><span>valuse_for_report</span><span>(</span><span>inquiry</span><span>))</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When these changes were deployed, the memory usage of our production workers dropped to below 1GB. As a nice bonus our biggest report got generated in less than 2 minutes (from over 15 minutes before), and only consumed around 250MB of memory.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We should’ve done a lot of this when we first expirienced issues.</p>

<p>If you are generating big Excel files do it the right way from the beginning: stream the data and make sure to load only what you need.</p>

<p>Oh, and use jemalloc and Sequel, they are great!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/attention-cover.png" alt="Attention cover"></p><p>Attention. It helps you achieve all your goals as well as assists you when you procrastinate. If you know how to focus on the task at hand, you are more likely to achieve your goal, but sometimes you just can’t keep the focus and distract. In this article, you will find out how attention works and what causes it to alter.</p><p>But before going into the details, let’s talk about what attention is.</p><h2 id="a-small-window-into-the-vast-world">A Small Window Into The Vast World</h2><p>Attention is the process that selects which sensory information is preferentially processed and ultimately reaches our awareness.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/attention-satellitte-dish-analogy.png" alt="Satellite dish"></p><p>Consider the satellite dish. The signal from every satellite TV channel propagates through the air at every moment. And the satellite dish receives every frequency, but it amplifies only the channel we set it to. Millions of hours of airtime beam through space each moment, but we only see and hear what the satellite dish is tuned to, what it is focused on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>So it is with our brains and attention. We are bombarded with sensory information at any given moment: lights, sounds, sights, smells, balance, and more, but we direct our attention only to certain stimuli: the screen we see in front of us or a song we are listening to. Our attention works like a filter - we focus on what we like and filter out what we don’t seek. Like a satellite dish, the brain receives a flood of signal, but it promotes to our awareness only what we are interested in.</p><h2 id="orienting-attention-from-within-and-without">Orienting Attention From Within And Without</h2><p>We can orient our attention toward what we want or need as we decide. We are in charge of our attention. We are masters of it… Until we are not.</p><p>Studies have shown, and, from your experience, you can easily recall numerous cases when you are focusing on something but get distracted by noises, sights, people, and other unrelated things. Therefore, even though we are in charge of our attention, there is a lot more happening in the background.</p><p>In 2002, Maurizio Corbetta and Gordon L. Shulman published a paper<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in which they addressed the evidence of the two types of attention: the one that can be deployed under voluntary control and the other that can be captured by unexpected or salient events.</p><h2 id="goal-directed-attention-top-down">Goal-Directed Attention (Top-Down)</h2><p>Goal-Directed attention (GDA) is the cognitive effort we make when we are curious about something or when we focus on something that is aligned with our goals. And by “goals” here, I don’t mean some grandiose, life-defining objectives. If I ask you to look at the blue circle in the image below, focusing your attention on it is also a goal you are pursuing.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/colored-circles.png" alt="Image with three circles of different colors"></p><p>Another example is that you read these words now by deliberate focus and process the meaning of the text you see. Or whenever you speak with someone, you focus on the words they say and the meaning they try to communicate.</p><p>One essential characteristic of Goal-Directed attention is the fact that it is very narrow.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/gda.png" alt="Image with Goal-Directed attention that is narrow"></p><p>Since we purposefully direct the Goal-Directed attention on incoming sensory information or internal thoughts, we need to process that information to know how it aligns with our goal. But the conscious processing capabilities of our brains are scarce. Our Working Memory, which is believed to be where we operate and manipulate with data, has an estimated capacity of <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">four chunks of information.</a></p><p>Moreover, we cannot consciously focus on more than one thing at a time, which further thins down the already narrow focus we are able to exercise.</p><p>In 1959, Neville Moray published a paper<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> that described the phenomenon later coined as ** “The Cocktail Party Problem."** Experiment attendants were presented with two auditory information streams — one in each ear, and they were asked to attend to information presented in either one or the other ear.</p><p>The results showed that the verbal content in the unattended ear is blocked below the level of conscious perception, meaning that almost none of the verbal content of the rejected message is consciously processed.</p><p>Visual attention is also narrow. Even if the visual sense has the highest information throughput, we can process only about <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pixelated-perception/">10,000 bits/sec out of the 10,000,000,000 bits/sec</a> that hit our eyes every second.</p><p>To demonstrate this, let’s play a game. Do you know Waldo?</p><figure><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/waldo.png" alt="Image of Waldo"><figcaption><p>Source:
<a href="https://www.subpng.com/png-actfys/">subpng.com</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>It is a character from a series of children puzzle books. The books consist of detailed illustrations depicting some scenes with many people at a given location. And the goal is to find Waldo. Here is an example of a picture. Take a look at it to get a grasp of what’s in there.</p><p>Now, can you find Waldo in it?</p><figure><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/find-waldo.jpg" alt="Image where Waldo is hidden"><figcaption><p>Source:
<a href="https://pixy.org/1456168/">pixy.org</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>I hope you enjoyed searching for Waldo, but I’d like to discuss the <em>process</em> you followed.</p><p>First of all, you can tell at a glance what the picture above is about. It is some sparsely arranged marketplace with lots of people walking around. It feels almost effortless and natural — you glance over the image, and you form an impression of what is there.</p><p>However, everything changes the moment you start looking for Waldo. Then you begin to analyze the image meticulously, inch-by-inch. Some people go character by character, examining and comparing the character they see with Waldo’s stored representation in their Working Memory. Others might look frantically across the image, trying to spot some resembling patterns in characters (e.g., red-and-white-striped shirt, bobble hat, etc.). Yet others might move horizontally or vertically, trying to find Waldo along their line of sight.</p><p>Regardless of the approach you choose, you will still have to look thoroughly through the whole image until you finally find Waldo (spoiler alert: he’s at one of the corners of the table located at the top-left of the image).</p><p>That’s our Goal-Directed attention in action. You had a <strong>goal</strong> — to find Waldo, and because you cannot process the entire image at once, you have to go piece-by-piece and analyze it in small chunks.</p><h2 id="stimulus-driven-attention-bottom-up">Stimulus-Driven Attention (Bottom-Up)</h2><p>Imagine that while you are reading this article, you hear the sound of a breaking plate in the kitchen, which distracts you from reading. Or you are working on a report, and suddenly, the light starts to flash, thus distracting you from the job.</p><p>As the name suggests, this attention is driven by stimuli. As mentioned in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/human-senses/">How People Learn — Human Senses</a>, there are five sensory channels capable of receiving information (stimuli) of the following types:</p><ul><li>Vision</li><li>Hearing</li><li>Touch</li><li>Taste</li><li>Smell</li></ul><p>And there is an enormous difference between conscious and unconscious attention throughput:</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/attention-types-throughputs.png" alt="Image with conscious and unconscious attention throughput"></p><p>Although we can consciously process only a tiny bit of information we receive from the world around us, all that unconscious attention throughput is there for a reason. It participates in the unconscious monitoring of the world around us and promoting certain things to our attention, <strong>overriding our Goal-Directed attention,</strong> if necessary.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/sda.png" alt="Image with Stimulus-Driven attention that processes information from around us"></p><p>And it makes total sense from an evolutionary perspective. Imagine some of our very, very far ancestors, on a sunny day, found a bush with some delicious berries. They didn’t eat for a long time, and while savoring the juicy berries, totally immersed in this process, a branch cracks somewhere in the nearby bushes.</p><p>The first reaction is the <em>fight or flight (or freeze) response</em> that happens in the first milliseconds after hearing the cracking branch. And it happens automatically, without thinking like:</p><blockquote><p>“Hmm… what could have caused that sound in the nearest bush? Could it be a saber-toothed tiger? Or maybe a bird? I think it would be more reasonable to get away from it as most probable it is some predator since my brother reported seeing a group of lions recently.”</p></blockquote><p>Thus, some stimuli have the potential to override your Goad-Directed attention, even though you wouldn’t want that.</p><h3 id="the-drivers-of-stimulus-driven-attention">The Drivers Of Stimulus-Driven Attention</h3><p>But what exactly can override your attention? According to the father of American psychology, William James:</p><blockquote><p>In passive immediate sensorial attention, the stimulus is a sense-impression, either very intense, voluminous, or sudden — in which case it makes no difference what its nature may be, whether sight, sound, smell, blow, or inner pain — or else it is an instinctive stimulus, a perception which, by reason of its nature rather than its mere force, appeals to some one of our normal congenital impulses … these stimuli differ from one animal to another, and what most of them are in man: strange things, moving things, wild animals, bright things, pretty things, metallic things, blows, blood, etc.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Therefore, the Stimulus-Driven attention is captured by either high-contrast changes in our environment (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.) or intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.) or by some certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.), or somewhat “important” (e.g., one’s own name).</p><p>Similar conclusions were found in the Moray’s experiments:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>[…] Described the sort of reports that subjects could give about the rejected message. They could distinguish between speech, noise, and tones, recognize clicks and gross changes in pitch, such as the change from a man’s to a woman’s voice. But the verbal content of the message was blocked entirely, even to the extent of the subject being unable to say in what language the message was being spoken.</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, more salient stimuli, like gross changes in pitch or different tones, are promoted to our conscious attention, but more weak or homogeneous ones, like different words spoken in the same voice, are not.</p><h2 id="the-yin-and-yang-of-attention">The Yin And Yang Of Attention</h2><p>Although the two types of attention have different and sometimes opposite characteristics, it is the interaction between them that allows us to exhibit coherent behavior and navigate the social and physical worlds we live in.</p><p>Goal-Directed attention allows us to perform cognitive-related tasks when we need to concentrate and process information (e.g., communicating, writing reports, coding, operating machines, etc.).</p><p>Stimulus-Driven attention allows us to stay safe and navigate the …</p></div></div>

There are tons of plugins available on <a href="https://pub.dev/">pub.dev</a> build by the community that can be integrated right on the go with our Flutter apps. In this article, we will take a look at some of those plugins which can be used almost in any Flutter app and enhance the User Experience to a great extent.</p><figure><img width="100%" src="https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/20/share-widget.png" sizes="auto" alt="Share Widget in Flutter App" data-srcset="            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/20/share-widget.png 20w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/32/share-widget.png 32w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/64/share-widget.png 64w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/128/share-widget.png 128w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/300/share-widget.png 300w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/360/share-widget.png 360w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/484/share-widget.png 484w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/576/share-widget.png 576w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/720/share-widget.png 720w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/960/share-widget.png 960w,    " srcset="            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/20/share-widget.png 20w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/32/share-widget.png 32w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/64/share-widget.png 64w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/128/share-widget.png 128w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/300/share-widget.png 300w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/360/share-widget.png 360w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/484/share-widget.png 484w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/576/share-widget.png 576w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/720/share-widget.png 720w,            https://www.ravsam.in/assets/images/resized/960/share-widget.png 960w,    "></figure><p>Share is a plugin that we can use to share the app content via other apps using the platform’s share dialog.

I’m a white, straight, cis-gendered male software engineer from Australia. I build products, fix bugs, and enjoy a good coffee.</p><p>And I say the word ‘guys’. A lot.</p><p>So when I was told that saying ‘hey guys’ might make some people (women, in this case) feel excluded, frankly, I didn’t understand. “I say ‘guys’ all the time. How could it be an issue?” I told myself. People telling me what I can and can’t say? That doesn’t feel right. For years, I held the view that inclusive language was a threat to free speech.</p><p>But all it took was one podcast episode to change my perspective on inclusive language.</p><h2 id="free-speech-vs-inclusive-language">Free speech vs inclusive language</h2><p>My late teens and early 20’s were influenced by the so-called Intellectual Dark Web - Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, Sam Harris and the like. For the most part, I respect them a lot and still listen to their content to this day.</p><p>Universally, this group is not in favor of “language policing”, to put it lightly. Famously, Jordan Peterson was outspoken in his opposition to Canada’s C-16 bill, which he believed to be a threat to free speech. Peterson was specifically against the idea that he would have to address people by their preferred gender pronoun (e.g. he, her, zir, etc.). In other words, he didn’t want the government forcing him to use inclusive language. Whether or not this&nbsp;<a href="https://torontoist.com/2016/12/are-jordan-petersons-claims-about-bill-c-16-correct/">was an accurate characterization of C-16</a> is another question. But the premise that one’s choice of words could be criminalized in such a way is one that I am not in favor of.</p><p>In the years following the C-16 controversy, the world appeared to split into two camps: one that was supportive of inclusive language, and one that, passionately, was not. I mostly found myself in the second camp.</p><p>That was until a few months ago when I was listening to an&nbsp;<a href="https://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/bartending-to-everyone-inclusive-language/">episode of the Front End Happy Hour podcast</a>&nbsp;about inclusive language. One of the hosts said something so simple, yet so incredibly insightful, that changed my mind in an instant:</p><p><em>“I question people who have asked me, “Why are we doing [inclusive language]? Like, aren’t there bigger issues to solve?”. Yes, there’s always a bigger issue to solve. But this one’s pretty easy. And it’s not that offensive.&nbsp;<strong>All you have to do is stop doing something.</strong>"</em></p><p>I am not easily offended. And so inclusive language as a concept was initially hard to comprehend. But the reality is this: it’s not up to me to tell someone what’s offensive and what’s not. All I can tell someone is what is offensive&nbsp;<em>to me.</em>&nbsp;Inclusive language is not language policing. It’s not telling someone what they can and can’t say. It’s not a violation of free speech. Inclusive language is about&nbsp;<strong><em>empathy</em>.</strong></p><h2 id="inclusive-language-in-the-remote-workplace">Inclusive language in the remote workplace</h2><p>What is often overlooked about Jordan Peterson’s views on the subject is that he is totally on board with using inclusive language in a private context. He just doesn’t want it to be legally enforced. This is an important distinction.</p><p>If you are talking to someone, and they are uncomfortable by the words you’re using, the resultant conversation is unsatisfactory. They walk away from the encounter at best annoyed, and at worst upset. If all it took to improve your relationship with this person was more inclusive language, wouldn’t it make sense to do that?</p><p>Whether you agree or not, you cannot escape the fact that <strong>inclusion is incredibly important in the workplace</strong>. Making your team feel included at work is better for everyone and everything, including your bottom line.</p><p>Inclusion becomes even harder to cultivate in a remote environment. When you’re working from home, you communicate with your team members primarily via text chat. Slack, email and Jira tickets. Text communication is notoriously hard, something that we all now appreciate in 2020. Your words can be interpreted in wildly different ways, to the point where a productive professional relationship can collapse in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Non-inclusive language generally seems to cause a more subtle, more gradual decay of workplace relationships. If I’m the only man in a team of women, and someone in our Slack channel addresses the group with ‘hey, ladies’, I’ll probably think, “Hmm, that’s odd. Doesn’t she realize I’m in this team?”. I’ll then go about my day as normal. But if this happens every day, maybe I would start to feel like I’m invisible. Like I’m not even a part of the team. Like My work is not impressive enough to be noticed. And so on.</p><p>And the worst part is, without the person reaching out to you directly, it’s impossible to know that you’ve upset someone until it’s too late. The value of their contributions declines. They stop proposing ideas in meetings. And then, they quit their job altogether.</p><p>Additionally, Slack channels are different from physical meeting rooms. You often don’t know who is actually in a given Slack channel. You might think the channel is only comprised of males and so saying ‘hey guys’ isn’t an issue. But what if you’re mistaken? Yet another challenge for inclusion in the remote workplace.</p><p><strong>The bottom line is this: inclusive language matters</strong>. When everyone on the team truly feels a part of the team, everybody wins. Conversations improve, productivity increases, and most importantly, people enjoy coming to work. And as more and more of our office communication moves to chat platforms like Slack, the importance of inclusive language has never been greater.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>And so, I’ve stopped saying ‘hey guys’ for these reasons. And a bunch of other words and phrases. Blacklist, whitelist, psycho, crazy, disabled, the list goes on. If there’s a chance someone will feel excluded by the words I’m about to type, then I’ll choose different words.</p><p>The question then becomes, “Well, how do I know what’s inclusive or not?”. You might argue that there are so many ways someone could be offended, that it’s not a practical problem to solve. I built a <a href="https://allybot.io/">Slack app</a> to help. AllyBot will suggest inclusive alternatives to over 400 non-inclusive phrases to team members. The suggestions are private to you, giving you the opportunity to edit your message at your discretion. AllyBot is <a href="https://allybot.io/#community">free for public Slack communities and educators</a> (reach out to me at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:tom@allybot.io">tom@allybot.io</a>).</p><p>If you’re still not convinced about inclusive language, that’s okay. Thanks for reading my ramblings regardless. But next time you’re chatting on Slack, I’d ask you to stop and think, “Is someone being excluded by my choice of language?”.</p></article><section id="articleNext"></section></section></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>I.</strong></p>
<p><span>With all that is going on currently, from the pandemic, to civil unrest, to an incredibly contentious political climate, even those who were alive at the time find it hard to remember how much optimism there was at the end of the Cold War, particularly around the subject of China. It’s easy to grasp now why there was optimism about the Soviet Union and the accompanying collapse of communism, but people forget that there was almost as much optimism about the Chinese communists. The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests"><span>Tiananmen Square Protest</span></a><span> of 1989, which actually happened before the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall"><span>Berlin Wall</span></a><span> came down and the Soviet Union officially dissolved, seemed like the first shudder of the massive earthquake of democracy and liberalization that would eventually come for China in the same way that it came for all the countries of the former Soviet Bloc.</span></p>
<p><span>It was this optimism that spawned things like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man"><span>The End of History and the Last Man</span></a><span> by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama"><span>Francis Fukuyama</span></a><span> a book which has occupied a prominent position in my last </span><a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2020/09/30/have-we-run-out-of-history-and-legitimacy/"><span>two</span></a> <a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2020/10/07/books-i-finished-in-september-with-one-i-didnt/"><span>posts</span></a><span>. And even though, as I mentioned, it holds up better than I would have expected, it’s equally obvious that Fukuyama was very wrong on China, but it’s starting to look more and more like everyone was wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The example of this “wrongness” that’s gotten the most attention recently is what happened between China and the NBA. It all started when </span><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/breaking/ct-houston-rockets-gm-tweet-china-20191006-qv2y4m7xvvhopafbnlvkrxb7cu-story.html"><span>Daryl Morey, the owner of the Houston Rockets tweeted, “fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.”</span></a><span> The backlash from China and Chinese companies was swift, and presumably surprising. It’s not worth going into </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2019/11/11/20959250/china-nba-houston-rockets-hong-kong"><span>everything that happened</span></a><span> but it was quickly apparent to the NBA that billions of dollars were on the line and everyone, including Morey backtracked, apologized, and, in keeping with the theme, basically kowtowed. From this example it might not immediately be clear what “everyone was wrong” about. But I think it can be best summed up by the idea that doing business in and with China was going to be the same as doing business in and with other countries. This is not to say that there aren’t difficulties in doing business in Russia or Saudia Arabia, but not only does the Chinese reaction seem more extreme than what you might expect out of those other two countries, there’s also so much more at stake. Whatever broadcast deal the NBA has with Russia or Saudia Arabia, I’m sure it’s a small fraction of the </span><a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2019-07-29/Tencent-NBA-extend-partnership-for-five-more-years-in-1-5-bln-deal-IJ0UB34uxq/index.html"><span>$1.5 billion</span></a><span> they’re getting out of China. In other words China is different, more different than I think the NBA expected.</span></p>
<p><span>This post is all about exploring how they’re different, because I don’t think that’s quite clear yet. Also, since a discussion of differences could fill several books, I’m going to restrict my discussion to examining very high level differences between nations and cultures. Even with this restriction there are still numerous competing explanations of how China is different, or what the “wrongness” might be, so we’ll spend a little bit of time with each of them.</span></p>
<p><strong>II.</strong></p>
<p><span>To begin our examination I’d like to turn back to the book, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Wrong-China-Paul-Midler/dp/1119213711"><span>What’s Wrong With China?</span></a><span> by </span><a href="http://paulmidler.com/"><span>Paul Midler</span></a><span>, which I reviewed </span><a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2018/11/03/china-and-the-strangeness-of-civilizations/"><span>here</span></a><span>, since, based on the title, it should provide an almost direct answer to our question, and Midler doesn’t just provide one answer to this question he provides lots of them, but most of his explanations and the stories which illustrate them operate at a level lower than the one we’re interested in. That said he does have two very important insights. First, that in China the rules and expectations surrounding business and agreements in general are very different from Western rules and expectations, and second, and perhaps more importantly from our perspective, he has some very interesting things to say about the motivation of the Chinese leadership.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to Midler, it’s very important to understand that the Chinese think dynastically. They don’t imagine a smooth upward curve where they’ll be in power forever, but rather they imagine that they have a limited window when times are good and that they need to take advantage of that window. (Sometimes this is referred to as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_Heaven"><span>Mandate of Heaven</span></a><span>.) Accordingly, Midler asserts that one of the keys to understanding their actions is to recognize that they’re in a rush to accomplish as much as possible before the current dynastic cycle ends. Some quotes from the book:</span></p>
<p><em><span>Beijing appears to be in a hurry, but for what?</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>…When the United States voiced it’s concern over reclamation activity in the South China Sea, Beijing did not respond by cooling down related activity. Quite the opposite, project crews began working around the clock…</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>In moving fast, Beijing was guaranteeing that the international community would apply greater pressure. But by its own calculations, the window of opportunity was going to close one way or another anyway, so why not put as many points on the board before it did so?</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>…No, this foolish rush is about something else, something simpler. It’s about ringing the bell. It’s about seeing just how far China can take things before that great window of opportunity shuts.</span></em></p>
<p><span>Of course, more than helping us </span><em><span>understand China</span></em><span>, what we really want out of an explanation is a guide for </span><em><span>what to do about China</span></em><span>, what actions we should take.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How does this explanation do on that front?&nbsp; Well it does supply the somewhat counterintuitive guidance that the more pressure we bring to bear upon China the more aggressive they’ll be. But more interestingly it seems to suggest that we can just wait China out. That just like we expected in the early 90s eventually the Communist Party will be removed from power or suffer some other calamity, and the problem will go away. Unfortunately, in the meantime, this does nothing for the Hong Kong Protestors, or the Tibetians or the Uighurs. Nor is it clear even if we can wait them out how long that might take. Certainly the Chinese Communists themselves are determined to hold on to the Mandate of Heaven for as long as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>The final question which we need to ask of this explanation and of all our explanations is how much weight we should give it, and here, I’m inclined to say quite a lot. Of all the people I mention Midler is the only one who has spent decades living in China, and so while it might be possible to argue that others understand the Chinese leadership better (possible to argue, not definitely true) I don’t think anyone I’ve come across has a better grasp of the people.</span></p>
<p><strong>III.</strong></p>
<p><span>In his book </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accidental-Superpower-Generation-American-Preeminence/dp/1455583685"><span>The Accidental Superpower</span></a><span>. </span><a href="https://zeihan.com/"><span>Peter Zeihan</span></a><span> puts forth an even more pessimistic view about China’s prospects:</span></p>
<p><em><span>The reality of China is considerably different from the conventional wisdom. There are many reasons to doubt the strength of the Chinese system, but let’s focus on those relevant to things geographic and demographic. Individually, any of the raft of concerns I’m about to detail would be enough to derail the Chinese rise. Collectively they are more than enough to return China to the fractured, self-containing mess that it has been for most of its history.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><span>I don’t intend to spend much time on Zeihan’s concerns, but it’s worth being aware of what they are:</span></p>
<p><span>First, Zeihan’s primary focus is geography and this might be the area he feels the strongest about. Specifically he thinks China is actually three nations (or perhaps four). This may be the least obvious of his concerns, so I’ll include his explanation:</span></p>
<p><em><span>This tripartite system—northern China as the stable-as-glass political core, central China as the nationally disinterested economic core, and southern China as the potentially secessionist territory (and the interior being largely ignored)—holds to the present day. Even contemporary China’s political system reflects it: All of the critical military branches of the government are headquartered in the north, the north and central regions trade of the premiership every decade in order to balance security and trade interests, while the south is not even represented on the Politburo.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Such a geographic look at the country lays bare the greatest myth about China: that it is united. I’m not talking here about the concept of the mainland versus Taiwan, but rather the idea that the mainland itself can ever truly be a unified entity. Taking a closer look at history indicates that China’s past periods of “unity” are anything but.</span></em></p>
<p><span>Second, that as deep as their rivalry/conflict runs with the US that their rivalry/conflict with Japan is a hundred times deeper.</span></p>
<p><span>Third, that the only reason they’re unified right now is because of the US. We neutralized the rivalry with Japan, we cleared the oceans of predatory navies (Ziehan also makes the point that China is not a natural naval power), enforced </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_navigation"><span>freedom of navigation</span></a><span>, and created and invited them to participate in a global market.</span></p>
<p><span>Fourth, their financial system is a mess, and is more a system of subsidization, than a system of credit. Leading to lots of projects that are technically possible but economically ridiculous. (This is something Midler touches on as well).</span></p>
<p><span>Fifth, demography, China is getting old faster than it’s getting rich, which is bad for all kinds of reasons, but particularly because their economy is entirely driven by exports, which requires new cheap workers. And even if they wanted to switch to internal consumption, demography makes that hard as well.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, and I had to include this because it seems to be the opposite of what everyone else is saying. Zeihan claims that Taiwan, in concert with Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore, “Form a line of islands off the Chinese coast that block any possible Chinese access to the ocean blue.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If anything this assessment of what’s wrong with China (everything) and what we should do about China (wait and/or exclude them from the international system) is even more optimistic than Midler’s. Though I should also point out the book was published in 2014, so it’s …</span></p></div></div>

In a nutshell, it is the theorem that states that</p><blockquote><p>$e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x$</p></blockquote><p>where:</p><ul><li>$x$ is a <strong>real number</strong>.</li><li>$e$ is the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/#Key_Mathematical_Numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>base of the natural logarithm</strong></a>.</li><li>$i$ is the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/#Key_Mathematical_Numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>imaginary unit</strong></a> (i.e., square root of $-1$).</li></ul><div><p>Note</p><p>In this formula, the right-hand side is sometimes abbreviated as $\operatorname{cis}{x}$, though the left-hand expression $e^{ix}$ is usually preferred over the $\operatorname{cis}$ notation.</p></div><p>Euler’s formula establishes the fundamental relationship between <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/#Trigonometric_Functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>trigonometric functions</strong></a> and <strong>exponential functions</strong>. Geometrically, it can be thought of as a way of bridging two representations of the same unit complex number in the complex plane.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some of the <strong>key values</strong> of Euler’s formula, and see how they correspond to points in the trigonometric/unit circle:</p><ul><li>For $x=0$, we have $e^{0} = \cos 0+ i \sin 0$, which gives $1 = 1$. So far so good: we know that an angle of $0$ on the trigonometric circle is $1$ on the real axis, and this is what we get here.</li><li>For $x=1$, we have $e^{i}=\cos 1 + i \sin 1$. This result suggests that $e^i$ is precisely the point on the unit circle whose angle is <strong>1 radian</strong>.</li><li>For $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$, we have $e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{2} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{2} = i$. This result is useful in some calculations related to physics.</li><li>For $x = \pi$, we have $e^{i\pi} = \cos \pi + i \sin \pi $, which means that $e^{i\pi} = -1$. This result is equivalent to the famous <a href="#Euler%E2%80%99s_Identity"><strong>Euler’s identity</strong></a>.</li><li>For $x = 2\pi$, we have $e^{i (2\pi)} = \cos 2\pi + i \sin 2\pi$, which means that $e^{i (2\pi)} = 1$, same as with $x = 0$.</li></ul><p>A key to understanding Euler’s formula lies in rewriting the formula as follows: \[ (e^i)^x = \sin x + i \cos x \] where:</p><ul><li>The right-hand expression can be thought of as the <strong>unit complex number</strong> with angle $x$.</li><li>The left-hand expression can be thought of as the <strong>1-radian unit complex number</strong> raised to $x$.</li></ul><p>And since raising a unit complex number to a power can be thought of as <strong>repeated multiplications</strong> (i.e., adding up angles in this case), Euler’s formula can be construed as two different ways of running around the unit circle to arrive at the same point.</p><h2><span id="Derivations"></span>Derivations<span></span></h2><p>Euler’s formula can be established in at least three ways. The first derivation is based on <strong>power series</strong>, where the exponential, sine and cosine functions are expanded as power series to conclude that the formula indeed holds.</p><p>The second derivation of Euler’s formula is based on <strong>calculus</strong>, in which both sides of the equation are treated as functions and differentiated accordingly. This then leads to the identification of a common property — one which can be exploited to show that both functions are indeed equal.</p><p>Yet another derivation of Euler’s formula involves the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system#Complex_numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>polar coordinates</strong></a> in the complex plane, through which the values of $r$ and $\theta$ are subsequently found. In fact, you might be able to guess what these values are — just by looking at the formula itself!</p><h3><span id="Derivation_1_Power_Series"></span>Derivation 1: Power Series<span></span></h3><p>One of the most intuitive derivations of Euler’s formula involves the use of <strong>power series</strong>. It consists in expanding the power series of exponential, sine and cosine — to finally conclude that the equality holds.</p><p>As a caveat, this approach assumes that the power series expansions of $\sin z$, $\cos z$, and $e^z$ are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_convergence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>absolutely convergent</strong></a> everywhere (e.g.,&nbsp; that they hold for all complex numbers $z$). However, it also has the advantage of showing that Euler’s formula holds for all complex numbers $z$ as well.</p><p>For a complex variable $z$, the <strong>power series expansion</strong> of $e^z$ is \[ e^z = 1 + \frac{z}{1!} + \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} + \cdots \] Now, let us take $z$ to be $ix$ (where $x$ is an <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#arbitrary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arbitrary</a> complex number). As $z$ gets raised to increasing powers, $i$ also gets raised to increasing powers. The <strong>first eight powers</strong> of $i$ look like this: \begin{align*} i^0 &amp; = 1 &amp; i^4 &amp; = i^2 \cdot i^2 = 1 \\ i^1 &amp; = i &amp; i^5 &amp; = i \cdot i^4 = i \\ i^2 &amp; = -1 \quad \text{(by the definition of $i$)} &amp; i^6 &amp; = i \cdot i^5 = -1 \\ i^3 &amp; = i \cdot i^2 = -i &amp; i^7 &amp; = i \cdot i^6 = -i \end{align*} (notice the <strong>cyclicality</strong> of the powers of $i$: $1$, $i$, $-1$, $-i$. We’ll be using these powers shortly.)</p><p>With $z = ix$, the expansion of $e^z$ becomes: \[ e^{ix} = 1 + ix + \frac{(ix)^2}{2!} + \frac{(ix)^3}{3!} + \frac{(ix)^4}{4!} + \cdots \] Extracting the powers of $i$, we get: \[ e^{ix} = 1 + ix-\frac{x^2}{2!}-\frac{i x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{i x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^6}{6!}-\frac{i x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^8}{8!} + \cdots \] And since the power series expansion of $e^z$ is absolutely convergent, we can rearrange its terms without altering its value. Grouping the <strong>real</strong> and <strong>imaginary terms</strong> together then yields: \[ e^{ix} = \left( 1-\frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!}-\frac{x^6}{6!} + \frac{x^8}{8!}-\cdots \right) + i \left( x-\frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \right) \] Now, let’s take a detour and look at the power series of <strong>sine</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>cosine</strong>. The power series of $\cos{x}$ is \[ \cos x = 1-\frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!}-\frac{x^6}{6!} + \frac{x^8}{8!}-\cdots \] And for $\sin{x}$, it is \[ \sin x = x-\frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \] In other words, the last equation we had is precisely \[ e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x \] which is the statement of Euler’s formula that we were looking for.</p><h3><span id="Derivation_2_Calculus"></span>Derivation 2: Calculus<span></span></h3><p>Another neat way to establish Euler’s formula is to consider both $e^{ix}$ and $\cos x + i \sin x$ as <strong>functions</strong> of $x$, before differentiating them to find some common property about them.</p><p>For that to happen though, one must assume that the functions $e^z$, $\cos x$ and $\sin x$ are defined and <strong>differentiable</strong> for all real numbers $x$ and complex numbers $z$. By assuming that these functions are differentiable for all complex numbers, it is also possible to show that Euler’s formula holds for all complex numbers as well.</p><p>First, let $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$ be $e^{ix}$ and $\cos x + i \sin x$, respectively. <strong>Differentiating</strong> $f_1$ via <a href="https://mathvault.ca/chain-rule-derivative/#Chain_Rule_%E2%80%94_A_Review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chain rule</a> then yields: \[ f_{1}'(x) = i e^{ix} = i f_1(x) \] Similarly, differentiating $f_2$ also yields: \[ f_{2}'(x) = -\sin x + i \cos x = i f_2(x) \] In other words, both functions satisfy the differential equation $f'(x) = i f(x)$. Now, consider the function $\frac{f_1}{f_2}$, which is <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#welldefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well-defined</a> for all $x$ (since $f_2(x) = \cos x + i\sin x$ corresponds to points on the unit circle, which are never zero). With that settled, using the <strong>quotient rule</strong> on this function then yields: \begin{align*} \left(\frac{f_{1}}{f_2}\right)'(x) &amp; = \frac{f_1’(x) f_2(x)-f_1(x) f_2’(x)}{[f_2(x)]^2} \\ &amp; = \frac{i f_1(x) f_2(x)-f_1(x) i f_2(x)}{[f_2(x)]^2} \\ &amp; = 0 \end{align*} And since the derivative here is $0$, this implies that the function $\frac{f_1}{f_2}$ must have been a <strong>constant</strong> to begin with. What is the value of this constant? Let’s figure it out by plugging in $x=0$ into the function: \[ \left(\frac{f_1}{f_2}\right)(0) = \frac{e^{i0}}{\cos 0 + i \sin 0} = 1&nbsp; \] In other words, we must have that for all $x$: \[ \left(\frac{f_1}{f_2}\right)(x) = \frac{e^{ix}}{\cos x + i \sin x} = 1&nbsp; \] which, after moving $\cos x + i \sin x$ to the right, becomes the famous formula we’ve been looking for.</p><h3><span id="Derivation_3_Polar_Coordinates"></span>Derivation 3: Polar Coordinates<span></span></h3><p>Yet another ingenious proof of Euler’s formula involves treating exponentials as numbers, or more specifically, as complex numbers under <strong>polar coordinates</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, we already know that all non-zero complex numbers can be expressed in <strong>polar coordinates</strong> in a unique way. In particular, any number of the form $e^{ix}$ (with real $x$), which is non-zero, can be expressed as: \[ e^{ix} = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \] where $\theta$ is its <strong>principal angle</strong> from the positive real axis (with, say, $0 \le \theta &lt; 2 \pi$), and $r$ is its <strong>radius</strong> (with $r&gt;0$). We make no assumption about the values of $r$ and $\theta$, except the fact that they are functions of $x$ (which may or may not contain $x$ as variable). They will be determined in the course of the proof.</p><p>(However, what we do know is that when $x=0$, the left-hand side is $1$, which implies that $r$ and $\theta$ satisfy the <strong>initial conditions</strong> of $r(0)=1$ and $\theta(0)=0$, respectively.)</p><p>For what it’s worth, we’ll begin by <strong>differentiating</strong> both sides of the equation. By the definition of exponential, differentiating the left side of the equation with respect to $x$ yields $i e^{ix}$. After differentiating the right side of the equation, the equation then becomes: \[ i e^{ix} = \frac{dr}{dx}(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) + r(- \sin \theta + i \cos \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dx} \] We’re looking for an expression that is uniquely in terms of $r$ and $\theta$. To get rid of $e^{ix}$, we substitute back $r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$ for $e^{ix}$ to get:<span> \[ i r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) = (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \frac{dr}{dx} + r(- \sin \theta + i \cos \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dx} \] Once there, distributing the $i$ on the left-hand side then yields: \[ r(i \cos \theta-\sin \theta) = (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \frac{dr}{dx} + r(- \sin \theta + i \cos \theta) \frac{d \theta}{dx} \] …</span></p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>One of my favorite things is to misuse technology in creative ways. Breaking the rules without breaking the rules.</p>

<p>For example, a hobby project I built long ago was <a href="https://github.com/secretGeek/dod">DOS-on-dope</a>, a working Ruby-on-rails parody, billed as <em>the last batch-file based MVC framework you'll ever need</em>. And there was <a href="http://www.secretgeek.net/console_log">a console.log() adventure</a> in which you played an old school console-adventure-game from inside the chrome developer tools.</p>

<p>The world of esoteric programming is filled with examples of people stretching the rules to breaking point, and misusing technology in creative ways. In particular (for example) I love <a href="http://wiki.secretgeek.net/quine">quines</a>. Quines are programs which output their own source code. Life is a Quine.</p>

<p>A different but somehow related topic I like is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture">brutalism</a>, in particular, this often overlooked aspect:</p>

<blockquote>Another common theme in Brutalist designs is the exposure of the building's functions.</blockquote>

<p>...the tendency to <strong>make the internal external</strong>, and reveal the secrets of the building, in a somehow.... <em>brutaful</em> way. ;-).</p>

<p>A similarly intriguing idea which has fallen into disuse is the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects">naked objects</a>, wherein:</p>

<blockquote>The user interface should be a direct representation of the domain objects.</blockquote>

<p>Putting all this together I decided to make a truly naked, brutalist html page, that is itself a quine. And this page is it.</p>

<p>Viewing <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secretGeek/html_wysiwyg/master/html.html">the source</a> of this page should reveal a page identical to the page you are now seeing. Nothing is hidden. It's a true "What you see is what you get."</p>

<h2>How it works.</h2>

<p>Did you know that the rules of html and css allow you to make <strong>every</strong> element visible, even elements like 'title' or 'style' or 'script', that are normally hidden from view? Those are just elements like any other. You can expose them <strong>all</strong> like so:</p>



<p>With that snippet of code (which is <strong>not</strong> a snippet of code, but an <strong>actual</strong> style block itself!) you can now see every element of this page, including that style block, the html and title tags, etc.</p>

<p>It does have one downside: every element on the page is now a "block" element, even some which should be "inline", such as "code" and "anchor" elements. We can correct this like so:</p>



<p>To give the code a more 'view source' feel, I've also applied <code>monospace</code> fonts, and a generally simple and consistent style to all elements, using a "*" selector, like so:</p>



<p>So far I've put style declarations all on one line, because ordinary html refuses to treat line breaks as "br" tags. But there is a way to make line-breaks display as line-breaks, and that is with this piece of styling:</p>



<h2>Make the internal external.</h2>

<p>The next trick is to make the internal external. We can start by ensuring that the tags themselves, such as paragraph tags, are exposed in their stark, brutal, beauty:</p>



<p>That works for "p" elements, but do we need to have custom styling for <strong>every</strong> element? If there was a way to output the "name" of a tag in html, then we could reduce all of the necessary style rules above to something like:</p>

<blockquote>
*::before {
 '&lt;' name() '&gt;'
}
</blockquote>

<p>And...

</p><blockquote>
*::after {
 '&lt;\/' name() '&gt;'
}
</blockquote>


<p>But alas there is no "name()" function (yet!). So we are forced to generate a chunk of style information like this (via <a href="https://nimbletext.com/Live/1105905186/">NimbleText</a> of course)</p>

<p>Please scroll happily past the next 28 offensively repetitive lines...</p>



<p>Some elements are a little trickier because they have attributes. Consider for example the "anchor" which often has a <code>href</code> attribute. We <em>need</em> that attribute to be visible, including its value. This is done like so:</p>



<p>The <code>attr()</code> function, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr">mozilla docs</a> is a nifty trick, "supported" since CSS 2.</p>


<p>The only other style that is special is "style" itself, which has to include an escape character to avoid being taken literally.</p>







<p>Finally to reduce the visual weight of the before and after pseudo elements we can give them a soft purple color and a low weight font:</p>





<p>Finally, because I believe brutalist design, even when applied to truly naked brutal html quines, is about function, not about deliberate ugliness, I'd like to apply these humble styles that improve the readability of this brutiful missive.</p>



<p>...they're derived from <a href="https://jrl.ninja/etc/1/">"58 bytes of css to look great nearly everywhere"</a>.</p>

<p>One last thing. Although this idea has bounced around in my head for a decade, the thing that reminded me to pipe it into a file was seeing this piece of "Code as Art" from Geoff Huntley: <a href="https://noyaml.com/">no yaml</a>. Bring back the world weird web.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>If somebody notices a dead body in the room they can use the <code>report</code> command to halt the playing and move everyone to the discussion stage. It is also possible to trigger the discussion stage by going to the cafeteria and using the <code>press emergency button</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="the-discussion-stage"><a href="#the-discussion-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The discussion stage</h3>
<p>If a body has been found or a meeting has been called everyone gets thrown in the discussion state. At this point everyone can see who is still alive. Then there's a chatroom which is limited to 50 messages in total, so use the chat wisely. While/after chatting it is possible to either vote to throw someone off the ship or to skip using <code>/vote [number]</code> or <code>/skip</code>. You can also use <code>/list</code> to see who has not voted yet.</p>
<p>After everyone has voted either the game moves directly back to the playing stage or someone gets thrown off. After the player has been ejected it will be visible if it was the imposter (and then the game has been won by the crew) or if someone innocent was ejected. Then the game moves back to the playing stage.</p>
<p>The crew can win by having everyone complete all the tasks or by voting out the imposter. The imposter can win by killing all the crew or by making the crew vote out all their crewmates.</p>

<p>Posted October 18th, 2020</p>
<p>I like bash, and I somehow find that surprising.
Bash is dangerous, bash is old, bash is <em>simple</em>.
Other people - people I respect - like bash too.</p>
<h2>Why not?</h2>
<p>Across all of the awful things that bash does wrong - that make bash a bad programming language - my biggest complaint
is the general idea that bash is unsafe.
It is unclear when - if at all - types are meaningful in bash.
Code is highly imperative.
Error-handling is almost non-existant.
Global state 😱.
This all normally spells doom.</p>
<h2>Aside: why so?</h2>
<p>I often think of programming languages on the imperative &lt;-&gt; functional axis.
I like the languages on the right, and dislike the ones on the left.</p>
<p>The obvious counter is that sometimes you need something quick and dirty, something that doesn't need to compile,
something that doesn't need expensive virtual machine spin-up.</p>
<p>We are sort of left then with bash, perl, php, python, and ruby for quick and dirty.
And, to be fair, I could imagine using <code>irb</code> as a shell environment.
The others: I could not.</p>
<p>Bash has something else going for it: it's <em>ubiquitous</em>.</p>
<p>Supposing for a moment that ubiquity is a sufficient argument to justify learning <em>some</em> bash, I imagine I haven't
convinced you: people seem to settle on a primary language, a scripting language, and some basic bash.</p>
<p>I'm here to tell you that you should just use bash as your scripting language, and any time you need "real" scripting
capabilities, you really just needed your primary language, and if your primary language seemed too clunky, that's a
problem in itself.</p>
<p>I will die on this hill: python is garbage.
Just use bash.</p>
<h2>Something something monads</h2>
<p>Bash has something more going for it.</p>
<p>When we write scripting languages like python, we normally utilise imperative state, and some nice higher level
constructs like list comprehensions, to transform some data.</p>
<p>I'll argue then that python's primary interface is the <em>collection</em>.
Python code is often all about manipulating collections.</p>
<p>Thinking about primary languages, I'll mention a couple.</p>
<p>Rust - my primary language - has a familiar ruby- or java-like syntax (a lot of methods) that many are familiar with.
But - in terms of thinking about writing code and decomposing problems, Rust's biggest win is its powerful enums and
traits.</p>
<p>So I'll argue that rust's primary interface is the <em>trait</em>, which when wielded, categorises the world and declaratively
describes the world's capabilities.</p>
<p>Java has baggage (DI, code-generation, gradle, annotation-hell), but its claim to fame is the Object.</p>
<p>Java's primary interface is in mapping the relationship between different kinds of data, and things that manipulate
data.</p>
<p>Bash has a primary interface too!</p>
<h2>I/O</h2>
<p>Bash's primary interface - and the thing that makes bash powerful, productive, and admired by all - is the fact that
everything is built around I/O.</p>
<p>In that sense, bash is hardly even a real language.
Bash just leverages subprocesses, and gives you fine control over where to wire up signals.</p>
<p>That's what makes bash elegant, but it's also what makes bash incredibly powerful, not only for composing systems, but
for decomposing software architecture into its critical signals.</p>
<p>One complaint about bash seems to be that everyone writes their own flavor of it.</p>
<p>My flavor is one big <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pipelines.html">pipeline</a>, with some basic
safety sprinked in.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>I have a small bit of software on a cron-job which scrapes property listings online and writes a summary to a
matrix.org channel.</p>
<p>To write this software I decomposed the problem into pure I/O and only wrote the applications I needed to represent that
problem space as a pipeline (ref: <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rightscrape">1</a>, <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/filterfrom">2</a>,
<a href="https://lib.rs/crates/rightscrapex">3</a>, <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/send_glitch">4</a>).</p>
<p>This pattern is a beaut, and one I'd like to repeat more of in the future.</p>
<p>I've heard folks refer to this as "using bash as glue code", but this seems to be taking things one step further.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>My flavor of bash is better than yours, because it elevates my primary language, minimises bash's safety impact, helps
me decompose my software, and gives me a topic for a blog post.</p>

		<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The Ryuk threat actors went from a phishing email to domain wide ransomware in 5 hours. They escalated privileges using Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472), less than 2 hours after the initial phish. They used tools such as Cobalt Strike, AdFind, WMI, and PowerShell to accomplish their objective.</p>
<p>Ryuk has been one of the most proficient ransomware gangs in the past few years, with the FBI claiming <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-ransomware-victims-have-paid-out-140-million-one-version-has-cost-them-the-most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$61 million USD</a> having been paid to the group as of February 2020. Earlier in the year, the group grew a little quiet, but that seems to have changed in the past few weeks, with incidents like what occurred at <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uhs-hospitals-hit-by-reported-country-wide-ryuk-ransomware-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UHS hospitals</a>.</p>
<h3>Case Summary</h3>
<p>In our previous <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/10/08/ryuks-return/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryuk case,</a> we saw the threat actors leverage access to an environment via the Bazar Loader malware. This time around, we saw them accomplish their objective faster, but the general tactics and techniques stayed similar between incidents.</p>
<p>Bazar was introduced to the environment again with the delivery via phishing emails. For an in depth breakdown on this loader, see <a href="https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/front-door-into-bazarbackdoor-stealthy-cybercrime-weapon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this analysis</a> by&nbsp; Roman Marshanski &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/VK_Intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vitali Kremez</a>. Bazar, once running, was seen again injecting into explorer.exe, svchost.exe, and spawning command shell processes.</p>
<p>From this loader we saw initial mapping of the domain, using built-in windows utilities such as Nltest. However, unlike the last case, the threat actors started at a lower privileged user and rather than proceed slowly or cautiously, they exploited the recently disclosed Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) to reset the machine password of the primary domain controller.</p>
<p>Lateral movement was initiated via SMB file transfers and WMI executions of Cobalt Strike Beacons. The network indicators align similarly to the prior campaign and were noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/kyleehmke/status/1315499593359122432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyle Ehmke</a> in response to our last post pivoting off the prior report’s intel. From memory analysis, we were also able to conclude the actors were using a trial version of Cobalt Strike with the EICAR string present in the network configuration for the beacon. Both portable executable and DLL beacons were used.</p>
<p>After moving laterally to the secondary domain controller, the threat actor started on more domain discovery via Net and the PowerShell Active Directory module. From there, the threat actors appeared to use the default named pipe privilege escalation module on the server. At this point, the threat actors used RDP to connect from the secondary domain controller, to the first domain controller, using the built in Administrator account.</p>
<p>Once on the main domain controller, another Cobalt Strike beacon was dropped and executed. Then more domain reconnaissance was performed using <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/05/08/adfind-recon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdFind</a>. Once this completed, at the four hour mark, the threat actors were ready for their final objective.</p>
<p>Four hours and 10 minutes in, the threat actors used the pivot from the primary domain controller to RDP into the Backup server. Backup servers were again targeted first for deployment of the ransomware executable, followed by servers and then workstations.The threat actors finished their objective by executing the ransomware on the primary domain controller, and at the 5 hour mark, the attack completed.</p>
<p>While last time we commented on the lead time between the first and second day to aid detection and response activity, this case goes to show that you can’t count on that kind of timescale. You need to be ready to act in less than an hour, to make sure you can effectively disrupt the threat actor.</p>

<h3>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</h3>
<h3><a>Initial Access</a></h3>
<p>Access was initiated by a phishing email leading to the Bazar Loader malware executable.</p>
<h3><a>Execution</a></h3>
<p>Bazar relies on user execution of an executable to run. This user was a Domain User and did not have any other permissions.</p>
<h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>
<p>CVE-2020-1472 was used to reset the credentials on one of the domain controllers in the environment. After resetting the password, the threat actors then targeted a different domain controller, potentially due to breaking services by use of their exploit.</p>

<p>On one of the domain controllers we saw use of the Cobalt Strike named pipe escalation.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c echo 92d8cc45954 &gt;; \\.\pipe\446b3c</pre>
<h3><a>Defense Evasion</a></h3>
<p>On the first domain controller that the treat actors connected to after their initial connection, they dropped a DLL and executed it via rundll32.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C rundll32 C:\Windows\system32\SQL.dll, StartW</pre>
<p>Dropped via RDP and executed via rundll32 on the second domain controller.</p>
<pre>rundll32 C:\PerfLogs\arti64.dll, rundll</pre>
<p>Shortly after, the DLL was called again via regsrv32.</p>
<pre>regsvr32 C:\PerfLogs\arti64.dll</pre>
<p>Then a 2nd DLL was dropped and executed in a similar manner on the 2nd DC.</p>
<pre>rundll32 C:\\PerfLogs\\socks64.dll, rundll</pre>
<h3><a>Discovery</a></h3>
<p>Ran on the beachhead.</p>

<p>They then ran the following looking for host names, operating systems and last logon dates of all AD systems.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C Get-ADComputer -Filter {enabled -eq $true} -properties *|select Name, DNSHostName, OperatingSystem, LastLogonDate | Export-CSV C:\Users\AllWindows.csv -NoTypeInformation -Encoding UTF8</pre>
<p>After already completing the above discovery work and having already pivoted to their 2nd domain controller, the threat actors moved on to AdFind for further domain reconnaissance.</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\Temp\adf\AdFind.exe
C:\Windows\Temp\adf\adf.bat</pre>
<p>Contents of the script ran the following with AdFind.</p>
<pre>adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=person)"
adfind.exe -f "objectcategory=computer"
adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)"
adfind.exe -sc trustdmp
adfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)
adfind.exe -f "(objectcategory=group)"
adfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp</pre>
<p>The threat actor then ran this command a few times.</p>

<h3><a>Impact</a></h3>
<p>Starting around 4.5 hours after the initial Bazar malware was executed, the Ryuk threat actors acted on their final objectives and initiated RDP connections from the domain controller previously exploited, to the rest of the environment. This time they initiated the ransomware first on the secondary domain controller (their 1st pivot) and transferred the Ryuk executable over the RDP connection.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>In 1935, a gentleman called Alonzo Church came up with a simple scheme that could compute…just about anything. His scheme was called Lambda Calculus. It was a phenomenal innovation, given that there weren’t even computers for him to test out his ideas. Even cooler is that those very ideas affect us today: anytime you use a function, you owe a hat tip to Mr. Church. </p><p>Lambda Calculus is so cool that many hackers use it as their secret handshake — a “discreet signal” if you will. The most famous, of course, is PG’s Y Combinator. In this essay, we’ll find out what it’s all about, and do things with functions that we’d never have imagined. In the end you’ll have built just about every programming concept: numbers, booleans, you name it…just with functions.</p><p>City dwellers who drive SUVs rarely consider their cars as ferocious machines that traverse rocky deserts and flooded rivers. It’s the same with programmers and functions. Here’s what we <em>think</em> functions do:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> square (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>*</span><span> x x)))</span></code></pre><p>Safe, clean, and useful. We’re so accustomed that it would surprise us to find the myriad of ways we can bend functions to do just about anything. </p><p>Let’s step out into the wilderness a bit. Say you wanted to make a data structure for pairs: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> pair (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>(</span><span>first</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 0</span>
<span>(</span><span>second</span><span> pair) </span><span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>How would you do it? It’s sensible to use a map or a class or a record to represent a pair. But…you could use functions too.</p><p>Here’s one way we can make a pair:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                   (</span><span>fn</span><span> [selector]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>selector</span><span> a b))))</span></code></pre><p>No maps or classes…it just returns a function! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-pair (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
<span>ex-pair</span>
<span>; =&gt; #object[church_factorial$church_pair...</span></code></pre><p>Now  our <code>ex-pair</code> takes a <code>selector</code> argument. What if we ran ex-pair with this selector:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>ex-pair</span><span> (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span></code></pre><p>Well, <code>(ex-pair (fn [a b] a))</code> would expand too: </p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a) a b)</span></code></pre><p>Which would return… <code>a</code>! </p><p>That just gave us the <code>first</code> value of our pair! We can use that to write a <code>church-first</code> function:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-first-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] a))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-first (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                    (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-first-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-first</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 0</span></code></pre><p>And do something similar for second: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> take-second-arg (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b] b))</span>
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-second (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>pair</span><span> take-second-arg)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-second</span><span> ex-pair)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 1</span></code></pre><p>We just used functions to represent pairs. Now, since the grammar for Lisp is just a bunch of pairs plopped together, that also means we can represent the grammar of Lisp…with just functions!</p><p>What we just did was analogous to a city dweller driving their SUV…on a snowy day. It gets a <em>lot</em> crazier. </p><p>We said we could represent <em>everything</em>. Let’s go ahead and try it! </p><p>Here’s what can do. Let’s take a function we know and love, and implement it from top-to-bottom in Lambda Calculus.</p><p>Here’s factorial: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> factorial-clj [n]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> n)</span>
<span>    </span><span>1</span><span> </span>
<span>    (</span><span>*</span><span> n (</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> n)))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>factorial-clj</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 120</span></code></pre><p>By the end of this essay, we’ll have built factorial, only with functions.</p><p>To do this, I want to come up front and say I am cheating a little bit. In Church’s Lambda Calculus, there is no <code>def</code>, and all functions take one argument. Here’s all he says: </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjA4LTc0M2VkMDgwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05YTI2LTFlMGUyOWFmNDQ0MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>In his rules, you define anonymous functions by popping a little <code>λ</code> in front. What follows is the argument, following by a  <code>.</code> .After the <code>.</code> is the application.</p><p>This is very much akin to a single-argument anonymous function in Clojure: <code>λ x. x</code> =&gt; <code>(fn [x] x)</code></p><p>We could follow those rules, but writing factorial like that is going to get hard to reason about very quickly. Let’s tweak the rules just a little bit. The changes won’t affect the essence of Lambda Calculus but will make it easier for us to think about our code. Here it goes:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjE3LTc5OWMxYjAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05N2U5LWY0ZDIxZGE2YmJkOC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>1<!-- -->)<!-- --> for a single argument function, <code>(fn [x] x)</code> maps pretty well to Church’s encoding. We can go ahead and use it as is.</p><p>2<!-- -->)<!-- --> Since Church’s lambdas only take one argument, For him to express a function with two arguments, he has to write <em>two</em> anonymous functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>λ</span><span> f. λ x. f x)</span></code></pre><p>This would map to:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f] (</span><span>fn</span><span> [x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>But, nesting our functions like this can get annoying in Clojure <sup>1</sup>. To make life easier for us, we’ll allow for multi-argument functions:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span> [f x] (</span><span>f</span><span> x))</span></code></pre><p>3<!-- -->)<!-- --> Finally, Church has no concepts of variables outside of what’s provided by a function definition. </p><p>For him to express </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>make-pair</span><span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>He would have to “unwrap” <code>make-pair</code></p><pre><code><span>((</span><span>λ</span><span> a. λ b. λ selector . selector a b)</span>
<span> a b)</span></code></pre><p>To keep our code sane, we’ll allow for <code>def</code>, but with one rule: </p><p><strong>You can use</strong> <strong><code>def</code></strong> <strong>, as long as you can “replace” it with an anonymous function and nothing breaks.</strong> </p><p>For example, imagine if <code>make-pair</code> <em>referenced itself</em>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> make-pair (</span><span>fn</span><span> [a b]</span>
<span>                 (</span><span>make-pair</span><span> ...)))</span></code></pre><p>This would break because if we replaced <code>(def make-pair …)</code> with an anonymous function, there would be no variable called <code>make-pair</code> anymore! </p><p>That’s it, these are our rules. With that, we’re ready to make factorial! </p><p>The first thing we need is the concept of a number. How can we do that? </p><p>Church thought of a pretty cool idea. What if “numbers”, where higher-order functions with two arguments:  a function <code>f</code>, and a value <code>v</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> zero (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v] v))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> one (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>zero</span><span> f v))))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p><strong>We can figure out what number each function represents by “counting” the number of times</strong> <strong><code>f</code></strong> <strong>was composed.</strong> </p><p>For example, 0 would compose <code>f</code> zero times: it would just return <code>v</code>.  1, would compose f once: <code>(f v)</code>. 2 would compose twice: <code>(f (f v))</code>, and so on. </p><p>To help us see these numbers in our REPL, let’s create a quick converter function: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [church-numeral]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> inc </span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>Since a church numeral composes <code>f</code> the number of times it is called with <code>v</code> as the first argument, all we need to see what number it is in Clojure, is to provide <code>inc</code> as <code>f</code> and <code>0</code> as <code>v</code>! Now <code>2</code> would do <code>(inc (inc 0))</code> for example, and get us the corresponding Clojure number.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [zero one two])</span>
<span>; =&gt; (0 1 2)</span></code></pre><p>Cool! </p><p>Take a look at how we wrote two: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> two (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>           (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>one</span><span> f v))))</span></code></pre><p>What we did here,  is <em>delegate</em> f’s composition to the numeral before (in this case <code>one</code> ), and then just called <code>f</code> <em>one more time.</em> </p><p>What if we abstracted the <code>one</code> out?</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-inc</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [f v]</span>
<span>      (</span><span>f</span><span> (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> f v))))) </span></code></pre><p>Voila. Give this function a numeral, and it will return a new numeral that calls <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. We’ve just discovered <code>inc</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> one)))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>3</span></code></pre><p>Cool.</p><p>Now that we have this function, we can also write a quick helper to translate Clojure numbers to these numbers:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> int-&gt;church-numeral</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [clojure-int]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>zero?</span><span> clojure-int)</span>
<span>      zero</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> (</span><span>dec</span><span> clojure-int))))))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>=&gt; </span><span>5</span></code></pre><p>That’ll come in handy for our REPL.</p><p>Next up, we need a way to “decrement” a number. Well, with <code>inc</code> we create a numeral that composes <code>f</code> <em>one more time</em>. If we can make some kind of function that composes <code>f</code> <em>one less time,</em> then we’d have <code>dec</code>! </p><p>To do that, we’ll need to go on a short diversion.</p><p>Remember our <code>pair</code> data structure? Let’s create a function for it (we’ll use this in just a moment below): <code>shift-and-inc</code>.  All it would do, is take pair of numbers, and “shift” the pair forward by one:</p><p>For example, applying <code>shift-and-inc</code> to <code>(0 1)</code>,  would produce <code>(1 2)</code>. One more time, it would produce <code>(2 3)</code>, and so on. </p><p>Sounds simple enough: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> shift-and-inc (</span><span>fn</span><span> [pair]</span>
<span>                     (</span><span>church-pair</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)</span>
<span>                       (</span><span>church-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-second</span><span> pair)))))</span></code></pre><p>Bam, we take a pair. The second item is shifted over to the first positions and is replaced with its <code>inc</code>ed friend. Let’s try it out:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> [p (</span><span>shift-and-inc</span><span> (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> one two))]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>map</span><span> church-numeral-&gt;int [(</span><span>church-first</span><span> p) (</span><span>church-second</span><span> p)]))</span>
<span>; =&gt; (2 3)</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm!</p><p>Now that we have <code>shift-and-inc</code>, what if we did this: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-dec</span>
<span>  (</span><span>fn</span><span> [church-numeral]</span>
<span>    (</span><span>church-first</span>
<span>      (</span><span>church-numeral</span><span> shift-and-inc</span>
<span>                      (</span><span>church-pair</span><span> zero zero)))))</span></code></pre><p>Remember that our <code>church-numeral</code> would call <code>shift-and-inc</code> N times, representing its numeral value. If we started with a pair <code>(0, 0)</code>, then what would the result b, if we composed <code>shift-and-inc</code> <code>N</code> times?</p><p>Our result would be the pair <code>(N-1, N)</code>. This means that if we take the first part of our pair, we have <code>dec</code>! </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>church-numeral-&gt;int</span><span> (</span><span>church-dec</span><span> (</span><span>int-&gt;church-numeral</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>)))</span>
<span>; =&gt; 9</span></code></pre><p>Nice.</p><p>Next up, multiplication. Say we multiply <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>. We’d need to produce a church numeral that composes <code>f</code>, <code>a * b</code> times. To do that, we can leverage the following idea:</p><p>Say we made a function <code>g</code>, which composes <code>f</code> <em>b</em> times. If we fed that function to <code>a</code>, it would call <code>g</code>, <em>a</em> times.  </p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk2Mzc4MjI2LTdmOTFmYzAwLTExNTgtMTFlYi05MmY2LTVlZDdhNzA0YWE1MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If <code>a</code> was “2” and “b” was 3, how many times would <code>f</code> get composed? Well, <code>g</code> would be composed twice. Each time <code>g</code> is composed, <code>f</code> is composed 3 times.

<span>=&gt; </span><span>25</span></code></pre><p>Works like a charm! </p><p>We’ve got numbers, we’ve got <code>*</code> and we’ve got <code>dec</code>. Next up…booleans! </p><p>To do this, we need to be creative about what <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> is. </p><p>Let’s say this. Booleans are two argument functions: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> church-true (</span><span>fn</span><span> [</span><span>when-true</span><span> </span><span>when-false</span><span>]</span>

<span>                    </span><span>when-false</span><span>))</span></code></pre><p>They take a “true” case and a “false” case. Our <code>church-true</code> function would return the true case, and <code>church-false</code> function would return the false case. </p><p>That’s it. Surprisingly this is enough to handle booleans. Here’s how we could convert them to Clojure bools.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> church-bool-&gt;bool [church-bool]</span>

<p>Legos are an excellent meta-toy in that they represent the potential for a near-infinite number of toys depending on how you assemble them. Each brick has structure. But each brick is only interesting to the extent that it can combine with other bricks, forming new and more complex structures. So in order to enjoy Legos, you have to figure out how they fit together and come up with a clever way of making the particular toy you have in mind. Once you have mastered a few simple rules, the open-ended design of Lego bricks lets you build anything you can imagine.</p>

<p>Our universe has the same versatile structure. It seems to run according to just a few simple forces, but as those forces interact, they give rise to intricate patterns across many scales of space and time. You see this everywhere you look in nature – in the fractal design of a seashell or the intricate polities of a coral. In the convection of a teacup or the circulation of the atmosphere. And this simple structure even determines the shape and behavior of man’s most complicated flying machines.</p>

<p>To see this more clearly, we are going to start from the basic physical laws of airflow and use them to derive the shape of a wing.<sup id="fnref:fn18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn18">1</a></sup> Since we are using so few assumptions, the wing shape we come up with will be as fundamental as the physics of the air that swirls around it. This is pretty fundamental. In fact, if an alien species started building flying machines on another planet, they would probably converge on a similar shape.</p>

<h3 id="navier-stokes">Navier-Stokes</h3>

<p>We will begin this journey with the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Navier-Stokes-equation">Navier-Stokes equation</a>, which sums up pretty much everything we know about fluid dynamics. It describes how tiny fluid parcels interact with their neighbors. The process of solving fluid dynamics problems comes down to writing out this equation and then deciding which terms we can safely ignore. In our case, we would like to simulate the flow of air through a wind tunnel and then use it to evaluate various wing shapes.</p>

<p>Since the pressure differences across a wind tunnel are small, one of the first assumptions we can make is that air is incompressible. This lets us use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations#Incompressible_flow">incompressible form</a> of the Navier-Stokes equation:</p>

<p><span id="longEqnWithSmallScript_A">
\(\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} ~=~ - \underbrace{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection}} ~+~ \underbrace{\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{viscous diffusion}} \\
~+~ \underbrace{f}_{\text{velocity $\uparrow$ due to forces}}\)
</span>
<span id="longEqnWithLargeScript_A">
\(\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} ~=~ - \underbrace{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection}} ~+~ \underbrace{\nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{viscous diffusion}} ~+~ \underbrace{f}_{\text{velocity $\uparrow$ due to forces}}\)
</span></p>

<p>Another term we can ignore is viscous diffusion. Viscous diffusion describes how fluid parcels distribute their momenta due to sticky interactions with their neighbors. We would say that a fluid with high viscosity is “thick”: common examples include molasses and motor oil. Even though air is much thinner, viscous interactions still cause a layer of slow-moving air to form along the surface of an airplane wing. However, we can ignore this boundary layer because its contribution to the aerodynamics of the wing is small compared to that of self-advection.</p>

<p>The final term we can ignore is the forces term, as there will be no forces on the air once it enters the wind tunnel. And so we are left with but a hair of the original Navier-Stokes hairball:</p>

\[\underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{\text{velocity update}} = \underbrace{- (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u}}_{\text{self-advection ("velocity follows itself")}}\]

<p>This simple expression describes the effects that really dominate wind tunnel physics. It says, intuitively, that “the change in velocity over time is due to the fact that velocity follows itself.” So the entire simulation comes down to two simple rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		• Rule 1: Velocity follows itself <p>(+)</p>
		<ul>
		
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<!-- <b>Rule 1: Velocity follows itself</b> -->
		• Rule 2: Volume is conserved <p>(+)</p>
		<ul>
		
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>By alternating between these two rules, we can iteratively 1) move the system forward in time and 2) enforce conservation of volume and mass. In practice, we implement each rule as a separate function and then apply both functions to the system at every time step. This allows us to simulate, say, a gust of wind passing through the wind tunnel. But before we can direct this wind over a wing, we need to decide how to represent the wing itself.</p>

<h3 id="representing-the-wing">Representing the Wing</h3>

<div>
<p>The wing is an internal boundary, or occlusion, of the flow. A good way to represent an occlusion is with a mask of zeros and ones. But since the goal of our wind tunnel is to try out different wing shapes, we need our wing to be continuously deformable. So we will allow the mask to take on continuous values between zero and one, making it semi-permeable in proportion to its mask values. This lets us add semi-permeable obstructions to the wind tunnel as shown:</p> <p>(+)</p>
</div>



<div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.00.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.0</p>
  </div>
    <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.05.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.05</p>
  </div>
    <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.12.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.12</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_0.50.png"></p><p>Mask = 0.5</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/mask/mask_1.00.png"></p><p>Mask = 1.0</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="choosing-an-objective">Choosing an Objective</h3>

<p>Now we are at the point where we can simulate how air flows over arbitrary, semi-permeable shapes. But in order to determine which of these shapes makes a better wing, we still need to define a measure of performance. There are many qualities that one could look for in a good wing, but we will begin with the most obvious: it should convert horizontal air velocity into upward force as efficiently as possible. We can measure this ability using something called the lift-drag ratio where “lift” measures the upward force generated by the wing and “drag” measures the frictional forces between the air and the wing. Since “change in downward airflow” in the tunnel is proportional to the upward force on the wing, we can use it as a proxy for lift. Likewise, “change in rightward airflow” is a good proxy for the drag forces on the wing. With this in mind, we can write out the objective function as</p>

\[\max_{\theta} L/D\]

<p>where \(\theta\) represents some tunable parameters associated with the shape of the wing mask and \(L/D\) can be obtained using the initial and final wind velocities of the simulation according to</p>

\[\begin{align}
     L/D &amp;= \frac{\text{lift}}{\text{drag}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{\text{change in downward airflow}}{-\text{change in rightward airflow}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{ -\big ( v_y(t)-v_y(0) \big )}{-\big ( v_x(t)-v_x(0) \big )}\\
    &amp;= \frac{ v_y(t)-v_y(0) }{ v_x(t)-v_x(0)}
\end{align}\]

<p>Solving this optimization problem will give us a wing shape that generates the most efficient lift possible. In other words, we new have the correct problem setup; what remains is to figure out how to solve it.</p>

<h3 id="optimization">Optimization</h3>

<div>
<p>We are going to solve this problem with gradient ascent. Gradient ascent is simple and easy to implement, but there is one important caveat: we need a way to efficiently compute the gradient of the objective function with respect to the wing mask parameters. This involves differentiating through each step of the fluid simulation in turn – all of the way back to the initial conditions. This would be difficult to implement by hand, but fortunately there is a tool called <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a> which can perform this back-propagation of gradients automatically. We will use Autograd to compute the gradients of the mask parameters, move the mask parameters in that direction, and then repeat this process until the lift-drag ratio reaches a local maximum.</p> <p>(+)</p>
</div>



<p>So let’s review. Our goal is to simulate a wind tunnel and use it to derive a wing shape. We began by writing down the general Navier-Stokes equation and eliminating irrelevant terms: all of them but self-advection. Next, we figured out how to represent a wing shape in the tunnel using a continuously-deformable occlusion. Finally, we wrote down an equation for what a good wing should do and discussed how to optimize it. Now it is time to put everything together in about two hundred lines of code and see what happens when we run it…</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/optimize_wing.png">

</p></div>

<p>Sure enough, we get a beautiful little wing. Of all possible shapes, this is the very best one for creating efficient lift in our wind tunnel. This wing is definitely a toy solution since our simulation is coarse and not especially accurate. However, after making a few simple improvements we would be able to design real airplane wings this way. We would just need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simulate in 3D instead of 2D</li>
  <li>Use a mesh parameterization instead of a grid</li>
  <li>Make the flow laminar and compressible</li>
</ol>

<p>Aside from these improvements, the overall principle is much the same. In both cases, we write down some words and symbols, turn them into code, and then use the code to shape our wing.<sup id="fnref:fn14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn14">2</a></sup> The fact that we can do all of this without ever building a physical wing makes it feel a bit like magic. But this process really works, for when we <a href="http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/jameson-cincin-pm.pdf#page=36">put these wings on airplanes</a> and trust them with our lives, they carry us safely to our destinations.<sup id="fnref:fn3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:fn17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn17">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Just like the real wind tunnels of the twentieth century, these simulated wind tunnels need to go through lots of debugging before we can trust them. In fact, while building this demo we discovered a number of ways that things can go wrong. Here are some of the most amusing failure cases:</p>

<p><img src="https://greydanus.github.io/assets/optimizing-a-wing/sim_bloopers.png">
</p>

<p>Several of these wings are just plain dreadful. But others seem reasonable, if unexpected. The two-wing solution is particularly amusing. We did not intend for this “biplane” solution to occur, and yet it is a completely viable way of solving the objective we wrote down. One advantage to keeping the problem setup so …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Technology has become as pervasive as the air we breathe today. While our reliance on technology keeps on increasing, there are a myriad of problems that complement the acceptance of these solutions for inconvenience. For instance, social media may have started as a force for good, but it possibly has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/19/the-social-dilemma-a-wake-up-call-for-a-world-drunk-on-dopamine">devolved into a state of dysfunction</a>, one that is all about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">surveillance capitalism</a>. Likewise, online commenting may have built a degree of community and credibility over the years, but it has also led to a vast array of problems like online toxicity, <a href="https://www.salon.com/2017/08/05/why-facebooks-racism-problem-might-never-be-solved/">online disinhibition</a> and misogyny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe it was Albert Einstein who adroitly stated that — <em>It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity</em>. Possible, but this is why checks and balances need to be put in effect to ensure that there is more than just a modicum of control. As more and more people are converted to a digitalized life, there are sure to be more issues that come to the forefront. If there are problems created by technology then technology will create solutions to those problems as well.</p>
<p>The focus of this post is — <em>The Future of</em> <em>Online Commenting</em>. At this particular juncture, let’s dissect the current state of online commenting, and its future. But before we do, let’s have a basic look at its history.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Brief Look at the History of Online Commenting&nbsp;</h2>
<p>We hear of the whole concept of letters to the editor, and even letters that were sent to authors by readers. This was the type of commenting that was present; commenting is reminiscent of the older practice of publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_editor">letters to the editor.</a>&nbsp;With the advent of technology and online platforms plus the death of penmanship, the whole concept of —<em> letters to the editor</em> — have taken on the form of online commentary via enabling comments. </p>
<p>The first online website to offer a comments section was <a href="https://www.opendiary.com/">Open Diary</a>, which added reader comments shortly after its launch in October 1998. As the concept of analytics came to the fore, and a larger audience created greater brand value, which resulted in more sales, more and more companies embraced online commenting.</p>

<p>Towards the late 2000s, comments sections were quickly added to news sites. And, it was <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17512786.2016.1205954?journalCode=rjop20">between 2007 and 2008 that there was a 42% growth</a> in the number of popular news sites with comments sections. In 2008, 75% of the top 100 most popular newspapers in terms of circulation had commenting systems in place. However, towards 2010, The American Journalism Review posited that newspapers offer <a href="https://www.monsterinsights.com/what-is-gated-content-and-how-to-use-it-to-get-more-leads/">gated comments</a> or do away with comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This evolution of commenting is the sign of the times. Many have agonized over the value of the conversations taking place online, but we see with the influx of social media platforms and blogging really taking off that online commenting is here to stay.</p>
<p>Building a commenting system where people would have to comment as their real selves, or moderating a commenting system where people were allowed to continue commenting under a different identity, has become an issue concerning the allocation of resources for many.</p>
<h2>The Future of Online Commenting has to Deal with Current Issues</h2>
<p>Online commenting and those who are privy to the world of such interactions are well aware of the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/10-years-of-comment-moderation/553136/">mental toll that it could have</a>. While most commenting systems do offer the facility of pre-moderation, where all incoming comments are queued to await approval, this seems to be effective only to a certain degree.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amp/2019-05-03-turn-off-comments-wont-fix-internet.html">Dr. Gina Masullo Chen</a>, assistant professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, states, <em>“I would rather use techniques that will improve the comment stream…and some of the things that improve them are really strong moderation and pre-moderation.”</em> That said there is no doubt that moderators face a serious mental toll in embracing this as a full-time job. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">The Trauma Floor</a>&nbsp;showcases the issues faced by Facebook moderators, and it is harrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the mental toll that moderating online comments has on its gatekeepers, there is also the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/future-propaganda-will-be-computer-generated/616400/?utm_source=pocket&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pockethits">specter of misinformation</a> that is looming large and terrifying. We have all heard of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">the Cambridge Analytica debacle</a>, and now we are faced with so much of disinformation spreading via online comments.</p>
<p>In a world that is teeming with so much of <a href="https://api-nationalgeographic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/science/2020/09/coronavirus-origins-misinformation-yan-report-fact-check-cvd?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=16005082450055&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s">fake news, like, for instance, regarding Covid-19</a>, it comes as no surprise that organizations desire to one-up their competitors. With a sea chockfull of content, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/is-facebook-organic-reach-dead/">organic reach appears to be dying</a>; this is certainly the case with Facebook. This is precisely why aspects like influencer marketing works where brands piggyback on the followers of influencers. </p>
<p>We hear of entities like <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/microsofts-ai-team-release-a-bot-that-can-generate-fake-comments-the-internet-asks-why">Bizarrely</a>, which is a team at Microsoft that has released work on an AI bot, called DeepCom. This initiative used to generate fake comments about news articles. This is the other side of the coin: While technology serves to solve certain problems, there are companies that will utilize technology to generate money. The intention is what counts at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Considering the various online facts regarding the aspect of commenting, you will realize that there are many issues concerning comments so much so that companies like <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/">Verge has done away with online comments</a>. News sites are known to be a nefarious cesspit of human thoughts. Yet, the question remains: Does getting rid of comments affect a site’s engagement and followership? It does, and yet there are outliers like the <a href="https://amp-theatlantic-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/371862/?usqp=mq331AQHKAFQCrABIA%3D%3D&amp;amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=16023963115219&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2014%2F06%2Finternet-comments-and-perceptions-of-quality%2F371862%2F">National Journal</a> that saw page views increase.</p>
<p>Instead of doing away with online commenting, why not have real-time automated feedback as a solution? Instead of focusing on that age-old advice of <strong>Never Read The Comments</strong>, let’s focus on a solution. Commenting platforms aim to keep toxic conversations stifled with a combination of human guardians and up-to-date technology.</p>
<h2>Is the Future of Online Commenting Driven by AI? </h2>
<p>The future is here. <a href="https://micky.com.au/instagram-ai-automatically-hides-offensive-comments/?amp">Instagram is already on the way to using AI</a> to identify and block offensive comments. AI will also remind users that they are typing something offensive. AI tools work to flag and categorize harmful comments before a human can review them, thus helping to manage the workload and decrease toxic content. While there’s a possibility to dance around the edges of algorithmic detection, the fact is that this is better than nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question of impartiality needs to be answered. Esther Berg’s opines that Instagram has <a href="https://nypost.com/article/social-media-censorship-conservatives/">unfairly silenced conservative thoughts</a>. Although this factor is not addressed in the article, one wonders whether this particular intervention was human or non-human. There is something known as <strong>adaptive behavior</strong>, which ultimately is one of the main concerns in designing AI-focused commenting systems. Basically, commenters can ultimately amend the word. For example, if <strong>chocolate</strong> is a banned word, it could be written as <strong>c h o c o l a t e</strong>.</p>
<p>Either way, the fact here is that AI is the future, and <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/ai-statistics/#gref">there are plenty of statistics to prove this</a>. By 2025, the global AI market is expected to be almost&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/top-industries-getting-revolutionised-by-artificial-intelligence-686a440857c0">$60 billion</a>. Moreover, the number of AI startups grew&nbsp;14 times over the last two decades. A comfortable prediction would be that commenting systems will be powered by AI yet with a human overseer. </p>
<p>Just like any technology that is used, the main stakeholders of that particular technology is human. Catering to humans is only possible with humans. AI has come a long way for sure, yet what is missing is the gap between the understanding that lies between both AI and man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humans are still the best when it comes to reading, understanding, interpreting and moderating content. Because of this, businesses that are focused on making their mark in the world will make use of both AI and humans when creating an online presence and moderating content online.</p>
<h2>Privacy is a BIG Issue </h2>

<p>Many news sites and blogs have chosen to go on a digital dieting strategy with regard to the endeavor of online commenting. This is because while there are too many issues with toxic commentary, there’s also the <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">issue of </a><strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784">Privacy</a></strong><a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/the-endless-story-of-wordpress-plugins-security-issues/431784"> that needs to be considered</a>.</p>
<p>Most websites and blogs use a third party commenting system. Suffice to say, the focus of a commenting system is to initiate better conversations. However, the issue here is that systems like <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">Disqus and Facebook Comments track visitors</a>, and harvest their data for advertising purposes. Adding insult to injury, these systems even have the <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">indiscrete ability to know what sites users have visited</a>. What is ironic here is that <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/104/2014/7/29/Your-users-deserve-better-than-Disqus/">many companies blindly use these systems</a> at the expense of privacy. Therefore, choosing a GDPR-compliant system is key. </p>
<p>Data that is tracked by Disqus, which may be revealed to third parties, includes pseudonymous analytics data, which inclides a user’s IP address, their web browser version and installed add-ons, and their referring pages and exit links.</p>
<p>Disqus has also been criticized for <a href="http://www.baekdal.com/insights/the-first-rule-of-privacy">publishing its registered users’ entire commenting history</a>, along with a list of connected blogs and services, on the publicly viewable user profile pages. Of course, there are other issues, too, like the fact that such a system is heavy and can lead to a decrease in page load speed. </p>
<p>Exactly why is data privacy important? It is important to consumers because a breach of personal information can damage an individual’s fundamental rights and freedoms, including the risk of identity theft and other types of fraud.</p>
<p>To maintain customer trust today, a company must demonstrate that&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/08/08/data-privacy/">data privacy</a>&nbsp;is one of its core values. Indeed, while many businesses still view privacy policies as a forgettable legal routine, there is a change in the consumer’s attitude. <a href="https://blog.netwrix.com/2019/11/05/data-privacy-trends-issues-and-concerns-for-2020/">Worryingly, as per a PwC research, only 25%</a> of consumers believe most companies handle their personal data responsibly.</p>

The Lost Chapter<br>
<span color="#A0A0A0">Recovered conversations from 2004 shine new light on Facebook's origins.</span></p><div>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authoritas-Students-Admissions-Founding-Facebook/dp/1606690000/ref=ed_oe_h"><img src="http://www.aarongreenspan.com/authoritas/en_US/title.gif"></a></p><p><b>UPDATE:</b> See the January 2019 <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/realitycheck/facebook.html" target="_new">Facebook, Inc. Reality Check report on PlainSite</a>, as well as my <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/d434d37f-c020-44b4-bda8-11bbad29ac58" target="_new">June 2019 testimony before UK Parliament's DCMS Sub-Committee on Disinformation</a>.</p><p>Chapter 30: The Other Folder</p><p><b>2003: Cambridge, Massachusetts</b></p><p>In college, my computer's filing system was relatively straightforward: I had a folder for each year of school, and within each of those folders there were additional folders for each course I was taking. For everything else—birthday cards for my family, funny or strange conversations with friends, documents from the College administration, and summer housing—there was the "Other" folder.</p><p>So it happened that in my junior year of college, I came across the web site of one of the many finals clubs on campus, the Fly Club. I wasn't even close to being a member of any of the clubs, but the Fly Club was of particular interest because it effectively sat on my front lawn, directly in front of Lowell House, where I'd walk back and forth in front of it to go to class every day, several times a day, without ever having seen the inside. (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=The+Fly+Club,+Cambridge,+MA+02138&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=42.371103,-71.118104&amp;spn=0.001494,0.002401&amp;sll=42.371031,-71.118166&amp;sspn=0.001494,0.002401&amp;t=h&amp;hq=The+Fly+Club,&amp;hnear=Cambridge,+Massachusetts+02138&amp;z=19&amp;iwloc=A)" target="_new">It's still there</a>.)</p><p>At the time, the Fly's web site had a minor glitch. As an exclusive social club open only to the elite of the elite, there wasn't much for the "average" visitor such as myself to do. On the home page, members could sign in, while everyone else could simply stare at a large picture of the building that they were politely denied access to. I wasn't interested in gaining access so much as I was curious why access was denied in the first place. But even the most exclusive buildings have back doors.</p><p>Asking my web browser to display the address of the image of the building revealed that it was unsurprisingly in the /images folder. And asking my web browser to see if there was anything else in that folder revealed that there was: a PDF comprising a directory of the Club's still-living members dating back to 1923.</p><p>I thought about it for a while, and then decided to e-mail someone I knew in the Club to inform him of the problem and to offer my services in fixing it. He replied thanking me, and that was the last I heard about it. Though I did not deliberately save the PDF to my hard drive at first, eventually I did, afraid that without it, there would be no proof that I had ever found the problem in the first place, should the matter ever come up again. I saved the file to my Other folder, and there it sat for nine years.</p><p><b>2012: Palo Alto, California</b></p><p>Quora is a Silicon Valley startup, founded by Adam D'Angelo and Charlie Cheever, both so-called Facebook veterans (a phrase that actual veterans might find laughable). Adam was Facebook's founding CTO after graduating from CalTech, and Charlie was one of Facebook's early employees after graduating from Harvard. Both are smart, down-to-earth, driven, and relatively quiet guys. Both managed to generate an enormous amount of investor, media, and user interest for Quora, though most of the users today still seem to be confined to Silicon Valley types (which should make it unsurprising that I have an account). And both founders are now at the center of a growing mystery after Adam unilaterally announced on September 11, 2012 that Charlie would no longer be involved in his day-to-day role at the company.</p><p>Several articles, none of them particularly insightful, were written about this minor drama. One of them mentioned that while at Harvard, Charlie had been the President of the Fly Club, which got me wondering—was that really true? So I began to think whether I might be able to answer the question for myself without the confounding factors of rumor and speculation. With a few clicks, I decompressed my Other folder from my junior year of college, and found the Fly Club's 2001 PDF. It confirmed that Charlie was indeed a member of the Club in 2001. And then I noticed some other files—several dated files, all ending with "zuckerberg.html."</p><p><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/timeline.pdf" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="PDF"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/timeline.pdf" target="_new">The Complete Timeline</a></p><p><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040108.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040108.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040108.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040409.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040409.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040409.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040420.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040420.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040420.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040524.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040524.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040524.zuckerberg.html</a><br><a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040602.zuckerberg.html" target="_new"><img src="http://www.thinkpress.com/shared/icons/aim.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="AIM"></a> <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/housesystem/20040602.zuckerberg.html" target="_new">20040602.zuckerberg.html</a></p><p>•</p><p>It turns out that my Other folder contained some of the most important legal evidence regarding the origins of Facebook, Inc. that I had been trying to find for years, but without much success. I had already scoured the folders I created for the Student Entrepreneurship Council and come up with a number of the AOL Instant Messenger conversations that I had with Mark, but not all of them, and not the most revealing ones. I had also checked my "Aaron" folder, which had another sub-folder for Instant Messenger conversations, as well as the large hierarchy of folders containing all of Think Computer Corporation's data, which had even more conversations, but none with Mark. The conversations I remembered having, but could not recall the exact details of, were nowhere to be found, at least until September 12, 2012.</p><p>What Mark and I talked about in the months before and after Facebook's launch is remarkably relevant both for its historical and present value. There is almost as much significance in what was not said as what was.</p><p>For starters, it's striking how different the context is between the way these conversations portray the beginning of Facebook, and how the opening scenes of The Social Network portray the beginning of Facebook. Long after Mark's angry blog posts that spawned Facemash, there was no talk of girlfriends or breakups, and no talk of finals clubs (even though one indirectly led me back to the conversations themselves). In other words, as we already knew, Ben Mezrich <a href="http://www.aarongreenspan.com/writing/essay.html?id=71">invented material out of whole cloth</a> for his book (upon which the movie was based), and <a href="http://www.aarongreenspan.com/writing/essay.html?id=76">profited enormously</a> from calling it "non-fiction." He did so mostly at the expense of Mark's high school friend (and later, Quora co-founder) Adam D'Angelo and myself. When the book and then the movie came out, only Adam had Facebook's imprimatur to protect his reputation.</p><p>Rather, the real key to Mark's interest in social networking can be found in the first ten lines of our first conversation: AIM screennames. Using Adam's BuddyZoo, which allowed users to determine their connections to other AIM users, Mark determined the shortest path between his screenname and mine. But we each independently realized that AIM was startlingly deficient insofar as the software encouraged users to customize their profiles, and then limited them from doing so. There was far more potential than what AIM allowed in its small text box, which is why I had immediately added an AIM screenname field to my Facebook along with a field for cell phone number, and Mark was thinking about building the exact same thing—only with Adam's BuddyZoo built in.</p><p>It's also remarkable just how close Mark and I seemed at the beginning, even after just meeting each other, which might help explain why I felt so deeply wounded in the ensuing months and years. Mark repeatedly requested, and I repeatedly offered, help with his (and even Adam's) project; after all, he didn't know much about computer hardware, and he knew almost nothing about business or legal matters. This is not to say that he wasn't smart, because he was certainly a quick learner. Yet almost from the outset, despite acting in an otherwise friendly manner, Mark determined not that he wanted to help me in return, but that he wanted to compete with me.</p><p>Serious competition between friends, in my experience, never works well, and always ends badly. Someone is bound to get hurt. In this case that person was obviously me. Mark's brand of competition, though, was more pernicious than your average sort. Rather than building a site with the same functionality as the houseSYSTEM Facebook, he built a site with the same functionality as the houseSYSTEM Facebook (as he himself admitted) that he called, without ever informing me of his intent to do so, The Facebook. It wasn't "Mark's Facebook." It wasn't "A Facebook." It was "The Facebook." As the operator of another product that people were already calling the exact same thing, that automatically put me on the defensive, because his choice of a generic name necessarily implied uniqueness and stature. His eagerness to take his work to <i>The Crimson</i> to be broadcast campuswide, made this seemingly minor problem a major one, especially when other campus newspapers nationwide, and then mainstream newspapers, picked up the story.</p><p>For a college student in 2003, I understood an awful lot about trademarks, including the general reasons why one could not trademark a generic term. I had spent five years fighting two companies over the right to name my company Think Computer—a battle I eventually won in 2004. But it came at a great expense in terms of both time and money, and I was shocked that Mark would trample on the name of someone he had just met in the dining hall over dinner three days before. It was an expense I simply could not afford all over again (unlike the Winklevoss twins, my father did not have millions of dollars of disposable income), besides which I couldn't wrap my head around the idea of getting into a legal battle with another student who apparently looked up to me and sat next to me in a Computer Science independent study. So I asked Mark about it after class one day. He denied doing anything wrong, acting wounded by the question instead. Either he was faking it, or he truly didn't understand what he was doing. Perhaps it was a little of both.</p><p>It had already been clear from our first bite of rubber chicken in Kirkland House that there were a lot of things Mark didn't understand, aside from intellectual property. He didn't understand how to speak like a mature person his age. He didn't understand why his earlier creation, Facemash, might have offended people (including me). He didn't really understand why anyone would be interested in a site as useful as houseSYSTEM. And he shockingly did not understand why information …</p></div></div>

<p>Imagine moving to a neighborhood and finding that suddenly, your friends and family are ashamed of you. Employers turn you down when you tell them your address, your fiancee tells you her family is threatening to disown her if she marries you.</p>
<p>It sounds like a literary allegory for racism, but for 2-3 million people known as <em>burakujyumin</em> in Japan, it’s a historic precedent. <em>Burakumin</em> were once part of a broader despised caste, but now refers increasingly to sections of cities where that caste once lived, and the jobs that caste once had.</p>

<p>Particularly, leather tanning and butchering. An American researcher in Japan took a job in a leather working factory, and tells this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>“On the evening before I was to head off to my first day at the factory, I had received an olfactory warning from my 82-year-old neighbor, friend, and frequent dinner companion. The stench of leather, Nakajo-san explained, was atrocious. More than that, the smell of leather stuck – it clung to your clothes, to your hands, to your hair. While the odor might wash off initially, after time, after daily contact with the scent, the smell became part of you. I needed to be prepared to stink – and stink permanently – if I were really going to work in the factory. I also, and here Nakajo-san grew a bit more serious, needed to be prepared to eat dinner alone. He explained that he could not&nbsp;abide the smell of leather and that our shared evening meals would have to end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Some employees of banks have reported managers holding up maps of <em>burakumin</em>&nbsp;(“hamlet”) neighborhoods, warning the agents not to discriminate against people from those areas. One former clerk tells the story of a manager who delivered this speech, saying it was useful to know these neighborhoods so the agents could brace themselves to hide their disgust when they saw them. The intent was clear: “This is the map of people we don’t want to give loans to… but don’t discriminate… but check this map. You know, to <em>make sure you don’t discriminate</em> against the disgusting people who live there.”</p>
<p><strong>Defining Japan<br>
</strong>Japanese people are essentially identical to Koreans in origin, but a history of nationalism, represented by a divine emperor, has placed an imaginary sense of distinction into the blood of many Japanese. The cultural identities of some Japanese are distinct from this “pure blood” of the mainland: <em>Ainu</em> of Hokkaido and the Okinawan people have historically been considered Pseudo-Japanese, just above foreign residents of Japan. (Even multi-generational Korean migrant families are considered pseudo-Japanese). The Ainu have their own religion and ceremonies, deemed barbaric by their occupiers, while the Okinawans were seen as half-Chinese, owing to a history as a vassal state.</p>
<p>But even being “pure” Japanese didn’t keep you from full integration. There was a caste difference. Burakumin doesn’t refer to a national identity, but to “the hamlet people” who lived in ghettos on the outskirts of the cities. Essentially, outsiders.</p>

During the Tokugawa Shogunate, society was deliberately stratified into classes. We imagine the peasants to be the lowest class in a country where samurai literally had the right to kill them for any perceived insult, but there were worse people to be than the farmers toiling for a feudal lord, and one of them is the person responsible for clearing away the bodies of humans and animals or slaughtering animals for meat or leather. They were called <em>Eta</em> – “Filthy People,” or <em>Hinen</em> – “Non-People.”</p>
<p>Eta came first, long before the Tokugawa era, and Hinen came after, a term applied to everyone on Tokugawa Ieyasu’s shit list:</p>
<blockquote><p>The term came to include beggars, panhandlers, lepers, and Eta and later evolved into an all-encompassing name for occupations such as cleaners, gardeners, falcon hackers, butchers, harbingers, comedians, gravediggers and prison guards.</p></blockquote>
<p>These jobs were considered filthy for a handful of reasons. Cleaners and gardeners were not the artisans designing the gardens, they were the ones cleaning outhouses or carrying fertilizer for the gardens. Falcon Hackers and Butchers were similar, a falcon hacker cut meat into bite-sized pieces for Imperial falcons while they are hatchlings. Notably, many of these – with the absence of comedians, who basically were accused of “working blue” – worked in proximity to the royal court. Most were considered below peasants, who were elevated above merchants (taxes were based on rice, not income) and merchants remained one step above the “outcasts.”</p>
<p>Popular stories about them circulated widely. They had dog bones in their bodies but were missing a rib. That their necks didn’t cast shadows, their sexual and excretory organs were deformed. They were subhuman in the hierarchy of Tokugawa, a distinction that lasted nearly 300 years.</p>
<p>They were banned from leaving their ghettos after sunset, banned from wearing shoes, often had to wear identifying marks on their clothing. If they spoke to anyone – usually for matters of trade – they had to get on their hands and knees. Certain haircuts were forbidden, and if they wore them, a samurai could execute them on sight.</p>
<p><strong>Common People&nbsp;</strong><br>
Tokugawa-era rules said that once you took one of these jobs, all of your descendants belonged to the same caste. So why would anyone take these jobs?</p>
<p>Desperation and tradition, as best as I can tell, but no one seems to know for certain. Horses and cows were being killed in Japan before Buddhist law banned it in the 8th century; once that law was passed an entire class of worker was legally and religiously tainted. (The further away you were from the capital, Kyoto, the more likely you were to ignore these laws: Hence, concentrations today are still focused in Kyushu and Tokyo, then the outskirts of the country).</p>
<p>One important factor was the weird (to Westerners) distinction between wealth and class. Lots of samurai were poor, despite being near the top of the social hierarchy. Hide workers were paid by<em> daimyo</em> and merchants for armor, saddles, and other leather goods, even if they weren’t respected for making them, and as with any organization in Japan, they formed their own hierarchies and fiefdoms on the outskirts of towns (hamlets) with the other undesirables: Lepers, comedians, prostitutes, beggars, all of which eventually became <em>burakumin</em>.</p>
<p>Eventually, of course, they had no choice: They could <em>only</em> work in the professions allowed to their class, a distinction useful to Tokugawa’s policies of strict social control. Everyone still got leather, and the stigma reminded riot-prone farmers that things could be worse.</p>
<p>By the last year of the Tokugawa period, 1867, we hear rumblings of a rebellion amongst the burakumin. Only 9 years earlier, a court had decided that only the unwarranted murder of <em>seven</em> Eta people could earn the death penalty, because Eta were only 1/7th human in the eyes of the court. And yet, a struggling shogun seeking new sources of revenue decided to tax them (already a questionable proposition, as of course most of them were quite poor). The Eta people near Osaka refused to pay, and responded with a letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are considered unclean because we dispose of animals and eat their flesh. Yet, we have heard that Westerners eat the flesh of animals as part of their daily meals, and they are treated politely here. Even here, in our own country after the ports have been opened, high-ranking people are said to have developed a taste for eating meat. Hence, we would like discrimination against us to cease by abolishing the use of the word “Eta” to describe us. If that were done, we would willingly donate the requested money even if we must dispose of all our possessions.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few years later, after the Meiji Restoration – a few years after the American Civil War – they got what they wanted. The government of Japan issued what some call “The Emancipation Proclamation” for Eta, giving them equal status and forbidding the acknowledgment of their history. It did not go well; riots in Okayama lead to Burakumin being burned in the streets. Even with their new legal status, the government was considering plans to round up Eta and force them to work in Hokkaido as farmers.</p>
<p>The name Eta eliminated, a few new ones emerged: “The New Commoners,” the “Special Kind,” which soon took on the meaning of “Different Kind,” even, briefly, “The Village People.” A surprisingly familiar attempt to govern attitudes through suggestion lead to another name, “Model Hamlet People,” and from there <em>burakumin</em> was born. Though still considered discriminatory, the word continues to be used by activists and academics, so I’m using it here.</p>
<p>Burakumin continued to work immersed in the smell of meat and hides, in abattoirs and tanneries isolated from the communities they served. These regions smelled like death. The workers smelled like death, and had for centuries. The religious stigma shifted to a social one, and then to a reflection of the neighborhoods they worked in. The idea of sub-humans remained.</p>
<p>Emancipation had a cost: Without legal distinctions, they became just another merchant class, now thrown into the same race and competition as everyone else. Socially, they couldn’t mingle with “proper” townspeople, could not marry out of their class. The only difference is that the government wasn’t involved in their repression – other people were doing it for them.</p>
<p>Burakumin could not find other work. They could not marry outside their closed impoverished communities, could not improve their social standing, despite the egalitarian meritocracy espoused in the Meiji period. This state of affairs lasted without government action for another 70 years – where the whole class of impoverished outcasts lived in forbidden and ignored neighborhoods marked by social exclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Eta Redux</strong></p>
<p><em>“Die eta filth.” “Burakumin maggots.” “Drop atomic bombs on buraku neighborhoods.”</em></p>
<p>These are some examples of the graffiti documented by Kiwi researcher …</p></div></div>

<p>A few months ago, I discovered a remote code execution issue in the <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> desktop application and I reported it via their <a href="https://discord.com/security">Bug Bounty Program</a>.</p><p>The RCE I found was an interesting one because it is achieved by combining multiple bugs. In this article, I'd like to share the details.</p><h3>Why I chose Discord for the target</h3><p>I kind of felt like finding for vulnerabilities of the Electron app, so I was looking for a bug bounty program which pays the bounty for an Electron app and I found Discord. Also, I am a Discord user and simply wanted to check if the app I'm using is secure, so I decided to investigate.</p><h3>Bugs I found</h3><p>Basically I found the following three bugs and achieved RCE&nbsp;by combining them.</p><ol><li>Missing contextIsolation</li><li>XSS in iframe embeds</li><li>Navigation restriction bypass (CVE-2020-15174)</li></ol><p>I'll explain these bugs one by one.</p><h3>Missing contextIsolation</h3><p>When I test Electron app, first I always check the options of the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window">BrowserWindow API</a>, which is used to create a browser window. By checking it, I think about how RCE can be achieved when arbitrary JavaScript execution on the renderer is possible.</p><p>The Discord's Electron app is not an open source project but the Electron's JavaScript code is saved locally with the asar format and I was able to read it just by extracting it.</p><p>In the main window, the following options are used:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>const mainWindowOptions = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;title: 'Discord',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;backgroundColor: getBackgroundColor(),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;width: DEFAULT_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;height: DEFAULT_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minWidth: MIN_WIDTH,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;minHeight: MIN_HEIGHT,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;transparent: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;frame: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;resizable: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;show: isVisible,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;webPreferences: {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blinkFeatures: 'EnumerateDevices,AudioOutputDevices',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><b>nodeIntegration: false</b></span>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preload: _path2.default.join(__dirname, 'mainScreenPreload.js'),<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nativeWindowOpen: true,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enableRemoteModule: false,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spellcheck: true<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>};</blockquote><p>The important options which we should check here are especially <i>nodeIntegration</i> and <i>contextIsolation</i>. From the above code, I found that the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option is set to false and the <i>contextIsolation</i> option is set to false (the default of the used version) in the Discord's main window.</p><p>If the nodeIntegration is set to true, a web page's JavaScript can use Node.js features easily just by calling the <code>require()</code>. For example, the way to execute the calc application on Windows is:</p><blockquote>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp; require('child_process').exec('calc');<br>&lt;/script&gt;</blockquote><p>In this time, the <i>nodeIntegration</i> was set to false, so I couldn't use Node.js features by calling the <code>require()</code> directly.</p><p>However, there is still a possibility of access to Node.js features. The <i>contextIsolation</i>, another important option, was set to false. This option should not be set to false if you want to eliminate the possibility of RCE on your app.</p><p>If the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, a web page's JavaScript can affect the execution of the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/83bb065b4f6ed512d545c46389a7fdc114c94a54/lib/renderer">Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer</a>, and preload scripts (In the following, these JavaScript will be referred to as the JavaScript code outside web pages).&nbsp;For example, if you override&nbsp; <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, one of the JavaScript built-in methods, with another function from a web page's JavaScript, the JavaScript code outside web pages also will use the overridden function when the <code>join</code> is called.</p><p>This behavior is dangerous because Electron allows the JavaScript code outside web pages to use the Node.js features regardless the <i>nodeIntegration</i> option and by interfering with them from the function overridden in the web page, it could be possible to achieve RCE even if the <i>nodeIntegration</i> is set to false.</p><p>By the way, a such trick was previously not known. It was first discovered in a pentest by Cure53, which I also joined in, in 2016. After that, we reported it to Electron team and the <i>contextIsolation</i> was introduced.</p><p>Recently, that pentest report was published. If you are interested, you can read it from the following link:</p><p>Pentest-Report Ethereum Mist 11.2016 - 10.2017<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSsD9gzOejmQ2QipReyMXwr_M0Mg1GMH/view</a></p><p>You can also read the slides which I used at a CureCon event:</p><p>The <i>contextIsolation</i> introduces the separated contexts between the web page and the JavaScript code outside web pages so that the JavaScript execution of each code does not affect each. This is a necessary faeture to eliminate the possibility of RCE, but this time it was disabled in Discord.</p><p>Now I found that the <i>contextIsolation</i> is disabled, so I started looking for a place where I could execute arbitrary code by interfering with the JavaScript code outside web pages.</p><p>Usually, when I create a PoC for RCE in the Electron's pentests, I first try to achieve RCE by using the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer. This is because the Electron's internal JavaScript code on the renderer can be executed in any Electron app, so basically I can reuse the same code to achieve RCE and it's easy.</p><p>In my slides, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/masatokinugawa/electron-abusing-the-lack-of-context-isolation-curecon-en?slide=41">I introduced</a> that RCE can be achieved by using the code which Electron executes at the navigation timing. It's not only possible from that code but there are such code in some places. (I'd like to publish examples of the PoC in the future.)</p><p>However, depending on the version of Electron used, or the <i>BrowserWindow</i> option which is set, because the code has been changed or the affected code can't be reached correctly, sometimes PoC via the Electron's code does not work well. In this time, it did not work, so I decided to change the target to the preload scripts.</p><div><p>When checking the preload scripts, I found that Discord exposes the function, which allows some allowed modules to be called via <code>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('MODULE-NAME')</code>, into the web page.</p></div><p>Here, I couldn't use modules that can be used for RCE directly, such as <i>child_process</i> module, but I found a code where RCE can be achieved by overriding the JavaScript built-in methods and interfering with the execution of the exposed module.</p><p>The following is the PoC. I was able to confirm that the calc application is popped up when I call the <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function which is defined in the module called "<i>discord_utils</i>" from devTools, while overriding the <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>.</p><blockquote>RegExp.prototype.test=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>}<br>Array.prototype.join=function(){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "calc";<br>}<br>DiscordNative.nativeModules.requireModule('discord_utils').getGPUDriverVersions();</blockquote><p>The <code>getGPUDriverVersions</code> function tries to execute the program by using the "<i>execa</i>" library, like the following:</p><blockquote>module.exports.getGPUDriverVersions = async () =&gt; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (process.platform !== 'win32') {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;const result = {};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const nvidiaSmiPath = `${process.env['ProgramW6432']}/NVIDIA Corporation/NVSMI/nvidia-smi.exe`;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;try {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = parseNvidiaSmiOutput(await execa(nvidiaSmiPath, []));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;} catch (e) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result.nvidia = {error: e.toString()};<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;return result;<br>};</p></blockquote><p>Usually the <i>execa</i> tries to execute "<i>nvidia-smi.exe</i>", which is specified in the <code>nvidiaSmiPath</code> variable, however, due to the overridden <code>RegExp.prototype.test</code> and <code>Array.prototype.join</code>, the argument is replaced to "<i>calc</i>" in the <i>execa</i>'s internal processing.</p><p>Specifically, the argument is replaced by changing the following two parts.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L36</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55">https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/blob/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc/lib/parse.js#L55</a></p><p>The remaining work is to find a way to execute JavaScript on the application. If I can find it, it leads to actual RCE.</p><h3>XSS in iframe embeds</h3><p>As explained above, I found that RCE could happen from arbitrary JavaScript execution, so I was trying to find an XSS vulnerability. The app supports the autolink or Markdown feature, but looked like it is good. So I turned my attention to the iframe embeds feature. The iframe embeds is the feature which automatically displays the video player on the chat when the YouTube URL is posted, for example.</p><p>When the URL is posted, Discord tries to get the <a href="https://ogp.me/">OGP</a> information of that URL and if there is the OGP information, it displays the page's title, description, thumbnail image, associated video and so on in the chat.</p><p>The Discord extracts the video URL from the OGP and only if the video URL is allowed domain and the URL has actually the URL format of the embeds page, the URL is embedded in the iframe.</p><p>I couldn't find the documentation about which services can be embedded in the iframe, so I tried to get a hint by checking the CSP's <i>frame-src</i> directive. At that time, the following CSP was used:</p><blockquote>Content-Security-Policy: [...] ; frame-src https://*.youtube.com https://*.twitch.tv https://open.spotify.com https://w.soundcloud.com https://sketchfab.com https://player.vimeo.com https://www.funimation.com https://twitter.com https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ https://recaptcha.net/recaptcha/ https://js.stripe.com https://assets.braintreegateway.com https://checkout.paypal.com https://*.watchanimeattheoffice.com</blockquote><p>Obviously, some of them are listed to allow iframe embeds (e.g. YouTube, Twitch, Spotify).&nbsp;I tried to check if the URL can be embeded in the iframe by specifying the domain into the OGP information one by one and tried to find XSS on the embedded domains. After some attempts, I found that the&nbsp;<a href="https://sketchfab.com/">sketchfab.com</a>, which is one of the domains listed in the CSP, can be embedded in the iframe and found XSS on the embeds page.&nbsp;I didn't know about Sketchfab at that time, but it seems that it is a platform in which users can publish, buy and sell 3D models. There was a simple DOM-based XSS in the footnote of the 3D model.</p><p>The following is the PoC, which has the crafted OGP. When I posted this URL to the chat, the Sketchfab was embedded into the iframe on the chat, and after a few clicks on the iframe, arbitrary JavaScript was executed.</p><p><a href="https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html">https://l0.cm/discord_rce_og.html</a></p><blockquote>&lt;head&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="og:title" content="RCE DEMO"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta property="<span><b>og:video:url</b></span>" content="https://<span><b>sketchfab.com</b></span>/models/2b198209466d43328169d2d14a4392bb/embed"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta …</blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>From the moment&nbsp;we log onto the internet, we get bombarded with dozens, if not hundreds of digital ads. Ads for shoes, shirts, vacations, productivity tools, medicine, political campaigns, mortgages, even ads for next generation military helicopters, <a href="http://worlddefenseshow.com/">weapons conferences</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/sponsored-content/2020/06/the-digital-battlespace">“digital battlespace” management</a>, and <a href="http://pnclassaction.com/">class action lawsuits</a>.
</p><p>A <a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2019/02/internet-users-spend-more-than-a-quarter-of-their-lives-online.html">2019 report</a> found that the average internet user spends more than a quarter of their life (nearly seven hours per day) on the internet, through a combination of mobile, desktop, and other devices at work and at home. A typical user might see several <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/how-many-websites-do-you-visit-each-day/">dozen to several thousand</a> web pages per day. Given how much time we spend staring at computer or smartphone screens, it is no surprise that advertisers devote much of their efforts to getting a piece of our attention through said screens.</p><p>So how many ads does a typical internet user see per day? Estimates vary greatly, with some clocking in at <a href="https://ppcprotect.com/how-many-ads-do-we-see-a-day/">20,000 per day.</a> One might question what these companies are getting out of bombarding users with so many ads. After all, many <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/brain-memory-magic-number/story?id=9189664">psychology experiments</a> have shown that our short-term memory can hold only a limited number of separate items. The average is about 7 items, plus or minus 2, depending on the context and individual. There is also the issue of relevance - more than <a href="https://www.audienceproject.com/blog/key-insights/new-study-has-ad-blocking-peaked/">half of online </a>users find that the online ads they see are irrelevant. This has been partly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/08/18/the-cost-performance-paradox-of-modern-digital-marketing/#200ee9e82a9c">attributed</a> to problems with inaccurate audience targeting data.</p><p>I decided to conduct an exploratory experiment and monitor how many Google display and banner ads I saw over the course of a single month of browsing activity. I used the <a href="https://adalytics.io/">Adalytics browser extension</a> to keep track of all my ad data to determine:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>How many different advertisers are paying for ads to get my attention?&nbsp;</li><li>What types of ads do I see most often?&nbsp;</li><li>What proportion of the ads I saw were relevant or useful to me?</li></ul><h2>How many different ads did I see?</h2><p>Over the course of one month in 2020, I saw a total 4,975 ads across the 35 different websites I visited. Of these 4,975 ads, there were 397 unique advertisement sponsors.
</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/GFrlzaKOjOsSUQfE.png" alt="top-ads-barchart.png"></p><p><i>How many times did I see an ad from a particular advertiser?</i></p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/HSYRJBmnMukLbOcm.png" alt="top-ads-wordcloud.png"></p><p><i>Word cloud of advertisers whose ads I saw most frequently</i></p><h2>One advertiser showed me their ads over 2,000 times within the course of one month</h2><p>I was surprised by the large number of ads I got from the online lending marketplace LendingTree. Almost 40% of the ads I saw were from their company, for a grand total of 2,081 ads. Upon closer inspection, I realized that I had been reading an article on a statistics website and left the browser tab open for a day (but not in view). This particular website would unload and load new ads from Google and Pubmatic’s ad networks every 15-20 seconds - an ‘interesting’ practice that allows a publisher like the website displaying this LendingTree ad to garner a larger number of ad impressions (and revenue) per each site visit. This practice wastes a user’s network data and can also slow down browser performance.This situation illustrates a broader phenomenon - the AdChoices program was created partially in response to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) taking a closer look at the digital advertising industry in 2009. The resulting initiative was designed as a self-regulatory mechanism by the adtech platforms, but those platforms may have little financial interest in creating tools that enable users to reduce how many irrelevant ads they are shown. It is therefore unsurprising that <a href="https://www.audienceproject.com/blog/key-insights/insights-attitude-towards-advertising-use-ad-blocking/">eliminating irrelevant ads</a> has become one of the top drivers of ad blocker adoption.</p><p>A recent r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/ir3247/if_the_same_ad_is_served_on_a_given_webpage_500/">Ad Operations</a> discussion confirmed that LendingTree most likely is getting charged for this multitude of ‘unseen’ impressions. Advertisers can utilize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_capping">frequency capping</a> to reduce the number of times a website visitor is shown the same ad and blacklist websites that inflate their impression counts through such means.</p><p>Disregarding this one problematic website, LendingTree was still the dominant purveyor of ads to my browser - 162 distinct impression loads. I discussed in another blog post how the Digital Advertising Alliance (which includes Google) created a self-regulatory initiative called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdChoices">AdChoices</a>, which in theory allows consumers to opt-out of seeing a specific ad multiple times by clicking on a blue triangle icon in the top right corner of an ad iframe. However, I showed in that exploratory analysis that a majority of ads do not include the AdChoices icon within their iframes, thus preventing users from opting out of seeing a specific ad unless they install an ad blocker. At the time this analysis was conducted, a majority of LendingTree’s ads that were observed neither included the AdChoices icon nor provided an opt-out mechanism upon clicking. In the latter case, the Blue AdChoices icon would simply take me to a <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/1660762">Google Ads FAQ</a> that talks about Google’s Ad Personalization. At the time this blog post was written, I noticed that some of LendingTree’s ad do include a seemingly functional AdChoices icon that lets you opt-out of seeing their ads - the only problem is, after clicking this button and navigating to a new page, I would still see the same Lending Tree ads. Therefore, there was no way for me to indicate that I was not interested in LendingTree’s ads for the 2000th time, short of tweeting at their Marketing Team. (I will update this blog post if we get a response.)</p><h2>Breakdown of ads by category</h2><p>I used the <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/taxonomy/">Interactive Advertising Bureau’s (IAB) Content Taxonomy</a> to categorize each ad I was shown and see what types of ads were most common. Categorizing the 397 unique advertisements showed 27 different IAB categories represented in this sample. Of these, “Technology &amp; Computing” ads were the most common, while “Shopping” and “Food &amp; Drink” were surprisingly under-represented in terms of the number of distinct advertisers.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_vIEXkuoBoDNmlwPi/assets/kGIMdiYyuoYKRLJg.png" alt="ads-by-category.png"></p><p><i>Pie chart illustrating the relative frequency with which I saw different categories of ads. Technology, business, and automative ads dominated.</i></p><p>I also had a fair number of different “Automotive” related ads showing up, both for cars as well as car insurance. I would broadly consider this category to be irrelevant to me, as I do not own a car nor want to own one. Showing car insurance ads to someone without a car does not seem to match the aspirational marketing maxim of “right person at the right time.”</p><h2>How many ads were relevant?</h2><p>Lastly, I sat down and reviewed the different unique ads I saw and labeled them as ‘relevant/useful’ or ‘not relevant’. This was obviously a very subjective exercise but an important one nonetheless. Irrelevant ads hurt user’s digital experience and they waste advertisers’ time and money. Entire industries have been built on personal data collection and the promise of marketing personalization, so this exercise was meant to serve as a very rough proxy for the success of that vision.</p><p>When labeling ads as ‘relevant’, I tried to be fairly open minded and include things that I’m not in the market for right now, but might be at some point in the next few years, such as replacement running shoes. I also included public awareness ads, such as those for coronavirus.gov or the public health initiative alonetogether.com. Of the 397 unique advertisers whose ads I saw (including multiple different products or ad copies), I decided 32 of them were relevant. The majority of these were for technology services, such as the cloud software monitoring company sonraisecurity.com, news related items (like a Bloomberg subscription or Politico sponsored articles), or coupon services. I got several ads for products I already purchase, such as TDAmeritrade’s brokerage services or Cloud Guru’s online tech education service. However, ads for things like <a href="http://covance.com/">Convance’s</a> contract clinical trial services, car insurance, coding bootcamps, or <a href="https://ncgmarketing.com/">digital marketing for attorneys</a> were not things I would ever need.</p><p>I saw these 32 ‘relevant’ ads a total of 666 times (auspicious, I know), and saw irrelevant ads 4,309 times. Excluding that one problematic website that served me thousands of LendingTree and other ads, reduces the irrelevant ads frequency total to 1867, or 74%.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Based on this small sample size analysis and accounting for the outlier of one website, I saw ~85 Google display ads per day. The majority of them (74%) were not relevant to me, and in most cases I did not have a way to opt-out of seeing them any more. I did get some ads from companies that were offering relevant products or services that I looked into further; some of these companies paid for more than 100 impressions to grab my attention, which underscores how some marketing strategies espouse a high number of touchpoints to interest a customer.</p><p>The example of LendingTree’s ad barrage, both on that one particularly problematic website, as well as on other sites, highlights how a lack of opt-out mechanisms and frequency capping can hurt consumers, and perhaps advertisers as well.</p><h2>Take away points</h2><ul><li>The proportion of ads shown to users that are relevant can be as low as 25%, probably even lower</li><li>A small number of advertisers can account for a disproportionately large portion of ad content served to users</li><li>Users are often not given any way to opt-out of irrelevant ads, excepting by installing ad blockers</li></ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-9/">previous</a></em>
</span></p>

<p>Welcome back to the Compiling a Lisp series. In this thrilling new update, we
will learn a little bit more about x86-64 instruction encoding instead of
allocating more interesting things on the heap or adding procedure calls.</p>

<p>I am writing this interlude because I changed one register in my compiler code
(<code>kRbp</code> to <code>kRsp</code>) and all hell broke loose — the resulting program was
crashing, <code>rasm2</code>/Cutter were decoding wacky instructions when fed my binary,
etc. Over the span of two very interesting but very frustrating hours, I
learned why I had these problems and how to resolve them. You should learn,
too.</p>

<h3 id="state-of-the-instruction-encoder">State of the instruction encoder</h3>

<p>Recall that I introduced at least 10 functions that looked vaguely like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>Emit_mov_reg_imm32</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>Register</span> <span>dst</span><span>,</span> <span>int32_t</span> <span>src</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kRexPrefix</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0xc7</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0xc0</span> <span>+</span> <span>dst</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write32</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>src</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These functions all purport to encode x86-64 instructions. They do, most of the
time, but they do not tell the whole story. This function is supposed to encode
an instruction of the form <code>mov reg64, imm32</code>. How does it do it? I don’t know!</p>

<p>They have all these magic numbers in them! What is a <code>kRexPrefix</code>? Well, it’s
<code>0x48</code>. Does that mean anything to us? No! It gets worse. What are <code>0xc7</code> and
<code>0xc0</code> doing there? Why are we adding <code>dst</code> to <code>0xc0</code>? Before this debugging
and reading extravaganza, I could not have told you. Remember how somewhere in
a previous post I mentioned I was getting these hex bytes from reading the
compiled output on the Compiler Explorer? Yeah.</p>

<p>As it turns out, this is not a robust development strategy, at least with
x86-64. It might be okay for some more regular or predictable instruction sets,
but not this one.</p>

<h3 id="big-scary-documentation">Big scary documentation</h3>

<p>So where do we go from here? How do we find out how to take these mystical
hexes and incantations to something that better maps to the hardware? Well, we
once again drag <a href="https://tchebb.me/">Tom</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> into a debugging session and pull
out the big ol’ Intel <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html">Software Developer Manual</a>.</p>

<p>This is an enormous 26MB, 5000 page manual comprised of four volumes. It’s
<em>very intimidating</em>. This is exactly why I didn’t want to pull it out earlier
and do this properly from the beginning… but here we are, eventually needing
to do it properly.</p>

<p>I will not pretend to understand all of this manual, nor will this post be a
guide to the manual. I will just explain what sections and diagrams I found
useful in understanding how this stuff works.</p>

<p>I only ever opened Volume 2, the instruction set reference. In that honking
2300 page volume are descriptions of every Intel x86-64 instruction and how
they are encoded. The instructions are listed alphabetically and split into
sections based on the first letter of each instruction name.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at Chapter 3, specifically at the MOV instruction on page
&nbsp; 1209. For those following along who do not want to download a massive
PDF, this <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/index.html">website</a> has a bunch
of the same data in HTML form. Here’s the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mov">page for
MOV</a>.</p>

<p>This page has every variant of MOV instruction. There are other instructions
begin with MOV, like MOVAPD, MOVAPS, etc, but they are different enough that
they are different instructions.</p>

<p>It has six columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Opcode</em>, which describes the layout of the bytes in the instruction stream.
This describes how we’ll encode instructions.</li>
  <li><em>Instruction</em>, which gives a text-assembly-esque representation of the
instruction. This is useful for figuring out which one we actually want to
encode.</li>
  <li><em>Op/En</em>, which stands for “Operand Encoding” and as far as I can tell
describes the operand order with a symbol that is explained further in the
“Instruction Operand Encoding” table on the following page.</li>
  <li><em>64-Bit Mode</em>, which tells you if the instruction can be used in 64-bit mode
(“Valid”) or not (something else, I guess).</li>
  <li><em>Compat/Leg Mode</em>, which tells you if the instruction can be used in some
other mode, which I imagine is 32-bit mode or 16-bit mode. I don’t know. But
it’s not relevant for us.</li>
  <li><em>Description</em>, which provides a “plain English” description of the opcode,
for some definition of the words “plain” and “English”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other instructions have slightly different table layouts, so you’ll have to
work out what the other columns mean.</p>

<p>Here’s a preview of some rows from the table, with HTML courtesy of Felix
Cloutier’s aforementioned web docs:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Opcode</th>
<th>Instruction</th>
<th>Op/En</th>
<th>64-Bit Mode</th>
<th>Compat/Leg Mode</th>
<th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>88 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m8,r8</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r8</em> to <em>r/m8.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>REX + 88 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m8</em><sup>***,</sup><em>r8</em><sup>***</sup></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>N.E.</td>
<td>Move <em>r8</em> to <em>r/m8.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>89 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m16,r16</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r16</em> to <em>r/m16.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>89 /<em>r</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m32,r32</em></td>
<td>MR</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>r32</em> to <em>r/m32.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>C7 /<em>0 id</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m32, imm32</em></td>
<td>MI</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>Move <em>imm32</em> to <em>r/m32.</em></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>REX.W + C7 /<em>0 id</em></td>
<td>MOV <em>r/m64, imm32</em></td>
<td>MI</td>
<td>Valid</td>
<td>N.E.</td>
<td>Move <em>imm32 sign extended to 64-bits</em> to <em>r/m64.</em></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>If you take a look at the last entry in the table, you’ll see <code>REX.W + C7 /0
id</code>. Does that look familiar? Maybe, if you squint a little?</p>

<p>It turns out, that’s the description for encoding the instruction we originally
wanted, and had a bad encoder for. Let’s try and figure out how to use this to
make our encoder better. In order to do that, we’ll need to first understand a
general layout for Intel instructions.</p>

<h3 id="instruction-encoding-big-picture">Instruction encoding, big picture</h3>

<p>All Intel x86-64 instructions follow this general format:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>optional</em> instruction prefix (1 byte)</li>
  <li>opcode (1, 2, or 3 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>if required,</em> Mod-Reg/Opcode-R/M, also known as ModR/M (1 byte)</li>
  <li><em>if required,</em> Scale-Index-Base, also known as SIB (1 byte)</li>
  <li>displacement (1, 2, or 4 bytes, or none)</li>
  <li>immediate data (1, 2, or 4 bytes, or none)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found this information at the very beginning of Volume 2, Chapter 2 (page
527) in a section called “Instruction format for protected mode, real-address
mode, and virtual-8086 mode”.</p>

<p>You, like me, may be wondering about the difference between “optional”, “if
required”, and “…, or none”. I have no explanation, sorry.</p>

<p>I’m going to briefly explain each component here, followed up with a
piece-by-piece dissection of the particular MOV instruction we want, so we get
some hands-on practice.</p>

<h4 id="instruction-prefixes">Instruction prefixes</h4>

<p>There are a couple kind of instruction prefixes, like REX (Section 2.2.1) and
VEX (Section 2.3). We’re going to focus on REX prefixes, since they are needed
for many (most?) x86-64 instructions, and we’re not emitting vector
instructions.</p>

<p>The REX prefixes are used to indicate that an instruction, which might normally
refer to a 32-bit register, should instead refer to a 64-bit register. Also
some other things but we’re mostly concerned with register sizes.</p>

<h4 id="opcode">Opcode</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.2 (page 529) for a brief explanation of opcodes. The
gist is that the opcode is the <em>meat</em> of the instruction. It’s what makes a MOV
a MOV and not a HALT. The other fields all modify the meaning given by this
field.</p>

<h4 id="modrm-and-sib">ModR/M and SIB</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.3 (page 529) for a brief explanation of ModR/M and
SIB bytes. The gist is that they encode what register sources and destinations
to use.</p>

<h4 id="displacement-and-immediates">Displacement and immediates</h4>

<p>Take a look at Section 2.1.4 (page 529) for a brief explanation of displacement
and immediate bytes. The gist is that they encode literal numbers used in the
instructions that don’t encode registers or anything.</p>

<p>If you’re confused, that’s okay. It should maybe get clearer once we get our
hands dirty. Reading all of this information in a vacuum is moderately useless
if it’s your first time dealing with assembly like this, but I included this
section first to help explain how to use the reference.</p>

<h3 id="encoding-piece-by-piece">Encoding, piece by piece</h3>

<p>Got all that? Maybe? No? Yeah, me neither. But let’s forge ahead anyway. Here’s
the instruction we’re going to encode: <code>REX.W + C7 /0 id</code>.</p>

<h4 id="rexw">REX.W</h4>

<p>First, let’s figure out <code>REX.W</code>. According to Section 2.2.1, which explains REX
prefixes in some detail, there are a couple of different prefixes. There’s a
helpful table (Table 2-4, page 535) documenting them. Here’s a bit diagram with
the same information:</p>

<p>In English, and zero-indexed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bits 7-4 are always <code>0b0100</code>.</li>
  <li>Bit 3 is the W prefix. If it’s 1, it means the operands are 64 bits. If it’s
0, “operand size [is] determined by CS.D”. Not sure what that means.</li>
  <li>Bits 2, 1, and 0 are other types of REX prefixes that we may not end up
using, so I am omitting them here. Please read further in the manual if you
are curious!</li>
</ul>

<p>This MOV instruction calls for REX.W, which means this byte will look like
<code>0b01001000</code>, also known as our friend <code>0x48</code>. Mystery number one, solved!</p>

<h4 id="c7">C7</h4>

<p>This is a hexadecimal literal <code>0xc7</code>. It is the <em>opcode</em>. There are a couple of
other entries with the opcode <code>C7</code>, modified by other bytes in the instruction
(ModR/M, SIB, REX, …). Write it to the instruction stream. Mystery number
two, solved!</p>

<h4 id="0">/0</h4>

<p>There’s a snippet in Section 2.1.5 that explains this notation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the instruction does not require a second operand, then the Reg/Opcode
field may be used as an opcode extension. This use is represented by the
sixth row in the tables (labeled “/digit (Opcode)”). Note that values in row
six are represented in decimal form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a little confusing because this operation clearly <em>does</em> have a second
operand, denoted by the “MI” in the table, which shows Operand 1 being
<code>ModRM:r/m (w)</code> and Operand 2 being <code>imm8/16/32/64</code>. I think it’s because it
doesn’t have a second <em>register</em> operand that this space is free — the
immediate is in a different place in the instruction.</p>

<p>In any case, this means that we have to make sure to put decimal <code>0</code> in the
<code>reg</code> part of the ModR/M byte. We’ll see what the ModR/M byte looks like in
greater detail shortly.</p>

<h4 id="id">id</h4>

<p><em>id</em> refers to an immediate <em>double word</em> (32 bits). It’s called a <em>double</em>
word because, a word (<em>iw</em>) is 16 bits. In increasing order of size, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>ib</em>, byte (1 byte)</li>
  <li><em>iw</em>, word (2 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>id</em>, double word (4 bytes)</li>
  <li><em>io</em>, quad word (8 bytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means we have to write our 32-bit value out to the instruction stream.
These notations and encodings are explained further in Section 3.1.1.1 (page
596).</p>

<p>Overall, that means that this instruction will have the …</p></div></div>

<p>I want to take a brief look at various data serialization formats and compare them. Basically the goal is to answer the question, “can we find something better than JSON?” However, note that we are looking at these things for DATA SERIALIZATION, not for config files and stuff, so that’s the goal by which these will be judged.</p>
<p>There’s two orthogonal axes to look at these things under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-describing vs.&nbsp;schema-defined formats</li>
<li>Human readable vs.&nbsp;machine-readable formats</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, whether the type information for a structure is defined in a separate file (a schema) that a receiving program checks against, or whether the message itself contains type information. It’s almost exactly the difference between statically and dynamically typed programming languages. Like programming languages, both have pros and cons, neither of them are always better than the other. The goal of this is to compare apples to apples, so we’re gonna note which category these things fall into but not make value judgements based on them. There’s also fuzzy edges; many self-describing formats optionally have a schema layer too. Similarly, we will not really compare tooling quality; the goal is to look at the intrinsic properties of the formats. The culture surrounding them may be considered though.</p>
<p>This is also important not to conflate with an RPC protocol, though many of these things are used IN RPC protocols. Keep in mind that HTTP/REST interfaces are often just a type of RPC protocol, whether realized that way or not.</p>
<p>Up to date as of October 2020. Doesn’t try to include myriad minor things, ’cause there’s only so much time in the world.</p>

<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a></p>
<p>What everything gets currently compared against. We all know JSON, we all agree it’s Sorta Good Enough but really is kinda crap.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing. (<a href="https://json-schema.org/">https://json-schema.org/</a> exists but does not seem very widely used.) Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">RPC protocol</a> but it also seems lightly used, <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">this</a> might be more general.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to major programming languages – Easy to understand and debug</li>
<li>Simple – Easy to read, write, and understand… at least for simple things. <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">Turns out there’s a lot of gotcha’s though.</a></li>
<li>Pretty compact if minified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is pretty shit – no date/time, no real integers, no real structs, no unions/tuples/etc</li>
<li>Tends to discourage schema’s – “So simple it doesn’t need it”, until it becomes less simple.</li>
<li>No normalized form – fields may be reordered, <em>duplicated</em>, etc. Makes hashing it hard, gotta read whole message to begin verifying it, etc.</li>
<li>No comments – harder to write well than you might think!</li>
<li>No good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>
<p><a href="https://yaml.org/">https://yaml.org/</a></p>
<p>Started out as a simpler alternative to XML.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Lots of people</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaguely simple to read and write, in its basic form</li>
<li>Low visual noise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Way too complicated – they made it a strict superset of JSON for some damn reason, and nobody uses that form, so it’s just a pile of wasted effort</li>
<li>Reference impl incomplete, other impl’s disagree with each other and the spec</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xml">XML</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</a></p>
<p>Not sure anyone really knows how XML happened. It’s basically the W3C’s fault, I think? It’s okay for some things but in the end I’m not sure it’s something anyone actually <em>wants</em> to use, it’s just going to be one more of those mistakes of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing with common schema usage. Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">RPC protocol</a> and many other complicated things.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone who can’t avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promotes schemas and validation</li>
<li>Simple to use for simple things</li>
<li>Actually pretty decent for documents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve never gotten schemas and validation to actually work in practice</li>
<li>Everything is string-ly typed</li>
<li>No real arrays</li>
<li>Complicated as frig</li>
<li>Very verbose</li>
<li>There’s like 3-4 different ways to do everything</li>
<li>Still no good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protobuf">Protobuf</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/</a></p>
<p>aka Protocol Buffers, but that’s a pretty dumb name. Google’s common, fast on-the-wire serialization format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Has an <a href="https://grpc.io/">RPC protocol</a> built around it.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, basically everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Basically reasonable</li>
<li>Now has some support for versioning schemas, though it’s a hard problem in general</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Not particularly simple</li>
<li>Wire protocol may be more work than it needs to be</li>
<li>Its type system <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html">could maybe be better</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capn-proto">Cap’n Proto</h2>
<p><a href="https://capnproto.org/">https://capnproto.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other Binary Serialization Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC, which is built in to the reference implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> sandstorm.io, Cloudflare?, various other people but it doesn’t seem like that many</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be fast</li>
<li>Made by one of the people who worked heavily on Protobuf at Google, so <a href="https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-required-like-in-protocol-buffers">there’s lots of experience behind it</a>. That said, doesn’t mean this cat’s always <em>right</em>, but there’s certainly opinions that are trying to be expressed.</li>
<li>Sophisticated RPC comes as part of the standard package</li>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
<li>Adorable name</li>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
<li>Lots of the docs and concepts are pretty low level, you usually ain’t gonna need it</li>
<li>Seems more complicated than protobuf – this might be one reason there’s fewer 3rd-party implementations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thrift">Thrift</h2>
<p><a href="https://thrift.apache.org/">https://thrift.apache.org/</a></p>
<p>Apache’s version of Protobuf. Does anyone actually use this? Facebook, apparently, since they invented it and then gave it to Apache. Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Basically mostly Facebook? Twitter and AirBNB also apparently use it, so apparently it’s not UNpopular.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It works?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Docs suck</li>
<li>Apache is the tragic junkyard of open source projects</li>
<li>Apparently still not as good as flatbuffers, see below</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flatbuffers">Flatbuffers</h2>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/</a></p>
<p>Feels a little like Google’s answer to Cap’n Proto, as it has some of the same design goals – zero-copy serialization and layouts that are more amenable to versioning.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Includes RPC protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, Cocos2D, Facebook’s mobile client</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda feels like the problem is already solved by capnp</li>
<li>Includes a JSON parser for some reason?</li>
<li>Type system is kinda anemic with regards to unions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cbor">CBOR</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbor.io/">https://cbor.io/</a></p>
<p>Basically a binary re-imagining of JSON.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> ???</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty good type system – there’s things like fixnum’s, datetime’s, blobs, etc</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Built-in extensibility</li>
<li>Designed to be a drop-in replacement for JSON</li>
<li>IETF standard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda more complicated than it needs to be, though this is for the sake of compactness and comprehensive types. Numbers are densely packed into fewer bits when possible, for example.</li>
<li>Doesn’t actually seem that widely adopted for some reason?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="msgpack">Msgpack</h2>
<p><a href="https://msgpack.org/">https://msgpack.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other CBOR, or rather, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14067747">CBOR is derived from this</a>. Designed to be simple and compact. Kinda a <em>lot</em> like a slightly chopped down CBOR, actually, their integer specification stuff looks nearly identical.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Redis, a few others?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Compact</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specification is kinda weak</li>
<li>No real tuple or enum types</li>
<li>Why not just CBOR?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bson">BSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://bsonspec.org/">http://bsonspec.org/</a></p>
<p>As the name implies, a binary-ifcation of JSON. Created by MongoDB as its internal data format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> MongoDB</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit but is reasonably pragmatic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is reasonably pragmatic but is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit</li>
<li><strong>C strings</strong> – though there’s random non-C strings in places as well.</li>
<li>Its arrays are a travesty against serializarion</li>
<li>Basically an implementation detail of MongoDB, and it looks like it</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that are interesting but not actually in the scope of serialization languages, or are otherwise irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="toml">TOML</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">https://github.com/toml-lang/toml</a></p>
<p>Invalid, it’s designed as a config language, not a serialization format. It’s basically an attempt to make something as simple and ubiquitous as windows .INI files that is an actual specification rather than a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Various, notably Cargo (Rust’s build tool)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work well as a config language without deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Works poorly when you try to make deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ron">RON</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">https://github.com/ron-rs/ron</a></p>
<p>Rusty Object Notation. Because shoehorning Rust’s ML-y type systeminto JSON isn’t very much fun. Works startlingly well for this purpose but is basically untried elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> A few, notably <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">Amethyst</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good type system for sophisticated functional-style languages</li>
<li>Simple and reasonably compact</li>
<li>Actually very good at what it does</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Young, underspecified, Rust-centric</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bincode">Bincode</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">https://github.com/servo/bincode</a></p>
<p>Included mainly for completeness. It’s not standardized outside of a single particular implementation which doesn’t promise stability, so not intended for general-purpose use. It’s intended as a fast and easy RPC/IPC format for Servo, and the actual format is basically an implementation detail of that goal.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Servo, programs written by introverts who don’t care about being able to talk to each other. (Turns out this is a useful niche though, who knew.)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, fast, simple.</li>
<li>Works basically transparently for IPC with Rust code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anything other than that specific version of that specific library is …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I come across questions on how to get started in programming often. People are hungry to learn, but don’t know where to start or which path to take. This is made even more difficult these days due to a lot of different areas that exist, such as web development, mobile software development, game development etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although we live at a time when tutorials and lessons are abundant, a lot of it can feel overwhelming. What you need is a roadmap to navigate the topics. You want a structure to guide you in your learning. A lot of coding bootcamps follow an approach similar to a college curriculum. Working through these curriculums is frustrating because you don’t feel like you are learning anything substantial quickly enough. College curriculum is great if your goal is to get a certificate or a degree. They are not great if your goal is to learn the practical skills of software engineering.</p>



<p>Following is a roadmap that I have put together to help you guide yourself in learning how to program. Your mileage with this will depend on your current experience with coding. These days though, I expect a lot of people to have had some exposure to very basic coding concepts such as loops, if statements etc. Spending any more time on these concepts may not be worthwhile. What you want is a road map that gets you on your way to building things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here it is, my recommended roadmap for learning how to build software:</p>



<h2>1. Start with Web Development</h2>



<p>As I had mentioned, there are many different areas of software development that you could focus on. I recommend starting with Web Development because it has the quickest feedback loop. This will help you improve fast and learn various concepts quickly. Principles learnt here can then be applied to other areas that you may be interested in such as mobile app development or game development.</p>



<p>When learning web app programming, you will be required to pick up HTML, CSS and Javascript. These are core languages for building web apps. But what you want to spend more time and focus on is the backend server system. The backend systems are responsible for providing the data APIs that support your application. Principles that you learn building good backend systems will provide you with a strong software engineering foundation.</p>



<p>For the backend, you will primarily work with either PHP, Python, Java or Ruby. Pick any one that you feel comfortable with. I recommend Python or Ruby to start.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Prioritize building an end-to-end application first</strong></h2>



<p>One of the key principles for effective learning is to focus on depth first. Instead of learning a lot of concepts across the breadth of the topics, I recommend going deep into one specific area. In this case, I suggest focusing on building a simple end-to-end application first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will get a general idea of what it is like to build something from scratch. More importantly, you will feel great having a built a working app. The feeling of satisfaction from the progress will motivate and propel you forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point you are ready to unpack and dive deeper into various aspects of what you have built. </p>











<h2><strong>3. Dive deep into the principles of software architecture</strong></h2>



<p>Once you have built an end-to-end app you will find that learning a couple of frameworks and libraries will be enough to keep you going. Most coding bootcamps stop here. But this stops short of diving into the richer and more rewarding world of software engineering. </p>



<p>I recommend spending time learning software design principles, object oriented programming and various systems architecture patterns. You will learn the details of how to cleanly and effectively work with databases, how to structure your code to enable more complex systems, different design patterns and architectures. </p>



<p>Software architecture&nbsp;principles&nbsp;are timeless and will support you throughout your entire career. </p>



<p>Some great books I can recommend here are:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321127420/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0321127420&amp;linkId=4962a37ba12a94696993ef4f54eca9fa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0132350882&amp;linkId=20953e9f7d1dd550a5b402f355cfc2a1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clean Code</a></p>



<h2><strong>4. Data structure and&nbsp;algorithms are super important</strong></h2>



<p>The importance of algorithms in software engineering can be surprisingly controversial. This is perhaps due to Silicon Valley tech companies relying on them in the interview process. It’s true that many professional software developers never look back at the algorithms that they vaguely learn in college.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s unfortunate. The reality is that deep knowledge of algorithms, just like software architecture are foundational requirements if you want to excel as a software engineer at the highest level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Check out the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201657880/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201657880&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mkngsmlrcrcls-20&amp;linkId=0eb37d6439098ac088b44d65937d4143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Programming Pearls</a> for some great practical thinking on this).<br></p>



<hr>



<p><strong><br></strong>I hope this roadmap gives you some sense of the various aspects that you can focus on to learn programming and launch a career in software engineering. I have not provided a time estimate here since your progress will vary. Learning something new and complex takes time. If you stick with it, a rewarding career is waiting for you on the other side.</p>

This is important to be able to develop applications on a local machine and have them run as expected in a deployed environment. It's also important for developers to be able to run applications as expected on any computer to get up and running quickly and collaborate with other developers no matter how they've configured their computer.</p><p>The reason why running applications on different machines is so difficult is that all the right versions of an application's dependencies must be installed for it to run as expected. For example, if trying to run an API that is built with Node.js, and it was developed and tested on a machine using Node.js 12.8, it might not necessarily run the same on a machine that has Node.js version 10.18 installed. The same goes for any other dependency used in applications, such as python, ruby, php, typescript, nginx, apache, mysql, postgres, etc. Docker makes it possible to build containerized applications that hold the right versions of all dependencies and can run as intended on different machines.</p><p>Docker has 4 types of "objects" it uses to be able to create these isolated environments: <strong>images</strong>, <strong>containers</strong>, <strong>volumes</strong>, and <strong>networks</strong>. The two objects users will most often be directly working with are Docker <strong>images</strong> and Docker <strong>containers</strong>.</p><p><span>

A Docker <em>image</em> can be thought of as the blueprints and code used by a Docker <em>container</em>. Docker images can be saved to image registries for others to download the images. The most popular Docker image registry is <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker Hub</a>. You can think of image registries as the NPM equivalent for Docker images.</p><p>Read more about Docker images and containers in the <em><a href="#docker-images">Docker images</a></em> and <em><a href="#docker-containers">Docker containers</a></em> sections of the guide, respectively.</p><p><strong>Docker volumes</strong> are used to persist data that is generated by running Docker containers. By saving data to a Docker volume, it will permit an application to have the same data even if the Docker container has been removed, recreated, or restarted. Docker volumes are also useful if two different containers should have access to the same data since both containers can point to the same volume.</p><p><strong>Docker networks</strong> are used to make sure containers are isolated from each other and are also used to allow containers to communicate with each other.</p><p>Read more about Docker volumes and networks in the <em><a href="#docker-volumes">Docker volumes</a></em> and <em><a href="#docker-networks">Docker networks</a></em> sections of the guide, respectively.</p><div><p>Resources 📝</p><p>Related resources</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>"Docker Overview"</em></a> from the official Docker documentation</li></ul></div><h2 id="what-about-virtual-machines"><a href="#what-about-virtual-machines" aria-label="what about virtual machines permalink"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" strokelinecap="round" strokelinejoin="round"><line x1="4" y1="9" x2="20" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" y1="15" x2="20" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" y1="3" x2="8" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" y1="3" x2="14" y2="21"></line></svg></a>What about virtual machines?</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtual machines</a> (VMs) often come up in the same conversation as Docker since they are both be used to create isolated environments.</p><p>With Docker, applications run in isolated environments called containers and each one of these containers share the same operating system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kernel</a> on a machine.

Docker handles this for you if you install the Docker Desktop app for Mac OS or Windows, which ships with <a href="https://github.com/Linuxkit/Linuxkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinuxKit</a>: a lightweight Linux kernel that runs on Mac OS or Windows operating systems and is used by the Docker engine. The lightweight Linux kernel sits on a hypervisor that ships natively with Windows (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/41556921/8360496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reference</a>) and Mac OS (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/55085366/8360496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reference</a>).</p><p><img src="https://www.robertcooper.me/images/docker-on-Linux-windows-mac.jpg" alt="Docker hardware and software breakdown on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows OS"></p></div><p>The advantages of using Docker over virtual machines overwhelmingly tip the scales in favor of using Docker. Compared to virtual machines, Docker containers can get up in running within seconds compared to minutes, are lightweight (magnitude of MBs compared to GBs), are easily configurable, and use a small amount of resources. Perhaps the only reason to use a virtual machine over docker is if a high level of isolation is desired because of concerns about security vulnerabilities associated with having Docker containers using a shared kernel on the host operating system.</p><h2 id="docker-engine"><a href="#docker-engine" aria-label="docker engine permalink"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" strokelinecap="round" strokelinejoin="round"><line x1="4" y1="9" x2="20" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" y1="15" x2="20" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" y1="3" x2="8" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" y1="3" x2="14" y2="21"></line></svg></a>Docker engine</h2><p>The Docker engine needs to be installed and running on any machine that wants to do anything related to Docker. Starting the engine means that a long-running background process (the Docker daemon which also corresponds with the <code>dockerd</code> command) gets started to create a server that can be interacted with via a REST API. The Docker CLI is the way most people interact with the REST API to manage Docker objects, but 3rd party apps are also able to interact <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">directly with the REST API</a> or via <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker engine SDKs</a>.</p><p><span>

For example, if building a python based API, a base image that is made up of a Linux OS with python installed on it can be used. After specifying a base image, other instructions are used that can specify the following details on how to the Docker image should be built:</p><ul><li>Environment variables to set in a container</li><li>Ports exposed by the image</li><li>Which files should be copied into the image</li><li>Which dependencies should be installed</li><li>Command to be executed when starting a container (e.g. <code>yarn start</code> if starting a Node.js API)</li><li>And more...</li></ul><p>As an example, an image for a Node.js API might have a <code>Dockerfile</code> similar to the following:</p><div><p>Dockerfile</p><div><pre data-language="Dockerfile"><p><span>1</span><span># Base image that has Node version 12.16.1 installed on a Linux OS.</span></p><p><span>2</span><span># This is an alpine Linux image that is smaller than the non-alpine Linux equivalent images.</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>FROM node:12.16.1-alpine3.11</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span># Installs some dependencies required for the Node.js API</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>RUN apk add --no-cache make g++</span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span># Indicates that the API exposes port 3000</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>EXPOSE 3000</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span># Specifies the working directory.

					<p>About <time datetime="2005-08">15 or so years ago</time>, I was changing jobs.

								and Cool Plex, which looked a lot of meta-code and what I now know to be <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7839826">RDF Triples</a>
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>At my new job, I was writing web-facing applications using open source technology and deploying to Linux.  I needed to find an editor to help me with the task.</p>
					<p>I spent a bit of time exploring my options.  During that exploration, I learned of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> from <a href="https://www.oddbird.net/authors/carl/">Carl Meyer</a>.<span><ins role="note">
								Carl is a friend of mine from high school, and has contributed a lot to the world.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>At the time I had three young children, I had just changed jobs, changed programming languages, and couldn’t wrap my head around Emacs.  I wanted my editor to behave like other <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Graphical User Interface" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GUI">↑</a></sup>
						applications.</p>
					<p>I didn’t take the time to walk through the Emacs tutorial, and left Emacs behind.</p>
					<p>A few months into my new job, I switched languages and paradigms again.  In <time datetime="2005-12-03">December 2005</time>, my company hopped in a van and drove to Chicago to learn about <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q842014" title="Django: Python Web Framework">Django</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Django: Python Web Framework" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-DJANGO">↑</a></sup>
						and <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190478" title="Ruby on Rails: Open Source Web Application Framework">Ruby on Rails</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Ruby on Rails: Open Source Web Application Framework" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ROR">↑</a></sup>
						.  Within a week, our organization adopted Ruby on Rails.</p>
					<p>At that time, I adopted <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2297533" title="Textmate">Textmate</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Textmate" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-TEXTMATE">↑</a></sup>
						as my editor.  It had a beautiful user-interface and required little effort to learn.<span><ins role="note">
								I wasn’t aware of how useful a shell environment could be; In the years I’d learn more.  I had, during my professional life, often relied on GUI views into files, systems, and processes.  So I didn’t have a mental model that would have further nudged me towards an integrated text editor.  And in my hubris, I didn’t step through the Emacs tutorial.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>At the time Textmate was closed source. I used it and loved it, but it began to lag.<span><ins role="note">
								The search a project function started misbehaving and gridning projects to a halt.
							</ins></span>
						I found <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q267193" title="Sublime Text: A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose">Sublime Text</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Sublime Text: A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-SUBLIME">↑</a></sup>
						and switched.  At the time, Sublime was positioning as a Textmate replacement.</p>
					<p>Then, as I engaged more and more in open source projects, I started wanting an open source text editor.  I learned about Atom in 2015.  It was open source and acted enough like Sublime, that I switched.<span><ins role="note">
								During this time, I dabbled with <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131382" title="Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor">vim</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-VIM">↑</a></sup>
								.  However, the modal nature of editing felt foreign.  At times, I’d try out a tutorial, but it never stuck.  I also thought about revising Textmate as the owner later released it as open source.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>Forward to <time datetime="2020-03">earlier this year</time>.  I had begun noticing more and more bugs and breaks in Atom.  Not one to fear changing editors, I started looking.</p>
					<p>I also gave <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19841877" title="Visual Studio Code">VS Code</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Visual Studio Code" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-VSC">↑</a></sup>
						a spin, and found it disconcerting.  First, it felt constraining and off-putting. The configuration ecosystem felt clunky. The plugins felt like an App Store. Everything felt like VS Code was trying to obfuscate it’s underlying systems.</p>
					<ins role="note">
						<p>Years ago, I started aspiring to write most of my commit messages following <a href="https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">Tim Pope’s guidance on commit messages</a>.  To this day, I try to write meaningful commit messages, knowing that these commit messages will most often be close to the code.</p>
						<p>Some may put that information in a pull request message on Github or Gitlab, but that information does not remain close to the code. However, that information is now inextricably tied to the details of Github. When I want to spelunk through my code, I don’t want to have to go to Github to get a view into what happened. I want my <code>git annotate</code> and <code>git log</code> to carry as much meaning as possible.</p>
					</ins>
					<p>The proverbial last straw was the <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q186055" title="Git: Free and open source revision control software">git</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Git: Free and open source revision control software" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GIT">↑</a></sup>
						prompt for commit messages.  The prompt was a small input box; It didn’t encourage meaningful commit messages. Instead it encouraged terse commits. That feature alone told me that people using it will be encouraged to write bad commit messages. I didn’t want to be that guy with my text editor.</p>
					<p>So, I spent a bit of time again testing <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131382" title="Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor">vim</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-VIM">↑</a></sup>
						and Emacs.</p>
					<p>I again tried <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131382" title="Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor">vim</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Improved version of the Vi keyboard-oriented text editor" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-VIM">↑</a></sup>
						but it felt off.<span><ins role="note">
								I use Vim when I shell out to a server.  I haven’t done it much recently, because I’d likely use Emacs’s <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode">Tramp mode</a>.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>I tried Emacs, and worked my way through the Tutorial.  It was the strong commitment to the Tutorial and honestly the writing of that tutorial that nudged me to dive further in.  I spent some time fiddling with Doom or Spacemacs, but in the end settled on bare metal Emacs.</p>
					<p>This proved crucial.  As someone that’s used text editors for 15+ years, I know the features I’ve used. What I chose to do in Emacs was to complete the tutorial and start coding.</p>
					<p>If I found myself wanting a feature, I took note of it.  Then, I went and found the package or packages that implemented the feature.<span><ins role="note">
								I spent quite a bit of time reading through <a href="https://melpa.org/">Melpa</a>, looking for a package. What happened is that I have built up my own editor that meets my needs.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>Now, 5 months or so in, I’m fully loving the experience. The community of Emacs developers seem to have a higher commitment to writing documentation.<span><ins role="note">
								Many Emacs developers write their configuration files using the paradigm of <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q607703">Literate Programming</a>.  In other words, they first write down their intentions for the software, then write the software.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<h2 id="org-mode">Org Mode</h2>
					<p><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> is the missing piece for my past text editors. <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93149769">Carstin Dominik</a> took the time to build out functionality for organizing the non-coding tasks of software development, research, and writing.<span><ins role="note">
								Were I to begin my blog anew, I’d leverage <code>org-mode</code> and <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">ox-hugo</a> for blogging.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>Org Mode layers meaningful tools on top of plain text files; The syntax is close to Markdown, but different enough. The simplicity of structure makes the world of difference. With the plain text, I can run low-level Unix commands (e.g. <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, etc.) but also have higher level programmatic access to the data.</p>
					<h2 id="magit">Magit</h2>
					<p>Prior to <a href="https://magit.vc/">magit</a>, I almost always used command line tools for <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q186055" title="Git: Free and open source revision control software">git</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of Git: Free and open source revision control software" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GIT">↑</a></sup>
						. My previous workflow would be to use Terminal to state my git commits, and then my text editor to write commit messages.<span><ins role="note">
								Atom’s slowness to open as a commit message editor was another reason I left Atom.  I don’t want to wait multiple seconds to start writing a commit message.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>Except for reading git logs, I now do most all git tasks with Magit.  That includes an <strong>amazing</strong> interactive <code>git rebase</code> environment.</p>
					<h2 id="fill-paragraph">Fill Paragraph</h2>
					<p>I must mention this lowly command.</p>
					<p>When Carl introduced me to Emacs, he showed me <code>fill-paragraph</code>. That functionality stuck with me. It’s nothing fancy, but it shows that Emacs treats column-width as a first class citizen.</p>
					<p>And why is column width important?  First, <a href="https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">re-read the note about commit message</a>.</p>
					<p>Conforming to that structure helps ensure that your <code>git log</code> excursions are not unduly messy.  It also helps if you’re going to interact with the command-line.  In other words, automatic word-wrapping is nice, but its not universal, nor does it work in all contexts.</p>
					<p>I have used this command to quickly wrap documentation so as to not have it flow off the screen.<span><ins role="note">
								For coding buffers, I disable word wrapping.  I also aspire to 120 character line width for code and 80 character line width for comments.  Why the variance?  Comments should read more like prose, and long running lines make the paragraphs harder to read.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>It ain’t much of a command, but I’ve held a candle for it since I learned about Emacs.</p>
					<h2 id="swiper">Swiper</h2>
					<p>I never knew I wanted Swiper until I stumbled onto it.  I now use it <em>all of the time</em>; It’s even replaced my default Find behavior in Emacs.</p>
					<p>What does it do? I type Control+S<span><ins role="note">
								In Emacs parlance, that’s <code>C-s</code>
							</ins></span>
						and start typing a word.  In a mini-buffer at the bottom of the current buffer, I see the lines that include that word.  It’s a bit like a find with context.  Importantly, this doesn’t move my cursor in the main buffer.</p>
					<p>So I end up quickly referencing something and get back to typing.  Or, I can navigate through the mini-buffer and jump to that location in the main buffer.  Quite slick.</p>
					<h2 id="wgrep-ag">WGrep-Ag</h2>
					<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep/blob/master/wgrep-ag.el">wgrep-ag</a> package sort of blew my mind. It allows you to use <abbr itemprop="mentions" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Thing" itemid="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher" title="The Silver Search (ag)">ag</abbr> <sup><a aria-label="Other references of The Silver Search (ag)" href="https://takeonrules.com/more/glossary/#abbr-dfn-AG">↑</a></sup>
						with <a href="https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep">wgrep</a> to edit search results</p>
					<p>Follow along carefully:</p>
					<p>In Emacs, I search a project using <code>ag</code>.  Emacs renders the search results in a mini-buffer. In this case, the mini-buffer is a small set of rows at the bottom of Emacs that show a subset of the results.</p>
					<p>With the mini-buffer active (e.g. I’ve been typing results there), I invoke <code>ivy-occur</code>.  That function opens all of the search results in a read-only buffer.<span><ins role="note">
								While I was writing this example, I thought to myself “I wonder if I can use <code>ivy-occur</code> from Swiper results?  Yes I can.  So I learned something while explaining something.
							</ins></span>
					</p>
					<p>With this new buffer, I invoke the function <code>wgrep-change-to-wgrep-mode</code>.  This toggles <code>ivy-occur</code> buffer into an edit mode.  I begin editing the search results as though it were it’s own file.</p>
					<p>Then I save the edits, and <code>wgrep-ag</code> writes all of those changes back to the found results.</p>
					<p>Another way to think of it, <code>wgrep-ag</code> loads a semi-structured buffer. Each row has three fields: file name, line number, and line text.  I can use <code>wgrep-ag</code> to write those changes back to the originating file.</p>
					<p>Seriously, this functionality amazes me.</p>
					<h2 id="multiple-cursors">Multiple Cursors</h2>
					<p>Textmate first introduced me to this powerful concept.  Since then, this functionality has been a mandatory feature of my editors.</p>
					<p>Two packages help deliver on this:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<a href="https://github.com/victorhge/iedit">iedit</a> - by default, if I type Control+<code>;</code> (e.g. <code>C-;</code>), the iedit package highlights each occurence of the word. I can now type and iedit updates all occurrences.</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el">multiple-cursors</a> - this package provides finer grain control, and allows me to set a cursor on ten contiguous lines …</li></ol></section></div>

      Change the frame acceleration:

    <p>
      Move the time window: 
    </p>
    

    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
    Under general relativity, gravity is not a force. Instead it is a distortion of spacetime. Objects in free-fall move along geodesics (straight lines) in spacetime, as seen in the inertial frame of reference on the right. When standing on Earth we experience a frame of reference that is accelerating upwards, causing objects in free-fall to move along parabolas, as seen on the left.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this system there is only one space dimension, shown on the vertical axis and labeled in meters. The time dimension is the horizontal axis and labeled in seconds. The gravitational field is constant within the area of interest. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Use the first slider to change the acceleration of the frame of reference in the middle. When the frame has zero acceleration it is said to be an inertial frame of reference.
    </p>

    <p>
    Use the second slider to move the time window. Note that all the trajectories remain as straight lines in the inertial frame of reference.
    </p>

<h2 id="rule-110">Rule 110</h2>
<p>After reading Chris Penner's blog post on <a href="https://chrispenner.ca/posts/conways-game-of-life">Conway's Game Of Life Using Representable and Comonads</a>, I decided to implement a similar solution for the 1 dimensional automata <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110">Rule 110</a>. Being such a simple algorithm I thought the implementation would be trivial. However, it turns out that working with arbitarily bounded spaces in the <code>Store Comonad</code> requires a clever use of dependent types to apply memoizaition as described in Chris' blog.</p>
<p>This blog post walks through my experience attempting to use <code>Store</code>, <code>Representable</code> in Haskell to implement Rule 110, difficulty finding a suitable <code>Representable</code> instance, and then a pivot to Idris where I was able to solve the problem using the finite set type <code>Fin n</code>.</p>
<p>The Rule 110 algorithm takes a vector of boolean values and applies a simple set of rules for transforming each index based upon its neighbors. You can think of it as a 1 dimensional variant of Conway's Game of Life, but with the twist that the first and last element of the vector are considered neighbors. In other words, the automata in Rule 110 exists on a circle rather then a line segment.</p>
<p>Here is the rubric for generating the new state for a given element:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Current Pattern</td>
<td>111</td>
<td>110</td>
<td>101</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>011</td>
<td>010</td>
<td>001</td>
<td>000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>New State</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This post assumes no prior knowledge of Comonads, Representable Functors, <code>Fin n</code>. The first few sections are intended to introduce these concepts by focusing on the actual implementations of their APIs.</p>
<h2 id="the-store-type-and-its-api">The Store Type and its API</h2>
<p>The <code>Store</code> type can be thought of as a way to query some indexable state along with a cursor that queries into the store at some index.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> a) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p>State is held implicitly in your query function and, as we shall see later, can be transformed through composition.</p>
<p>As an example, we can construct a <code>Store</code> whose implicit state is an infinite list of Booleans which we index into with an Integer:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>initialStore ::</span> <span>Store</span> <span>Int</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>initialStore <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> query <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>    <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a><span>      query ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>      query i <span>=</span> (<span>cycle</span> [<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>]) <span>!!</span> <span>abs</span> i</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Store</code> API then allows us to do things like query arbitrary indices, shift around our cursor, and through its <code>Functor</code> and <code>Comonad</code> instances to perform transformations on the implicit state held inside the query function.</p>
<p>Lets walk through the implementation of this API to gain a better intuition.</p>
<p>First we need a getter to lookup the current index:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>pos ::</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> s</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>pos (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> s</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we want a way to query the <code>Store</code>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>peek ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>peek s (<span>Store</span> query _) <span>=</span> query s</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>peeks ::</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> s) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a>peeks f (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> query (f s)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>peek</code> disregards the current cursor and instead applies a new cursor to the store's query function. <code>peeks</code> uses a function <code>s -&gt;
  s</code> to modify the current cursor and then query the store with the new cursor.</p>
<p>We would also like a way to set and shift our cursor index:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>seek ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>seek s (<span>Store</span> query _) <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> query s</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span>seeks ::</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> s) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a>seeks f (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> query (f s)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This covers are basic getters and setters, but what if we wanted a way to query multiple indices into our store?</p>
<p>We might write this function:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>peekMany ::</span> [s] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a>peekMany xs store <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> (<span>flip</span> peek store) xs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This function looks pretty good, but notice we are using <code>fmap</code>. We can take advantage of polymorphism here allow use use of any <code>Functor</code>:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>peekFunctor ::</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> f s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>peekFunctor fs store <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> (<span>flip</span> peek store) fs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can use any <code>Functor</code> we want, but notice how we aren't using our cursor at all. This is a clue that we might be able to generalize this function further.</p>
<p>It would be great if we could modify <code>peekFunctor</code> to use our cursor value without losing the current behavior of the function.</p>
<p>If we replace the <code>f s</code> parameter with a function <code>s -&gt; f s</code> then we could apply the current cursor to our function and generate an <code>f
  s</code> to generate our <code>f a</code> output. Then if we want the precise behavior of <code>peekFunctor</code> we can simply apply <code>const (x :: f s)</code> and ignore the current cursor!</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>experiment ::</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> f s) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> f a</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>experiment f store <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> (<span>flip</span> peek store) (f (pos store))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To recap our <code>Store</code> API we have:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>pos ::</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span>peek ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a><span>peeks ::</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> s) <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a><span>seek ::</span> s <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a><span>seeks ::</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> s) <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a><span>experiment ::</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (s <span>-&gt;</span> f s) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> f a</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="transformation-of-state">Transformation of State</h2>
<p>The state of the system is stored implicitely inside the <code>s -&gt; a</code> query function rather then in some data structure. Because of this, the only way to modify the state would be to modify the query function itself.</p>
<p>We can do this by first querying the current store to get an <code>a</code> value and then apply some <code>a -&gt; b</code> function to the value to produce a modified version of the state at that index.</p>
<p>We can do this by pattern matching on our <code>Store</code> then composing an <code>a -&gt; b</code> function with our query function:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>updateStoreState ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s b</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>updateStoreState f (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (f <span>.</span> query) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>updateStoreState</code> allows you to modify the query result for all possible values inside the Store's implicit state. This signature shoud look familiar as it is <code>fmap</code> and <code>Store</code> is in fact a <code>Functor</code>.</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> (<span>Store</span> s) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2"></a><span>    fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s b</span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3"></a>    <span>fmap</span> f (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (f <span>.</span> query) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can model successive transformations of the state through applications of <code>fmap</code>. For example, using the <code>Store Int Bool</code> example from earlier, we might want to apply <code>not :: Bool -&gt; Bool</code> to invert the state of our system:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span>initialStore ::</span> <span>Store</span> <span>Int</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2"></a>initialStore <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> query <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3"><a href="#cb12-3"></a>    <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb12-4"><a href="#cb12-4"></a>      query i <span>=</span> (<span>cycle</span> [<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>]) <span>!!</span> i</span>
<span id="cb12-5"><a href="#cb12-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb12-6"><a href="#cb12-6"></a><span>newState ::</span> <span>Store</span> <span>Int</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb12-7"><a href="#cb12-7"></a>newState <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> <span>not</span> initialStore</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using equational reasoning we can translate that into:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1"></a>newState <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> <span>not</span> initialStore</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2"></a>         <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> <span>not</span> (<span>Store</span> query s)</span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3"></a>         <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (<span>not</span> <span>.</span> query) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using this technique to model 3 manipulations of a system shows how each modification to the implicit state builds up a larger composed query function:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1"></a><span>newState ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> (b <span>-&gt;</span> c) <span>-&gt;</span> (c <span>-&gt;</span> d) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s b</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><a href="#cb14-2"></a>newState h g f store <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> f (<span>fmap</span> g (<span>fmap</span> h store))</span>
<span id="cb14-3"><a href="#cb14-3"></a>                     <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> f (<span>fmap</span> g (<span>fmap</span> h (<span>Store</span> query s)))</span>
<span id="cb14-4"><a href="#cb14-4"></a>                     <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> f (<span>fmap</span> g (<span>Store</span> (h <span>.</span> query) s))</span>
<span id="cb14-5"><a href="#cb14-5"></a>                     <span>=</span> <span>fmap</span> f (<span>Store</span> (g <span>.</span> h <span>.</span> query) s)</span>
<span id="cb14-6"><a href="#cb14-6"></a>                     <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (f <span>.</span> g <span>.</span> h <span>.</span> query) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p>While elegant, modeling state transformations as function composition means that every time we query an index in a <code>Store</code>, we must recalculate every single previous transformation going back to the original <code>Store</code> query. Without caching these intermediate computations this will get very expensive.</p>
<p>Luckily, Chris Penner showed us a fantastic solution for this using Representable Functors. We will look at <code>Representable</code> shortly, but for now lets ignore the performance issue and focus on the tools we need to naively implement Rule 110.</p>
<h2 id="extending-our-api-with-comonad">Extending our API with Comonad</h2>
<p>Not only is <code>Store</code> a <code>Functor</code>, it is also a <code>Comonad</code>.</p>
<p><code>Comonads</code> are the dual of <code>Monads</code>. Where <code>Monads</code> introduce some effect to an argument via the form <code>a -&gt; m b</code>, <code>Comonads</code> introduce a notion of querying a structure for data (co-effects):</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1"></a><span>-- Monadic</span></span>
<span id="cb15-2"><a href="#cb15-2"></a>a <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb15-3"><a href="#cb15-3"></a><span>repeat</span><span> ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb15-4"><a href="#cb15-4"></a><span>-- Comonadic</span></span>
<span id="cb15-5"><a href="#cb15-5"></a>w a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb15-6"><a href="#cb15-6"></a><span>length</span><span> ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Comonad</code> Typeclass has three functions:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1"></a><span>class</span> <span>Functor</span> w <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Comonad</span> w <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"><a href="#cb16-2"></a><span>    extract   ::</span> w a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb16-3"><a href="#cb16-3"></a><span>    duplicate ::</span> w a <span>-&gt;</span> w (w a)</span>
<span id="cb16-4"><a href="#cb16-4"></a><span>    extend    ::</span> (w a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> w a <span>-&gt;</span> w b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice the inverse relation to <code>return</code>, <code>join</code>, and <code>(=&lt;&lt;)</code> from <code>Monad</code>:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1"></a><span>extract ::</span> w a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><a href="#cb17-2"></a><span>return</span><span>  ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb17-3"><a href="#cb17-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb17-4"><a href="#cb17-4"></a><span>duplicate ::</span> w a     <span>-&gt;</span> w (w a)</span>
<span id="cb17-5"><a href="#cb17-5"></a><span>join      ::</span> m (m a) <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb17-6"><a href="#cb17-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb17-7"><a href="#cb17-7"></a><span>extend ::</span> (w a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> w a <span>-&gt;</span> w b</span>
<span id="cb17-8"><a href="#cb17-8"></a><span>(=&lt;&lt;)  ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m b) <span>-&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> m b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If a defining characteristic of <code>Comonads</code> in Haskell is to provide a mechanism for querying some structure for data, then we can almost definitionally say that <code>Store</code> is a <code>Comonad</code>. <code>Store</code> is literally a mechnanism for querying a structure to produce data!</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1"></a><span>instance</span> <span>Comonad</span> (<span>Store</span> s) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb18-2"><a href="#cb18-2"></a><span>    extract ::</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb18-3"><a href="#cb18-3"></a>    extract (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> query s</span>
<span id="cb18-4"><a href="#cb18-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb18-5"><a href="#cb18-5"></a><span>    extend ::</span> (<span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Store</span> s b</span>
<span id="cb18-6"><a href="#cb18-6"></a>    extend f (<span>Store</span> query s) <span>=</span> <span>Store</span> (\s' <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Store</span> query s')) s</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>extract</code> applies the current cursor to the query function and <code>extend</code> chains state transforming queries.</p>
<p><code>extract</code> is fairly trivial in this case, but <code>extend</code> is a little trickier. It helps to think about in relation to our <code>fmap</code> implementation.</p>
<p>Like <code>fmap</code>, it uses a function to modify our implicit state, but where <code>fmap</code> composed a pure <code>a -&gt; b</code> function with our query, <code>extend</code> creates a new query function by applying your entire store to a comonadic action. This allows us to bring into scope the entire current store when modifying particular points in the store.</p>
<p><code>extend</code> is extremely powerful and allows us to do really interesting things like create windowing functions and perform kernel convolution. It allows us to modify every single individual points in "parallel" using the entire state as context.</p>
<p>One interesting example of extend is to perform a moving average on some time series data.</p>
<p>First we need a <code>Store</code> modeling time sequenced data. We will use <code>Int</code> for our Index and it will represent a single unit of time in a data stream. We want some fairly dynamic data source so I chose the Fibbonaci sequence. At each point in time (each index) we get the next Fibbonaci number.</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1"></a><span>fibStore ::</span> <span>Store</span> <span>Int</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb19-2"><a href="#cb19-2"></a>fibStore <span>=</span> store query <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3"><a href="#cb19-3"></a>  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb19-4"><a href="#cb19-4"></a><span>    query ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb19-5"><a href="#cb19-5"></a>    query <span>0</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb19-6"><a href="#cb19-6"></a>    query <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span></span>
<span id="cb19-7"><a href="#cb19-7"></a>    query n <span>=</span> query (n <span>-</span> <span>1</span>) <span>+</span> query (n <span>-</span> <span>2</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, if we want to calculate a window starting from a given cursor want some way to query for the subsequent points in time. <code>experiement</code> will work perfectly here:</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1"></a><span>window ::</span> <span>Store</span> <span>Int</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb20-2"><a href="#cb20-2"></a>window store <span>=</span> experiment (\s <span>-&gt;</span> [s<span>..</span>s<span>+</span><span>10</span>]) store</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I chose to fix the window at 10 units of time arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Now notice the shape of <code>window</code> is <code>Store Int a -&gt; [a]</code>. That looks a lot like the comonadic …</p></div>

Working with containers always feels like magic. In a good way for those who understand the internals and in a terrifying - for those who don't. Luckily, we've been looking under the hood of the containerization technology for quite some time already and even managed to uncover that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/not-every-container-has-an-operating-system-inside/#container-is-just-a-processes">containers are just isolated and restricted Linux processes</a>, that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-dont-need-an-image-to-run-a-container/">images aren't really needed to run containers</a>, and on the contrary - <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-need-containers-to-build-an-image/">to build an image we need to run some containers</a>.</p>
<p>Now comes a time to tackle the container networking problem. Or, more precisely, a single-host container networking problem. In this article, we are going to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to virtualize network resources to make containers think each of them has a dedicated network stack?</li>
<li>How to turn containers into friendly neighbors, prevent them from interfering, and teach to communicate well?</li>
<li>How to reach the outside world (e.g. the Internet) from inside the container?</li>
<li>How to reach containers running on a machine from the outside world (<em>aka</em> port publishing)?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it'll become apparent that the single-host container networking is nothing more than a simple combination of the well-known Linux facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>network namespaces;</li>
<li>virtual Ethernet devices (veth);</li>
<li>virtual network switches (bridge);</li>
<li>IP routing and network address translation (NAT).</li>
</ul>
<p>And for better or worse, no code is required to make the networking magic happen...

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Any decent Linux distribution would probably suffice. All the examples in the article have been made on a fresh <em>vagrant</em> CentOS 8 virtual machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant init centos/8
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh

[vagrant@localhost ~]$ uname -a
Linux localhost.localdomain 4.18.0-147.3.1.el8_1.x86_64</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of simplicity of the examples, in this article, we are not going to rely on any fully-fledged containerization solution (e.g. <em>docker</em> or <em>podman</em>). Instead, we'll focus on the basic concepts and use the bare minimum tooling to achieve our learning goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-namenetnsaisolating-containers-with-network-namespaces"><a name="netns"></a>Isolating containers with network namespaces</h2>
<p>What constitutes a Linux network stack? Well, obviously, the set of network devices. What else? Probably, the set of routing rules. And not to forget, the set of netfilter hooks, including defined by iptables rules.</p>
<p>We can quickly forge a non-comprehensive <code>inspect-net-stack.sh</code> script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "&gt; Network devices"
ip link

echo -e "\n&gt; Route table"
ip route

echo -e "\n&gt; Iptables rules"
iptables --list-rules</code></pre>
<p>Before running it, let's taint the iptables rules a bit to make them recognizable:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo iptables -N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>After that, execution of the inspect script on my machine produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

&gt; Route table
default via 10.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
10.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.2.15 metric 100

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>We are interested in that output because we want to make sure that each of the containers we are going to create soon will get a separate network stack.</p>
<p>Well, you might have heard already, that one of the Linux namespaces used for containers isolation is called <em>network namespace</em>. From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html"><code>man ip-netns</code></a>, <em>"network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices."</em> For the sake of simplicity, this is the only namespace we're going to use in this article. Instead of creating fully-isolated containers, we'd rather restrict the scope to only the network stack.</p>
<p>One of the ways to create a network namespace is the <code>ip</code> tool - part of the de facto standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2">iproute2</a> collection:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip netns add netns0
$ ip netns
netns0</code></pre>
<p>How to start using the just created namespace? There is a lovely Linux command called <code>nsenter</code>. It enters one or more of the specified namespaces and then executes the given program:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0 bash
# The newly created bash process lives in netns0

$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

&gt; Route table

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code></pre>
<p>From the output above it's clear that the <em>bash</em> process running inside <code>netns0</code> namespace sees a totally different network stack. There is no routing rules at all, no custom iptables chain, and only one loopback network device. So far, so good...</p>

<h2 id="a-namevethaconnecting-containers-to-host-with-virtual-ethernet-devices-veth"><a name="veth"></a>Connecting containers to host with virtual Ethernet devices (veth)</h2>
<p>A dedicated network stack would be not so useful if we could not communicate with it. Luckily, Linux provides a suitable facility for that - a virtual Ethernet device! From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html"><code>man veth</code></a>, <em>"veth devices are virtual Ethernet devices. They can act as tunnels between network namespaces to create a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace, but can also be used as standalone network devices."</em></p>
<p>Virtual Ethernet devices always go in pairs. No worries, it'll be clear when we take a look at the creation command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name ceth0</code></pre>
<p>With this single command, we just created a pair of <em>interconnected</em> virtual Ethernet devices. The names <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> have been chosen arbitrarily:</p>
<pre><code>$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: ceth0@veth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@ceth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> after creation resides on the host's network stack (also called root network namespace). To connect the root namespace with the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we need to keep one of the devices in the root namespace and move another one into the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set ceth0 netns netns0

# List all the devices to make sure one of them disappeared from the root stack
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@if5: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netns netns0</code></pre>
<p>Once we turn the devices on and assign proper IP addresses, any packet occurring on one of the devices will immediately pop up on its peer device connecting two namespaces. Let's start from the root namespace:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set veth0 up
$ sudo ip addr add 172.18.0.11/16 dev veth0</code></pre>
<p>And continue with the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0
$ ip link set lo up  # whoops
$ ip link set ceth0 up
$ ip addr add 172.18.0.10/16 dev ceth0
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
5: ceth0@if6: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0</code></pre>

    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/container-networking-is-simple/veth.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>Connecting network namespaces via veth device.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We are ready to check the connectivity:</p>
<pre><code># From `netns0`, ping root's veth0

<p>At the same time, if we try to reach any other addresses from the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we are not going to succeed:</p>
<pre><code># Inside root namespace
$ ip addr show dev eth0
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

# Remember this 10.0.2.15

$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0

# Try host's eth0
$ ping 10.0.2.15
connect: Network is unreachable

# Try something from the Internet
$ ping 8.8.8.8
connect: Network is unreachable</code></pre>
<p>That's easy to explain, though. There is simply no route in the <code>netns0</code> routing table for such packets. The only entry there shows how to reach <code>172.18.0.0/16</code> network:</p>
<pre><code># From `netns0` namespace:
$ ip route
172.18.0.0/16 dev ceth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.18.0.10</code></pre>
<p>Linux has a bunch of ways to populate the routing table. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is part 2 of an ongoing series about <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>. If you missed part 1:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://opensourc.es/basics-multiple-dispatch">Multiple dispatch</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is now also part 3 on <a href="https://opensourc.es/all-about-pkg">how to use the package manager</a>.</p>
<p>In this post I want show you how to use the REPL (Read-eval-print loop) and to use <a href="https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl">Revise.jl</a> which in my opinion is THE extension everyone should use!</p>
<p>If you enjoy the video format more than reading a blog: First of all: Thanks that you're here and not on YouTube/Netflix/Twitch etc :D  You might wanna have a look at this wonderful video about the REPL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkgCENBFrAY">Julia REPL tips and tricks by BrainRPG</a>.</p>
<p>That are well spent 40 minutes ;) Anyway as you're here let's continue.</p>

<h2 id="repl_first_usage"><a href="#repl_first_usage">REPL first usage</a></h2>
<p>After downloading/installing the latest version (now 1.4.2) you can just type <code>julia</code> in your REPL and get greeted like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; julia
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.4.2 (2020-05-23)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |

julia&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You get some useful information right there which newcomers often miss as they are too excited to try it out. Maybe you've been there and are now reading this post to get some more tips &amp; tricks.</p>
<p>I'm talking about the different REPL modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>?</code> for help mode</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>;</code> for shell mode</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>]</code> for package mode</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can simply type one of those characters to switch to the mode.</p>
<h3 id="getting_help"><a href="#getting_help">Getting help</a></h3>
<p>After typing <code>?</code> you see:</p>
<pre><code>help?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can get help about functions like getting their docstring using this method.</p>
<p>In the last post I talked about <code>methods</code> to see which methods are implemented for a given function.</p>
<pre><code>help?&gt; methods
search: methods methodswith Method MethodError hasmethod

  methods(f, [types], [module])

  Return the method table for f.

  If types is specified, return an array of methods whose types match. If module is specified, return an array of methods defined in that module. A list of modules can also be specified as an array.

  │ Julia 1.4
  │
  │  At least Julia 1.4 is required for specifying a module.</code></pre>
<p>The first line shows you a list of functions with a similar name which might be handy if you mistyped the function name.</p>
<p>Or if you just have a typo:</p>
<pre><code>help?&gt; metods
search: methods methodswith Method MethodError hasmethod</code></pre>
<p>This way you also sometimes learn new useful functions.</p>
<p>You have no clue what the method is called? I guess you still now what you want to do with it ;)</p>
<p>Maybe have a look at <code>apropos</code></p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; apropos("standard deviation")
Base.randn
Random.randn!
Statistics.stdm
Statistics.std</code></pre>
<p>You're probably looking for <code>Statistics.std</code>. I have to admit that often this way you get quite a long list of possibilities but it can be a reasonable method if you don't have an internet connection.</p>
<p>In the end of this post I have a list of resources you might want to check out when learning Julia :)</p>
<h3 id="shell_mode"><a href="#shell_mode">Shell mode</a></h3>
<p>The next mode in our list is the shell mode which you can enter with <code>;</code>:</p>
<pre><code>shell&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I don't actually know how well this works on Windows but it's quite useful on Linux and probably Mac.</p>
<p>You can just use your normal commands that you use in your shell like <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>pwd</code> and so on. These are only the ones I use frequently. Depending on your workflow you might wanna use <code>git</code> with that as well.</p>
<p>It is often nice to be able to do a quick command in the same directory instead of opening a new terminal for it.</p>
<p>That said you can use Julia itself for some of those commands as well:</p>
<pre><code>help?&gt; cd
search: cd Cdouble gcd gcdx secd asecd cld Cmd codeunit codeunits codepoint code_llvm code_typed code_native code_lowered code_warntype @cmd ncodeunits @code_llvm @code_typed @code_native @code_lowered

  cd(dir::AbstractString=homedir())

  Set the current working directory.</code></pre>
<h3 id="package_mode"><a href="#package_mode">Package mode</a></h3>
<p>Let's get to the last REPL mode before discussing <code>Revise</code> a bit. </p>
<p>You can add packages with this mode as well as updating/removing them. Follow me with <code>]</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(@v1.4) pkg&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This mode is a little special as you see the package environment we are in. At the moment we are in the global environment. If you need different package versions in different projects/environments, you can create a new environment by using <code>activate</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(@v1.4) pkg&gt; ?activate
  activate
  activate [--shared] path

  Activate the environment at the given path, or the home project environment if no path is specified. The active environment is the environment that is modified by executing package commands. When
  the option --shared is given, path will be assumed to be a directory name and searched for in the environments folders of the depots in the depot stack. In case no such environment exists in any of
  the depots, it will be placed in the first depot of the stack.</code></pre>
<p>i.e if I want to add a dependency to my <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/ConstraintSolver.jl">ConstraintSolver</a> I would write</p>
<pre><code>]
(@v1.4) pkg&gt; activate /home/ole/Julia/ConstraintSolver
Activating environment at `~/Julia/ConstraintSolver/Project.toml`

(ConstraintSolver) pkg&gt;</code></pre>
<p>but that might be needed in your first steps so don't worry about that now :)</p>
<p>Instead let's install <a href="https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl">Revise.jl</a> as I mentioned it's THE package you need. If you don't trust me, you might click on the link to check it out before you follow the installation.</p>
<pre><code>(ConstraintSolver) pkg&gt; activate 
Activating environment at `~/.julia/environments/v1.4/Project.toml`</code></pre>
<p>&lt;- Just to get back to the general environment for me. You probably don't have the ConstraintSolver so you don't need it.</p>
<pre><code>(@v1.4) pkg&gt; add Revise
   Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`
   Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git`
  Resolving package versions...
   Updating `~/.julia/environments/v1.4/Project.toml`
  [295af30f] + Revise v2.7.3
   Updating `~/.julia/environments/v1.4/Manifest.toml`
 [no changes]</code></pre>
<p>And now v2.7.3 of Revise is installed. Simple, isn't it?</p>
<p>Before I jump into Revise let's stay in this REPL mode for a bit if you don't mind. </p>
<p>Checking which packages one has installed in the current environment:</p>
<pre><code>(@v1.4) pkg&gt; status

<p>I don't wanna fill your screen ... I have quite a lot installed and can probably uninstall some of them. You can see the version number for each package here (besides standard libraries like Dates). For <code>Unitful</code> you can see that I have checked it out for development. (Just some test I think).</p>
<p>If you want to improve Revise (or any other package) you can use </p>
<pre><code>(@v1.4) pkg&gt; dev Revise</code></pre>
<p>and then the repo will be cloned to <code>~/.julia/dev/Revise</code> and you can implement your awesome feature.</p>
<p>Okay let's check whether there are some updates:</p>

<p>okay maybe I haven't done this for a bit but some packages get frequently updated ;)</p>
<p>Maybe it's a good moment to talk a bit about <code>Project.toml</code> and <code>Manifest.toml</code> without getting too deep. Each environment has both of these files. </p>
<p><code>Project.toml</code></p><ul>
<li><p>defines the direct dependencies and some bounds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Manifest.toml</code></p><ul>
<li><p>defines all dependencies exactly</p>

<p>Art-Supreme is happy to announce the collaboration with the AI NORN project. To our knowledge this is the first time in history of art that the robotic arm is painting an artwork based on the digital representation of another artificially generated artwork. All of this has been done just with the help of neural network algorithms<strong>.</strong> The team has achieved a new level of cooperation in understanding the use of artificial intelligence.&nbsp; One of the goals of this collaboration is to develop a system that&nbsp; can interact with the real world, allowing users to create their own personalised art with the aid of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Here is the original digital painting </strong>which was created with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Style_Transfer">neural style transfer algorithm</a></p>





<p><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="417" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6SUAJcOU3u_5tnIGMsYqW-JeHiERm6WPn3iWHGZo9NTJqTffpskhLQYnPXLuf7LuALkdd7iklcx5DywExH3pTfiv9PRITz5oMo_IF30IdDUQBwMs_fusQhpi_hfX93e32TLBZ5J5"></p>



<p><strong>And here is a robotic arm </strong>trying to convey that image onto the canvas. The robotic arm is also running a neural network algorithm which is trained to use the paintbrush in order to minimise the difference between the digital and the real image that is being painted.</p>



<br>

</p></figure></center>



<p><strong>And here is the final result </strong>of the robotic arm</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="624" height="437" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Z5j-SIqzeWoBV2uxZijnveRtsCW7dNKHLNugkrFxnl1gOvVVkw3Ey0batTrL-TiECLcixht8WBIOxTJywMisa_ngETQQunNEu8D-AqDVNeogkaZJJd1SDGkITx9ZVp3W07_MjXz2"></p>







<p>Some things to say: It’s not perfect. As you can imagine the robot still doesn’t have the ability and freedom that a human hand does. For example the movement angles and finesse of pressure is limited in comparison to a skilled artist.</p>







<p>In conclusion, there is a lot to be done. This is actually just the beginning of this collaboration. One thing is sure; as the technology progresses, the boundary that separates man and machine becomes thinner and thinner.</p>



<p>In that light we see the intelligent machines as a tool which can teach&nbsp; more about ourselves in many yet undisclosed ways. We believe AI art is the next big thing and we are happy that you are here with us getting your insight into creativity and intelligence.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the more helpful frameworks that I’ve found in my career has been to aggressively avoid unforced errors in management. In tennis, unforced errors are cases where a player missed a shot due to their own mistake, rather than due to their opponent. In management, unforced errors are problems where the source is <em>you</em>, rather than an objective business need or external circumstance.</p>

<p>I define unforced errors as problems caused by taking action, when doing absolutely <strong>nothing</strong> would have worked just fine: cases when you mess with something that wasn’t broken in the first place. In addition to being annoying, unforced errors distract from existing priorities and open up new fronts in any battles that you’re currently engaged in. And since the solution is so easy – just do nothing – learning how to identify them can pay dividends.</p>

<h2 id="common-types-of-unforced-errors">Common Types of Unforced Errors</h2>

<p>Unforced errors generally come in a few easy to identify forms.</p>

<p>The most common is deciding to “fix” a problem that doesn’t matter, or that doesn’t exist at all. One of the prototypical examples is the decision to migrate to a new technology stack because it seems cool, or because your current technology choice is no longer in vogue. Maybe you’re running Ruby or PHP but really want to try out Rust, despite the fact that your product is otherwise working fine and you’re not having trouble finding and retaining engineers. This invention of a problem can lead to Tech Debt Science Projects in which your team rebuilds otherwise working technology. If anything breaks (it likely will), you’ve caused an unforced error.</p>

<p>Another class of unforced errors comes from deciding to standardize or regulate a system that’s working fine. For example, imagine a case where your engineering teams are all running agile processes differently. Some teams aren’t disciplined about retrospectives, some teams are highly regimented about story sizing while others wing it, and some teams occasionally insert “break” weeks in between sprints so that schedules never quite align. To a certain kind of person, this type of inconsistency feels deeply wrong – like a house in which all of the walls were a very slightly different color.</p>

<p>But your business doesn’t require consistency for aesthetic purposes, or for its own sake. In some situations, you can tolerate somewhat haphazard team processes for a surprisingly long time – dodging the upfront effort of standardization, the ongoing effort of maintaining it, and the overall risk of standardizing on a system that doesn’t actually help everyone on balance. (of course, if there are real upsides to enforcing consistency then you should go for it)</p>

<h2 id="catching-unforced-errors-before-they-happen">Catching Unforced Errors Before They Happen</h2>

<p>In my experience unforced errors often stem from a yearning for control. When times are tough it can be tempting to latch onto areas where you already have mastery and look for ways to optimize them, and this optimization feels like productive work. Ironically, this means that you’re more likely to cause unforced errors, as these familiar domains are areas where you’re probably doing well – focus is needed in the areas of the business that you rarely think about, where your existing decisions are the least battle-tested.</p>

<p>The general solution to unforced errors is to ruthlessly prioritize. Focus on the problems that are truly existential threats to your business and team, or represent transformational opportunities.</p>

<p>My simple heuristic for avoiding unforced errors is to always imagine the worst thing that can happen if you just skip a new project – what would happen if you had never thought about this initiative at all? This is especially true when you’re talking about changing something rather than doing something new. If the worst that happens is that you miss a chance for a 5-10% optimization of a non-essential part of your business, alarm bells should be gently ringing.</p>

<p>Unforced errors are a pain – not only do they distract, but the optics can be pretty bad when a lot of hard work backfires. By avoiding these hiccups, you can keep your team happier and focus on getting the wins that are most important to your business.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page"><div><article><section><div><div><div><p>En medio de los trabajos de remodelación que se vienen realizando en el Mirador Natural, en la Pampa de Nasca, arqueólogos del Plan de Gestión Nasca-Palpa del Ministerio de Cultura y el personal técnico a cargo de dichas labores, lograron identificar un nuevo geoglifo figurativo, -correspondiente a un felino-, que había sido dibujado en una de las laderas de esta colina. </p>

<p>La figura apenas era visible y estaba a punto de desaparecer debido a que se localiza en una ladera de pendiente bastante pronunciada y a los efectos de la erosión natural. En la última semana se realizó la limpieza y conservación del geoglifo, el cual muestra la figura de un felino representado con el cuerpo de perfil y la cabeza de frente, cuyos trazos en su mayor parte estaban bien definidos por una línea de ancho variable entre 30 y 40 cm. </p>

<p>La figura mide 37 metros de largo, visto en forma horizontal y según sus rasgos estilísticos data de la época Paracas Tardío. Es decir, es anterior a las famosas figuras de la Pampa de Nasca, con una antigüedad de 100 a 200 años antes de nuestra era. Representaciones de felinos de este tipo son frecuentes en la iconografía de la cerámica y los textiles de la sociedad Paracas.</p>

<p>Con este descubrimiento se pone en evidencia, una vez más, el rico y variado legado cultural que alberga la zona, la cual además se encuentra dentro del área inscrita en la Lista de Patrimonio Mundial de la UNESCO. De este modo, aun en tiempos de pandemia, personal del Ministerio de Cultura viene contribuyendo con la investigación, la conservación y el desarrollo turístico de la región, en particular de la provincia de Nasca.</p>

<p><strong>Dato:</strong></p>

<p>Las Líneas y Geoglifos de Nasca y Palpa, bien inscrito en la Lista del Patrimonio Mundial en el año 1994, son una de las más extraordinarias e inigualables obras del hombre. Las líneas y geoglifos conforman un paisaje cultural con profundo significado y simbolismo, pues expresan el mundo mágico y religioso de las sociedades prehispánicas Paracas y Nasca, quienes durante más de 1,500 años las dibujaron sobre las arenas del desierto y las montañas. Hoy son testimonio del genio creativo de los antiguos pobladores americanos, y de los singulares conceptos y formas de expresión religiosa que desarrollaron a lo largo de su historia. </p>

<p><strong>Sobre el Mirador Natural</strong></p>

<p>El Mirador Natural corresponde a una colina rocosa que se localiza en una sección de la Pampa de Nasca, a la altura del km 426.4 km de la carretera Panamericana Sur. Recibe ese nombre debido a que alrededor de ella confluyen numerosas líneas rectas de diferente ancho y longitud (geoglifos), las cuales se pueden observar desde la cima de la colina. Técnicamente constituye uno de los Centros de Líneas más grandes de la Pampa de Nasca.</p></div></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]>

      <section>
        
          <p><time datetime="2020-06-22T13:47:48+00:00">June 22, 2020</time></p>
        
        
        
          <p><em>Building out a reusable keynote slide plugin with only pure CSS</em></p>
        
        <p>There are a great deal of options available on the web and built into most operating systems when you need to create presentation / keynote slides. You could use native software like LibremOffice Impress, Powerpoint, Apple’s Keynote, etc. You could also decide to use preexisting web-based apps like Google Slides or an open source project such as RevealJS. All of these are good options.</p>

<p>But thinking more about how overly “complex” these apps are implemented, it got me wondering if I could quickly code up a presentation slide “framework” with pure CSS and barely any code…</p>

<p>This is what I came up with:</p>

<h2 id="the-demo">The Demo</h2>

<p data-height="472" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="bradleytaunt" data-slug-hash="jOWBJZb" data-pen-title="Presentation / Keynote Slides (Pure CSS)">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/bradleytaunt/pen/jOWBJZb"> Presentation / Keynote Slides (Pure CSS)</a> by Bradley Taunt (<a href="https://codepen.io/bradleytaunt">@bradleytaunt</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>Yes, I know this is <em>ugly</em>, but this was created as a barebones skeleton for others to build upon. The demo uses a simple set of <code>radio</code> inputs that correspond to their own individual <code>slide</code> element. The “framework” looks at the currently <code>checked</code> input, then changes the <code>opacity</code> and <code>z-index</code> of it’s corresponding slide item. Pretty straightforward stuff!</p>

<p>Let’s break down each piece:</p>

<h2 id="the-html">The HTML</h2>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"slider"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"radio"</span> <span>name=</span><span>"pagination"</span> <span>value=</span><span>"1"</span> <span>checked</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"radio"</span> <span>name=</span><span>"pagination"</span> <span>value=</span><span>"2"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"radio"</span> <span>name=</span><span>"pagination"</span> <span>value=</span><span>"3"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"radio"</span> <span>name=</span><span>"pagination"</span> <span>value=</span><span>"4"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>"radio"</span> <span>name=</span><span>"pagination"</span> <span>value=</span><span>"5"</span><span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"slide"</span><span>&gt;</span>

<p>There isn’t a whole lot going on here. We are just including a set of <code>radio</code> inputs (based on how many slides are desired) along with their corresponding <code>slide</code> class elements. You might notice we don’t do anything to specifically target each individual slide item – you’ll see why we don’t need to in the CSS section!</p>

<p>Again – not much to see here. We use CSS to look down through the DOM for each <code>radio</code> elements slide “partner”. We do this by targeting the <code>nth-of-type</code> on both elements. Simple stuff.</p>

<p>Some drawbacks to this approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to manually target each new slide you add (color, styling, content, etc.)</li>
  <li>Lack of animations might require extra work to implement (maybe 3rd party libraries like AOS?)</li>
  <li>Probably won’t be best for extremely long/complex presentation slides</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it! Hope you enjoy playing around with it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><img src="https://manybrain.github.io/m8r_blog/img/2020/10/messageflow2.png" alt="Slide showing Mailinator as a message hub"></p>
<h2 id="send-your-webhooks-to-public-mailinator">Send Your Webhooks to Public Mailinator</h2>
<p>You can now direct JSON webhooks from anywhere to Mailinator.com. Mailinator has always been known for email but has actually supported SMS for several years.
Mailinator now allows anyone to post their webhooks directly into the Public (i.e. FREE) Mailinator system.</p>
<p>Messages that arrive this way will arrive in the destination inbox just as an email would. Of course, incoming webhooks will retain their original form
and are visible by clicking the link on the inbox page.  It’s easy too!  Here’s the URL:</p>
<pre><code>https://mailinator.com/api/v2/domains/public/webhook/&lt;destination-inbox&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Posting JSON data to that url will inject that data into the respective Mailinator inbox.  Here’s a full curl command to try it out right now:</p>
<pre><code>curl -v -d '{"from":"MyMailinatorTest", "subject":"testing message", "text" : "hello world", "to" : "jack" }'
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-X POST "https://www.mailinator.com/api/v2/domains/public/webhook/bob/"
</code></pre>
<p>(Check the “bob” inbox at Mailinator.com after running this command)</p>
<h2 id="twilio">Twilio</h2>
<p>Mailinator will accept webhooks from anywhere (your custom webhooks, Zapier, IFTTT … you name it!) but, we’re adding direct mapping support for some more popular services that send webhooks. Twilio is up and running already and just requires a small modification
to the url:</p>
<pre><code>https://mailinator.com/api/v2/domains/public/twilio/&lt;destination-inbox&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="for-mailinator-subscribers---private-webhooks">For Mailinator Subscribers - Private Webhooks</h2>
<p>For Mailinator subscribers, the functionality goes deeper. Firstly, you can publish webhooks to your Private Domain as you’d expect. In addition, incoming webhooks enjoy all
the advantages of private messages with Mailinator including access via Web or API, and execution through the Mailinator Rule System.</p>
<p>By webhooking your SMS messages into your Private Domain, your automated tests now have a one-stop-shop (with just one API you’re already used to), to access the incoming messages
that make up your Message Workflow.</p>
<p>We’re excited about this new feature and excited to see what our Customers will do with it !</p>
<p>You can find more information about the feature in our documentation for both the Public and Private systems.</p>

                    <p>Ethereum scaling solutions. What a wonderful, fiercely debated topic by the community. Since way before the DeFi craze started and long before high gas fees started eating into our profits, we've been talking about it.</p><p>Let's get one thing out of the way. Until about 2 hours ago, I wasn't a big fan of any proposed scaling solution that isn't natively integrated into Ethereum. But after reading the Hermez whitepaper, do see a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. Let's look behind the current CT hype and find out why.</p><p>In short, Layer 2 is an umbrella term for all attempts at taking some of the processing off Ethereum (i.e., taking something "off-chain") to ease congestions and (quite drastically) lowering Gas fees.</p><p>If you've been around for longer than 5 minutes, you've probably heard about all the amazing solutions. And they are always just around the corner. There are even people that <a href="https://twitter.com/theklineventure/status/1203991003566231553">believe</a> Ethereum scaling solutions are already here.</p><p>In reality, Ethereum still only processes <strong>about 15 transactions per second.</strong> This number is most often compared to Visa, which can process about 2,000 transactions per second.</p><figure><img src="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/ethereum-txs-per-second.png" alt="" srcset="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/ethereum-txs-per-second.png 600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/ethereum-txs-per-second.png 1000w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/ethereum-txs-per-second.png 1600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/ethereum-txs-per-second.png 2008w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ethereum transactions per second (<a href="https://blockchair.com/ethereum/charts/transactions-per-second">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>A variety of these Layer 2 solutions is currently under development. Some of these have even made it to the mainnet, but none of them is mature or adopted enough to make it worth using —&nbsp;for now.</p><p>Many of which you've probably already heard about. Plasma, Raiden, xDai and OmiseGo, to name just a few, have been around forever. But the hype, as usual, is overpromising and underdelivering. Is Hermez any different?</p><figure><img src="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-28.png" alt="" srcset="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-28.png 600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-28.png 1000w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/image-28.png 1600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-28.png 2274w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ethereum vs Hermez transaction size (<a href="https://hermez.io/hermez-whitepaper.pdf">Source</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>One of the proposed scaling technologies for Ethereum is fittingly called <strong>rollups. </strong>The idea is that you take a bunch of transactions, verify them off-chain, and then only store the proof on-chain.</p><p>Hermez aims to deliver one of these solutions.</p><p>Every 10 minutes, Hermez will use what's technically called "ZK-Rollups" to create a batch of transactions and only store the result on-chain. This significantly increases the amount of throughput as the heavy-lifting is done by Hermez instead. There are drastic implications, positive and negative though.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="assets-are-stored-off-chain">Assets are stored off-chain</h2><p>With the current design, L2 networks cannot communicate anything on-chain. All funds are stored, and all transfers are executed, in a <strong>fenced environment.</strong></p><p>Imagine Ethereum transactions would cost $100/transaction, but Bitcoin could do the same transfer for just $3/transaction. You could swap your <code>$ETH</code> for <code>$BTC</code>, transfer the funds and swap them back into your original <code>$ETH</code>.</p><p>Let's ignore for a second that you would have to pay an exchange a fee (twice) and that the <code>BTC/ETH</code> rate might change while you're exposed to Bitcoin. The concept of Layer 2 would then be somewhat similar. All assets you want to make "Layer 2"-capable would first have to be converted to off-chain assets.</p><p>Expect assets like <code>$hETH</code>, <code>$hWBTC</code> and others to take this spot. These would be 1:1 pegged to the assets, equivalent to <code>$WBTC</code> right now. In Hermez's case, the originals would be locked in smart contracts while within their Layer 2.</p><h2 id="not-all-transactions-are-supported">Not all transactions are supported</h2><p>Continuing this analogy and assume you are still in Bitcoin. Some awesome smart contract just popped up and you'd like to invest/play/ape into it. Unfortunately, Bitcoin doesn't have ability to do that. You'd have to swap back first. Of course, as soon as you swapped back, you're exposed to the high transaction fees of Ethereum again. 🤯</p><p>Hermez only supports ordinary transfers. Think: sending some Ether from your personal wallet to an exchange (that doesn't use contracts, e.g. Binance). This is still huge, as per their whitepaper.</p><blockquote>Why focusing on transfers? It turns out that more than 50% of transactions on the Ethereum network are transfers, and a large percent of these are deposits and withdrawals from exchanges. Demand could be reduced by a significant amount if exchanges started using rollups, or (in the ideal case) even agreed to meet on the same rollup. (<a href="https://hermez.io/hermez-whitepaper.pdf">Source</a>)</blockquote><figure></figure><h2 id="incompatibility-across-the-board">Incompatibility across the board</h2><p>Here's the main issue with approaches that are not integrated into the Ethereum core itself. Any solution will have its own protocol, it's own process for on/off-boarding assets and it's own nodes/coordinates/stakees — whatever you want to call it. As it stands, they'd all be incompatible with each other.</p><p>What that means is that, if Binance for example opts into supporting Hermez, but the wallet you use only supports xDai, you will not be able to benefit from it. This incompatibility and competition will make it hard for companies and individuals to choose and, probably, hinder progress for a while.</p><h2 id="transaction-costs-may-be-less-transparent">Transaction costs may be less transparent</h2><p>This one is debatable, and it's something that I did not understand from reading the whitepaper. But after contacting the team, it became clear that fees paid on Layer 2 are not always paid in Ether.</p><p>Anything you transfer to, from or within the Layer 2 network will cost a small fee, deducted from the total amount you're sending. I can see all types of issues with this, but we will have to see how this turns out.</p><figure><img src="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-30.png" alt="" srcset="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-30.png 600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-30.png 1000w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/image-30.png 1600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-30.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>All the above leads leads to a terrible user experience. If it isn't easy to use, widely adopted and therefore provides a meaningful benefit, nobody will use it. When I started to read the whitepaper, I prepared myself for disappointment. However, my concerns were addressed on page 20:</p><blockquote>To achieve a robust ecosystem of rollups, it is important to enable migrations between different rollups and other L2 applications. To this end, together with the Ethereum community and other researchers from different rollup solutions, some members of the Hermez decentralized community are working on the standardization and compatibility between these technologies. (<a href="https://hermez.io/hermez-whitepaper.pdf">Source</a>)</blockquote><p>It appears that the Hermez team is aware of this and, in fact, aims to build a standard for migrating transactions between different rollup solutions. In the whitepaper, they link to <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/mass-migration-to-prevent-user-lockin-in-rollup/7701">this Ethereum research thread</a>.</p><p>Hermez aims to further improve the user experience by providing a web wallet that interacts directly with MetaMask. While still requiring movement of funds between different channels (on/off-chain), it should make it easier.</p><figure><img src="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-27.png" alt="" srcset="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-27.png 600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-27.png 1000w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-27.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Hermez used what they call "coordinators" to verify off-chain transactions. These coordinators can bid to be rewarded the right to verify the next batch of transactions. While the network is intended to be fully decentralized, it will initially be driven by a "boot coordinator" which the developers control.</p><p>Over time, this boot coordinator will become less relevant as the amount of fees that it can consume (and therefore amount of HEZ it can bid to stay sustainable) is reduced by 5% every month. Eventually, other coordinators could therefore outbid the boot coordinator, making the network fully centralized.</p><p>For all intends and purposes however, this means that Hermez isn't going to be centralized from the start. The whitepaper mentions that the bootstrap period is expected to last 1-2 years. Any longer, the control will be transferred to the HermezDao, powered by Aragon. </p><figure><img src="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-26.png 600w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-26.png 1000w, https://rawcrypto.com/content/images/2020/10/image-26.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Hermez introduced their native <code>$HEZ</code> token on Uniswap, without prior private or pre-sales. Starting at $1, it quickly went to $3.16 before settling now at around $2.50 per token.</p><p>The token's primary purpose is for coordinators to bid on the right to verify the next batch of transactions. Coordinators get a bit of everything that is transferred, so there is a bit of a "spend money to make money" dynamic going on.</p><p>So far so good, but unfortunately the inflation is quite high. Quite a lot of it will go to the founders (different from the developers). Personally, this is a big red flag for me as founders might dump without hesitation.</p><h2 id="vesting-schedules">Vesting schedules</h2><p>A little confusing, but Hermez has two different vesting schedules.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><h2>Theres nothing that can’t be made worse</h2>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20201001">The Treasury has moved to prohibit payment of ransomware ransoms</a>. They’ve said there will be some exceptions, and it is obvious that this won’t be an effective complete global ban on payment. The result, a partial ban on payment, is the worst possible ransomware environment for victims. The impact of different legal regimes governing ransom payments are well documented and understood, <a href="https://rusi.org/publication/occasional-papers/closing-gap-assessing-responses-terrorist-related-kidnap-ransom">see RUSI here</a>.</p>
<p>Banning ransomware payments seems like a means of removing the financial reward for the gangs. It makes intuitive sense that if the victims cannot pay, then the gangs will stop using ransomware. Unfortunately the counterintuitive truth is that an incomplete, ineffective, partial ban will actually make objectively ransomware worse for everyone.</p>
<p>If there is a complete universal global ban, then ransomware ceases to be a source of money and the ransomware gangs stop. Or at least migrate to something else that makes money. We know this scenario is not going to happen.</p>
<h3>What’s the worst that can happen?</h3>
<p>A partial ban creates significant unintended consequences. Firstly, the ransomware gangs still make money from ransomware, so they do <strong>not</strong> cease operations. Then, to encourage payment they become more drastic and extreme in their actions. They have to make a stronger incentive to encourage people who are dissuaded by the ban, but might pay if given sufficient “encouragement”. Then, because the prohibition on payment drives it underground – with all the limited transparency and brutal mechanisms for enforcing compliance — the ransom prices rise. This environment: higher prices, more aggressive ransomware gangs, fewer reputable companies negotiating and handling the ransom payments (and thereby managing the gangs); it is the worst possible situation for everyone.</p>
<h3>How to control attacker behaviour</h3>
<p>The only entity with power to control the behaviour of ransomware gangs is the one providing their protection. The gangs need a place to operate and somewhere to convert their crypto currency into hard currency. They are cashing out hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto, and there is no way that isn’t raising “know your customer” alerts for money laundering.</p>
<p>The only controlling entity is the one that allows the gangs to operate. The gangs are completely at the mercy of whichever entity provides protection (yes, it’s Russia). This is the rule everywhere that kidnapping gangs operate, and ransomware gangs share this trait with kidnap&amp;ransom (K&amp;R) gangs with regards to their operational requirements.</p>
<h3>Private governance. Better than nothing? Hmm</h3>
<p>The current situation, where there is no criminalisation of payment has created a market place where a number of companies working with insurers are handling the vast majority of ransomware incidents. There are crisis responders who help the companies recover, who arrange a minimal payment, and who get paid by the insurers. This is market governance and it keeps the prices down because there is a sort of gentlemen’s agreement between the gangs and the payment companies. Also, the lack of prohibition means these companies operate in the open and they can share information about pricing etc internally and with each other. (Transparency)</p>
<p>The status quo is not the ideal world, but it is far better than the nightmare of ineffective partial prohibition.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.bygonely.com/old-moscow-1931-photos/">Moscow</a> was the center, heart, and soul of the Soviet Union in the 1950s. The country was recovering from <a href="https://www.bygonely.com/wwii-colorized-photographs/">World War II</a>, and moving towards the rapid development and prosperity. The city housed the headquarters of the Soviet secret service, the KGB, and the developing nuclear and aerospace breakthroughs of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.</p>
<p>New architectures, theatres, skyscrapers, and hotels were built in the city during the 1950s. The Hilton Moscow Leningrad kaya, one of Moscow’s Seven Sisters Skyscrapers, was also built-in 1954. Moscow also hosted the 1957 Ice Hockey World Championships and 6th World Festival of Youth and Students.</p>
<p>Here below are some stunning vintage photos that will take you back to the Soviet Moscow in the 1950s.</p>

You may be using Mastodon wrong
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202010181913.37# -->
<p>October 18, 2020 — 
Carlos Fenollosa
</p>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>I'm sure you have already heard about <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>,
typically marketed as <em>a Twitter alternative</em>.</p>

<p>I will try to convince you that the word <em>alternative</em> doesn't mean here what you think it means,
and why you may be using Mastodon wrong if you find it boring.</p>

<h4>An alternative community</h4>

<p>You should not expect to "migrate from Twitter to Mastodon."</p>

<p>Forget about the privacy angle for now. Mastodon is an alternative community, where people behave
differently.</p>

<p><strong>It's your chance to make new internet friends.</strong></p>

<p>There may be some people for whom Mastodon is a safe haven. Yes, some users really do migrate
there to avoid censorship or bullying but, for most of us, that will not be the case.</p>

<p>Let's put it this way: Mastodon is to Twitter what Linux is to Windows.</p>

<p>Linux is libre software. But that's not why most people use it. Linux users mostly want 
to get their work done, and Linux is an excellent platform.
There is no Microsoft Word, no Adobe Photoshop, no Starcraft. If you need to use these tools, honestly,
you'd better stick with Windows. You can use emulation, in the same way that there are
utilities to post to Twitter from Mastodon, but that would miss the point.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, you can perform the same tasks, but the process will be different.
You can post <em>toots</em> on Mastodon, upload gifs, send DMs... but it's not Twitter, and that is fine.</p>

<h4>The Local Timeline is Mastodon's greatest invention</h4>

<p>The problem most people have with Mastodon is that they "get bored" with it quickly. I've seen it a lot, and
it means one thing: <strong>the person created their account on the wrong server</strong>.</p>

<p>"But," they say, "isn't Mastodon federated? Can't I chat with everybody, regardless of their server?"
Yes, of course. But discoverability works differently on Mastodon.</p>

<p>Twitter has only two discoverability layers: your network and the whole world. Either a small group of
contacts, or everybody in the whole world. That's crazy.</p>

<p>They try very hard to show you tweets from outside your network so you can discover new people.
And, at the same time, they show your tweets to third parties, so you can get new followers.
This is the way that
they try to keep you engaged once your network is more or less stable and starts getting stale.</p>

<p>Mastodon, instead, has an extra layer between your network and the whole world:
messages from <em>people on your server</em>. This is called the <em>local timeline</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The local timeline is the key to enjoying Mastodon.</strong></p>

<h4>How long it's been since you made a new internet friend?</h4>

<p>If you're of a certain age you may remember BBSs, Usenet, the IRC, or early internet forums.
Do you recall how exciting it was to log into the unknown and realize that there were people
all around the world who shared your interests?</p>

<p>It was an amazing feeling which got lost on the modern internet. Now you have a chance to relive it.</p>

<p>The local timeline dynamics are very different. There is a lot of respectful interactions among total strangers,
because there is this feeling of community, of being in a neighborhood. Twitter is just the opposite, strangers
shouting at each other.</p>

<p>Furthermore, since the local timeline is more or less limited in the amount of users, you have the chance
to recognize usernames, and being recognized. You start interacting with strangers, mentioning them, sending them
links they may like. You discover new websites, rabbit holes, new approaches to your hobbies.</p>

<p>I've made quite a few new <em>internet friends</em> on my Mastodon server, and I don't mean followers or contacts.
I'm talking about human beings who I have never met in person but feel close to.</p>

<p>People are humble and respectful. And, for less nice users, admins enforce codes of conduct and, 
on extreme cases, users may get kicked off a server. But they are not being banned by a faceless corporation
due to mass reports, everybody is given a chance.</p>

<h4>How to choose the right server</h4>

<p>The problem with "generalist" Mastodon servers like <a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social</a>
is that users have just too diverse interests and backgrounds.
Therefore, there is no community feeling. For some people, that may be exactly what they're looking for. But, 
for most of us, there is more value on the smaller servers.</p>

<p>So, how can you choose the right server? Fortunately, you can do a bit of research. 
There is an official <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities">directory of Mastodon servers</a> categorized by
interests and regions. </p>

<p>Since you're reading my blog, start by taking a look at these:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bsd.network/">bsd.network</a>, for fans of BSD systems</li>
<li><a href="http://linuxrocks.online/">linuxrocks.online</a>, for Linux fans</li>
<li><a href="http://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon.org</a>, for free software in general</li>
<li><a href="http://tilde.zone/">tilde.zone</a>, for oldschool internet users</li>
<li><a href="https://merveilles.town/">merveilles.town</a>, with a very particular mixture of art and technology</li>
<li><a href="https://metalhead.club/">metalhead.club</a>, to enjoy those classic riffs</li>
</ul>

<p>And the regionals</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://mastodont.cat/">mastodont.cat</a> for catalans</li>
<li><a href="https://mastodon.madrid/">mastodon.madrid</a> for madrileños</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more. Simply search online for "mastodon server MY_FAVORITE_HOBBY." And believe me, servers
between 500 and 5,000 people are the best.</p>

<h4>Final tips</h4>

<p>Before clicking on "sign up", always browse the local timeline,
the about page, and the most active users list. You will get a pretty good idea of the kind of people
who chat there.
Once you feel right at home you can continue your adventure and start following users from other servers.</p>

<p>Mastodon has an option to only display toots in specific languages. It can be very useful to avoid being
flooded by toots that you just have no chance of understanding or even getting what they're about.</p>

<p>You can also filter your notifications by types: replies, mentions, favorites, reposts, and more.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div><p>Published on <!-- -->2020-08-11</p><hr><p>As machine learning, analytics, and data processing become more complex and central to organizations, improving the software behind them becomes more urgent.</p><p>Data within organizations is disorganized and not trusted. Engineers and practitioners feel unproductive and mired in drudgery. Collaboration between data scientists, data engineers, analysts, and other roles that build complex data systems is painful. The software that processes and produces data is unreliable and resistant to change.</p><p>This state of affairs is why Dagster exists, which we first discussed publicly <a href="https://www.dagster.io/blog/introducing-dagster">a year ago</a>.</p><p>Dagster is a new type of workflow engine: a <strong>data orchestrator</strong>. Moving beyond just managing the ordering and physical execution of data computations, Dagster introduces a new primitive: a data-aware, typed, self-describing, logical <strong>orchestration graph</strong>. This graph explicitly models an implicit, pre-existing structure in every data application and platform. We believe this graph is integral to the entire application lifecycle and, when made accessible and operable over an API, can form the basis of an entire ecosystem of tools and libraries.</p><blockquote><h2>Dagster is a new type of workflow engine: a <strong>data orchestrator</strong>.</h2></blockquote><p>Dagster targets two primary audiences. The first is full-stack engineers and data scientists responsible for an entire end-to-end data application and infrastructure. The second is platform teams that enable other data teams to efficiently and autonomously deliver features and capabilities. They both care deeply about the interactions and interfaces between roles, tools, and infrastructure. Technology choices do not limit them: Dagster is flexible and adaptable, designed to run any tool, use any storage, and deploy to any infrastructure.</p><p>What also unites these audiences is the belief that there is something “off” in today’s data systems. Code is under-abstracted and under-tested. Unproductive development environments and repetitive infrastructure management bedevil the developer experience. The systems are too unreliable and difficult to change. The way out is to introduce new abstractions and tools that make these systems more testable, reliable, and fun to build.</p><p>Since our launch, we’ve worked with many users building remarkable systems with Dagster. Our latest release, 0.9.0 — code-named “Laundry Service” — represents the culmination of that year of hard work and learning. This post discusses what we’ve learned, what we’ve built, and the design principles we’ve used to guide the system’s evolution.</p><h2>Data Applications and the Orchestration Graph</h2><p>After a year, we’re more confident in the broad applicability of the concept of a <strong>data application</strong>, which unifies a set of software practices, artifacts, and systems — such as ETL, ELT, and ML training — that have different historical roots but convergent needs and characteristics. We define a data application as <em>a</em> <em>graph of computations that consume and produce data assets</em>.</p><p>The shared characteristics of these systems translate into challenges that data teams feel today:</p><ul><li>Local development with fast feedback cycles</li><li>Effective testing before deployment</li><li>Integration with the diverse tools used by data practitioners</li><li>Collaboration between the different personas that construct them</li><li>Debugging when things go wrong</li><li>Linking data assets to the code that produced them</li><li>Managing application complexity in concert with changing and increasingly demanding requirements</li></ul><p>The net result is systems of stunning complexity, whose formidable needs are not met by the software ecosystem that supports them today.</p><p>In the status quo, traditional workflow engines such as Airflow work with a purely operational dependency graph: ensuring proper execution order, managing retries, consolidating logging, and so forth. These systems were a huge step forward over loosely coupled cron jobs and other solutions that did not formally define dependencies. A narrow focus on execution allowed those systems to be maximally general while demanding minimal change to the code that they orchestrated.</p><p>Dagster makes different tradeoffs, enabling a more structured programming model that exposes a richer, semantically aware graph. The data computations within Dagster are:</p><ul><li>Modeled as coarse-grained functions with typed inputs and outputs, not with parameter-less tasks</li><li>Connected with data dependencies, not with pure execution dependencies</li><li>Parametrized by schematized configuration separate from code, not tightly coupled, loosely structured code and configuration</li><li>Executable in multiple environments (dev, test, and prod), not bound to a specific deployment</li><li>Observable via stream of metadata events, not complete “black box” computations</li><li>Viewable in tools in your local environment with no infrastructure requirements, not only after deployment and execution</li></ul><p>We call this opinionated structure the orchestration graph. This graph and the tools built on its API enable a dramatically improved way to structure data systems. It can be tested, deployed, executed, reused, and debugged flexibly. A software engineering process can be built around it in which multiple teams and personas can be effective, and it naturally becomes the system of record for your data processes.</p><blockquote><h2>The orchestration graph is the abstraction that connects all practitioners.</h2></blockquote><p>We designed this graph and system with broader principles in mind. These principles encode our beliefs about the underlying nature of data applications and the direction of the broader ecosystem.</p><ol><li><strong>Acknowledge and manage complexity: </strong>Data application construction is an extraordinarily and subtly difficult endeavor, and the status quo is under-abstracted software that results in chaos and untamed complexity. The complexity cannot be wished away. Instead, acknowledge it and adopt the abstractions and engineering processes needed to manage it.</li><li><strong>Embrace heterogeneity:</strong> Data tools and systems are heterogeneous for a good reason: people with diverse skill sets, needs, and tool preferences build them. They are deployed and execute on a wide range of infrastructure. Rather than forcing homogeneity and vertical integration, embrace heterogeneity and manage it with cross-cutting tools and software abstractions.</li><li><strong>Data-aware orchestration: </strong>Computations in data applications consume and produce data. The orchestrator should be aware of this. Typed data dependencies mean correct, testable, and understandable software. Structured metadata events emitted by computations are a definitive log of operational data and asset creation, forming a critical base layer for data catalogs, data lineage, and self-service ops.</li></ol><p>The orchestration graph is <em>the</em> common abstraction that connects all practitioners. Practitioners may use different computational runtimes, storage systems, programming languages, and tools, but the data assets they consume and produce must come from somewhere and go somewhere. This universality makes it a natural point of leverage for shared tools, collaboration, and managing system complexity. The orchestration graph should not only order computation: it should <em>structure</em>, <em>organize</em>, and <em>interrelate</em> computations and the assets they produce.</p><h2>Acknowledge and Manage Complexity</h2><h3>This is software.</h3><p>It bears repeating that data applications are software applications, and many of the principles of software engineering have their corollaries in the data domain. But attempts to blindly apply traditional software engineering techniques to data often fall short of their promise, especially compared to the impact of nontraditional tools like notebooks. We need to adapt software engineering concepts to this adjacent domain, where uncontrolled inputs and heavy-weight side effects are the rule rather than the exception.</p><p>We think data engineering today is in a similar position as web frontend engineering was a decade ago: wrestling with a novel and complex domain, dramatically under-tooled, and often regarded with unjustified disdain by practitioners in better-understood domains with more mature tooling, like systems programming. At that time, frontend engineering needed changes in web standards and browser APIs, new programming models and runtimes, and investment in tools. Today, even novice frontend developers work in sophisticated frameworks — built on what was considered arcane functional programming principles — with high-quality tools supported by a healthy ecosystem.</p><p>Just like web frontend ten years ago, we believe that data application engineering needs new approaches. Dagster offers a set of novel abstractions that lead to more resilient, testable, reusable code.</p><p>Take this example, which incorporates a number of our abstractions into a data computation executed in Pandas:</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2880/1*Xe-s_p-g3ugkZBGC2p--WQ.png" width="700px"></p><p>This example uses Pandas to load data about cereals, compute a new feature, sugar_per_cup, and then filter out cereals below a certain, configurable percentile of that feature. We then save that result as a file in a data lake.</p><p>This code demonstrates a few notable properties of Dagster:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Functional Computations</strong>: The core abstraction is a <em>solid, </em>a functional unit of computation in the orchestration graph. These solids describe their data requirements (in the form of typed inputs and outputs), configuration (with config_schema), and environmental requirements (expressed as required_resource_keys).</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Dependencies</strong>: Solids are connected using data-aware dependencies. The system takes responsibility for marshaling data (or pointers to data) from the outputs of one solid to the inputs of another. This code builds the orchestration graph structure but does not directly execute it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gradually Typed Inputs and Outputs</strong>: Dagster uses a gradual, optional type system. Note that the input into add_sugar_per_cup is a DataFrame type with no constraints on its internal structure. However, its output defines column schema and other constraints verified at runtime. These are flexible user-defined types specified in software.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configurable</strong>: Solids (as well as other artifacts) can also declare a typed configuration schema …</p></li></ol></div></article></div></div></div>

  <a href="https://evanm.website/2020/10/how-to-avoid-overengineering/"></a>
  
  <p>This article considers the conditions that lead teams to produce overengineered software and describes how you can avoid falling prey to such conditions.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-overengineering">What do we mean by “overengineering”?</h2>

<p>When a software developer says that a piece of software is <em>overengineered</em>, they are saying that they think it has too many moving parts, too much abstraction, or an excessive emphasis on performance. The number of concepts required to understand the thing feels unreasonable.</p>

<p>It’s a fundamentally subjective call, but you know it when you see it. Like a Ferrari at a go kart race, an overengineered system is out of scale with its operating environment and intended usage.</p>

<p>But how does it happen? Are there certain conditions that lead teams to produce systems that observers would perceive as overengineered?</p>

<p>To determine this, let’s consider two stereotypical software
engineering phenomena: cargo culting and a related pattern that I’ve
started to call “the Xoogler effect”.</p>

<p>From there, we can characterize certain cognitive biases that drive a team towards overengineering.</p>

<h2 id="cargo-culting">​​Cargo culting</h2>
<p><img src="https://evanm.website/images/overengineering/cloudnativelandscape.jpg" alt="The Trillion Dollar Homepage"><span>Fig. 1. <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">The Trillion Dollar Homepage</a>.</span></p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a> is a cultural phenomenon in which technologically-advanced artifacts become objects of obsessive ritual to a group of people outside of the artifact-producing society. While the term has fallen out of favor within the field of anthropology (in acknowledgement of its reductive and colonialist overtones), it’s fairly common in software circles.</p>

<p>To a software engineer, “cargo culting” is used pejoratively to refer to the adoption of a technology or practice based solely on its origin or popularity. Loosely, the thinking goes that if a tool, language, or convention was developed at or inspired by ideas from a large, successful company, then that tool must have contributed to the company’s success. Thus, in adopting it, you increase your odds of also succeeding.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Era-defining companies like Intel and Google used OKRs, so we should too.”</li>
  <li>“The SRE book talks about how Google relies on service level objectives, so using them will help our services become more reliable.”</li>
  <li>“Most successful companies end up needing advanced load balancing and request-proxying systems to scale their microservices architectures. Our 10-person startup should adopt these systems in order to help us scale.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Like incorporating in Delaware or only hiring graduates of name-brand universities, a particular practice correlating with notable instances of company growth doesn’t imply causation. Just because a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_bias">popular or successful</a> company uses a technology doesn’t mean that it’s appropriate or worthwhile for your situation.</p>

<h2 id="the-xoogler-effect">The Xoogler effect</h2>

<p>When people leave engineering jobs at big, successful tech companies, they take their former employer’s engineering culture with them. This tends to be highly valuable, for both the technical acumen of the new company and the incoming engineer’s compensation package.</p>

<p>But this tendency can be taken too far. The incoming employee, believing that they have a direct line to the state of the art, may go on to recreate systems in their former employer’s image to an unreasonable degree.</p>

<p>Not to pick on Googlers, but something about that company’s culture really brings this out. There are many notable examples of Xooglers replicating Google-internal systems and practices in the outside world, either as independent startups or efforts within existing companies. I don’t find this terribly surprising, given the tone that’s set within Google—you spend your time there constantly being told that you’re among the best software engineers to walk the face of the Earth, using technologies unmatched in their power, quality, and scalability. It makes sense that former employees feel compelled to emulate things that worked at Google<sup><a id="fn1ref" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>But this generalizes to other large and/or successful companies. Many people leave the productivity bubble of a “FAANG and friends” company and end up building tools and systems that they miss. To name but a few, this is how we got Thrift, Envoy, and <a href="https://bazel.build/">three</a> <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">different</a> <a href="https://buck.build/">tools</a> based on Google’s build system.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-biases">Cognitive biases</h2>

<p>I think these two phenomena can be linked to a handful of widely-known cognitive biases. Cargo culting is a clear manifestation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_bias">authority bias</a>. And the Xoogler effect seems related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument">the law of the instrument</a>.</p>

<p>It’s rational to want to stay within your <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/12/circle-of-competence/">circle of competence</a>, but it can be counterproductive in excess. When you’ve been inculcated in the expert use of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. Your thinking in new environments is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">anchored</a> by prior experience in old environments, which can impede learning and the development of new skills.</p>

<p>And it turns out that these two patterns can feed on each other. Cargo culting is <em>catalyzed by</em> the Xoogler effect in cases when a former big company employee’s experience is uncritically venerated by new colleagues.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-resist-the-urge-to-overengineer">How to resist the urge to overengineer</h2>

<p>Resisting the temptation to overengineer requires one to be honest with themselves about the context in which they’re operating.</p>

<p>You should always design systems to address problems that are in front of you instead of falling for solutions to problems faced by big companies in the past. You shouldn’t base your company’s infrastructure on GitHub stars. And as wistful as you may be for your last company’s tools, they may not be as applicable to your current situation as you think.</p>

<h3 id="assessing-cargo-without-becoming-a-cultist">Assessing cargo without becoming a cultist</h3>

<p>When evaluating a popular tool, language, or convention, it’s worthwhile to take the time to understand the underlying forces that motivated its invention<sup><a id="fn2ref" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. Before making any decisions, try to contextualize a technology within the environment that formed it. From there, you can pattern match that environment to your own in order to determine if the technology is appropriate.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s consider everyone’s favorite overengineering punching bag: Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Kubernetes traces its conceptual lineage to Borg<sup><a id="fn3ref" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>, the cluster-management system that’s run Google’s production workloads for over a dozen years. The main value that Borg provides to Alphabet is its ability to maximize the capital efficiency of their datacenters. The technology that we now call “container orchestration” allowed them to get more computing oomph out of their fleet by maximizing utilization and making more efficient use of machines they’d already paid for.</p>

<p>Is maximizing capital efficiency of your datacenter or cloud environment a concern for your company? If you believe Kubernetes offers other benefits<sup><a id="fn4ref" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>, are you confident that they outweigh the complexity and maintenance overhead?</p>

<p>I find this thought process helpful when evaluating new tools, patterns, frameworks, or management practices. Conventional wisdom advocates that you fully understand a problem before applying a solution to it. It’s also important to understand the conditions that led to a solution and how those conditions align with those you find yourself in.</p>

<p>Regardless of the decision you end up making, this process is likely to make you a better engineer. The job is fundamentally about building systems to solve problems at reasonable cost. That cost is measured not only as upfront capital expenditure, but in the ongoing drag associated with maintenance and cognitive load. More often than we realize, engineering is about right-sizing a solution in light of these ongoing costs.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The intellectual property debate is so hot these days that I can’t wander into a restroom without running across graffiti supporting one side or the other. Some people think that patents and other forms of intellectual property law are the bane of the free universe, and that these laws are not just misguided but actually evil and should be struck down as soon as possible. Others are convinced that pretty much the whole world economy is driven by intellectual property. And those people want to do anything to strengthen the legal status of IP rights. <mark>As a result, the graffiti on the issue gets quite graphic at times.</mark></p>

<p>Of course, most of it is on the virtual restrooms on the Internet, not so much the restrooms in the hotspots of San Jose’s nightlife<label for="sn-1"></label>
<span>
This, as anybody who lives in San Jose can tell you, is called IRONY. San Jose doesn’t have nightlife. People living here drive to San Mateo if they actually want to have fun
</span>.
There’ll be huge flamefests over some specific issue associated with intellectual property law, with people arguing everything from First Amendment rights to whether IP law might make open source development impossible sometime in the future. I find myself certifiably schizophrenic on the issue.</p>

<p>It’s not that I don’t have an opinion: I have very strong opinions on the worth of intellectual property, but they end up being on both sides of the argument. I can tell you, this can be very confusing. It means that I end up arguing both sides. And I think this is because there really are two sides to intellectual property, and they share nothing but the name.</p>

<h2 id="intellectual-property-is-not-property">Intellectual ‘Property’ is not Property</h2>

<p>To many people, including me, intellectual property is all about human inventiveness, about the very thing that makes us humans instead of animals (that, and thumbs, of course). And in that setting, the very name “intellectual property” is an affront: It’s not property to be sold like chattel, it’s the act of creation, it’s the greatest thing any human can ever do. It’s Art, with a capital A. It’s the Mona Lisa, but it’s also the end result of a long night of programming, and it’s an end result that you as a programmer are damned proud of. <mark>It’s something so precious that selling it isn’t even possible: It’s indelibly a part of who you are.</mark></p>

<p>That kind of creativity—whether it be in the form of painting, music, sculpture, writing, or programming—should be sacred. The creator and the thing he or she created have a bond that cannot be severed. It’s like the bond between a mother and child, or between bad Chinese food and MSG. But at the same time it’s something that everybody in the whole world should be able to be part of, because it is humanity.</p>

<p>And then, in the other corner, weighing in at an approximate seven gadzillion billion U.S. dollars a year, intellectual property is huge business. Human creativity got a price tag, and it turned out to be quite expensive. Creativity is rare, and as a result it is not just expensive but also extremely lucrative. Which brings in a totally different class of arguments, and totally different kinds of people. The kind of people who call the end result of human creativity “property.” Not to mention, of course, lawyers.</p>

<p>Read the title of this paper again. The “property” people are winning. After all, their name stuck. So what’s the problem?</p>

<p>The most well-known example of intellectual property is the notion of copyright. Copyrights are basically the codification of the rights of any creator to do with his or her creation as he or she wishes. The “owner” of the creation can decide on how that creation should be used.</p>

<p>Copyrights are also legally very simple to get. You don’t have to register your copyright: You are automatically the copyright holder of whatever creative work you do. This is an important distinction from most other intellectual property law, mainly because it actually makes it easy for individuals, not just big corporations, to own copyrights. You can own a copyright, simply by virtue of writing, painting, or generally creating something unique. If you want to, you can add a legend like “(C) Copyright 2000 Yourname Here,” but quite frankly, you don’t need to. You own the copyright whether you say so or not. Saying so just makes it easier for other people to track you down if they want to use your work.</p>

<p>Of course, just owning a copyright in itself is not very useful. But the fact that you own what you create means that you can control how it is used. You have, for example, the right to sell such a work of art to somebody else, and nobody but the IRS gets to have any say in the matter. But it’s about more than just the money, and that’s where a lot of people seem to find themselves flummoxed.</p>

<p>For example, you can use your power as owner of a copyright to try to do more interesting things than just sell it. You can license it. This is even better than selling it; <mark>instead of selling the work of art you can sell the license to do certain things to it, and still retain the copyright on it. Basically, you can have your cake and eat it, too.</mark> This is how the Microsofts of the world get created: endlessly selling the rights to use something, without actually losing anything. No wonder people just love to own this kind of property.</p>

<h2 id="problems-of-treating-ip-as-property">Problems of Treating IP as Property</h2>

<p>Does anybody perhaps start to see a problem here? If you don’t see anything strange so far, I have a bridge and a few pieces of waterfront property to sell you.</p>

<p>The basic problem with intellectual property is starting to show itself: You as the owner of intellectual property can effectively sell it forever, without ever losing anything yourself. You don’t risk anything, and in fact you might decide to write your license in a way that basically says that even if the property is flawed, you cannot be held responsible in any way. Sounds preposterous? You’d be surprised. So, intellectual property offers no consumer protection.</p>

<p>It gets worse. The copyright holder not only has the right to sell his or her property without losing it, but also the right to sue people who sell property that looks like his or hers. Clearly the copyright owner has rights over that derived work. <em>Clearly</em>? Not so fast.</p>

<p>Where do you draw the line between inspiration and copying? And what happens when different people come up with similar ideas? Who gets the gravy train of being able to sell his idea over and over and over again, and gets to tell the other people to butt out of his business? <mark>It’s not just consumers who aren’t protected, it’s also other creative people who are not protected by the notion of “intellectual property.”</mark></p>

<p>What makes the discussion ugly at this point is that a lot of the arguments for stronger intellectual property rights are based on the notion of giving inventors and artists more “protection.” What people don’t seem to ever realize is that giving such powerful rights to some people also ends up taking rights away from others.</p>

<p>And maybe not so surprisingly, the proponents of stricter intellectual property laws are the organizations that stand to gain the most. Not the artists and inventors themselves, but the clearinghouses of IP: companies that make a living off other people’s creativity. Oh, and lawyers, of course. The end result? Copyright law amendments like the infamous Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which removes the last vestiges of consumer rights over the use of copyrighted material.</p>

<p>Now, if you are getting the notion that I think copyrights are actually detrimental, you’re wrong. I happen to absolutely love copyrights, I just don’t believe in taking the rights of the authors too far. Not to the point of screwing the consumer over. And I say this not just as a consumer, but as a producer of copyrighted material myself, both in the form of this book and of Linux itself.</p>

<p><mark>I, as a copyright holder, have my rights. But with rights come obligations—or as they say in certain neighborhoods, <em>noblesse oblige</em>.</mark> And so I have the obligation to use those rights in responsible ways, and not as a weapon against others who lack such rights. As one great American once declared, “Ask not what your copyright can do for you, ask what you can do for your copyright”—or something to that effect.</p>

<h2 id="patents-make-the-problem-uglier">Patents Make the Problem Uglier</h2>

<p>Copyright is, despite even the DMCA, a fairly mild and well-behaved form of intellectual property. The notion of “fair use” does still exist, and holding a copyright does not give all rights to the work to the copyright holder.</p>

<p>The same cannot be said for patents, trademarks, and trade secrets; the heavy drugs of IP. Discussions over software patents in particular have gotten so inflamed in technical circles that it officially counts as one of the subjects you should not discuss in polite company, along with gun control, abortion rights, medical marijuana, and whether Pepsi tastes better than Coca Cola. And the reason is that patents, in many ways, give control over new inventions similar to that of copyrights, but with few of the redeeming qualities of copyrights.</p>

<p>One of the most awkward issues with patents is that, unlike with copyrights, you don’t get a patent just for inventing something new. No, <mark>you get a patent after you’ve gone through the painful and prolonged process of filing for it with the patent office.</mark> Waiting for the patent office, by the way, is a bit like standing in line at the DMV, but you have to realize that you stand in line with about twelve patent lawyers, and the line is …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
        <time datetime="2020-08-12">2020-08-12</time>
      <p>Let's write some Elixir.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      bar(a, -1)
    else
      bar(a, 1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    IO.inspect(a * b)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Not very useful, but that's good enough for our purpose.</p>
<p>I like Elixir, but I think most of the time it just looks like functional Ruby. I want to make this code look like Elixir.</p>
<p>First, this code is lacking every Elixir developer's best friend: <code>|&gt;</code>. Let's add some <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Meh. It's definitely better, but I mean, that's only 3 <code>|&gt;</code>s. I want more <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<p>We have an <code>if</code> in there, so maybe we can do something with it?</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    (a &lt; 0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>We sure can! That's one more <code>|&gt;</code>. Can we do better than this?</p>
<p>Well... <code>&gt;</code> and <code>*</code> are <code>Kernel</code> functions, so maybe...</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is great, can we keep going?</p>
<p>The Elixir docs say <code>defmodule</code> is just a macro. Does that mean I can just <code>|&gt;</code> into <code>defmodule</code>?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Yes you can!</p>
<p><code>def</code> and <code>defp</code> are macros too right?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>So many pipes! 😍</p>
<p>We're getting somewhere, but something still doesn't feel right. This module really isn't doing much, so maybe it should not be that long? Also, I think we need more <code>:</code>. Atoms are very Elixir-y, so let's do more of that:</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule(do: (
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def(do: a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if(do: a |&gt; bar(-1), else: a |&gt; bar(1)))

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp(do: a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect())
))
</code></pre>
<p>We're <code>:do</code>ing great!</p>
<p>You know what's also very Elixir-y? Lists. Lists and tuples.</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule([{:do, (
  a
  |&gt; foo()
  |&gt; def([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if([{:do, a |&gt; bar(-1)}, {:else, a |&gt; bar(1)}])}])

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()}])
)}])
</code></pre>
<p>Who's going to say this looks like Ruby now? ⚗️</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The most fundamental core of any business relationship is trust. Traditionally this was built through multiple interactions, which included at least in-person meeting.</p><p>It seemed that something about meeting in person helped solidify what was discussed. Whether this is through body language or both parties being able to lower their guards and speak somewhat informally.</p><p>These in-person meetings have been a staple for long-lasting business relationships. However, the ability for these type of interactions has been put on hold thanks to the current pandemic. The startup community has had to adapt to these restrictions and in my opinion, the perfect environment for entrepreneurship was created.</p><p>People with extra time on their hands and nothing to do.</p><p>While I recognize and have experienced the downsides of this pandemic from a business perspective, I try to look at the positives. This motivation is what led to my most recent startup, <a href="https://accordably.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accordably, which is a competitor monitoring solution</a>.</p><h2><strong>How do you find a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>Alright, great, you want to start a business, but how do you actually find a cofounder?</p><p>I wish I could tell you that this was the easy part, but it’s actually probably the hardest.</p><p>It’s going to be a lot of trial and error.</p><p>We are in more restricted social times, so it becomes even more difficult. A good place to start is with previous colleagues that you’ve worked with. You know them from a professional perspective, you’ve seen how they act with colleagues and their work ethic.</p><p>Remember, the stakes are much higher when it’s your own business, so these favourable employee working traits don’t always translate into a good cofounder.</p><p>Personally, I would recommend checking out different digital communities, you’d be surprised who you’ll meet and might find someone that has very similar goals to you.</p><p>My personal favourite community is Indie Hackers. They have a specific group called <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/looking-to-partner-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Looking to partner up”</a> and you will find a wide variety of people looking to start a business.</p><p>I am biased as that’s where I met the cofounder of Accordably.</p><h2><strong><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279,h_356/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png" alt="Remote cofounders of Accordably" width="1279" height="356" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1279/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1.png 1279w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_300/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-300x84.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://accordably.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Version-1-1024x285.png 1024w"></strong></h2><h2><strong>What to look for when choosing a cofounder?</strong></h2><p>The ideal match is someone who is the complete opposite of your skillset. Think of it like an ice hockey team. If your team was all goalies, you’d get nowhere. You need balance and different strengths to help push your product over the top.</p><p>Now one thing that shouldn’t be the complete opposite is your motivation. Finding someone who has the same drive is important or else there could be a growing resentment in your near future.</p><p>No two situations are the same and this is why it’s difficult to find a cofounder. There needs to be the right mix of similar professional goals and differing skillsets to build a strong tandem.</p><p>Another important attribute is whether you can see yourself getting along with this person from a social perspective. Face it, you’re going to have to spend a lot of time speaking with this person and planning out the future of your business.</p><p>There are some personality types that just don’t mix. Even if your skillsets are the perfect match, your mental health could be at risk if find yourself in a toxic work relationship.</p><p>For me, building a startup isn’t necessarily about the money (I mean it helps of course!) but it’s an outlet where my voice has a direct impact on the future of the business. I can test out crazy ideas and not worry about angry investors or upsetting management.</p><h2><strong>How to build trust when you’ve never met?</strong></h2><p>Just because you meet somebody in person doesn’t automatically create trust. Everyone has their own problems and you’ll never truly understand all the factors that go into their decisions.</p><p>So how do you build trust?</p><p>Time.</p><p>It takes time to build trust, you need to learn each others working habits, personalities and goals. After 2 weeks of working together, you should have a good understanding of the other person.</p><p>Of course, 2 weeks isn’t enough to jump into anything long term, but it will give you a good idea of direction and at that point, you can choose whether or not to continue.</p><p>While you should protect yourself, there’s no need to waste money on lawyers right at the start. Just write up a basic agreement that lays out your agreed upon terms and that you will revisit at a later stage.</p><p>Even with an agreement created by lawyers, you can get screwed over, so don’t worry about this too much at the start.</p><h2><strong>Finding the right idea</strong></h2><p>You’ve assembled a strong team, your skills match perfectly and you’re ready to go, but you’re missing one thing.</p><p>The idea!</p><p>This is difficult because whatever you choose you will be committing a large chunk of time to it, so you don’t want to make the wrong choice and get startup remorse.</p><p>Now I can’t stress this enough, no matter what you choose, make sure that it genuinely interests you. I’ve been in many situations that after the initial sparkle of an idea wears off, I’m stuck with a product that I find soul-crushingly boring.</p><p>The product may make money, but if you don’t enjoy it, it’s not worth it.</p><p>The approach that we took was rather than getting stuck in analysis paralysis, we just started with something.</p><p>We started working on a server-side web analytics solution and testing the market on this idea. We focused on building the infrastructure and easily transferable parts that we could use for other ideas.</p><p>After about a month of building, two things happened:</p><ol><li>We had enough time to see if our working styles meshed, which they did.</li><li>An idea popped up from a client request that we both believed in.</li></ol><p>Long story short, instead of beating your head against a wall trying to find the perfect idea, <strong>just start! </strong></p><p>Start with anything, inspiration will come, staying stagnant will just make you another wantrepreneur.</p><h2><strong>Maintaining communication</strong></h2><p>When it comes to remote cofounders the importance of communication is multiplied. Setting up the proper channels and maintaining a clear schedule is critical for success.</p><p>Keeping your teammate informed of your daily/weekly goals helps motivate and set accountability.</p><p>It’s very easy to procrastinate when you’re “the boss” but when you see your cofounder working their ass off and you’re doing nothing, that guilt should set in. Unless of course, you’re a prick.</p><p>Our main communication hub is Slack and we have integrated all of our tools to send notifications to this platform. This is our main dashboard and it helps keeps us on the same page for the health of the business.</p><p>Figure out what works for your duo and run with it. For us, we will have one or two calls a week and then for the smaller topics, just send each other audios clips.</p><p>This style has worked for us because when a thought is fresh, you can send a quick audio snippet and the other can listen to it when they have time.</p><p>Getting sidetracked is a big problem, so try to stay on goal and not overcommunicate with long phone calls every day.</p><p>One piece of advice that I can share when it comes to communication is that tone is not conveyed properly over text. I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen people get upset over an email or Slack message from a misunderstanding in tone.</p><p>In this digital world, don’t forget how to communicate. Jumping to conclusions or negatives will just set your team back. Clarify before making an unnecessary enemy.</p><h2><strong>Trust your gut</strong></h2><p>There is no one size fits all formula to finding a cofounder. People aren’t predictable. It takes time to find the right fit.</p><p>The one constant is your gut because no matter who you choose, you’re going to have to take a chance.</p><p>You could get burned or feel like you’re doing all the work, that’s just collateral damage in the life of an entrepreneur.</p><p>All that you can do is work with the information you’re given and decide if you believe in your cofounder. When it works, it works and you’ll eventually see success.</p><p>That’s what we’re working towards with Accordably and we’re excited to see what’s next for this project.</p></div></div></div>]]>

            <p>
    Posted on June  4, 2019
</p>



<p>This post is a write-up of a solution to part of a programming puzzle I did yesterday. It’s a little different than the usual “solution + theory” approach, though: I’m going to talk about the actual steps you’d need to take to get to the solution (i.e.&nbsp;what to google, what intermediate code looks like, etc.). Often write ups like this are presented as finished artefacts, with little info on the tricks or techniques the author used to jog their intuition into figuring out the puzzle (or where some intermediate step requires a leap of insight). In actual fact, this particular puzzle requires almost no insight <em>at all</em>: I’m going to show how to get to a working solution without understanding any of the theory behind it!</p>
<p>Spoilers ahead for the google foobar problem “Distract the Guards”.</p>

<p>We’re interested in a particular type of sequences of pairs of numbers. These sequences are generated from a starting pair <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>m</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m</annotation></semantics></math> like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>m</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m</annotation></semantics></math> are equal, the sequence stops.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the smaller number is subtracted from the larger, and then the smaller is doubled, and the sequence continues with these two numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s an example starting with 3 and 5:</p>
<pre><code>     3, 5
     6, 2
     4, 4
---- done ----</code></pre>
<p>Once it hits <code>4, 4</code>, the first condition is met, and the sequence stops. Not all of these sequences stop, however:</p>
<pre><code>     1, 4
     2, 3
     1, 4
---- done ---- </code></pre>
<p>As you can see, in this case we loop back around to <code>1, 4</code>: our task is to figure out, given a pair of numbers, whether the sequence generated by them loops forever, or stops at some point.</p>

<p>This step is crucial: before trying to figure out any of the deep mathematics behind the problem, write the dumbest thing that could work. You’re going to need it, anyway, to test your faster versions against, and besides, it might be good enough as-is!</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>def</span> sequence(n,m):</span>
<span id="cb3-2">    <span>while</span> n <span>!=</span> m:</span>
<span id="cb3-3">        <span>yield</span> (n,m)</span>
<span id="cb3-4">        <span>if</span> n <span>&lt;</span> m:</span>
<span id="cb3-5">            m <span>-=</span> n</span>
<span id="cb3-6">            n <span>*=</span> <span>2</span></span>
<span id="cb3-7">        <span>else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb3-8">            n <span>-=</span> m</span>
<span id="cb3-9">            m <span>*=</span> <span>2</span></span>
<span id="cb3-10"></span>
<span id="cb3-11"><span>def</span> loops(xs):</span>
<span id="cb3-12">    seen <span>=</span> <span>set</span>()</span>
<span id="cb3-13">    <span>for</span> x <span>in</span> xs:</span>
<span id="cb3-14">        <span>if</span> x <span>in</span> seen:</span>
<span id="cb3-15">            <span>return</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb3-16">        <span>else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb3-17">            seen.add(x)</span>
<span id="cb3-18">    <span>return</span> <span>False</span></span>
<span id="cb3-19"></span>
<span id="cb3-20"><span>def</span> solution(n,m):</span>
<span id="cb3-21">    <span>return</span> loops(sequence(n,m))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first function actually generates the sequence we’re interested in: it uses python’s generators to do so. The second function is just a generic function that checks a sequence for duplicates. Finally, the last function answers the question we’re interested in.</p>

<p>Next, we want to try and spot some patterns in the answers the function generates. Remember, we’re not really interested in figuring out the theory at this point: if we find out that a loop only happens when both numbers are even (for instance), that’s good enough for us and we can stop there!</p>
<p>We humans are pattern-matching machines: to leverage our abilities, though, we will need to visualise the data somehow. In this case, I’m going to plot a simple scatter graph to the terminal, using the following code (I apologise for my terrible indentation style):</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>print</span>(</span>
<span id="cb4-2">    <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>.join(</span>
<span id="cb4-3">        <span>''</span>.join(</span>
<span id="cb4-4">            <span>'*'</span> <span>if</span> solution(x,y) <span>else</span> <span>' '</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5">            <span>for</span> x <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>1</span>,<span>81</span>)</span>
<span id="cb4-6">        )</span>
<span id="cb4-7">        <span>for</span> y <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>100</span>,<span>0</span>,<span>-</span><span>1</span>)</span>
<span id="cb4-8">    )</span>
<span id="cb4-9">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And we get the following output:</p>

Nissan also limited the payment options their customers had to retrieve their illegally repossessed vehicles, forcing them to only select a payment option with high fees.</p><p>The $4M settlement with The CFPB is a “slap on the wrist” and a “cost of doing business” for Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp.</p><p>Similarly to the recent fines levied against <a href="https://yourautoadvocate.com/guides/bmw-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BMW for fraudulently reporting sales figures</a> to investors, the automotive industry never ceases to amaze us in how deceptive and unfair it can be.

<p>One of the goals of JuliaMono is to include most of the characters that a typical programmer would reasonably expect to find. (Except for all those emojis - they are best handled by the operating system.) Here’s a thousand or so chosen at random:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/unicode-sample.svg" width="100%" alt="Unicode sampler"></p><p>In JuliaMono, every character is the same width, because this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced</a> typeface. Usually, typefaces with a lot of Unicode mathematical symbols are not monospaced, because they’re intended for use in prose and \( \LaTeX \) applications, rather than in programming code.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, forcing every character into the same size box is a problem. It’s like fitting every human being of whatever shape or size into identical airplane seats - some characters are bound to look uncomfortable. There’s never quite enough room for a nice-looking “m” or “w”.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Evizero/UnicodePlots.jl">UnicodePlots.jl</a> uses various Unicode characters to plot figures directly in a terminal window. <sup id="fnref:linespacing"><a href="#fndef:linespacing">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/unicodeplots.png" alt="UnicodePlots in action"></p><p><a href="https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageInTerminal.jl">ImageInTerminal.jl</a> is similarly awesome, conjuring images from Unicode characters:</p>

<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/imageinterminal.png" alt="ImageInTerminal"></p><p>JuliaMono is quite greedy<sup id="fnref:greedy"><a href="#fndef:greedy">[7]</a></sup>, and contains a lot of Unicode glyphs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/juliamono/barchart.svg" width="100%" alt="silly barchart"></p><p>(Of course, size isn’t everything - quality can beat quantity, and other fonts will offer different experiences<sup id="fnref:otherfonts"><a href="#fndef:otherfonts">[8]</a></sup>).</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to support box-drawing characters and DataFrames.jl output (terminal permitting):</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; df = DataFrame(A=samples, B=glyphs)
df = 10×2 DataFrame

<p>(Can you spot the little used and sadly mathematically-unsupported "times" character?)</p>
<p>If you want to know whether you can use a Unicode character as an identifier in your Julia code, use the undocumented function <code>Base.isidentifier()</code>. So, for example, if you have the urge to use a dingbat (one of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapf_Dingbats">Herman Zapf dingbat</a> designs), you could look for something suitable in the output of this:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; for n in 0x2700:0x27bf
			Base.isidentifier(string(Char(n))) &amp;&amp; print(Char(n))

<p>JuliaMono is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType">OpenType</a> typeface. OpenType technology provides powerful text positioning, pattern matching, and glyph substitution features, which are essential for languages such as Arabic and Urdu. In English, OpenType features are often seen when letter pairs such as <span>fi</span> in certain fonts are replaced by a single glyph such as <span>ﬁ</span>. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_ligature">ligatures</a> have been used ever since printing with moveable type was invented, replacing the occasional awkward character combination with a better-looking alternative.</p>
<p>To be honest, I’m not a big fan of their use in coding fonts (and I’m not the only one<sup id="fnref:nottheonlyone"><a href="#fndef:nottheonlyone">[9]</a></sup>). I like to see exactly what I’ve typed, rather than what the font has decided to replace it with. But, there are a few places in Julia where suitable Unicode alternatives are not accepted by the language, and where I feel that the ASCII-art confections currently used can be gently enhanced by the judicious use of alternate glyphs. There are also a few places where some subtle tweaks can enhance the readability of the language without introducing ambiguity.</p>
<p>In JuliaMono, the following substitutions are applied when the <strong>contextual alternates</strong> feature is active:</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
    <th><p>typed</p></th>
    <th><p>displayed</p></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>-&gt;</td>
    <td>-&gt;</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td>=&gt;</td>
    <td>=&gt;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>|&gt;</td>
    <td>|&gt;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>&lt;|</td>
    <td>&lt;|</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>::</td>
    <td>::</td>
    </tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>You can see these in action in the following code fragment:<sup id="fnref:width"><a href="#fndef:width">[10]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>julialang = true # (!= 0)
(x, y) -&gt; (x + y)
f(p::Int) = p * p
@inbounds if f in (Base.:+, Base.:-)
    if any(x -&gt; x &lt;: AbstractArray{&lt;:Number})
         nouns = Dict(
            Base.:+ =&gt; "addition",
            Base.:- =&gt; "subtraction",
        )
    end
end
df2 = df |&gt;
    @groupby(_.a) |&gt;
    @map({a = key(_), b = mean(_.b)}) |&gt;
    DataFrame # &lt;|</code></pre>
<p>OpenType fonts also offer you the ability to choose different designs for certain characters. These are stored as a ‘stylistic set’.</p>
<p>All the options are stored in the font, and are often referred to by their internal four letter code (not the best user-oriented design, really). For example, the contextual alternates listed above are collectively stored in the <strong>calt</strong> feature.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an application will show the options more visually in a Typography panel<sup id="fnref:typographypanel"><a href="#fndef:typographypanel">[11]</a></sup>, usually tucked away somewhere on a Font chooser dialog.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of the stylistic sets currently available in JuliaMono.</p>

<p>
     The instruction set of the PDP-11 was designed towards a clean,
     general, symmetric instruction set.  It can be used as a
     register-based, stack-based, or memory-based machine, depending
     on the programmer's preferences.  Interrupt responsiveness is
     also important, supported with multiple interrupt levels for
     real-time computing as well as allowing for a separate interrupt
     handler for each device that generates interrupts.
</p><p>
     Word length is 16 bits with the leftmost, most significant bit
     (MSB) being bit 15.  There are eight general registers of 16 bits
     each.  Register 7 is the program counter (PC) and, by convention,
     Register 6 is the stack pointer (SP).  There is also a Processor
     Status Register/Word (PSW) which indicates the 4 condition code
     bits (N, Z, V, C), the Trace Trap bit, processor interrupt
     priority, and 4 bits for current and previous operating modes.
     Addressing on the -11 is linear from memory address 0 through
     177777.  Memory management allows access to physical memory with
     addresses of up to 22 bits (17777777).  All I/O devices,
     registers etc are addressed as if they were part of memory.
     These live in the 4KW of reserved memory space at the top of the
     addressing range.  Additionally, on most implementations of the
     PDP-11 architecture, the processor's registers are memory-mapped
     to the range 17777700-17777717 (there are many control registers
     beyond just the general registers, the specifics vary between
     implementations).  Thus Register 2 (R2) has an address of
     17777702.  All word memory addresses are even, except for registers.
     In byte operations, an even address specifies the least-significant
     byte and an odd address specifies the most-significant byte.
     Specifying an odd byte in a word operation will return an odd
     address trap.  Memory addresses from 0 to 400 octal are reserved
     for various exception traps such as timeouts, reserved
     instructions, parity, etc., and device interrupts.
</p><p>
     Addressing for the Single Operand, Double Operand and
     Jump instructions is achieved via six bits:
</p><pre>                          _ _ _ _ _ _
                         |x|x|x|_|_|_|
                         |Mode |Reg  |
</pre><p>
     where the modes are as follows: (Reg = Register, Def = Deferred)
</p><pre>     Mode 0  Reg           Direct addressing of the register
     Mode 1  Reg Def       Contents of Reg is the address
     Mode 2  AutoIncr      Contents of Reg is the address, then Reg incremented
     Mode 3  AutoIncrDef   Content of Reg is addr of addr, then Reg Incremented
     Mode 4  AutoDecr      Reg is decremented then contents is address
     Mode 5  AutoDecrDef   Reg is decremented then contents is addr of addr
     Mode 6  Index         Contents of Reg + Following word is address
     Mode 7  IndexDef      Contents of Reg + Following word is addr of addr
</pre><p>
     Note that the right-most bit of the mode is an indirection bit.
</p><p>
     Although not special cases, when dealing with R7 (aka the PC), some of
     these operations are called different things:
</p><pre>                          _ _ _ _ _ _
                         |x|x|x|1|1|1|
                         |Mode |  R7 |

     Mode 2  Immediate     Operand follows the instruction
     Mode 3  Absolute      Address of Operand follows the instruction
     Mode 6  Relative      Instr address+4+Next word is Address
     Mode 7  RelativeDef   Instr address+4+Next word is Address of address
</pre><p>
     Mainstream instructions are broken into Single operand and Double
     operand instructions, which in turn can be word or byte instructions.
</p>
<h2>Double Operand Instructions</h2>
<pre>                      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
                     |b|i|i|i|s|s|s|s|s|s|d|d|d|d|d|d|
                     | |     |     :     |     :     |
                     | | Op  | Source    |  Dest     |
</pre><p>
     Bit 15, b, generally selects between word-sized (b=0) and
     byte-sized (b=1) operands.  In the table below, the mnemonics and
     names are given in the order b=0/b=1.
</p><p>
     The double operand instructions are:
</p><dl>
          <dt>b 000 ssssss dddddd
              </dt><dd>Non-double-operand instructions.
</dd><dt>b 001 ssssss dddddd -- MOV/MOVB  <i>Move Word/Byte</i>

              </dt><dd>Compares values by subtracting the destination
              from the source, setting the condition codes, and
              then discarding the result of the subtraction.
</dd><dt>b 011 ssssss dddddd -- BIT/BITB  <i>Bit Test Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Performs a bit-wise AND of the source and the
              destination, sets the condition codes, and then
              discards the result of the AND.
</dd><dt>b 100 ssssss dddddd -- BIC/BICB  <i>Bit Clear Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>For each bit set in the source, that bit is cleared
              in the destination.  This is accomplished by taking the

     Bit 15, b, generally selects between word-sized (b=0) and
     byte-sized (b=1) operands.  In the table below, the mnemonics and
     names are given in the order b=0/b=1.  Unless otherwise stated,
     the operand is read for the data to operate on, and the result is
     then written over that data.
</p><p>
     The single operand instructions are:
</p><dl>

              </dt><dd>Swap bytes exchanges the two bytes found in the
              destination, writing the result back to it.
<p>
              The branch (b=1) is described in the section on
              branches, below.
</p><p>
              Note that SWAB is actually a bit pattern from the
              range reserved for branches.  This particular
              pattern is otherwise unused, as it would be a
              modification of BR, Branch Always, which has no
              obvious semantics.

</dd><dt>b 000 101 001 dddddd -- COM/COMB   <i>Complement Word/Byte</i>
              </dt><dd>Calculates the ones-complement of the operand,
              and stores it.  The ones-complement is formed by
              inverting each bit (0-&gt;1, 1-&gt;0) independently.
</dd><dt>b 000 101 010 dddddd -- INC/INCB   <i>Increment Word/Byte</i>

		</div><p>BERLIN — The European Union aims to spend up to €10 billion over the next seven years to help build up a homegrown cloud computing sector that could rival foreign corporations such as Amazon, Google and Alibaba.</p>
<p>Twenty-five EU countries signed a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/towards-next-generation-cloud-europe" target="_blank">joint declaration</a> Thursday pledging public money to power up the cloud sector and establishing the "European Alliance on Industrial Data and Cloud," a partnership geared toward facilitating such projects.</p>
<p>The alliance — whose funding is to be drawn from existing EU programs and hoped-for pledges from industry and national capitals — will be launched by the end of the year. Cyprus and Denmark were the only EU member countries not to sign the declaration due to “technical reasons.”</p>
<p>The declaration “is a foundation stone for the establishment of European cloud technology, which will be very high performing,” said Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, following a meeting of European telecoms ministers organized by the German government, which currently holds the EU’s rotating Council presidency.</p>
<p>“Contrary to the prejudices, we are not late [on cloud development]. We are the first to get involved in the industrial cloud,” he added.</p>
<blockquote><p>“EU governments and the public sector need to be fully committed to the initiative by fully shifting to cloud services” — <em>Lise Fuhr, ETNO’s director general</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The cloud alliance is a key part of the European Commission’s data strategy, which aims to create a single market for industrial data. Commissioner Breton in particular has lobbied hard to make the EU a worldwide data hub, and to develop data processing capabilities that would give Europe an edge over foreign rivals that currently dominate the cloud business.</p>
<p>It also fits in with broader efforts by European policymakers to make the Continent less dependent on foreign technology. Currently, U.S. technology firms dominate the global market for cloud storage.</p>
<p>In the same vein, the bloc is set to unveil by December a rulebook for platforms dubbed the “Digital Services Act," as well as binding laws for artificial intelligence that are set to be released early next year.</p>
<p>The new alliance will have the mandate to develop business, investment and implementation plans for European cloud technologies in the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Signatories also pledge to create common European standards and policy norms to create pan-European cloud services, and help small and medium-sized businesses, startups and the public sector embrace cloud technology.</p>
<p>“In order to achieve digital sovereignty, we need to start approaching data processing the way major American and Chinese companies — the hyper-scalers — approach it,” said German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier.</p>
<p>“This is an area where we’re far from being equals,” he added.</p>
<h3>Money, money, money</h3>
<p>The Commission’s plan is to invest up to €10 billion to develop Europe's cloud and data infrastructures.</p>
<p>The EU’s executive arm would invest €2 billion from programs in its long-term budget such as the Digital Europe Programme, Connecting Europe Facility 2 and InvestEU.</p>
<p>The rest of the money will come from both industry and member countries. National governments will be able to fund these projects through the EU’s coronavirus recovery plan, which has earmarked 20 percent toward digital projects.</p>
<p>The joint cloud declaration also issues demands to non-European cloud companies.</p>
<p>Cloud providers must “guarantee European standards in terms of security, data protection, consumer protection, data portability and energy efficiency and contribute to European digital sovereignty.”</p>
<p>The companies must offer “adequate assurance” that the EU will maintain control over its strategic and sensitive data.</p>
<p>“While all cloud providers are welcome in European cloud federation, the resulting cloud capacities should not be subject to laws of foreign jurisdictions,” the declaration read.</p>
<p>One of the first initiatives to come out of Europe’s cloud push is Gaia-X, a much-hyped European effort spearheaded by Germany and France to build up a European platform that sets common standards for cloud technology. Gaia-X has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1449266">limited</a> the voting rights of non-European cloud computing companies, and they cannot become directors of the association.</p>
<p>ETNO, the association representing Europe’s leading telecom operators, applauded the move.</p>
<p>“EU governments and the public sector need to be fully committed to the initiative by fully shifting to cloud services. We call for EU targets and commitments that reflect the demand side of the cloud investment story,” said Lise Fuhr, ETNO’s director general.</p>
<p>Tech lobby DigitalEurope was equally supportive, and announced it was applying for membership in Gaia-X.</p>

  <h2 id="intro">
  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Previously, we took a <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pytorch-pipeline/">simple video pipeline</a> and made it as fast as we could without sacrificing the flexibility of the Python runtime. It’s amazing how far you can go — <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/">9 FPS to 650 FPS</a> — but we did not reach full hardware utilization and the pipeline did not scale linearly beyond a single GPU. There is evidence (measured using <a href="https://github.com/chrisjbillington/gil_load">gil_load</a>) that we were throttled by a fundamental Python limitation with multiple threads fighting over the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Global Interpreter Lock</a> (GIL).</p>
<p>In this article we’ll take performance of the same <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">SSD300 model</a> even further, leaving Python behind and moving towards true production deployment technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html"><strong>TorchScript.</strong></a> Instead of running directly in the Pytorch runtime, we’ll export our model using TorchScript tracing into a form that can be executed portably using the <code>libtorch</code> C++ runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt"><strong>TensorRT.</strong></a> This toolset from Nvidia includes a “deep learning inference optimizer” — a compiler for optimizing CUDA-based computational graphs. We’ll use this to squeeze out every drop of inference efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk"><strong>DeepStream.</strong></a> While <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">Gstreamer</a> gives us an extensive library of elements to build media pipelines with, DeepStream expands this library with a set of GPU-accelerated elements specialized for machine learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These technologies fit together like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/deepstream_hybrid.svg" alt="DeepStream Hybrid Architecture"></p>
<p>This article will not be a step-by-step tutorial with code examples, but will show what is possible when these technologies are combined. The associated repository is here: <a href="https://github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline">github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline</a>.</p>
<h3 id="torchscript-vs-tensorrt">
  🔥TorchScript vs TensorRT🔥
  <a href="#torchscript-vs-tensorrt">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Both TorchScript and TensorRT can produce a deployment-ready form of our model, so why do we need both? These great tools may eventually be competitors but in 2020 they are complementary — they each have weaknesses that are compensated for by the other.</p>
<p><strong>TorchScript.</strong> With a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code we can generate a deployment-ready asset from essentially any Pytorch model that will run anywhere libtorch runs. It’s not inherently faster (it is submitting approximately the same sequence of kernels) but the libtorch runtime will perform better under high concurrency. However, without care TorchScript output may have performance and portability surprises (I’ll cover some of these in a later article).</p>
<p><strong>TensorRT.</strong> An unparalleled model compiler for Nvidia hardware, but for Pytorch or <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a>-based models it has incomplete support and suffers from poor portability. There is a plugin system to add arbitrary layers and postprocessing, but this low-level work is out of reach for groups without specialized deployment teams. TensorRT also doesn’t support cross-compilation so models must be optimized directly on the target hardware — not great for embedded platforms or highly diverse compute ecosystems.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with a baseline from the previous post in this series — <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/">Object Detection from 9 FPS to 650 FPS in 6 Steps</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-pipeline-tuning/#stage-2-postprocessing-on-gpu">Postprocessing on GPU</a> stage from my previous post is logically closest to our first DeepStream pipeline. This was a fairly slow, early stage in the Python-based optimization journey but limitations in DeepStream around batching and memory transfer make this the best comparison.</p>
<p>This Python-based pipeline runs at around 80 FPS:</p>








<p>After we get a basic DeepStream pipeline up and running we’ll empirically understand and then remove the limitations we see.</p>

<p>Our approach to using TorchScript and TensorRT together in a DeepStream pipeline will be to construct a hybrid model with two sequential components — a TensorRT frontend passing results to a TorchScript backend which completes the calculation.</p>
<h3 id="hybrid-deepstream-pipeline">
  Hybrid DeepStream Pipeline
  <a href="#hybrid-deepstream-pipeline">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Our hybrid pipeline will eventually use the <code>nvinfer</code> element of DeepStream to serve a TensorRT-compiled form of the SSD300 model directly in the media pipeline. Since TensorRT cannot compile the entire model (due to unsupported <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> ops) we’ll run the remaining operations as a TorchScript module (via <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/plugin-manual/index.html#page/DeepStream%20Plugins%20Development%20Guide/deepstream_plugin_details.html#wwpID0E0TDB0HA">the <code>parse-bbox-func-name</code> hook</a>).</p>
<p>However, the first pipeline will be the simplest possible while still following the hybrid pattern. The TensorRT model does no processing and simply passes frames to the TorchScript model, which does all preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing. 0% TensorRT, 100% TorchScript.</p>
<p>This pipeline runs at 110 FPS without tracing overhead. However, this TorchScript model has already been converted to <code>fp16</code> precision so a direct comparison to the Python-based pipeline is a bit misleading.</p>








<p>Let’s drill into the trace with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems">Nvidia’s Nsight Systems</a> to understand the patterns of execution. I have zoomed in to the processing for two 16-frame batches:</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_batch.png">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_batch_hu85cb8d526cf1fda403db89df3e60bf80_432723_896x520_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="520">
        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>Looking at the red NVTX ranges on the <code>GstNvInfer</code> line we can see overlapping ranges where batches of 16 frames are being processed. However, the pattern of processing on the GPU is quite clear from the 16 utilisation spikes — it is processing frame-by-frame.  We also see constant memory transfers between device and host.</p>
<p>Drilling in to see just two frames of processing, the pattern is even more clear:</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_frame.png">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/images/ds_100pc_torchscript_normal_ds_two_frame_hudc758a7e69d7157937e6a1d7caab6946_421239_896x540_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="540">
        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>With a little knowledge of how DeepStream works the problem is clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> sends batches of frames to the configured model engine (our empty TensorRT component) — great.</li>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> then sends the model output <em>frame by frame</em> to the postprocessing hook (our TorchScript component).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we have put our entire model into a TorchScript postprocessing hook we are now processing frame by frame with no batching, and this is causing very low GPU utilisation. (This is why we are comparing against a Python pipeline with no batching).</p>
<p><strong>We are using DeepStream contrary to the design</strong>, but to build a truly hybrid TensorRT and TorchScript pipeline we need batched postprocessing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DeepStream Limitation: Postprocessing Hooks are Frame-by-Frame</strong></p>
<p>The design of <code>nvinfer</code> assumes model output will be postprocessed frame-by-frame. This makes writing postprocessing code a tiny bit easier but is inefficient by default. Preprocessing, inference and postprocessing logic should always assume a batch dimension is present.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Nsight Systems view above also shows a pointless sequence of device-to-host then host-to-device transfers. The purple device-to-host memory transfer is due to <code>nvinfer</code> sending tensors to system memory, ready for the postprocessing code to use it. The green host-to-device transfers are me putting this memory back on the GPU where it belongs.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DeepStream Limitation: Postprocessing is Assumed to Happen on Host</strong></p>
<p>This is a legacy of early machine learning approaches. Modern deep learning pipelines keep data on the GPU end-to-end, including data augmentation and postprocessing. See Nvidia’s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/DALI">DALI library</a> for an example of this.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay, time to hack DeepStream and remove these limitations.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Nvidia have provided source for the <code>nvinfer</code> pipeline element. I’ve made two changes to better support our approach of doing significant work in the postprocessing hook and fix the above limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nvinfer</code> model engine output is now sent in a single batch to the postprocessing hook.</li>
<li>Model output tensors are no-longer copied to host, but are left on the device.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  These <code>nvinfer</code> changes are unreleased and are not present in the companion repository (<a href="https://github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline">github.com/pbridger/deepstream-video-pipeline</a>) because they are clearly derivative of <code>nvinfer</code> and I’m unsure of the licensing. Nvidia people, feel free to get in touch: <a href="mailto:paul@paulbridger.com">paul@paulbridger.com</a>.
</blockquote>

<p>With hacked DeepStream and no model changes at all this pipeline now hits 350 FPS when measured with no tracing overhead. This is up from 110 FPS with regular DeepStream. I think we deserve a chart:</p>








<p>The <code>Concurrency 1x2080Ti</code> stage from the Python pipeline is now the closest comparison both in terms of FPS and optimizations applied. Both pipelines have batched inference, video frames decoded and processed on GPU end-to-end, and concurrency at the batch level (note the overlapping NVTX ranges below). One additional level of concurrency in the Python pipeline is multiple overlapping CUDA streams.</p>
<p>The Nsight Systems view shows processing for several 16-frame batches:</p>

    </figure>
</a>

<p>We now have good GPU utilization and very few needless memory transfers, so the path forward is to optimize the TorchScript model. Until now the TensorRT component has been entirely pass-through and everything from preprocessing, inference and postprocessing has been in TorchScript.</p>
<p>It’s time to start using the TensorRT optimizer, so get ready for some excitement.</p>

<p>According to Nvidia, TensorRT <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt">“dramatically accelerates deep learning inference performance”</a> so why not compile 100% of our model with TensorRT?</p>
<p>The Pytorch export to TensorRT consists of a couple of steps, and both provide an opportunity for incomplete support:</p>

<li>Export the Pytorch model to the <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> interchange representation via <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html#tracing-vs-scripting">tracing or scripting</a>.</li>
<li>Compile the ONNX representation into a TensorRT engine, the optimized form of the model.</li>

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.

<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

			<p>This is a technical write up of the author’s investigation on how users of Samsung phones in Hong Kong (and Macau), using firmware released in September 2020, would be forced to use a public DNS service in Mainland China, which caused unease and privacy concerns among some of its users.</p>
<p>While this was investigated on a variant of a Galaxy Note 10+ phone targetting the Hong Kong market, it was reported that the issue exists for a wide range of recent Samsung phones, including those sold in other places when used in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(Update: The firmware update released in Mid-October 2020 has fixed the DNS issue discussed in this Part, but the issue of DNS queries for <code>qq.com</code> discussed in <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/15/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users-2/">Part 2</a> remained unchanged.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Shameless plug (for Hong Kong users): The author is the developer of Headuck Call blocker (useful only in Hong Kong). Earlier it got mistakenly flagged as malware by Google and lost many of its users, but the appeal was successful and the App is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headuck.headuckblocker.dev">on Google Play</a> again. Please re-consider the App if you got scared by the earlier Google Play malware warning.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In early October 2020, a Samsung phone user in Hong Kong, local forum (HKEPC) user dingwinslow209, <a href="https://www.hkepc.com/forum/viewthread.php?fid=168&amp;tid=2586830">reported that (link to forum post in Chinese)</a> an extra DNS server entry, <code>114.114.114.114</code> was added to the DNS setting of his Samsung mobile phone, which was updated with the latest firmware, whenever he was using a WiFi connection.&nbsp; This happened both when the DNS setting is static, or dynamic using DHCP (but not when VPN / mobile network was used).&nbsp; Even when both DNS1 and DNS2 were set to valid DNS servers (e.g. Google public DNS service using <code>DNS1 = 8.8.8.8</code> and <code>DNS2 = 8.8.4.4</code>), a new DNS3 entry pointing to <code>114.114.114.114</code> would appear in some utility app.</p>
<p>This immediately raised privacy concerns among some Samsung users in Hong Kong, as the public DNS server <code>114.114.114.114</code> is owned by Cogent Communications, under <a href="https://www.whois.com/whois/114.114.114.114">Nanjing XinFeng Information Technologies Inc</a>, in Mainland China.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in another local forum (lihkg), users captured DNS requests to <code>114.114.114.114</code>, and observed queries for “<code>qq.com</code>”&nbsp; (domain owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent), even when no software from Tencent is installed in the devices.&nbsp; There were reports that these DNS queries were sent once per minute, so long as the phone screen remained on.</p>
<p>There are further reports that when DNS queries to qq.com were blocked, the phone would report no internet connectivity via the WiFi connection.</p>
<p>The observation of the extra DNS entry was later independently confirmed by other forum users and the local media, using recent Samsung phones which have been updated in recent months.&nbsp; (See the links in the HKPEC post above, in Chinese).&nbsp; The issue persisted even when users reset their Samsung phone to factory settings. This showed that the issue originates from Samsung firmware instead of some third-party software malware.</p>
<p>The following documents the technical investigation and verification of the issue directly from analysing the code from firmware.&nbsp; The information should be sufficient for the issue and its extent to be independently verified.</p>
<h3>Getting and extracting the firmware</h3>
<p>To confirm the issue, a recent Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ firmware (SM-N9750 TGY, Hong Kong version), at Security Patch level 2020-09-01 was downloaded from one of the Samsung firmware download sites. Galaxy Note 10+ is one of the Samsung models reportedly&nbsp;affected.</p>
<p>After unzipping the downloaded firmware (in zip format), expanding the tar file beginning with “<code>AP_N9750ZSU3CTH1</code>“, decompressing the file <code>system.img.ext4.lz4</code> using <code>lz4</code>, converting it to ext4 format using <code>simg2img</code>, and mounting it as ext4 volume under Linux, one has access to the system image which would be installed when Note 10+ users update their phone to that patch level. (The same is accessible if a Note 10+ phone is rooted).</p>
<p>After some research, the culprit was found – a vendor specific service level component, added by Samsung to the Android framework, located at <code>/system/framework/wifi-service.jar</code>. This seems to work at the android system service level, supplementing the usual <code>services.jar</code>.</p>
<p>The decompiled source of the jar file (using <a href="http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk">this site</a>, with Jadx decompiler) has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY">https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY</a>.&nbsp; The following is a walkthrough of the relevant code when a user connects to a WiFi network, showing how the DNS entries were modified.</p>
<h3>Relevant flow of DNS entry addition</h3>
<p>The main culprit is the class <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiConnectivityMonitor</code>, located in the file <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a>. The decompiled code contains the following:</p>
<p>line 129: the hardcoded address <code>114.114.114.114</code></p>
<pre>private static final String CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP = "114.114.114.114";</pre>
<p>line 878: addresses used for DNS probe (to be covered in next part).</p>
<pre>public final String DEFAULT_URL = "http://www.google.com";
public final String DEFAULT_URL_CHINA = "http://www.qq.com";
public String DEFAULT_URL_STRING = "www.google.com";
public final String DEFAULT_URL_STRING_CHINA = "www.qq.com";</pre>
<p>This large class is mainly a state machine of the various WiFi states. The state hierarchy are defined, and initial state set, at lines 1185-1197.</p>
<pre>addState(this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mNotConnectedState, this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mConnectedState, this.mDefaultState);
addState(this.mCaptivePortalState, this.mConnectedState);
addState(this.mEvaluatedState, this.mConnectedState);
....
setInitialState(this.mNotConnectedState);</pre>
<p>The base class for the StateMachine can be found under AOSP source (<a href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/core/java/com/android/internal/util/StateMachine.java?q=StateMachine.java&amp;ss=android%2Fplatform%2Fsuperproject">StateMachine.java</a>).</p>
<p>When the device is connected to WiFi, it would enter <code>ConnectedState</code>.</p>
<p>line 1976 (under <code>processMessage()</code> of the initial <code>NotConnectedState</code>) would be invoked when a new WiFi connection is detected.</p>
<pre>wifiConnectivityMonitor.transitionTo(wifiConnectivityMonitor.mConnectedState);</pre>
<p>The <code>mConnectedState</code> variable is of class <code>ConnectedState</code>, defined from line 1988. The <code>enter()</code> method of <code>ConnectedState</code> contains the following code (from line 2090), which uses <code>CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP</code> (i.e. the Mainland Chinese controlled DNS server):</p>
<pre>if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mWifiManager != null &amp;&amp; WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.inChinaNetwork()) {
    Message msg = new Message();
    msg.what = 330;
    Bundle args = new Bundle();
    args.putString("publicDnsServer", WifiConnectivityMonitor.CHN_PUBLIC_DNS_IP);
    msg.obj = args;
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mWifiManager.callSECApi(msg);
}
</pre>
<p>From the code it seems to add the Mainland Chinese DNS service to the user’s list of DNS server automatically, when the device is connected to Chinese mobile network. There seems no option to disable the behaviour.</p>
<p><code>WifiConnectivityMonitor.inChinaNetwork()</code> is at line 11199.&nbsp; As suggested by its name, it should obtain the ISO code and return true only if the device is connected to a mobile network in China:</p>
<pre>public boolean inChinaNetwork() {
    String str = this.mCountryIso;
    if (str == null || str.length() != 2) {
        updateCountryIsoCode();
    }
    if (!isChineseIso(this.mCountryIso)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (!DBG) {
        return true;
    }
    Log.d(TAG, "Need to skip captive portal check. CISO: " + this.mCountryIso);
    return true;
}
</pre>
<p>Digging deeper, this is how the ISO code (<code>mCountryIso</code>) is obtained, under <code>updateCountryIsoCode()</code> at line 11219 (fallback skipped).</p>
<pre>public void updateCountryIsoCode() {
    if (this.mTelephonyManager == null) {
        try {
            this.mTelephonyManager = (TelephonyManager) this.mContext.getSystemService("phone");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Exception occured at updateCountryIsoCode(), while retrieving Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE");
        }
    }
    TelephonyManager telephonyManager = this.mTelephonyManager;
    if (telephonyManager != null) {
        this.mCountryIso = telephonyManager.getNetworkCountryIso();
        Log.i(TAG, "updateCountryIsoCode() via TelephonyManager : mCountryIso: " + this.mCountryIso);
    }
    /* fallback when there is no mobile network skipped. The fallback is to read the CountryISO setting from a Samsung config file (cscfeature.xml) */
    ....
}
</pre>
<p>(While not shown here, this code is also invoked when initializing and when change in ISO code of telephone network is detected, so it need not be called during each check.) The country code is get from <code>TelephonyManager.getNetworkCountryIso()</code> which is a standard Android API, documented <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager#getNetworkCountryIso()">here</a>. It returns the ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code equivalent of the MCC (Mobile Country Code) of the mobile operator. In Hong Kong, this is “HK”, and in Mainland China this is “CN”.</p>
<p>As one might suspect at this point, the problem lies in <code>isChineseIso()</code>, at line 11214:</p>
<pre>private boolean isChineseIso(String countryIso) {
    return "cn".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso) || "hk".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso) || "mo".equalsIgnoreCase(countryIso);
}</pre>
<p>This means that you are treated as being connected to a Chinese mobile network if you are connected to a Hong Kong mobile network for the purpose of adding the 114 DNS service.&nbsp; (BTW, “MO” is the ISO-3166-1 code for Macau.) Perhaps Samsung might want to address cases when people travel to Mainland China while forgetting to reset their hardcoded DNS settings, and kindly “add” a DNS service which works within the Great Firewall of China. But they seemed to forget that both Hong Kong and Macau are outside the Great Firewall, at least so far.</p>
<p>Back to the DNS setting code above (line 2090). It makes a binder call to <code>WifiManager.callSECApi()</code>, with message code = 330, with a <code>Bundle</code> setting <code>publicDnsServer</code> to our friend <code>114.114.114.114</code>. While <code>WifiManager</code> is a standard Android class the method <code>callSECApi()</code>, as suggested by its name, is Samsung specific.</p>
<p>The remote call to <code>WifiManager</code> would end up in the service class implementation at <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiServiceImpl</code>, implementing WifiService, at <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiServiceImpl.java">WifiServiceImpl.java</a>. (The class is Samsung’s extension to the AOSP service class of the same …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

<p>In 2020, my personal recommendation to web developers is to use <strong>Svelte for Sites, and React for Apps</strong>. This is, remarkably, a nuanced enough opinion that it pisses off fans of <em>either</em> of them.</p>
<p>I mentioned this in my <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/432/">Shoptalk Show interview</a> and Chris Coyier encouraged me to blog about it. Let me try to explain.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="sites-vs-apps"><a href="#sites-vs-apps">Sites vs Apps</a></h2>
  <p>First, I have to make a distinction between (Web) Sites and (Web) Apps. There are serious, intelligent people who insist that there isn't one. They want to build everything on the web with the same tech. Respectfully, <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/08/22/clean-starts-for-the-web.html">they are wrong</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Web Sites</strong> primarily display content, while interaction is limited. First-load times are paramount since users may bounce and/or their limited data/power/CPU may deprive them of important information (see <a href="https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/">Alex Russell for math on a reasonable baseline</a> but let's say you definitely want &lt;200kb in the critical path). This was the web's original usecase - displaying information - and it is what HTML/CSS/Browsers are great at.</p>
  <p><strong>Web Apps</strong> primarily exist for interaction. CRUD apps, livestream apps, games, whatever. These apps tend to be heavier, which is unfortunate because that affects their performance. But even a 2MB JS app doesn't sound so bad when it is literally competing with a 200MB mobile app, and (let's say) you're developing a B2B app where everyone is on high power and high bandwidth devices anyway. You're typically also keeping apps open longer, so the first-load issue doesn't matter as much (and can be mitigated with service workers). The challenge is even higher once you account for the fact that the Web App must ship with it all the UI components and behaviors for it to work, whereas a typical native app will usually heavily lean on platform-provided components. The web platform still lacks a lot of standard components/APIs and developer experience needed to make writing great Web Apps easy - hence the gap is filled by frameworks.</p>
  <p>I view Sites vs Apps as a spectrum. Of course, if your sites dont need ANY interaction at all, don't use any JS. But most sites have app-like features (login, reactions, comments), and many apps need to perform under site-like constraints.</p>

  <h2 id="react-for-apps"><a href="#react-for-apps">React for Apps</a></h2>
  <p>React has been open sourced for 7 years now. It is used in production at the biggest companies and sites in the world from Apple to Twitter to Amazon to Airbnb to Uber. It has been the most cited technology in Hacker News job postings for <a href="https://www.hntrends.com/2020/may-big-drop-developer-job-postings.html">at least 36 straight months</a>. There are <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1190088019707154432?s=20">between 3-9m React developers</a>, growing <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1024974678337703937?s=20">at least &gt;50% annually</a>. The <a href="https://youtu.be/Qox56z4xH6o">third party ecosystem is vast</a> and attracting instructors, developers, companies and hundreds of millions in corporate and venture funding.</p>
  <p>Based on that <em>alone</em> it is a good tech choice to base your app on already. But these are contingent facts that don't really have anything fundamental to do with React's merits. This is offensive to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/first-principles-approach/">first principles thinkers</a>. So let me offer some <em>core</em> reasons why React is a great choice for apps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>React Native looked troubled in 2018, but <a href="https://www.reactiflux.com/transcripts/react-native-team-2">the current team</a> seems to be executing well (as far as an outsider like me can tell). <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1301103950066671616?s=20">Flutter may yet give it a run for its money</a> someday, but has the Dart and Google hurdles to overcome. <strong>React Native is the best cross platform (mobile+web+desktop) "Write mostly once, run mostly anywhere" solution</strong> in tech today. If you have the resources to hire platform specialists, <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a">you won't find this useful</a>. However, if, like the vast majority of companies, you can't afford a dedicated team of specialists per platform, React Native is your best bet.</li>
    <li>React has by far the most experience in abstraction design. <strong>Where React leads, other frameworks follow</strong> (Both Vue's <a href="https://composition-api.vuejs.org/">Composition API</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao">Svelte 3's $: API</a> directly credit React for inspiration, as do Swift UI and Jetpack Compose). This isn't to say they always get it right (<em>pop quiz: how many Context APIs are there in React?</em>) but when <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html">Concurrent Mode</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn/status/1308438105616191496?s=20">React Flight</a> are released, I expect it to be deeply informed by production usage at the biggest websites in the world. Suspense for Data Fetching, still not yet released, has <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/web/facebook-redesign/">been in production at Facebook</a> for over a year. I want to stress how unusual this is - typically in open source, you release something and then hope it gets picked up by a BigCo and tested at scale. With React, Facebook <strong>dogfoods it at scale</strong> before releasing to the general developer community, with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15257">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/prepack/wiki/react-compiler">ideas</a> <a href="https://cdb.reacttraining.com/react-call-return-what-and-why-7e7761f81843">killed</a> before they are publicly blessed, because flaws were found. Judge React as much on what it doesn't ship as you do on what it does ship.</li>
    <li>That brings me to governance. It's not perfect (many people have issues with Facebook, for one thing), but I think <strong>React is one of the best run open source projects in the world</strong>. Normally mundane things like <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-versioning.html">versioning policy</a> to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html/">error messages</a> to <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/10/22/react-release-channels.html">release channels</a> to <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/10/20/react-v17.html#gradual-upgrades">gradual upgrades</a> matter at the scale of React. The team also does a lot of informal collaboration with key ecosystem partners like Gatsby, Apollo and Next.js, including at the browser level with Chrome and the language level with TC39. The team not only deeply cares about technical governance, but also fostering an inclusive and diverse community.</li>
    <li>I hesitated to mention this last point because it technically has to do with adoption, but I cannot separate it from React's merits: it seems to have <strong>the best thinkers on accessibility and interaction design</strong> right now. No other ecosystem has projects like Adobe and Devon Govett's <a href="https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html">React Aria</a> that has extensively thought through and tested for WAI-ARIA so you don't have to. Ditto <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/accessible-front-end-application-chakra-ui-nuxtjs/">Segun Adebayo's Chakra UI</a>. Or listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhKglxQT4sU">Rick Hanlon on the Touchable Web</a> and realize how much web apps need to improve for the open web to reverse <a href="https://vimeo.com/364402896">its alarming decline vs. mobile walled gardens</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>Let me be clear - is the React community ACTUALLY good at these things today? Hell to the no. Most of them are still debating whether or not to learn hooks vs class components. BUT React has the best shot because it has the best abstractions that enable the best thinkers to create the web application standard library we all want.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17004">Selective</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1200111677833973760?s=20">Progressive Hydration</a> are particularly interesting results of the Fiber rewrite. Together with a "full stack" future of React that lets the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1259615888438935556?s=20">easily move code and execution between client and server</a>, the hope for making apps that feel fast without compromising on developer or user experience is extremely strong.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can, of course, use React to make sites. Gatsby and Next.js (and the upcoming <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a>) are great static and serverless rendering options (The "greatness" of Gatsby <a href="https://dev.to/richharris/in-defense-of-the-modern-web-2nia">is disputed</a>). <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> is great for docs sites. If you are making sites and are worried about JS weight, you can usually <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1316540904761520129?s=20">swap Preact for React in a few lines of code</a> because you will usually not be running into any of <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v8/differences-to-react/">Preact's compromises</a> if you are just making a site.</p>
  <p>So why do I advocate using a different framework for sites?</p>

  <h2 id="svelte-for-sites"><a href="#svelte-for-sites">Svelte for Sites</a></h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Specifically, Svelte for <em>Interactive</em> Sites</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Svelte is <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety/status/1260209026563858432?s=20">used in production</a>
    from the NY Times (of course) to Square Enix to Apple to Spotify to Google Arts to Alaska Airlines and <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/community/tree/master/who's-using-svelte">hundreds more</a>, with other big dev platforms like Amazon and Microsoft also increasingly featuring it in their content. It has a lively community with the first podcasts, YouTube channels, schools, conferences and newsletters emerging. Svelte 3 has been wildly successful and yet it is still early days.
  </p>
  <p>I'm going to let you in on a little secret: <a href="https://twitter.com/buildsghost/status/1255936971265826816?s=20">Svelte and React aren't that different</a>. Take a look <a href="https://lihautan.com/compile-svelte-in-your-head-part-1/#compile-svelte-in-your-head">under the hood of Svelte compiled output</a>:</p>
  <pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>create_fragment</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>// redacted</span>

<span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>SvelteComponent</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>options</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>

<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>Wtf? <code>class App extends SvelteComponent</code>?? That looks like React??</p>
  <p>Yes. Wait til you realize that <a href="https://lihautan.com/compile-svelte-in-your-head-part-1/#updating-data"><code>=</code> basically compiles to <code>setState</code></a>, or that yes, it does actually <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/tree/master/src/runtime">ship a runtime</a>, or that yes, it actually has <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/ec0f79c5af3113bedf0a5e9ae1f5f521328fcd30/src/runtime/internal/scheduler.ts">a scheduler</a> too. Like I said, where React leads, other frameworks follow. React proved Components are the right way to go.</p>
  <p>This also means that <a href="https://youtu.be/xgER1OutVvU">most React developers can learn Svelte in <em>hours</em></a> so the switching cost is low.</p>
  <p>The differences are large enough, though, in everything else:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>JS Weight</strong>. Your site might get green Lighthouse scores, but hopefully you agree that you ideally only ship JS that you use, for your users' sake. Svelte sites are often single digit kilobytes. React+React DOM is ~120kb uncompressed. You can of course slash this severely if you can switch to Preact. But Svelte offers <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety/status/1314255119555338241">the smallest measured runtime footprint</a>. We used to worry about the compiler output overhead exceeding the size of React components (smaller runtime = more boilerplate), but <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety/status/1297548737091264518?s=20">recent studies have debunked this concern completely</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>But my consideration of JS weight extends beyond just the framework. Anecdotally, the kind of people that are drawn to Svelte seem to be more performance-minded than those in React (see everything that <a href="https://github.com/lukeed/">lukeed</a> makes). This comes from the top - where React devs often import heavy dependencies as long as they kinda fit the usecase, Rich Harris is the kind of stubborn developer that makes his own version of everything because he just needs it to do a smaller job. But also, Svelte is most people's <em>second</em> framework, so they come to it with more of a performance mindset. Collectively, the dependency choices encouraged by the framework's culture also impact the end result of JS weight.</li>
        <li>I am even encouraged by the emerging JAMstack culture in Svelte, where <a href="https://twitter.com/nickreese">Nick Reese</a> has made an excellent implementation of <a href="https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/">Jason Miller's Islands Architecture</a> with <a href="https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/">Elder.js</a>. (<em>TL;DR - typical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD6KTAGrj3E">Gen-2 SSG's</a> send JS to rehydrate the entire page, even the content that doesn't change, whereas Islands Architecture sites only send JS to hydrate dynamic parts of the page and leave the rest untouched.</em>)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Scoped styles</strong>. Need I say more? The way Rich Harris puts it, goes …</li></ul></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-6668c42b763b213dbe56"><div><p>That should be your aspiration in your company. To create something that’s hard for your customer to live without. For me, my AirPods Pro, my Dyson vacuum, Audible, and Spotify are the first to come to mind.</p><p>You don’t want to be one of many. Having to resort to bribing people to use you instead of another company. Sure, you can make money but your company will be very sensitive.</p><p><em>A tiny ‘’push’’ by a competitor or a changing market will displace you out of equilibrium.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Think of delicately balancing a marble on a flipped bowl. If you can balance it, the tiniest force will displace it out of its meta-stable equilibrium.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have a startup that’s susceptible to being cloned (Groupon) and succumbing to consumer surplus (Lime, Bird, Spin, etc.) it’ll be more fragile. The ultimate example is dropshipping or any other get rich quick/commodity scheme.&nbsp;</p><p><em>This incidentally, is also why those things don’t work. As soon as you have a formula, the more people will implement it, the less effective it’ll be.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Read: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/antinetworkeffects" target="_blank"><em>Network Effects, Neutral Network Effects, and Anti-Network Effects</em></a></p><p><em>The very existence of an easy formula makes that particular business model meta-stable.</em></p><p><em>Check </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/ten" target="_blank"><em>Ten</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/deeplove" target="_blank"><em>Do You Have Customers Who Deeply Love You?</em></a></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602502923408_28311"><div><p><em>I took these pictures for y’all when I was in Germany for business. As you can see, there’s Lime, Bird, Spin, Tier, and Dott. All fighting for market share and competing away profits. This creates a consumer surplus environment where the consumer would be willing to pay more but they don’t have to. That’s good for the consumer but dangerous for you as a startup.</em></p><p>If you can find a way to create a product that 1 person finds hard to live without, you can probably find 10. If you can find 10, you can probably find 100. And so on.</p><p>As a matter of fact, that 1 person most likely has 1 or 2 friends who they’ll bring into your tribe without you having to do any work. Having a product that people love so much it’s hard to live without makes your company more resilient.</p><p>Getting 1 person to feel that way is both harder and easier than people think. It’s hard because it’ll take a lot of effort and iteration before people truly feel like they would rather not live without your product.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s easier because virtually none of your competitors are even trying. They’re too focussed on the bottom line to even think about it. If they do, it’s mostly lip service or an afterthought.</p><p><em>It’s very difficult to push the business out of its equilibrium.&nbsp;</em></p><p>A business is in stable equilibrium if when it’s displaced it experiences a force pulling it back toward its equilibrium. Craigslist still lives on despite many competitors having improved a subset of it.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602502923408_24853"><div><p>Think of a marble in a bowl. If you displace it, it’ll experience a restoring force that’s trying to get it back into its stable equilibrium position. It actually takes a force to keep that marble away from its equilibrium position. That is until you put so much force on it, that it flies out of the bowl. The equivalence of this would be the iPhone vs. Nokia and Blackberry phones.</p><p>Suppose some law was passed that bans Google’s search engine until 2M people sign a petition on change.org to reinstate it. How long until that’d be done?</p><p>Probably not that long. Google is highly stable.</p><p>Now imagine the same thing with Instagram. A lot of people love Instagram but it’s probably not quite as stable as Google. One can imagine a lot of users moving on to TikTok and all of the other social platforms. It also wouldn’t be too long for someone to create a better IG from scratch without all the feature creep. IG would probably still be back though but it would likely take longer than the Google example.</p><p>Now imagine Facebook. Again, seems less stable than IG.</p><p>Now imagine TV. It might not even get back on its feet at all. If it would, it would take significantly longer than any of the previous examples.</p><p>This is essentially what happened during the pandemic. It exposed businesses that were meta-stable and businesses that thrived under this particular pressure. (Anti-fragile. Things that improve when stress is placed upon them.)</p><p>Zoom was anti-fragile because the pandemic made the product better.</p><p>This is why we often hear the following aphorism: ‘’Hard startups are easier than easy startups.’’ That’s because they’re more stable. It’s harder to disrupt a SpaceX or a Stripe than a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/26/on-demand-food-startup-sprig-is-shutting-down-today/" target="_blank">Sprig</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/7/21000094/unicorn-electric-scooter-shut-down-refund-tile" target="_blank">Unicorn Scooters</a>, or a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872984/moviepass-shutdown-subscription-movies-helios-matheson-ted-farnsworth-explainer" target="_blank">MoviePass</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-be1bf5f7cf8940601e50"><div><p>Copy matters. A lot.</p><p>A site with incredible copy but terrible design will do far better than one with world-class design but horrible copy.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because copy conveys the message. Copy seduces the reader. Copy makes a hot cup of cocoa for you while lighting some candles and putting on slow jams.</p><p>If you’re in a rush, this 1 tip will blow up your sales: <strong>Simplify your communication</strong>.</p><p>Remember that most users are very, very impatient. So when they land on your site and it takes more than… well, immediately, to figure out what it is you do, they’ll do the worst thing you can possibly imagine... hit the dreaded back button.</p><p><strong>The most important thing any beginner should do is to simply make their message clear</strong>. Forget about being cute and fancy.</p><p>A useful heuristic is the niece test: If your 12-year-old niece landed on your website, could she instantly get what you do?</p><p>Another one is the walk test. Put your site on your laptop and see if you can figure out the value prop while walking past it.</p><p>This is where people usually object because what they do is so much more complicated than what other companies are doing. ‘’Surely, my target audience would understand my jargon right?’’</p><p>Maybe. I’m not discounting that, and it’s worth testing. But usually, founders overestimate the degree of interest that cold traffic has. Remember that your prospects are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank">system 1 type thinking</a>: fast, intuitive, unconscious. In that state, they’re equivalent to a teen with a short attention span. They’re not gonna take the time to figure out what you do, so you have to remove as much friction as possible.</p><p><em>Read this in-depth essay on removing friction here: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/friction" target="_blank"><em>How To Increase Profit By Removing Friction</em></a></p><p>But testing is cheap so feel free to test ideas you think will work better. But the above should be your starting point.</p><p><em>But also remember that if you’re professional and communicate mostly in jargon, you’re gonna blend right in with your competition. That’s what professional means. Following the status quo. Which implies, devoid of personality. That might be okay if you’re an employee. But that’s the opposite of what you want as a founder. If you wanna learn how to differentiate read this: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/differentiation" target="_blank"><em>Mountain Of Carrots—How Companies Must Differentiate In A Cluttered Market</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Let’s look at advertising for a quick second okay. A great ad has 3 conditions:</p><p><strong>1. Get attention</strong></p><p>Nothing happens if people don’t see your ad.</p><p><strong>2. Clearly communicate what you want</strong></p><p>Nothing happens if you have attention but people don’t understand what you want from them or how you can help them.</p><p><strong>3. Persuade the prospect</strong></p><p>Nothing happens if you have their attention, they understand what you want from them or how you can help them, but they aren’t persuaded to take action.</p><p><em>I don’t want to go deep into behavior science right now but the easiest way to get people to take action (to cross the action threshold in the </em><a href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/36817028/Behavior-Model-for-Persuasive-Design.pdf?1425238284=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DBehavior_Model_for_Persuasive_Design.pdf&amp;Expires=1602589095&amp;Signature=KPddqP810HPTN~SZLDPWhUoEbIIz7rKXZmSs6MVnhCNnTISRH6k60ORCxlQfh8WphZtdJtu85lxVfbuneBEPDVfDlWS7tD8UNBn3Y5YpqvS5TjiQ3c0h9gcHWG00op6Fl5wmABWosDACoudSqS-9p471kocL7es~kQLdvan5FLVH7boNVWk7rS9QOBNU67k95h7Xl1xg1YasOC43BbLs4qeVzNeuZ-mOR7i32gtScEOWvu97ODs48SYSFSmdpXUFaap~Nln2ICvLEsCYdRbs3RN1toGCRHAsuwl1MBUKq8aZxMEKPBn3YCadIiBfwzWGaWuGKCj1ya1cIdrZVhXUSg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA" target="_blank"><em>FBM</em></a><em>) is to 1. Find the people that already want to get the result you’re offering. (That share the outcome or aspiration you’re talking about, to put it in technical terms.) And 2. Simplify the desired behavior such that the quantity of motivation required is minimal and the ability to execute the desired behavior is high. I.e. Make it easy for them.</em></p><p>Now, this isn’t an essay on advertising but those are solid copy conditions as well. Most businesses fail at all 3. Just observe your own behavior while scrolling through Facebook or going through your inbox. Almost no business even gets your attention. Your brain’s spam filter filters it out.</p><p><strong>1.Realize it’s possible to make much more by rearranging letters</strong> <em>(Or by using Dutch School Marketing in general. And yes, an extensive essay on Dutch School is forthcoming for those who’ve been murdering my inbox.)</em></p><p>‘’Well duh!’’, I hear you think. But most founders don’t believe that’s possible. This is why they say things like: ‘’Marketing doesn’t work for our company. It’s very hit or miss.’’ They believe there’s some miraculous marketing god that either graces you or doesn’t.</p><p>Remember that cheap and tiny changes can have disproportionate effects.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Read more about that in </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/trivialsolutions" target="_blank"><em>This Essay Will Save Your Company Money</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>2.Practice the oblique elements of creating copy: Swipe File and Cloning</strong></p><p><strong>Start building a swipe file</strong>. Any time you see compelling copy, steal it. Put it in a shoebox and fill that thing up. Headlines, CTA’s, Pictures, Value props, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>This’ll build your mental swipe file, it’ll train you to start noticing great copy so you’ll find more great copy (cuz you’re looking for it), and it’ll build your physical swipe file for moments when you’re lacking creativity and are staring at a blank screen.</p><p><strong>Start cloning copy </strong>that has done well. This is exactly like mathematics. It’s one thing to be able to follow along with a proof, but it isn’t until you recreate it that suddenly all the gaps in your knowledge become painfully apparent. You don’t want to just understand the copy, you want to understand it in your kidneys and spleen. It should become a part of you.</p><p><strong>3.Use the 3 direct elements of creating copy: Fact aggregation, benefit transformation, and offer crystallization</strong></p><p>Fact aggregation: Start writing down every, single fact about the product. Don’t edit yourself and be ridiculously thorough.</p><p>Benefit transformation: Transform as many of those facts into benefits.</p><p>Offer crystallization: Write down your offer and keep rewriting it until it’s crispy. I.e. Clear, snappy, and compelling.</p><p><strong>4.Use all your raw material to craft your copy.</strong></p><p>You got the building blocks with your facts, benefits, offer, swipe file, and the copy you’ve cloned.</p><p>If you lay that all out, you’ll be able to create the skeleton of your copy. You can then sand off the edges and make it into something neat.</p><p>From there it’s testing, testing, and wait for it… yes, more testing.</p><p>Is this going to make you a world-class copywriter by tomorrow 7 PM?&nbsp;</p><p>Yes!</p><p>Is this going to give you 6-pack abs, raise your IQ, and instantly make you sexier?&nbsp;</p><p>Why yes again! You’re 2 for 2.</p><p>Look, it’s not magic. And if the people looking for shortcuts would’ve taken the long path instead, they’d be done by now. <em>(Reminds me of a very non-PC saying: Some fat people will do anything to avoid eating less and exercising more. I think that all of us are or have been that person in some area of our lives.)</em></p><p>But applying what you’ve learned in this essay will make you better than a good 90% of companies out there. Most companies don’t know how to do this. And the vast majority of professionals suck at this. When your job isn’t to be effective but rather to avoid getting fired or making your boss look bad, or to win awards, you’re gonna do the opposite of what you need to do if you want to create great marketing. </p><p><em>This is why Dave Trott and Rory Sutherland are always ranting about the sorry state of advertising and marketing. And you know what… they’re not wrong.</em></p><p>There are, however,  a few people that have dedicated their lives to this and they’re absolute monsters. But that’s the cool thing about business, you don’t have to be amazing at every single thing. You just have to be amazing at a few things and okay at the rest.</p><p>This will make you <strong>more </strong>than okay.</p><p>Good luck out there and go build the future,</p><p>RJ</p><p><em>P.S. If you enjoyed this, I got a 4 part essay series that goes into absolutely ridiculous depth on everything mentioned here. Best part? It’s free.</em></p><p><em>You can find it here </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/salesletter" target="_blank"><em>Alchemy: Turning Words Into Money</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

This is an experiment so it might not work. If you’re not interested, skip to ‘’</em><strong><em>FOCUS ON YOUR CUSTOMERS AND BE AWARE OF THE COMPETITION. NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND</em></strong><em>.’’</em></p><p>Some of y’all know about the sport I do called Tricking:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602241281880_23682"><div><p>From 2015 till 2020 I had a period of time where I cut back on training in gymnastic gyms and only tricked on hard floor because I was mostly focussed on lifting weights and fighting.</p><p>This year I wanted to get serious about making a comeback. I had a lot of negative thoughts in my head. My sessions were garbage, especially compared to the stuff I used to throw.&nbsp;</p><p>I started to wonder whether I was just getting too old or something. But that didn’t make sense since there are MMA and boxing athletes that are still fighting, not just at a high level, but at the highest possible level on the planet, in their early 40s.</p><p>On top of that, my hard floor sessions were great. It seemed like my brain just couldn’t get used to the timing on a bouncy floor.</p><p>Eventually, I slowly started getting back into the groove… And then corona hit.</p><p>To top it off I also got a nasty lower back injury by slightly misjudging the timing on a women’s spring floor.</p><p>After the gym opened back up a few months ago, I really felt like I was making negative progress.</p><p>That’s when I decided I should see if I could use some behavior science (more out of exasperation than anything). I started to realize that one of the reasons I had bad sessions was because I was rushing. My foundation just wasn’t on point because I hadn’t taken the time to get used to the timing on a spring floor. I’d just plowed through it, hoping it would take care of itself.</p><p>I was also comparing every current session to my best sessions from the past as well as what other great trickers were doing. All extremely counterproductive.</p><p>Eventually, I managed to turn it around by focussing on behavior science’s  core maxim: ‘’Humans change best when they feel shine.’’</p><p><em>From </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/blaming" target="_blank"><em>‘Whose Fault Is It?’</em></a><em>:</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Shine, as defined by Professor BJ Fogg, is that feeling you got when you studied really hard for that crucial exam and learned that you completely aced it. Since shine is a feeling, you can choose to invoke it for the tiniest of progress steps. Doing so is what forms habits, NOT repetition or 21 days as is common sense.</em></p></blockquote><p>I scaled my behavior (tricks) way back such that I created a highly unfair game. A game rigged in my favor, guaranteeing a win. Finally, my tricking started to improve. After a few sessions where I was gradually making real progress, last week my body just ‘’vomited out’’ all the tricks and combos I’d been working on. From very complex tricks to complicated combos I’d never even attempted, let alone landed, in my life.</p><div><p>This was the first time I really felt like it was within my reach to become better than I had ever been.</p></div><p>I was so wrapped up with competing with other trickers and my past self that I was setting myself up to fail. Talk about being unrealistic. Like what did I expect? Just to walk back into the gym after years of not having trained on a spring floor and immediately crank out stuff I had to train years for. Like, come on! And yet that’s how most of our brains work.</p><p>It wasn’t until I rigged the game in my favor and started winning that gradually, using baby steps, my tricking started trending in the right direction.&nbsp;</p><p><em>How can you cheat? How can you rig the game in your favor?</em></p><p>Because I wasn’t focussed on myself and was too focussed on others I was doing way too many tricks (or behaviors essentially) simultaneously.&nbsp;</p><p>The tiny pro of that is that last week, everything just fell out in one god-like session. But I came this close to giving up because of it. In hindsight, it was so stupid. I should’ve just picked one trick that was barely out of reach and train towards that. Instead of 20 different ones, some of which were way too hard at the time.</p><p>Compete with the average of yourself over the last week or two. That way, you’ll gradually improve and feel shine.&nbsp;</p><p>That creates a pulling force allowing the desired behavior to escalate, precisely what we want in behavior design.</p><p>Most founders are looking way, way too much at what their competition is doing. The only reason you shouldn’t completely ignore your competition is that they may have stumbled onto great ideas to improve your customers’ lives that you should implement as well.</p><p>In my tricking story, I was the customer. I should’ve been focussed on me. Instead, I was focussed on my past self and my competition (other trickers).</p><p>That’s setting yourself up to fail.&nbsp;</p><p>Start with reality.&nbsp;</p><p>Where are you right now? Where are the customers right now? How can you, by using baby steps, improve their lives ever so slightly?</p><p>If you consistently keep doing that, those small changes will add up.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s already hard enough to obsess over the customer and turn them into a true fan. Obsessing over the competition just makes that harder because when you’re constantly looking at the competition, guess whom you’re not studying?</p><p>Also, you can’t differentiate by copying which is something we’ve covered extensively in <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/differentiation" target="_blank">Mountain Of Carrots — How Companies Must Differentiate In A Cluttered Market</a> and <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/antinetworkeffects" target="_blank">Network Effects, Neutral Network Effects, and Anti-Network Effects</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<ol><li>Clone the express demo repository:<br><code>git clone https://github.com/YonatanKra/askql-demo.git</code></li><li>Enter into the folder:<br><code>cd askql-demo</code></li><li>Checkout the express-quick-start tag:<br><code>git checkout express-quick-start</code></li><li>npm i</li><li>npm run dev</li></ol>



<hr>



<p>Now you have a working <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">express</a></em> repository.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Express is a web framework for nodejs. It helps you setup a flexible and easily extendible web server in a really short amount of time.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The setup is pretty simple – in <code>index.js</code> (Code snippet #1) the server is setup with 3 middleware: <code>logRequestMiddleware</code>, <code>logResultsMiddleware</code> and <code>errorHandler</code>. They are being used in the <code>/ask</code> endpoint.</p>



<p>There’s also a public html page that will serve as our client.</p>

<p>If you go to the client (<a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8080</a>) and submit the form, you will see that the submit has been logged. The output should be something like:</p>

<p>The output shown in <strong>Figure 1</strong> is not very exciting. You can see something that looks like code (actually, it is called <code>AskScript</code>) but it doesn’t do anything.</p>



<p>Let’s install AskQL so it would be able to parse our script.</p>



<h2>Setting up AskQL</h2>



<p>First we need to install AskQL: <em><code>npm i askql</code></em></p>



<p>Now that AskQL is installed, we can import its utilities and classes in our express app.</p>



<p>Let’s import an AskQL middleware:</p>



<pre><code>import middlewareFactory from "askql/askExpressMiddleware/askExpressMiddleware.js";
const { askExpressMiddleware } = middlewareFactory;</code></pre>



<p>The <em>askExpressMiddleware </em>is a function that accepts some resources and configuration objects and returns a middleware function:</p>



<pre><code>const askMiddleware = askExpressMiddleware( 
{ resources, values },  { callNext: true, passError: true}
);</code></pre>



<p>Resources are dynamic AskQL resources that can be accessed in the AskScript. </p>



<p>Resources can be functions, data handlers (like filter, map etc.) mathematical operators and actually anything a function can do (even 3rd party npm modules you import).</p>



<p>Values are static values that exist in the server.&nbsp; The <code>values</code> object is a regular object that holds numbers, strings, booleans, arrays or other objects.</p>



<p>Let’s take the resources that are coming from AskQL and define some values:</p>



<pre><code>import askql from 'askql';
const {resources} = askql;
const values = {    
  names: ['Johnny', 'Rita', 'Jane', 'Martha', 'Clark'],
  powers: ['Nerd', 'C#', 'Cool', 'Superman\'s mom', 'Superman']
};</code></pre>



<p>The configuration object is a means to customise the middleware – for instance, how to handle errors.</p>



<p>Now that the middleware is ready, we can add it to the list of middleware between the two loggers and restart the server.</p>



<p>The final <code>index.js</code> looks like this:</p>

<h2>Let’s see it in action</h2>



<p>The client is a form that sends AskScript to the <em>ask</em> access point (a post request).</p>



<p>Let’s try out the first code we can possibly think of:</p>



<pre><code>ask { 'Hello World!' }</code></pre>



<p>Write it down in the text area and submit.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, it returns “Hello World!”</p>



<p>Now, instead of just asking for a value from the server, let’s ask for a value from a variable that exists on our server (via the <code>values</code> we sent to our askMiddleware):</p>



<pre><code>ask { names }</code></pre>



<p>And we get all the names in the group.</p>



<p>Now let’s query for their powers (or maybe I should have used the word traits):</p>



<pre><code>ask { powers }</code></pre>



<p>That was wonderful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now we see how easy it is to access values we know about on the server.&nbsp; What about combining resources with values? Let’s do something more interesting:</p>



<pre><code>ask {&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  let arr = [];
&nbsp; for (let i = 0; i &lt; names:length; i = i + 1) { 
&nbsp;   arr = arr:set(i, {
                       name: names:at(i), 
                       power:powers:at(i)
    });
  }
  arr&nbsp;
}</code></pre>



<p>What do you think the above piece of code will do? You probably guessed right – it is a map! </p>



<p>AskQL has us covered with yet another core resource:</p>



<pre><code>ask {
  names:map(fun(name, i) {&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
    {name, power: powers:at(i)}&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  })
}</code></pre>



<p>The two last snippets would both have the same result!</p>



<h2>What Else?</h2>



<p>AskQL has lots of resources.</p>



<p>Let’s say we want to find one of our heroes according to the hero’s power? We just use the <code>find</code> resource:</p>



<pre><code>ask {
  names:find(fun(c, i) {
    return powers:at(i):equals('Innocent')
  })
}</code></pre>



<p>There are a lot more resources for AskQL.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>In this post, we’ve setup a nodejs server that allows a very flexible API without doing anything server side – just expose some data.</p>



<p>Anyone using microservices?</p>



<p>Let’s say there’s a microservice that serves some crucial data. How do we access it immediately?</p>



<pre><code>ask {
   fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people'):at('results')
}</code></pre>



<p>That script will return a list of Star Wars characters via the public StarWars API. </p>



<p>With AskQL we are not limited by anything. We can not only use the built in resources in order to created flexible scripts. We can also create our own custom resources!</p>



<p>In the next post, I’ll expand on this example and show how to create a custom resource to manipulate MongoDB.</p>



<p>I invite you to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/xFAANG/askql" target="_blank">AskQL repository</a> to contribute and be involved with a promising technology. There’s also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://discord.gg/D4haZp" target="_blank">the discord server</a> where you can hang out with the core team.</p>



<p>Thanks a lot to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Piotr_Zientara" target="_blank">Piotr</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/XFaang" target="_blank">xFAANG</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/jodoron" target="_blank">Yonatan Doron</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hodash.dev/" target="_blank">Hodash.dev</a> for the kind and thorough review.</p>

<p>Charting the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle" title="Circadian cycle">circadian cycle</a> makes it possible to find the best windows of time for brainwork. The <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> graph below was generated with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SleepChart" title="SleepChart">SleepChart</a> using a log of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">free running sleep</a>. In the graph, two yellow bands indicate the optimum time for brainwork. The exact timing may differ for each individual. However, the blocks can be easily determined:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>Morning block</b>: soon after waking, after morning coffee, or after breakfast. The best brain slot may last 2-4 hours. If you are sleepy in the morning see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">Natural creativity cycle</a></li>
<li> <b>Evening block</b>: soon after <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Siesta" title="Siesta">siesta</a>. The second best brain slot may last 2-4 hours as well. If you do not nap, you may not fully benefit from that block (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Power_nap" title="Power nap">Power nap</a>). If you are sleepy during this slot see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Best_time_for_napping" title="Best time for napping">Best time for napping</a></li></ol>

<p><b>The best test for a well designed day is that all activities <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning" title="Pleasure of learning">should be fun</a>!</b></p> 
<p>Brainwork is fun only if your brain is ready. Sleep is fun if you are ready. Rest and entertainment feel right only after a productive day. Even a bit of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a> can be fun if it is properly dosed and timed.

<h3><span id="Balanced_24_hour_cycle">Balanced 24 hour cycle</span></h3>
<p>The <span>slanting green line</span> separates the graph into the areas of phase advanced (right) and phase delays (left). The line is determined by points in the graph where the waking time (horizontal axis) added to the sleep time (left vertical axis) equals to 24.0 hours. The place where the <span>green breakeven line</span> crosses the <span>red sleep length line</span> determines the optimum balanced sleep cycle of 24 hours. In the presented example, 17.35 hours of waking, added to the expected 6.65 hours of sleep time complete a balanced full 24 hours sleep-wake cycle. The greater the angle between the <span>green</span> and <span>red</span> lines, the harder it is to balance sleep and fit it into the 24h cycle of the rotating earth. In the example, adding waking hours does not shorten sleep much enough to make the balance easy. This implies that a religious adherence to a 17.35 day may be necessary to balance the cycle. However, this shortened waking day may increase <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_latency" title="Sleep latency">sleep latency</a> and increase the probability of premature awakening, which can also tip the balance towards the phase delay. The <span>vertical aqua line</span> shows where the expected sleep time added to the waking time equals to 24 hours (crossover with the <span>green line</span> representing a perfect 24-hour day). In <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a> or <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advanced_Sleep_Phase_Syndrome_(ASPS)" title="Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASPS)">ASPS</a> that 24h balance may be hard to accomplish. For example, without medical intervention, only a large protective zone in the evening, early nap (or no nap), and intense morning exercise can help balance the day in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">DSPS</a>.
</p><p><b>Important!</b> This graph is based on data that is true solely for a free running sleep condition. If you use an alarm clock to regulate the timing of your sleep, these measurements and recommendations may not apply! In addition, the timing and amplitude of changes differ vastly between individuals!
</p>
<h2><span id="Sleeping_against_your_natural_rhythm">Sleeping against your natural rhythm</span></h2>
<p>If you sleep against your natural rhythm you will often experience tiredness or drowsiness that can be resolved by adjusting the sleeping hours. In healthy individuals, the daytime alertness is primarily determined by:
</p>
<ol><li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_components_of_sleep" title="Two components of sleep">circadian phase and homeostatic sleepiness</a></li>
<li> total sleep time the night before</li>
<li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#NREM_and_memory" title="Memory optimization in sleep">amount of slow-wave sleep the night before</a></li>
<li> regular adherence to the sleep-wake schedule in preceding days</li>
<li> sleep deficits accumulated in the preceding days (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_do_we_fall_asleep%3F#REM_rebound_hypothesis" title="How do we fall asleep?">REM deficit</a>, SWA deficit, etc.)</li></ol>
<p>All those factors are closely associated with the sleep phase. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_good_sleep:_free_running_sleep" title="Formula for good sleep: free running sleep">Free running sleep</a> provides the best way to maximize alertness throughout a waking day. Free running sleep is likely to shift the minimum temperature point from the early morning closer towards the middle of the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Subjective_night" title="Subjective night">subjective night</a>. You should notice <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">increased sleepiness before going to sleep</a> and no <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_inertia" title="Sleep inertia">sleep inertia</a> upon awakening! If you cannot free-run your sleep, it is very important to understand the relationship between your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic" title="Homeostatic">homeostatic</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian" title="Circadian">circadian</a> sleep drives as compiled in the table below. In the course of the day, you should move in sync between the yellow areas of the table, i.e. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_do_we_fall_asleep%3F#Sleep-wake_flip-flop" title="How do we fall asleep?">from perfect alertness to maximum sleepiness, and then back to perfect alertness</a>. The gray areas illustrate when your sleep falls out of sync:

        <div id="post-body"><p>Loyal readers of my blog will have noticed a theme, I’m interested in the continued move to virtualized network functions, and the need for faster networking options on cloud compute. In this blog, we’ll look at the network performance on the juggernaut of cloud computing, AWS.</p><p>AWS is the leader in the cloud computing world, and many companies now run parts of their services on AWS. The question we’ll try to answer in this article is: how well suited is AWS’ ec2 for high throughput network functions.</p><p><em>I’ve decided to experiment with adding a short demo video to this blog. Below you will find a quick demo and summary of this article. Since these videos are new and a bit of an experiment, let me know if you like it.</em></p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwe0gL8VBvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h3 id="100g-networking">100G networking</h3><p>It’s already been two years since AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/introducing-amazon-ec2-c5n-instances/" rel="noopener">announced the C5n instances</a>, featuring 100 Gbps networking. I’m not aware of any other cloud provider offering 100G instances, so this is pretty unique. Ever since this was released I wondered exactly what, if any, the constraints were. Can I send/receive 100g line rate (144Mpps)? So, before we dig into the details, let’s just check if we can really get to 100Gbs.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is fun :)  97Gbs <a href="https://t.co/6VdkR2Rlr4">pic.twitter.com/6VdkR2Rlr4</a></p>— Andree Toonk, Adelante! (@atoonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/atoonk/status/1266037590492241921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>100gbs testing.. We’re gonna need a bigger boat..</figcaption></figure><p>There you have it, I was able to get to 100Gbs between 2 instances! That’s exciting. But there are a few caveats. We’ll dig into all of them in this article, with the aim to understand exactly what’s possible, what the various limits are, and how to get to 100g.</p><h3 id="understand-the-limits">Understand the limits</h3><p>Network performance on Linux is typically a function of a few parameters. Most notably, the number of TX/RX queues available on the NIC (network card). The number of CPU cores, ideally at least equal to the number of queues. The pps (packets per second) limit per queue. And finally, in virtual environments like AWS and GCP, potential admin limits on the instance.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*JUjZ5NOIWUrey-Xm" alt=""></figure><p>Doing networking in software means that processing a packet (or a batch of them) uses a number of CPU cycles. It’s typically not relevant how many bytes are in a packet. As a result, the best metric to look at is the: pps number (related to our cpu cycle budget). Unfortunately, the pps performance numbers for AWS aren’t published so, we’ll have to measure them in this blog. With that, we should have a much better understanding of the network possibilities on AWS, and hopefully, this saves someone else a lot of time (this took me several days of measuring) ;)</p><h3 id="network-queues-per-instance-type">Network queues per instance type</h3><p>The table below shows the number of NIC queues by ec2 (c5n) Instance type.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*P9_cWmValN63fmRXAWqdqg.png" alt=""></figure><p><em>In the world of ec2, 16 vCPUs on the C5n 4xl instance means 1 Socket, 8 Cores per socket, 2 Threads per core.</em></p><p>On AWS, an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) NIC has as many queues as you have vCPUs. Though it stops at 32 queues, as you can see with the C5n 9l and C5n 18xl instance.</p><p>Like many things in computing, to make things faster, things are parallelized. We see this clearly when looking at CPU capacity, we’re adding more cores, and programs are written in such a way that can leverage the many cores in parallel (multi-threaded programs).</p><p>Scaling Networking performance on our servers is done largely the same. It’s hard to make things significantly faster, but it is easier to add more ‘workers’, especially if the performance is impacted by our CPU capacity. In the world of NICs, these ‘workers’ are queues. Traffic send and received by a host is load-balanced over the available network queues on the NIC. This load balancing is done by hashing (typically the 5 tuples, protocol, source + destination address, and port number). Something you’re likely familiar with from ECMP.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*VsV_F3dbhosQXAi9A97mqQ.jpeg" alt=""></figure><blockquote>So queues on a NIC are like lanes on a highway, the more lanes, the more cars can travel the highway. The more queues, the more packets (flows) can be processed.</blockquote><h3 id="test-one-ena-queue-performance">Test one, ENA queue performance</h3><p>As discussed, the network performance of an instance is a function of the number of available queues and cpu’s. So let’s start with measuring the maximum performance of a single flow (queue) and then scale up and measure the pps performance.</p><p>In this measurement, I used two c5n.18xlarge ec2 instances in the same subnet and the same placement zone. The sender is using <a href="https://toonk.io/building-a-high-performance-linux-based-traffic-generator-with-dpdk/index.html" rel="noopener">DPDK-pktgen</a> (igb_uio). The receiver is a stock ubuntu 20.04 LTS instance, using the ena driver.</p><p>The table below shows the TX and RX performance between the two c5n.18xlarge ec2 instances for one and two flows.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GVmlTopDSacvRFilauWZag.png" alt=""></figure><p>With this, it seems the per queue limit is about 1Mpps. Typically the per queue limit is due to the fact that a single queue (soft IRQ) is served by a single CPU core. Meaning, the per queue performance is limited by how many packets per second a single CPU core can process. So again, what you typically see in virtualized environments is that the number of network queues goes up with the number of cores in the VM. In ec2 this is the same, though it’s maxing out at 32 queues.</p><h3 id="test-two-rx-only-pps-performance">Test two, RX only pps performance</h3><p>Now that we determined that the per queue limit appears to be roughly one million packets per second, it’s natural to presume that this number scales up horizontally with the number of cores and queues. For example, the C5n 18xl comes with 32 nic queues and 72 cores, so in theory, we could naively presume that the (RX/TX) performance (given enough flows) should be 32Mpps. Let’s go ahead and validate that.</p><p>The graph below shows the Transmit (TX) performance as measured on a c5n.18xlarge. In each measurement, I gave the packet generator one more queue and vcpu to work with. Starting with one TX queue and one VCPu, incrementing this by one in each measurement until we reached 32 vCPU and 32 queues (max). The results show that the per TX queue performance varied between 1Mpps to 700Kpps. The maximum total TX performance I was able to get however, was ~8.5Mpps using 12 TX queues. After that, adding more queues and vCPu’s didn’t matter, or actually degraded the performance. So this indicates that the performance scales horizontally (per queue), but does max out at a certain point (varies per instance type), in this case at 8.5 Mpps</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*7ATryTmrHyn_Inaj" alt=""><figcaption>c5n.18xlarge per TX queue performance</figcaption></figure><p>In this next measurement, we’ll use two packet generators and one receiver. I’m using two generators, just to make sure the limit we observed earlier isn’t caused by limitations on the packet generator. Each traffic generator is sending many thousands of flows, making sure we leverage all the available queues.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*S8jlTc-v-Krm8BLx1QCGtw.png" alt=""><figcaption>RX pps per C5N instance&nbsp;type</figcaption></figure><p>Alright, after a few minutes of reading (and many, many hours, well really days.. of measurements on my end), we now have a pretty decent idea of the performance numbers. We know how many queues each of the various c5n instance types have.</p><blockquote><strong>We have seen that the per queue limit is roughly 1Mpps. And with the table above, we now see how many packets per second each instance is able to receive (RX)</strong>.</blockquote><h3 id="forwarding-performance">Forwarding performance</h3><p>If we want to use ec2 for virtual network functions, then just receiving traffic isn’t enough. A typical router or firewall should both receive and send traffic at the same time. So let’s take a look at that.</p><p>For this measurement, I used the following setup. Both the traffic generator and receiver were C5n-18xl instances. The Device Under Test (DUT) was a standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS instance using the ena driver. Since the earlier observed pps numbers weren’t too high, I determined it’s safe to use the regular Linux kernel to forward packets.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rK_4B6M-0NF2mrrDmheuFQ.png" alt=""><figcaption>test setup</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UUWrmoLH-MXLMsNBdCvJXg.png" alt=""><figcaption>pps forwarding performance</figcaption></figure><p>The key takeaway from this measurement is that the TX and RX numbers are similar as we’d seen before for the instance types up to (including) the C5n 4xl. For example, earlier we saw the C5n 4xl could receive up to ~3Mpps. This measurement shows that it can do ~3Mpps simultaneously on RX and TX.</p><p>However, if we look at the C5n 9l, we can see it was able to process RX+ TX about 6.2Mpps. Interestingly, earlier we saw it was also able to receive (rx only) ~6Mpps. So it looks like we hit some kind of aggregate limit. We observed a similar limit for the C5n 18xl instance.</p><h3 id="in-summary-">In Summary.</h3><p>In this blog, we looked at the various performance characteristics of networking on ec2. We determined that the <strong>performance of a single queue is roughly 1Mpps</strong>. We then saw how the number of queues goes up with the higher end instances up until <strong>32 queues maximum</strong>.</p><p>We then measure the RX performance of the various instances as well as the forwarding (RX + TX aggregate) performance. Depending on the measurement setup (RX, or TX+RX) we see that <strong>for the largest instance types, the pps performance maxes out at roughly 6.6Mpps to 8.3Mpps</strong>. With that, I think that the C5n 9l hits the sweet spot in terms of cost vs performance.</p><h3 id="so-how-about-that-100g-test">So how about that 100G test?</h3><p>Ah yes! So far, we talked about pps only. How does that translate that to gigabits per second?<br>Let’s look at the quick table below that shows how the pps number translates to Gbs at various packet sizes.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sXL3CJJ9M955aa8DvRUVyw.png" alt=""></figure><p>These are a few examples to get to 10G at various packet sizes. This shows that in order to support line-rate 10G at the smallest packet size, the system will need to be able to do ~14.88 Mpps. The 366 byte packet size is roughly the equivalent average of what you’ll see with an IMIX test, for which the systems needs to be able to process ~3,4Mpps to get to 10G line rate.</p><p>If we look at the same table but then for 100gbps, we see that at the smallest packet size, an instance would need to be able to process is over 148Mpps. But using 9k jumbo frames, you only need 1.39Mpps.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WbChAl1uTuUMnP6oHFzRhg.png" alt=""></figure><p>And so, that’s what you need to do to get to 100G networking in ec2. Use Jumbo frames (supported in ec2, in fact, for the larger instances, this was the default). With that and a few parallel flows you’ll be able to get to 100G “easily”!</p><h3 id="a-few-more-limits">A few more limits</h3><p>One more limitation I <a href="https://cloudonaut.io/ec2-network-performance-cheat-sheet/" rel="noopener">read about while researching</a>, but didn’t look into myself. It appears that some of the instances have time-based limits on the performance.

            </div>

            <p>If I wanted to explain in simple terms the difference between Marketing and Sales, I would use the following trivial example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marketing is getting them to call you.  Sales is you calling them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joking aside, its actually pretty accurate, as Marketing is about raising your company or product profile to the extent that people out there in the market place have heard about you, while Sales is about the direct approach, for example calling up a prospective customer and actively telling them about your company and product.</p>

<p>So which is more important, Marketing or Sales?  Actually they both compliment each other, so you really need both.  Marketing make it easier for Sales to get that all important first meeting, as prospects are more likely to agree to meet with a company that they have heard good things about in the market place.  Once that threshold is crossed, Sales then need to deliver a compelling and relevant demo pitch, <em>and</em> establish trust and confidence in the prospective customer that they become comfortable enough to sign off on a new purchase order.</p>

<p>So where does Engineering fit into this mix?  Well as an Engineering leader, you need to work closely with both Marketing and Sales.  Firstly you need to deliver a compelling product that is interesting to demo to prospects, then you need to work with Marketing on how to position that in the market place, for example by comparing your product strengths and weaknesses with your rivals, and building marketing stories around that.</p>

<p>On the Sales front, Engineering has to operate in a "sales enablement" role, by providing Sales with product training, product demos, and related collateral to enable them to build exciting demo pitches.  Furthermore, you may find yourself actively presenting some of those pitches depending on your presentation skills, especially if Sales need help with demonstrating to technical audiences (as engineers can communicate more easily with other engineers).</p>

<p>You must not forget that your Engineering team cannot succeed without Marketing and Sales bringing in the money to keep the lights on, while you must also remind them that without Engineering, there would be nothing available for them to sell!  It is a symbiotic relationship, that should be built on mutual respect.</p>

		<p>G-CORE is a graph query language for property graph databases.</p>
<p>G-CORE was design by the LDBC Graph Query Language Task Force, consisting of members from industry and academia, intending to bring the best of both worlds to graph practitioners.</p>
<p>The main features of G-CORE are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Property Graph data model which consists of nodes, edges, paths and properties;</li>
<li>Paths as first class citizens: paths can be queried and manipulated (as nodes and edges);</li>
<li>Core operations: graph patterns (JOF), path patterns (RPQs), aggregation, subqueries (Exists+SetOp), graph and path construction;</li>
<li>Composability: operations where the input and the output are graphs;</li>
<li>Balance between query expressivity and evaluation complexity.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jpakkane">Jussi Pakkanen</a>, author of the <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a> build system, wrote a nice article recently called <a href="https://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2020/10/does-c-still-deserve-bad-rap-it-has-had.html">Does C++ deserve its bad rap ..?</a> where he defends C++'s reputation as language that is hard to read and unnecessarily complex.</p>

<p>I've not been exposed to much C++ in a professional context.  I learned C++98 at university, and the minor update C++03 was published while I was there, but was turned off by its complexity and abandoned it in favour of writing my projects in C where that was acceptable.</p>

<p>C++11 and onward have famously added ergonomic features that have led to a usability rennaisance;  range iteration, smart pointers, lambdas, auto/type inference, et al.  To show that these have made C++ "good, actually", or at least "not that bad", Jussi implemented a small program:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Find all files with the extension .txt recursively in the subdirectories of the current directory, count the number of times each word appears in them and print the ten most common words and the number of times they are used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jussi's <a href="https://paste.debian.net/1167279/">C++ code</a> is available in full, and in his post he gives a helpful rundown of the highlights.  Up front, I agree that the C++ program Jussi wrote is a lot nicer than the C++ that I cut my teeth on.  But what's it like compared to languages that have been created since 1985?</p>

<p>I decided to write a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jmoiron/206337cdc62b999d07ebcbef5c0fc58b">Go implementation</a> that follows the basic structure of Jussi's, and do a rundown comparing the readability of the two.  Go and C++ are really similar.  Go is statically typed, designed by C programmers, and disrespected by people who don't use it.</p>

<p>Because Go is not <em>exactly</em> like C++, the implementation does a few things differently.  Go's <code>regexp</code> package does not contain an iterating regular expression implementation, so to keep things as <em>behaviourally</em> similar as possible I chose to use <code>bufio.Scanner</code> instead.  Also, because Go has explicit error channels, the Go version checks and reports on error conditions, which adds to its length.</p>

<p>Now, lets compare readability.</p>

<p>First, some general things that come up throughout the code.  The main body of the C++ code is not in the <code>std</code> namespace, meaning that <code>std::X</code> appears throughout.  This is what designers call "busy" or "noisy";  too many unnecessary elements in too little space.  This can be avoided via <code>using std</code>, so this is not a huge deal, but it's worth citing up front.  I don't know enough about the C++ community to know if this is representative, but since additional verbosity is the default, it's worth noting.</p>

<p>Next is the way that C++ object construction looks.  In older versions, this was explcit, but verbose.  C++11 brought with it several short cuts that cut out some repetition, but they overload syntax in confusing ways.  For a simple form of this, take the input file stream (ifstream) declaration for reading from each file:</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>std::ifstream current_file(e.path());
</code></pre>

<p>In this statement, <code>std::ifstream</code> is the type, <code>current_file</code> is a variable name, and <code>(e.path())</code> is... an argument list to <code>std::ifstream</code>'s default constructor.  Previously, this would look like:</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>std::ifstream current_file = std::ifstream::ifstream(e.path())
</code></pre>

<p>Which is stuttery and very noisy, but it's explicit and consistent.  In another section of code, a different type of initialization is done, where the variable receives the value of the argument.  This is done with alternate punctuation, <code>{}</code>'s:</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>std::string word{it-&gt;str()};
</code></pre>

<p>The basic function of this code is easy to understand, but the specific operation isn't because of the implicitness and the many-ways-to-do-it.  Go's value construction is more limited in expressiveness, but much more consistent.  The equivalent lines in the Go program are:</p>

<pre lang="go"><code>// to open a file stream
f, err := os.Open(path)
// to create a new string with the value of another string
word := strings.ToLower(scanner.Text())
</code></pre>

<p>This leads us to another readability tradeoff that is relatively widespread, which is Go's more typical use of type inference.  While there is type inference used in the C++ code as well, with the expression <code>const auto &amp;e</code> for the file walk iterator, it's built into Go via the <code>:=</code> operator (sometimes called the walrus operator in other language communities).  The tradeoff here is that type names are absent in the text, which can make it harder to tell at a glance what types are in use in the program.</p>

<p>Go's design encourages omit-by-default.  This leads to less stutter and less noise, which creates cleaner <em>looking</em> code, even if the semantics are identical.</p>

<p>It's an approach that works well with modern editors that are equipped to provide rich type information and provide other search facilities even when the types are being inferred in the text of the program.  These were not widespread in 1985 when C++ was first designed, and nonexistent in 1972 when its predecessor was created.</p>

<p>Go <em>has</em> explicitly type declaration syntax, <code>var word string = strings.ToLower(...)</code>, just like C++ has <code>auto</code> for inference, but it's rarely used outside of cases where type inference is not allowed by the language.  In the past, people have argued that type inference does indeed hurt readability, eg. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Bracha">Gilad Bracha</a> argued against adding <code>let</code> style inference to Java <a href="https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4459053">2001</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humans benefit from the redundancy of the type declaration in two ways. First, the redundant type serves as valuable documentation - readers do not have to search for the declaration of getMap() to find out what type it returns. Second, the redundancy allows the programmer to declare the intended type, and thereby benefit from a cross check performed by the compiler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite this style of objection, auto types came to Java via <code>var</code> in Java 10 in 2018, and I think inference is generally considered a productivity and readability benefit in all languages that have adopted it.</p>

<p>These design tradeoffs (plus mandatory semi-colons) combine to make the C++ code noticeably busier than the Go code.  I think a lot of programmers consider these minor details compared to semantic complexity, but other things being equal, they have an impact on readability.</p>

<p>However, for all these differences, parts of the code do read very similarly, and not just because I tried to write the code in the same way:</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>struct WordCount {
    std::string word;
    int count;
};
</code></pre>

<pre lang="go"><code>type WordCount struct {
    word  string
    count int
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the top of the program, the type <code>WordCounts</code> looks pretty identical.  The uses of <code>std::X</code> in the C++ code would simplify if we were in the std namespace, which we could do, so lets drop that even though it contributes to visual noise.  In C++, struct's are <em>implicitly</em> <code>typedef</code>-ed, unlike C, which is a little confusing compared to Go's more consistent type declaration syntax.</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>for(const auto &amp;[word, count]: word_counts) {
    word_array.emplace_back(WordCount{word, count});
}
</code></pre>

<p>Looping through the <code>word_counts</code> map feels similar, though C++ again introduces new syntax.  Go's version uses the <code>append</code> builtin, which, while being much better named than <code>emplace_back</code>, is more awkward to use:</p>

<pre lang="go"><code>for word, count := range wordCounts {
    wordArray = append(wordArray, WordCount{word, count})
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an idiom that melts away with enough Go experience, but <code>wordArray.append()</code> or <code>append(&amp;wordArray, ...)</code> would definitely be easier for the uninitiated to understand.</p>

<p>The sort in C++ is a <em>partial sort</em>, which will likely be faster than the full sort that's being done in Go.  This is nice to have at your disposal, but much wider API surface area makes C++ a much bigger thing to learn.</p>

<pre lang="c++"><code>// count_order_desc lambda definition:
auto count_order_desc = [](const WordCount &amp;w1, const WordCount &amp;w2) { return w2.count &lt; w1.count; };
// ...
std::partial_sort(word_array.begin(), word_array.begin() + final_size, word_array.end(), count_order_desc);
</code></pre>

<p>In Go, we're sorting the whole slice, and we're defining our functor inline, but it's much the same.</p>

<pre lang="go"><code>sort.Slice(wordArray, func(i, j int) bool {
  return wordArray[i].count &gt; wordArray[j].count
})
</code></pre>

<p>C++ can't really do much about its inheritance of C's inside-out type declarations, but type reuse in declarations is really nice in parameter lists.  The C++ lambda becomes more concise if we imagine an equivalent feature: <code>[](const WordCount &amp;w1, &amp;w1) { return w2.count &lt; w1.count }</code>.  I suppose it may be personal preference if that's more or less readable.</p>

<p>If we zoom out and look at the files as <em>shapes</em>, a clear picture emerges:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>go</th><th>c++</th></tr>
<tr><td>
  <img src="http://jmoiron.net/i/1alme8d.png">
</td><td>
  <img src="http://jmoiron.net/i/2tn9hn3.png">
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The Go program has much shorter, sparser lines.  This is the result of the aggregate noise omission in the language:  parentheses around loop and if conditions, line endings, type noise. Go's <a href="https://medium.com/@matryer/line-of-sight-in-code-186dd7cdea88">line of sight</a> is much better, but this is a little superficial; the C++ program's deeper nesting is due to the Go program scanning the entire file at once, instead of iterating by line and then by token.  If this were a more complex operation, their left alignment would be more similar.</p>

<p>This wouldn't change the C++ program's longer lines.  A small amount of this is stylistic, eg. using <code>f</code> for the file handle, but a lot of it comes down to excess line noise in the type machinery in C++.</p>

<p>The Go program also works with Unicode text files, and compiles and works across Linux, OSX and Windows.  Fixing the C++ code for this would likely further harm its readability.</p>

<p>While I think that cleanliness is a <em>nice</em> property to have, I think it's overrated when it comes ot readability.  People will gladly write much <em>more</em> code in order to make all of their functions short and simple, forgetting that the readability we're most often interested is an understanding of the program in its context and not of each component in isolation.</p>

<p>Despite having used Go for some time, engaging in this honestly has definitely uncovered some weak spots in code that I've learned to live with, but they're worth mentioning.</p>

<p>The zero you pass when making a slice with reserved capacity in <code>make(T, 0, cap)</code> isn't great.  The way that range's behaviour between map and slice types is different is sensible but a little …</p></div></div>

          <p><strong>Where we are</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/in-defense-of-blockchain-voting">published an article in CoinDesk</a> about using crypto to secure our elections. You can read and discuss more on this forum in <a href="https://forum.intercoin.org/t/can-crypto-save-our-elections/885">part 1</a> and <a href="https://forum.intercoin.org/t/how-to-safeguard-elections-with-crypto/886">part 2</a> that go into some detail about how crypto-powered voting would work, and why it would solve many problems that we face today.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Intercoin started building <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/c/applications/14">applications and smart contracts on the Ethereum platform</a>. While it’s not scalable enough to power <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/crypto-not-scalable-enough-to-be-money-cointelegraph">everyday money</a> or <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/ethereum-scalability-viability">massive elections</a>, perhaps Ethereum 2.0 (<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/a-comprehensive-view-of-ethereum-2-0-serenity-5865ad8b7c62">Serenity</a>) will one day become scalable enough that these smart contracts can see wider adoption, even without having to migrate to the Intercoin back-end platform.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Intercoin is planning to release its own Intercoin App in the app stores, and turn <a href="http://intercoin.org/">intercoin.org</a> into a web-based portal that will let anyone with a <a href="https://metamask.io/">Chrome Extension</a> to deploy the smart contracts we developed, invite friends from their contact list, and manage their community together. We also plan to roll out the Intercoin Crypto Show to teach people more about crypto and smart contracts. In the meantime, if you have questions, feel free to ask them in this forum.</p>
<p><strong>Start of the Art in Crypto Voting</strong></p>
<p>For every technology we use today, there was a time it was laughably inadequate as a replacement for what came before. For decades, chess engines were a mere curiosity, but now a smart phone can beat any grandmaster. The same is now true of voting technology. There have been early experiments in Russia running elections on <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/moscows-blockchain-voting-system-cracked-a-month-before-election/">Ethereum</a> as well as proprietary platforms like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/russia-vote-blockchain">Waves</a>. It’s still early, but we will see tremendous growth in the coming years.</p>
<p>What if people could vote securely online? Then they would be able to make decisions collectively about a variety of things. Technology can lower the cost of running a secure election, and make it available to any organization, large or small. But who can vote, and when? How do we know that it will be secure? Below, we explore exactly these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Who Can Vote?</strong></p>
<p>The first step in democratic elections is determining who can vote, and ensuring that everyone has an equal amount of say. There needs to be some process in place to make sure people don’t create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack#:~:text=In%20a%20Sybil%20attack%2C%20the,diagnosed%20with%20dissociative%20identity%20disorder.">multiple identities</a> to cheat the system. This is accomplished by voter registration, which itself has controversial issues like purging <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-rights/-use-it-or-lose-it---the-problem-of-purges-from-the-registration0/">inactive voters</a> and <a>disadvantaged voters</a> and other ways of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_ID_laws_in_the_United_States#Disparate_impact">disenfranchising voters</a> from even having their voice heard in the election.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day we will come up with better solutions for voter registration, but – for now – this step will have to be done via some established process that a community has. We have deployed the <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-defi-communitycontract/1159/2">CommunityContract</a> specifically to give communities the ability to determine who can vote, and who can’t.</p>
<p><strong>When Can They Vote?</strong></p>
<p>In the USA, voting normally takes place on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)">Election Day</a>, the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Some states allow early voting, so people can cast ballots before Election Day.</p>
<p>Five years ago, I wrote about <a href="http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=212">how polling is better than elections</a>. What I meant is that, expecting the entire population to turn out for an election on a specific day will lead to problems with voter turnout. Having a referendum where only 20% of people vote can cast doubt on the legitimacy of whether the outcome faithfully represents the will of the overall population, or just those who bothered to show up. For example, Puerto Rico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Puerto_Rican_status_referendum#:~:text=A%20referendum%20on%20the%20political,overwhelmingly%20chose%20statehood%20by%2097%25.">voted in 2017 to join the United States</a> by an overwhelming 97%, but that is partly due to a boycott by the opposition, who didn’t show up to vote, resulting in a 22.93% turnout. Opinion polls, on the other hand, show 52% support for joining the United States – a majority to be sure, but nowhere near as overwhelming, and possibly within a margin of error.</p>
<p>Polling vs Elections is less about who can vote, but rather about <em>when</em>. You can have a poll take place over a 5 year period, and in any given window of time, a certain small, random representative sample is able to vote. Any given participant can vote at most once in that rolling window, before it moves on to others. Participants can also fail to cast a vote, which is similar to sitting out an election, but at least timing of the eligibility window would be randomized for everyone, and can be lengthened to several days, removing major impediments to voting. Of course, all these parameters are customizable, and letting 100% of the people vote 100% of the time throughout the poll is just like a regular election.</p>
<p>People without a phone or active notifications would be underrepresented, but presumably, those who opted into elections and polls conducted with digital technology, especially about smart contract issues, would take care to have them turned on.</p>
<p><strong>Selecting Voters</strong></p>
<p>Each block in Ethereum has a hash of all transactions it contains, and it is pretty much impossible to control this hash without controlling a majority of mining power on the network. Moreover, controlling this hash would only allow one to possibly control the outcome of a tiny window in a single given election. A lot of effort resulting in almost no vandalism.</p>
<p>It is possible for smart contracts to use the <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/11455/inside-a-smart-contract-is-it-possible-to-get-latest-mined-blocks-number-and-i">hashes from previously mined blocks</a> as a “random” seed (better to call “uncontrolled” seed). Based on this seed, we can select <a href="https://community.intercoin.org/t/intercoin-defi-communitycontract/1159/2">members of the voting community</a> who are eligible to vote in any given block, by calling:</p>
<pre>eligible(address, blockNumber)
</pre>
<p>Blocks can go by pretty fast, and someone eligible to vote in block M could be eligible to vote in blocks M+1, M+2, …, M+N. Actually, rather than base it on block number, we use <em>timestamps</em>. That’s because we can’t rely on how quickly blocks will be mined, especially <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/200/19734">after Ethereum Serenity 2.0 rolls out</a>. Timestamps may sometimes be off by 2 hours or so (if miners are malicious) but this shouldn’t seriously affect the window in a biased way if we’re talking about random samples and polling windows that last several days.</p>
<p>Periodically, the Intercoin app (or another dapp) running on one or more servers somewhere can watch the <code>VotingContract</code> on the blockchain and find out if the user has recently become eligible to vote in the poll. It then sends a notification, sms or email to the user, with a link to the poll. Upon receiving it, the user would typically have a bunch of time to visit the link and cast their vote. Rather than having the smart contract waste gas looping through a ton of previous block hashes and execute the <code>eligible()</code> function, the client dapp interface helpfully submits the <code>blockNumber</code> together with the vote. The smart contract them simply verifies the eligibility before allowing the vote to proceed.</p>
<p>The <code>eligible()</code> function takes into account <code>blockNumber</code>, but also the <code>memberCount</code> from <code>CommunityContract</code> and <code>fraction</code> of them that can vote in any given window. The <code>eligible()</code> function must be continuous in the latter two variables, since e.g. <code>memberCount</code> of a community can change between the time the user learns they can vote, and then when their transaction is finally mined.</p>
<p><strong>What Can They Vote For?</strong></p>
<p>Our <code>VotingContract</code> is designed to be a general-purpose smart contract, to work with many types of elections, referendums, and polls. Those who are eligible to vote will call:</p>
<pre><code>contract VotingContract {
   address externalContract;
   address externalMethod;
   uint fraction; // eligible people to vote in any given window, out of 1e10
   uint minimum; // minimum number of eligible people in any window

   function vote(VotingData data, uint eligibleBlock) {
     if (eligible(msg.sender)
     &amp;&amp; !hasVotedSince(msg.sender, eligibleBlock)) {
        // valid vote as far as eligibility and voting once
        // but external contract might roll back this transaction
        // if the vote contains invalid data, for instance
        externalContract.call(
          abi.encodeWithSignature(
             concat(externalMethod, "(uint256,uint256)"), 
             data
          )
        );
     }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the <code>VotingData</code> is a <code>struct</code> that can contain arbitrary properties, which are interpreted by the <code>externalMethod</code> of the <code>externalContract</code>, which may choose to <code>rollback()</code> the transaction. It is not the business of <code>VotingContract</code> about <em><strong>how</strong></em> the vote is interpreted. It may be tallied in various ways (First past the post, <a href="https://electionscience.org/library/approval-voting-versus-irv/">ranked choice, approval vote</a>) and it may be a vote among two or more candidates (although for more than two, keep in mind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem">Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem</a>). For example, the <code>IncomeContract</code> can use the <code>VotingContract</code> and <code>CommunityContract</code> to allow a community to vote on whether the level of UBI should go up or down by 1%.</p>
<p><strong>Threat Profiles</strong></p>
<p>The set of threat profiles for an election or poll differs from, say, a banking app. Although both require security, in the banking app:</p>
<ol>
<li>people are managing relatively large amounts of money which are dear to them, and therefore take care to make sure their transaction was properly executed</li>
<li>people use the app that the bank releases, cryptographically signs and distributes on the app store or the web through https</li>
<li>people trust the bank and the bank is prepared to reverse individual transactions through chargebacks and fraud investigations</li>
</ol>

Experienced Python developers might recognize some of them. However, others will still be unknown. Regardless, I find all of them very cool.</p>

<h2 id="yc4ulma"><code>...</code></h2>
<p>Yes, you’re reading it right, <code>...</code> is a valid construct in Python. <code>...</code> is a singleton object called <code>Ellipsis</code>. If you type it into the Python interpreter, you can actually see it:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>...
<span>Ellipsis</span>
</code></pre>
<p>According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis">official docs</a> , <code>Ellipsis</code> is a "special value used mostly in conjunction with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data types.". There’s two major use cases for it. One is to serve as a placeholder body in an empty function. The other is on <code>Numpy</code>, as a slice item, just as described in the docs.</p>
<h3 id="function-placeholder">Function Placeholder</h3>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>Ellipsis</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>pass</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Beware, I'm not saying that <code>pass</code> == <code>...</code>, I'm just saying that as a function body, the outcome is the same. In fact, you can use anything as placeholder.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>my_awesome_function</span>():</span>
    <span>"An empty, but also awesome function"</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="numpy">Numpy</h3>
<p>The code below basically means create an array of matrices. Each matrix is 3x3. Then get the second column (numpy arrays are 0-based) of all innermost matrix.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>array = np.arange(<span>27</span>).reshape(<span>3</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>3</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>array
array([[[ <span>0</span>,  <span>1</span>,  <span>2</span>],
        [ <span>3</span>,  <span>4</span>,  <span>5</span>],
        [ <span>6</span>,  <span>7</span>,  <span>8</span>]],

       [[ <span>9</span>, <span>10</span>, <span>11</span>],
        [<span>12</span>, <span>13</span>, <span>14</span>],
        [<span>15</span>, <span>16</span>, <span>17</span>]],

       [[<span>18</span>, <span>19</span>, <span>20</span>],
        [<span>21</span>, <span>22</span>, <span>23</span>],
        [<span>24</span>, <span>25</span>, <span>26</span>]]])
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>array[..., <span>1</span>] 
array([[ <span>1</span>,  <span>4</span>,  <span>7</span>],
       [<span>10</span>, <span>13</span>, <span>16</span>],
       [<span>19</span>, <span>22</span>, <span>25</span>]])
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>array[:, :, <span>1</span>] 
array([[ <span>1</span>,  <span>4</span>,  <span>7</span>],
       [<span>10</span>, <span>13</span>, <span>16</span>],
       [<span>19</span>, <span>22</span>, <span>25</span>]])
</code></pre>
<p>Beware: Python's list doesn't work with <code>...</code>. </p>
<h2 id="an-elegant-unpacking">An Elegant Unpacking</h2>
<p>Iterable unpacking is a remarkably convenient feature and has been there for a while. Most people use it to unpack iterables with multiple items. As example, consider the following use cases.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a, *b, c = range(<span>1</span>, <span>11</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>c
<span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>b
[<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Or just:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a, b, c = range(<span>3</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>0</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>b
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>c
<span>2</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But one nice use case that many people do not take advantage of is unpacking a single iterable. Why this is useful? It makes the code a little bit more elegant, IMHO.</p>
<p>Instead of doing this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>lst = [<span>1</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = lst[<span>0</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>(a, ) = lst
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>lst = [<span>1</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>[a] = lst
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>I know that it may seem silly, but at least to me, it looks more elegant.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-flat-this-list">Can You Flat This List?</h2>
<p>Flattening a list can be done in several ways. The simplest one is using list comprehension. </p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>], [<span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>flattened = [elem <span>for</span> sublist <span>in</span> l <span>for</span> elem <span>in</span> sublist]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>flattened
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>If you're more inclined to functional programming, you can use a reducer.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>from</span> functools <span>import</span> reduce
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>reduce(<span>lambda</span> x,y: x+y,l)
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>However, there's yet another way. You can use the <code>sum</code> function!</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(l, [])
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>This works because the <code>sum</code> function iterates through each element in the list and concatenates them with the default value you pass as the second argument. Since lists in Python can be concatenated with <code>+</code> operator, then you get something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(l, []) ==&gt; [] + [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>] + [<span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>] + [<span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Even though this trick is brilliant, it’s by no means readable. Also, it has a terrible performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we do this with string?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, Python forbids doing the same with strings, even though you can concatenated strings with <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>s = [<span>"abc"</span>, <span>"def"</span>, <span>"ghf"</span>]

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(s, <span>""</span>)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input<span>-3</span>-f60d89b81305&gt; <span>in</span> &lt;module&gt;
----&gt; <span>1</span> sum(s, <span>""</span>)

TypeError: sum() can<span>'t sum strings [use '</span><span>'.join(seq) instead]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If we dig intro CPython source code, we can find where this happens:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>static</span> PyObject *
<span>builtin_sum_impl</span><span>(PyObject *<span>module</span>, PyObject *iterable, PyObject *start)</span>

</span>{
    PyObject *result = start;
    PyObject *temp, *item, *iter;

    iter = PyObject_GetIter(iterable);
    <span>if</span> (iter == <span>NULL</span>)
        <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span>;

    <span>if</span> (result == <span>NULL</span>) {
        result = PyLong_FromLong(<span>0</span>);
        <span>if</span> (result == <span>NULL</span>) {
            Py_DECREF(iter);
            <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span>;
        }
    } <span>else</span> {
        
        <span>if</span> (PyUnicode_Check(result)) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_TypeError,
                <span>"sum() can't sum strings [use ''.join(seq) instead]"</span>);
            Py_DECREF(iter);
            <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> (PyBytes_Check(result)) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_TypeError,
                <span>"sum() can't sum bytes [use b''.join(seq) instead]"</span>);
            Py_DECREF(iter);
            <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> (PyByteArray_Check(result)) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_TypeError,
                <span>"sum() can't sum bytearray [use b''.join(seq) instead]"</span>);
            Py_DECREF(iter);
            <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span>;
        }
        Py_INCREF(result);
    }

<h2 id="the">The <code>_</code></h2>
<p>This one is really interesting and very handy when working with the REPL. It not only works with the default Python interpreter, but with IPython as well.</p>
<p>Whenever you run an expression in the REPL, Python binds the output to the <code>_</code> variable. </p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>nums = [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>7</span>]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>sum(nums)
<span>11</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>_
<span>11</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>_</code> is a variable like any other, you can re-bind it, or do anything else with it.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>9</span> + _
<span>20</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = _
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span>20</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-else">What <code>else</code>?</h2>
<p>The <code>else</code> statement in can serve several purposes. Few people know, but you can use it outside the classical ‘if else` block. Python allow it to be used on loops and also on exception blocks.</p>
<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
<p>Python has two different loops, <code>for</code> and <code>while</code>. Both of them can be "broken". That is, if a certain condition is met, we can break out of the loop. For example:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>7</span>]: <span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
   ...:     <span>if</span> a == <span>3</span>:
   ...:         print(<span>"a == 3. exiting loop."</span>)
   ...:         <span>break</span>
   ...:     a += <span>1</span>
   ...: 
a == <span>3.</span> exiting loop.
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's say that we are looking for a particular condition. If that condition is satisfied, we save the result in a flag called <code>found</code>. Then, if we don't find it, we print a message.</p>
<pre><code>found = <span>False</span>
a = <span>0</span>

<span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        found = <span>True</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>if</span> <span>not</span> found:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>a</code> never becomes 12, the program outputs <code>a was never found</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, but how can we use <code>else</code> in this context?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>else</code> can be used to replace the flag. Basically, what we actually want is to run the loop and, if not found, then print a message. This is how it looks like with <code>else</code>:</p>
<pre><code>a = <span>0</span>

<span>while</span> a &lt; <span>10</span>:
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        <span>break</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>else</span>:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>And since it works with any loop, you can use a <code>for</code> instead of <code>while</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> a <span>in</span> range(<span>10</span>):
    <span>if</span> a == <span>12</span>:
        <span>break</span>
    a += <span>1</span>
<span>else</span>:
    print(<span>"a was never found"</span>)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
<p>The <code>else</code> in Python is so versatile that you can even use it in a <code>try ... except</code> block. The idea here is to capture a nonoccurrence of an exception. </p>
<pre><code>In [<span>13</span>]: <span>try</span>:
    ...:     {}[<span>'lala'</span>]
    ...: <span>except</span> KeyError:
    ...:     print(<span>"Key is missing"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"Else here"</span>)
    ...: 
Key <span>is</span> missing
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we try looking up a key named “lala” in an empty dictionary. Since “lala” is not there, the code will raise an <code>KeyError</code> exception. When I run this snippet in <code>IPython</code>, I got an expected result.</p>
<p>What about a case where the program raises no exception?</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>14</span>]: <span>try</span>:
    ...:     {<span>'lala'</span>: <span>'bla'</span>}[<span>'lala'</span>]
    ...: <span>except</span> KeyError:
    ...:     print(<span>"Key is missing"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"Else here"</span>)
    ...: 
Else here
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can see it in action. The <code>{’lala’: ‘bla’}[‘lala’]</code> block won’t raise <code>KeyError</code>, so the <code>else</code> comes into play. </p>
<p>Remember, few people know this, so I personally avoid using this feature to not confuse other developers working in the same code base. It’s nice to impress friends, though!</p>
<h2 id="comparing-things-like-a-boss">Comparing Things Like a Boss</h2>
<p>This is one of my favorites and not so hidden, to be honest. Unlike many programming languages, like <code>Java</code>, <code>C</code> or <code>C++</code>, Python allows you to chain comparison operators. Let's imagine that you have a variable <code>x</code> that holds the value of <code>10</code>. Now, let's say that you want to assert that <code>x</code> is within a range, like 5..20, inclusive. You could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>16</span>]: x = <span>10</span>
In [<span>17</span>]: <span>if</span> x &gt;= <span>5</span> <span>and</span> x &lt;= <span>20</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is within range"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is outside range"</span>)
    ...: 
<span>is</span> within range
</code></pre>
<p>It turns out, this can be simplified by chaining the operators. So, we can refactor the code to this:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>18</span>]: <span>if</span> <span>5</span> &lt;= x &lt;= <span>20</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"is within range"</span>)
    ...: <span>else</span>:
    ...:     print(<span>"x is outside range"</span>)
    ...: 
<span>is</span> within range
</code></pre>
<p>This code achieves the exact same result, but it's much more elegant. You can chain using any kind of comparison operator.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>20</span> == x &gt; <span>1</span>
<span>False</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>25</span> &gt; x &lt;= <span>15</span>
<span>True</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x &lt; <span>20</span> &lt; x*<span>10</span> &lt; <span>1000</span>
<span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Very cool!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That’s the end of this post. Python is a very friendly language and has some nice, but not well-known, features. In this post, I showed you my favorites and I hope you’ve learned something new. See you next time!</p>

  <h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>

  <p>An encouraging development in the education of programmers in recent years has been a renewed interest in the relationship between programming, logic and abstract algebra. Recent enthusiasm over functional programming is no doubt the main motivation behind this happy development.</p>

  <p>However, this interest is at times accompanied by a kind of awed appreciation of this relationship, perhaps among practitioner enthusiasts, who consider it almost miraculous, more than among academics. Some researchers notable for popularizing the interest in this relationship encourage this view with talk of “computational trinitarianism” and statements like, “this is further proof that mathematics is discovered rather than invented,” one <a href="http://archive.is/3wgAM">going so far</a> as to call the relationship “a manifestation of the divine” and to say that “all three have ontological force; they codify what is, not how to describe what is already given to us. In this sense they are foundational; if we suppose that they are merely <em>descriptive</em>, we would be left with the question of where these previously given concepts arise, leading us back again to foundations”. Another has <a href="https://vimeo.com/242784236">said</a>,<sup id="fnref:milewski"><a href="#fn:milewski">1</a></sup> “Have you heard of the Curry-Howard-Lambek isomorphism? … These three different theories … were developed separately — constructive logic, typed lambda calculus, and category theory — and the isomorphism says that these are actually <em>identical</em>. Why do these three completely separate theories have the same structure? Because all three of them are about composability.” While he is not too far off the mark when he later says, “Maybe we are just discovering the way our brains work. … [I]f mathematics is all about composition, then composition is something that our brains came up with in order to deal with complexity,” the truth is far simpler yet more interesting, even if less mysterious.</p>

  <p>Awed wonder is a powerful marketing tool, but it mystifies rather than clarifies, and fosters a kind of magical thinking in a field that strives to be most at odds with it (although, as we’ll see in part 2, it sometimes fails). The goal of mathematics is to simplify, not to wow. This attitude towards that — quite obvious, as we’ll see — relationship also distracts from the actual, less obvious, discoveries made. The existence of this relationship was not among them; it was not the denouement — it was the setup. Confusing the two muddles the very essence of any story.</p>

  <p>I also believe that it is this very attitude that puts the focus on the chosen mathematical abstractions rather than on the things they describe creates an atmosphere where there can only be one True interpretation — even one with three personas. I call this absolutist view that confuses the peculiarities of a method of observation with those of the observed system and so denies alternative interpretations the “Protestant” view, and it is a hindrance to understanding logic, where truth is, almost by definition, always relative to a specific system. As Alonzo Church wrote in the very paper he first introduced the λ-calculus<sup id="fnref:church0"><a href="#fn:church0">2</a></sup>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We do not attach any character of uniqueness or absolute truth to any particular system of logic. The entities of formal logic are abstractions, invented because of their use in describing and systematizing facts of experience or observation, and their properties, determined in rough outline by this intended use, depend for their exact character on the arbitrary choice of the inventor… [T]here exist, undoubtedly, more than one formal system whose use as a logic is feasible, and of these systems one may be more pleasing or more convenient than another, but it cannot be said that one is right and the other wrong.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The following text will attempt to demistify this relationship between computation, logic and abstract algebra. Category theory is a generalization of the last, but programming languages are sometimes interchangeably assigned to both the second, logic, and the first, computation, thus adding to the confusion. In my view, programming languages (at least when studied in a theoretical context) strictly belong to the second persona of logic, and not at all to the first, computation, other than by virtue of the ordinary relationship between the three; programming languages are no more related to computation than formal logic is. I <a href="https://pron.github.io/posts/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-computation">have previously written</a> about the distinction between programming and computation and the misunderstanding caused by confusing the two, and I hope that this text will clarify the matter further.</p>

  <p>While I will not opine on whether or not mathematical objects have “an ontological force”, as the Platonic ontology of mathematics is a matter of debate in the philosophy of mathematics — a fascinating field, but not a focus of this discussion — I will show that they are not only very much descriptive, but that <em>what</em> they attempt to describe, and therefore how they arise, has been explicitly stated by the originators of those ideas. There is nothing incidental, miraculous, surprising or “divine” in the relationship between computation, logic and algebra; rather, nothing is more creatively human than the process that led to their correlation, and while some things in mathematics are perhaps discovered, logic and algebra were <em>invented</em>, and rather than carrying an independent “foundational ontological force”, they were devised to <em>describe</em> a physical phenomenon (although I do not claim that the mathematical systems invented may not <em>also</em> correspond to some Truth). In particular, I will show that computation, logic and algebra were studied as a single subject for most of their relevant history, related in the following way: human reason works by computation, logic is a description of the process of reasoning, and algebra is the mathematical modeling of logic. The three began to separate into different disciplines only towards the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. Logic was separated from algebra by Gottlob Frege, immediately triggering the criticism that the correspondence between the two is an argument for having only one. Frege responded that there would <em>obviously</em> be a correspondence between the two because he had invented one to describe the same thing as the other, but that one can translate between two modes of expression does not mean that one of them is redundant. Computation separated from logic some decades later as a more foundational or primitive concept, while exposing the fact that the basic principles of how logic supposedly described human reason — which Gottfried Leibniz called the “Art of Combination” — hadn’t changed for literally millennia, and while logicians/algebraists declared themselves to be studying the computation in the human mind, they were actually just modeling a very particular, and ancient, <em>view</em> of human reason that they had taken on unquestionable faith. The systems were in such harmonious correspondence not just because they described the same physical phenomenon, but because they all <em>re</em>-described the <em>same ancient description</em> of that phenomenon.</p>

  <p>While researching the topic — not being a logician or a historian, but rather a programmer and an amateur interested in the history of mathematics — I was surprised how explicit this connection was made from the very beginning of the disciplines. Quite the opposite of accidental or miraculous, calling this relationship obvious is an <em>understatement</em>. That there is some relationship between a house cat and a leopard can be said to be obvious; the one between the original Star Wars trilogy and its many prequels and sequels is much more than just obvious. If you think that it is in any way accidental or miraculous, or that it is proof that Darth Vader was discovered rather than invented, you are clearly missing something very important in understanding the meta-theory of stories — meaning, how they come to be. I delight at the opportunity to use the history of science — or of logic and mathematics in this case — to clarify the development of mathematical concepts by tracing their evolution and the creative process of their originators.</p>

  <p>This book-length text — and not a short book — is published as a three-part blog post series, but I personally wrote very little of it. While the text is not different in content or conclusions from books about the history of logic and computation (or the wonderful recent Atlantic article, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/aristotle-computer/518697/"><em>How Aristotle Created the Computer</em></a>), it is certainly different in style, being comprised mostly of original sources. I chose to compose the text in this way for several reasons, listed here in no particular order: 1. I am not a professional historian and do not have sufficient knowledge to provide insight on historical trends. 2. I find reading (carefully selected) primary sources a lot more fun than sweeping descriptions. 3. As most mathematicians and programmers do not make good historians, a lot of inaccuracies and downright mistakes are perpetrated because few have seen the actual sources. 4. As my goal is to demystify logic and mathematics, I think it is especially enlightening to read how the originators of the ideas describe their process of arriving at their insight. My text is also different in focus; it attempts to emphasize the evolution of the connection …</p></div></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-ff1f1677bf36496f03d8"><div><p>As most of the major media categories — music, video and video games — have existed for decades, we tend to forget that media is technology. Instead, we think of technology as being used to express media, rather than media itself. Spotify, for example, is an <em>internet</em> <em>streaming </em>music service, while iTunes is a <em>download </em>music service, SiriusXM is <em>satellite</em> <em>broadcast</em> music service, and radio is a <em>terrestrial broadcast</em> technology. This focus on delivery ignores the classic definition of media: “<span>outlets</span> or <span>tools</span> used to <span>store</span> and <span>deliver</span> information or data.”</p><p>While the above might seem preoccupied with theory and philosophy, all analysis of the past and future of a given media category must start from the fact that media is technology. This is because technology not only enables content categories, it defines their business models and shapes the content, too. And as we know, technology is in a constant process of change. </p><p><strong>Chapter 1: How Technology Created Recorded Media, Then Continually Redefined It</strong></p><p>Music offers a great view into the interplay between technology, business model and content. Consider the following triptych, which covers seven decades, two decades and one year, respectively.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602797899091_5458"><div><p>&nbsp;When the flat record first emerged in the 1850s, it standardized around the 78. The 78 (as in 78 rotations per minute) came in a 10-inch version that held three minutes of music and a 12-inch version that held four. This meant that after centuries of variability, music suddenly had a defined run-time.&nbsp;</p><p>This length was reaffirmed by the first mass market standard for consumer media: the 45 RPM vinyl single, which launched in 1948 and held roughly three minutes. The music industry coalesced around this format (and its runtime) for a variety of tech-based reasons. The 45 was far cheaper for consumers than a 78 album, which was important given the high cost of record players and the ubiquity of free (singles-focused) radio. The 45’s cost advantage also meant it was the primary way labels delivered singles to thousands of radio stations across the country for local airplay. In addition, RCA quickly figured out how to make a stackable version of 45s, which was important to jukebox manufacturers. The rise of the 45 naturally led the length of the average song to decline; a four-minute song simply couldn’t fit on the most important audio format in the world.</p><p>As the physical and financial limitations of the 78 and 45 were relieved, and the far more flexible cassette and CD emerged, the length of the average single grew rapidly, adding nearly two minutes (or 78%) from 1959 to 1992. Still, almost all tracks conformed to the three-to-four minute standard. After decades, the West had become used to the idea that a song was roughly between three minutes and 20 seconds and four minutes and 10 seconds long.</p><p>On its surface, the shift to digital audio should have led to further increases in song length. After all, there was no longer any limitation to run-time. However, the reverse occurred. Technology might have relaxed its grip on music’s length, but it had strengthened its hold on business models.</p><p>As is well known, iTunes unbundled the physical album in individually downloadable (and bought) tracks. But in doing so, it penalized artists for bundling a multi-part song into a single track. Pink Floyd’s decision to split the 26-minute and nine-part Shine on You Crazy Diamond into two discrete tracks didn’t matter in 1975; all nine parts fit on a single record and no one wanted to buy just a single half let alone a single part. But in 2005, such a move could mean missing out on 75% of revenues — why sell two things when you could sell nine? And why would a consumer buy an entire $10 album if all they wanted was two $1 portions of Shine on You Crazy Diamond? These incentives naturally led to artists that were publishing new music to split their longer/multi-section songs into separate — and shorter — preludes, interludes and segments.</p><p>This behaviour has been greatly exacerbated by the advent of a new and even more disruptive digital music technology: on-demand streaming. While iTunes was technically innovative, its business model was not. Consumers, after all, primarily owned copies of individual tracks in the 1950s and 1960s. Spotify and Apple Music, meanwhile, meant consumers adopted not just a new music technology, but also bought an entirely different product: ongoing access to all music ever created.</p><p>But as technology has shifted consumers away from discrete and attributable transactions (buying record A on date B) to ongoing and general ones (subscribing to service C in perpetuity), musical talent needed a new compensation model. Spotify, therefore, decided to pay talent as and to the degree consumers listened to their works. Matching revenue with usage is intuitive, but it was never before possible in music. There was no way to track at-home record spins or CD plays, let alone charge for them. Nor was it practical for iTunes to ask users to download an individual song to their devices and pay several pennies per play when they later synched their iPod to iTunes. (This would have been rife with abuse, too.)</p><p>Engagement-based monetization is arguably more fair. Consider, for example, that the Beatles’ <em>Yesterday </em>and Psy’s <em>Gangnam Style</em> would each generate $1 when sold on iTunes, even if the former was played 2,000 times over ten years and the latter 30 times in the month it was bought and then never again. But the more that business models change, the more that incentives and content change, too.</p><p>To support engagement-based monetization, Spotify and its label suppliers had to define engagement. And they chose to do this on a per stream basis with a minimum stream time of 30 seconds (to avoid accidental plays, track skipping, etc.). However, this meant that a 10-minute track, five-minute track and 31-second track generated the same royalties.&nbsp;</p><p>So as the music industry has transitioned the majority of its revenues from CDs and downloads to streaming, major artists have relentlessly shortened and split their tracks. Why release a five-minute song if you can make it a two and a half-minute song that’s played twice? Or two different two and a half-minute songs? This meant artists had yet another reason to reduce track lengths</p><p>All of this helps to explain the extraordinary success of the 2019’s top track, <em>Old Town Road </em>by Lil Nas X, which is also Billboard’s longest running #1 ever, at 19 consecutive weeks. While the song is awesome, it’s also only one minute and 53 seconds — roughly half of 2019’s average song length. This means that four minutes of listening generated two times the average revenue and charting lift of every other hit song that year.</p><p><em>Old Town Road </em>isn’t an exception, either. Up until 2017, Billboard’s Hot 100 Chart has never had a year with more than 2% of its charting tracks shorter than two minutes and 30 seconds (most years had none). In the past three years, this sum has skyrocketed to over 12%, or roughly one in every eight tracks.</p><p>Notably, labels are also encouraging artists to simplify the name of their songs and albums in order to ensure they’re optimized for voice-controlled speakers and touchscreen-based searches. A track with five words is more likely to be misunderstood or suffer from autocorrect than one with two. Similarly, voice assistants are known to struggle with <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/voice-is-the-next-big-platform-unless-you-have-an-accent/">accents</a>, such as Irish or even Texan. Being hard to say means you might not get played.</p><p><em>Old Town Road </em>isn’t the first time technology made a hit. In fact, the modern day dominance of rap and R&amp;B comes from how changes in technology – not for delivery, but sales recognition –&nbsp; afforded Lil Nas X the opportunity to top the charts in the first place.</p><p>Prior to the 1990s, Black artists and music fans had spent decades arguing the record industry conspired against “urban contemporary” music by refusing it radio play and ignoring its sales. It took only five weeks after Billboard adopted SoundScan, a computerized sales database, to prove this theory right.</p><p>Until 1991, Billboard charts weren’t based on actual unit sales or radio play. Instead, it was assembled using (white) retail clerk estimates of what was selling best and what (white) DJs considered to be “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/06/19/charting-soundscans-shake-up/3b8187fb-2332-4096-95e9-1f8db7b66b2e/">hottest</a>” each week. According to <em>The Atlantic</em>, both groups had<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/06/19/charting-soundscans-shake-up/3b8187fb-2332-4096-95e9-1f8db7b66b2e/"> reasons to lie</a>. For example, labels would pressure radio stations to favour “hand-picked hits” if they wanted to keep receiving the newest single on time (stations sometimes<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola"> received bribes to play specific tracks</a>, too). Meanwhile, labels would force inventory on their retailers, who would then overreport sales to convince music fans to buy excess inventory.</p><p>Naturally, those who ran the music industry saw little need to overhaul how it worked. And thus while the book and film industries had shifted to computerized sales databases in the 1980s, not one of the top six record distributors signed onto SoundScan before its release in June 1991. But this resistance didn’t stop N.W.A.’s <em>N***az4life</em> from debuting #2 on the Billboard Top 100 the very next month under SoundScan. This was the highest charting performance in rap history – and happened without any radio airplay, music video airings on MTV, or a concert tour. The failings of the old honour system were further demonstrated by the fact that N.W.A. debuted at only #21 on Billboard’s R&amp;B chart, which wasn’t yet on SoundScan. Somehow it was possible that <em>N***az4life</em> was the second biggest album in the country by units purchased, but 21st in its own genre when it came to what was “selling” and “hottest.” One week after it’s release, the album hit #1 on the Billboard chart (displacing R.E.M) as hundreds …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

            <h2>Fun with Combinators</h2>

            <p>
    Posted on October 17, 2020
</p>





<p>There are a bunch of “minimal” computational models out there: Turing machines, lambda calculus, PowerPoint <span data-cites="wildenhainTuringCompletenessMS2017">(Wildenhain <a href="#ref-wildenhainTuringCompletenessMS2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, etc. These are radically simple languages which are nonetheless Turing complete, so theoretically “as powerful” as each other. Of those, lambda calculus is without question my favourite to actually write programs in: it’s the one which is closest to crawling out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit">Turing tarpit</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of implementation, though, it is <em>far</em> from simple. Lambda calculus has <em>variables</em>, which introduce huge complexity into the interpreter: especially if you want to do any kind of formal reasoning about programs, this complexity is a problem. We might want to reach for something even lower-level than lambda calculus: this is where combinator calculi come in.</p>
<p>You may have heard of SKI combinator calculus: it’s the “simplest” of the calculi, but it’s not actually very easy to understand, and it’s absolute murder to try use. So we’re going to start with <code>BCKW</code>, a more obscure calculus, actually invented by Haskell Curry.</p>
<p>There are 4 combinators in <code>BCKW</code>: <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>K</code>, and <code>W</code> (shocking, I know). You can think about these combinators as functions which manipulate the beginning of strings:</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)
Cxyz ~&gt; xzy
Kxy  ~&gt; x
Wxy  ~&gt; xyy</code></pre>
<p>Let’s work with some examples to get a sense for how these combinators work.</p>
<p>Upper case letters are combinators, lower-case are variables. Yes, yes, I know I said that combinator calculi didn’t need variables, and it doesn’t! I’m just using them here to explain how each of the combinators work. If you really want to be pedantic you can think of the lower case letters as notational placeholders meaning “any given combinator”. They won’t exist in any actual programs we write.</p>
<p>The simplest combinator is <code>K</code>: it’s actually equivalent to the <code>const</code> function from Haskell. It discards its second argument, and returns the first. If you give a combinator more arguments than it usually accepts, you just keep the extra arguments in the output:</p>
<pre><code>Kxyz ~&gt; xz</code></pre>
<p><code>W</code> is the next combinator: it <em>duplicates</em> its second argument.</p>
<pre><code>Wxy ~&gt; xyy</code></pre>
<p>We always start from the <em>left</em>, applying the rule for the left-most combinator first.</p>
<pre><code>WKxyz ~&gt; Kxxyz ~&gt; xyz
KWxyz ~&gt; Wyz   ~&gt; yzz</code></pre>
<p>Next we have <code>C</code>: this is equivalent to the Haskell function <code>flip</code>. It swaps the second and third arguments:</p>
<pre><code>Cxyz ~&gt; xzy</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a small little evaluator for expressions which use <code>C</code>, <code>K</code>, and <code>W</code>. You can edit the expression, and press enter to step through it.</p>



<p>The last combinator introduces parentheses, and it’s equivalent to function composition.</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)</code></pre>
<p>You can write parentheses yourself: implicitly, all expressions are left-associative. That means that the following are all equal:</p>
<pre><code>xyz = (xy)z = (x)yz = ((x)y)z</code></pre>
<p>But <code>xyz</code> is <em>not</em> equal to, say, <code>x(yz)</code>.</p>
<p>And here’s a puzzle to start flexing your combinator skills: one of the combinators in SKI combinator calculus is <code>I</code>, which is the identity function.</p>
<pre><code>Ix ~&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>Try write an expression which functions the same way as <code>I</code>, using only the <code>BCKW</code> combinators. Use the following evaluator to try and figure out how to do it: write an expression after <code>λ&gt;</code> which functions the same as <code>I</code>.</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> <code>CK</code> followed by any combinator will do the trick. So <code>CKB</code>, <code>CKK</code>, <code>CKC</code>, etc.
<pre><code>I = CKC</code></pre>
Update 19/10/2020: A few people have pointed out (<a href="https://www.joachim-breitner.de/">Joachim Breitner</a> was the first) that there is a shorter solution to this problem: <code>WK</code>. I tend to prefer solutions that don’t include <code>W</code>, since then we’re working in a subset of the language that is both terminating and affine; although in this case the reason I didn’t mention <code>WK</code> is that I just didn’t find it myself.
</details>

<p>Each of the combinators we’ve defined so far work a little weird: they seem to skip over their first argument, and work on their second. Indeed, there is another, equivalent combinator calculus which doesn’t have this peculiarity:</p>
<pre><code>Bxyz ~&gt; x(yz)
Axy  ~&gt; y
Mx   ~&gt; xx
Txy  ~&gt; yx</code></pre>
<p><code>B</code> stays the same in this calculus, but the rest of the combinators get switched out for seemingly simpler versions. <code>K</code> goes to <code>A</code><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<pre><code>Axy ~&gt; y
Kxy ~&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>Which isn’t a huge change. It’s the other two where we see the real difference. <code>W</code> has been swapped out for <code>M</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Wxy ~&gt; xyy
Mx  ~&gt; xx</code></pre>
<p>As you can see <code>W</code> basically does the same thing as <code>M</code>, but while passing through its first argument. The difference between <code>T</code> and <code>C</code> is similar:</p>
<pre><code>Cxyz ~&gt; xzy
Txy  ~&gt; yx</code></pre>
<p>So, first of all, it is pretty simple to show that <code>BCKW</code> contains all of the <code>BAMT</code> combinators. Try find a way to write <code>T</code> using only <code>BCKW</code> combinators (hint: you might want to use your previous answer for writing <code>I</code> using <code>BCKW</code>).</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> So in fact all of the changed <code>BAMT</code> combinators can be encoded using <code>BCKW</code> by putting <code>I</code> (or <code>CKC</code> or what have you) after the corresponding <code>BCKW</code> combinator. In other words:
<pre><code>T = CI = C(CKC)
A = KI = K(CKC)
M = WI = W(CKC)</code></pre>
</details>
<p>It’s pretty easy to go from <code>BCKW</code> to <code>BAMT</code>, then. However, it’s <em>extremely</em> difficult to go the other way. Here, try to write <code>K</code> in terms of <code>BAMT</code> (this is quite difficult, do not expect to get it!):</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> Either of the following would work:
<pre><code>B(TA)(BBT)
B(B(TA)B)T</code></pre>
</details>
<p>So this is why we will stick to <code>BCKW</code> for the time being: <code>BAMT</code> is just too painful to use.</p>

<p>One of the things <code>BCKW</code> has over <code>SKI</code> is that each combinator represents a concrete capability. <code>K</code> and <code>W</code> especially: without these combinators, we can neither duplicate nor discard variables. This makes the languages without one or both of these interesting (albeit not Turing-complete).</p>
<p>If we say that we can’t use <code>W</code>, we know that the will not duplicate any input. In fact, encoded appropriately, we know that the program can only decrease its size through execution. The <code>BCK</code> system is in fact an encoding of <em>affine</em> logic, which is all the rage nowadays. Rust uses affine types to guarantee memory safety: by preventing duplication of references, you can know that whenever you’re looking at a variable you’re free to modify it, or destroy it if necessary (obviously Rust is a bit more complex than what I’ve described here, but <code>BCK</code> is indeed the fundamental basis for the system in the same way that <code>SK</code> can be the basis for any programming language).</p>
<p>If we remove <code>K</code> as well we have a <em>linear</em> language. This is even more restrictive, but is also quite actively researched at the moment: linear types have been used to construct languages for differential privacy, for instance.</p>
<p>There’s one small issue with <code>BC</code>: it doesn’t (strictly speaking) have an equivalent to <code>I</code>. You can write an expression which is <em>close</em>, but it will only actually compute when applied to at least 3 arguments. See if you can find it.</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>BCC</code></pre>
</details>
<p>Usually we add <code>I</code>, though, to give us <code>BCI</code>.</p>

<p><code>S</code> is the only combinator we haven’t seen yet. It’s kind of a combination of <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>W</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Sxyz ~&gt; xz(yz)</code></pre>
<p>It does parenthesising, reordering, <em>and</em> duplication. This allows it to be powerful to be Turing complete only with the addition of <code>K</code>. Try first to construct <code>I</code> given only <code>S</code> and <code>K</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary> <code>SK</code> followed by any combinator will suffice.
<pre><code>I = SKK = SKS</code></pre>
</details>
<p>And now construct <code>S</code> from <code>BCKW</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>S = B(BW)(BBC) = B(B(BW)C)(BB)</code></pre>
</details>
<p>Of course, to show that <code>SK</code> is universal we’d need to show that it contains one of the other universal systems. We won’t do that exhaustively here, but first just try to figure out <code>B</code> and <code>W</code>:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>B = S(KS)K</code></pre>
</details>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<pre><code>S = SS(SK) = SS(KI)</code></pre>
</details>

<p>The next task is to encode the <code>Y</code> combinator. This is a combinator that evaluates to the following:</p>
<pre><code>Yf ~&gt; f(Yf)</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it encodes <em>recursion</em>. Like the <code>fix</code> function in Haskell, this combinator allows us to do recursion without explicit self-reference. And, of course, we can define this combinator using the combinators we’ve seen before, since our language is Turing complete. One encoding is <code>BM(CBM)</code>:</p>



<p>As you can see, <code>BM(CBM)</code>, when applied to <code>f</code>, yields <code>f(M(CBMf))</code>, which is equivalent to <code>f(BM(CBM)f)</code> (the <code>B</code> just hasn’t been applied inside the <code>f</code>). So this is indeed a proper recursion combinator.</p>

<p>Let’s try doing a little bit of programming with these combinators now.</p>
<p>In the lambada calculus, to encode numbers we often use the <em>church</em> numerals: that’s what we’re going to do here, too. A church numeral representing some number <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> is a function which takes two arguments, and applies the first argument to the second <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> times. Here are some church numerals in Haskell:</p>
<pre><code>zero :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
zero f x = x

one :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
one f x = f x

two :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
two f x = f (f x)

three :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
three f x = f (f (f x))</code></pre>
<p>Encoding these numerals in combinators is a little more difficult. Zero and one are obvious: they are <code>A</code> and <code>I</code>, respectively. Try to figure out two and three:</p>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary><code>WB</code>
</details>



<details>
<summary>Answer</summary><code>SB(WB)</code>
</details>
<p>It turns out that it’s pretty easy to encode numbers in a relatively small amount of space, using a binary encoding. First, multiplication on Church numerals is simply composition: so that’s <code>B</code> on our combinators. We already have 2 defined, so the next thing we need for a binary encoding is a successor function. And we know what <em>that</em> is, from the answer to 3!</p>
<p>This means we can encode normal number in <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathvariant="script"><mi>𝒪</mi></mstyle><mo stretchy="false" form="prefix">(</mo><mo>log</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{O}(\log n)</annotation></semantics></math> space (although it still takes linear time to evaluate). The following repl allows for numbers:</p>


<p>We could take up even less space if we allowed for non-normal forms. 4, for instance, could be encoded like so:</p>
<pre><code>M(WB)</code></pre>
<p>But we generally prefer to keep our encodings in normal form: otherwise there’s some extra evaluation we have to pay for when we go to use them.</p>

<p>Once upon a time SKI combinators were used as a target for functional compilers: Miranda, Haskell’s precursor, compiled down to a set of combinators which included <code>SKI</code>. Nowadays, Haskell is compiled to the “spineless tagless G-machine”: its compilation technique took over from combinators in the late 80s, and has been the dominant form since. Apparently the reason is that, on the current architecture of most computers, combinator-based compilation targets just aren’t fast enough. They generate too much garbage: as a result, …</p></div></div>

			<p>Following <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/12/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users/">Part 1</a> on forcing Mainland China DNS service upon Hong Kong WiFi users, this part analyzes how the periodic DNS queries on <code>qq.com</code>, as seen by users capturing the DNS queries, are generated from the recent Samsung phones firmware (as at Sept 2020) when WiFi is used.</p>

<blockquote><p>tl;dr: These queries are sent simultaneously to all DNS servers registered for the WiFi connection, including <code>114.114.114.114</code> when it is added under circumstances as examined in <a href="http://blog.headuck.com/2020/10/12/samsung-phones-force-mainland-china-dns-service-upon-hong-kong-wifi-users/">Part 1</a>. They are generated every 20 to 60 seconds (depending on settings and link conditions) when the following pre-conditions are satisfied, i.e. WiFi is connected (except with some known devices) with <code>mCurrentMode</code> not equals 0 (elaborated at the bottom of this article), and when screen is on.&nbsp; The queries are sent directly using the WiFi connection link, without going through the VPN / private DNS configured, presumably as they are intended for testing the WiFi network.&nbsp; The IP addresses returned by the queries are not further used, except for checking if they are in a private IP range (in which case the checking is deemed failed).</p></blockquote>
<p>The following is a technical (read: very boring) account of the findings. Jump to the end for hints to disable the DNS query for your home WiFi.</p>
<p>For better illustration of the source, a new Github repository showing the decompiled version of the same <code>wifi-service.jar</code> as in Part I has been created. It uses a different mode of the decompiler (JADX) to attempt to decompile more code to Java, even when there are issues in correctness. The repository is at <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1">SM-N9750-TGY-1</a>.</p>
<h3>The main players</h3>
<p>The main controlling class for the logic is again under <code>com.android.server.wifi.WifiConnectivityMonitor</code>, in the file <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a>.</p>
<p>As briefly mentioned in the last part, this class implements a state machine which represents the status of the WiFi connection being monitored. The states accept messages and respond to them by taking actions and / or transition into another state.</p>
<p>Separately, a subclass, <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>, is responsible for the monitoring of the connectivity and signal strength. The analyzer is an Android <code>Handler</code> which consumes messages in an event loop. These messages can be sent by the parent state machine, from within the analyzer itself, or from other subclasses, to control the activities of the analyzer.</p>
<p>The most relevant messages in our context are defined as follows (unless otherwise specified, the line numbers are those of the <a href="https://github.com/headuck/SM-N9750-TGY-1/blob/main/com/android/server/wifi/WifiConnectivityMonitor.java">WifiConnectivityMonitor.java</a> file in the decompiled code):</p>
<p>Messages sent to the Analyzer to control the lifecycle of the checking loop (lines 115-117, 254):</p>
<pre>    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL = 135221;
    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_START = 135219;
    private static final int ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP = 135220;
     ...
    private static final int NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS = 135223;
</pre>
<p>Messages representing external events sent to the <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> state machine (lines 205-206).</p>
<pre>    private static final int EVENT_SCREEN_OFF = 135177;
    private static final int EVENT_SCREEN_ON = 135176;
</pre>
<h3>Let the query loop start</h3>
<p>When the phone screen is turned on, Android will send the <code>android.intent.action.SCREEN_ON</code> intent to the network receiver of this class (line 1149), which will in turn send <code>EVENT_SCREEN_ON</code> to the <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> state machine. If the state is under <code>EvaluatedState</code> [Note 1], the <code>processMessage()</code> method, around line 2138, handles the message (for brevity, some reference to <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> in the code is omitted):</p>
<pre>    
case EVENT_SCREEN_ON:  //135176 
...
if (mCurrentMode != 0) {
    sendMessage(obtainMessage(135188 /* CMD_RSSI_FETCH */, mRssiFetchToken, 0) ;
    if (isValidState() &amp;&amp; getCurrentState() != mLevel2State) {
        if (mNetworkStatsAnalyzer != null) {
            mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_START); // 135219
        }
        startEleCheck();
    }
    if (mCurrentMode == 1 || mLinkDetectMode == 1) {
        sendMessage(obtainMessage(CMD_TRAFFIC_POLL/*135193*/, mTrafficPollToken, 0);
    }
}
...
</pre>
<p>This means that, when <code>mCurrentMode</code> is non-zero, WiFi is connected, and the connection is not with some known devices, it will send the <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> message to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>. (It will also perform other actions, like calling <code>startEleCheck()</code> to discover devices, but these are not relevant to our context.)</p>
<p>The message <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> is also sent to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code> from a few other places. Here is an extract of the <code>enter()</code> method of the <code>Valid</code> state, triggered when <code>WifiConnectivityMonitor</code> enters <code>Valid</code> state (i.e. upon WiFi connection) (line 3077-).</p>
<pre>if (mCurrentMode != 0) {
    ...
    mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_START);
    mNetworkStatsAnalyzer.sendEmptyMessage(NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS);
}</pre>
<p><code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code> is also sent when <code>mCurrentMode</code> switches from 0 to other values under <code>Valid</code> state (line 3112).&nbsp; Together, it is ensured that all paths arriving at the status, i.e. Wifi is connected, screen is on, and <code>mCurrentMode</code> is non-zero, will trigger <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>.</p>
<p>Note that upon entering the <code>Valid</code> state, <code>NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS</code> is also sent to the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>. Let’s look at what this message does first.</p>
<h3>The NetworkStatsAnalyzer</h3>
<h4>The “loop” structure</h4>
<p>The below shows a skeleton of the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code> handler loop handling the above messages, with bodies of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> and <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP</code> omitted for the moment. (lines 4157-, 4477-, 5107-)</p>
<pre>private class NetworkStatsAnalyzer extends Handler
{
    ...
    private boolean mDnsInterrupted = false;
    private boolean mDnsQueried = false;
    private long mLastDnsCheckTime = 0;
    private boolean mPollingStarted = false;
    private boolean mPublicDnsCheckProcess = false;
    private boolean mSkipRemainingDnsResults = false;
    
    ...
    public void handleMessage(Message string) {
        long now = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();
        final long elapsedRealtime = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime();
        final WifiInfo wifiInfo = WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.syncGetCurrentWifiInfo();
        final int what = string.what;
        switch (what) {
        ...
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_START:
                if (this.mPollingStarted) break;
                if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.isMobileHotspot()) break;
                if (this.isBackhaulDetectionEnabled()) {
                    this.sendEmptyMessage(TCP_BACKHAUL_DETECTION_START); // 135226
                }
                this.sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL);
                WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.initNetworkStatHistory();
                this.mLastRssi = wifiInfo.getRssi();
                this.mPollingStarted = true;
                break;
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL:
                ...
                break;
            case ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP:
                ...
                break;
            case NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS:
                if (!WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.isMobileHotspot()) {
                    checkPublicDns();
                }
                break;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The message <code>NETWORK_STAT_CHECK_DNS</code>, sent upon WiFi connection, will invoke the method <code>checkPublicDns()</code> if the WiFi is not a mobile hotspot. The method is as follows (line 4262-).</p>
<pre>public void checkPublicDns() {
    if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.inChinaNetwork()) {
        mPublicDnsCheckProcess = false;
        return;
    }
    mPublicDnsCheckProcess = true;
    mNsaQcStep = 1;
    WifiConnectivityMonitor wifiConnectivityMonitor = WifiConnectivityMonitor.this;
    String str = wifiConnectivityMonitor.mParam.DEFAULT_URL_STRING;
    DnsThread mDnsThread = new DnsThread(true, str, this, 10000);
    mDnsThread.start();
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mDnsThreadID = mDnsThread.getId();
    if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.DBG) {
        Log.d(TAG, "wait publicDnsThread results [" + WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mDnsThreadID + "]");
    }
}</pre>
<p>We see the problematic <code>inChinaNetwork()</code> method as discussed in Part I being used. It can be seen that the above code handles the “normal” case outside China. Upon WiFi connection, it will start an asynchronous DNS query in a separate thread called <code>DnsThread</code>, using the address in the constant <code>DEFAULT_URL_STRING</code> (hardcoded to “www.google.com” as shown in Part I). This is done once at the start of every WiFi connection. However, if <code>inChinaNetwork()</code> returns true, e.g. in the case of a phone in Hong Kong, it would just set the flag <code>mPublicDnsCheckProcess</code> to false and return, skipping the DNS query for google.</p>
<p>Then we look at <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>. On receipt of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_START</code>, the <code>NetworkStatsAnalyzer</code>, among other actions, sends the <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> message to itself, and sets the flag <code>mPollingStarted</code> to true. This would kick start the checking loop, as to be explained below. Before taking these actions, it would ensure that the loop is not already started by checking <code>mPollingStarted</code>, and that the WiFi connection is not acting as a hotspot.</p>
<p>The main flow controlling logic of the body of <code>ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL</code> polling loop is as follows (line 4509-).</p>
<pre>case ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL:
if (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.SMARTCM_DBG) {
    Log.i(TAG, "mPollingStarted : " + mPollingStarted);    
}
if (!mPollingStarted) {
    break;
}
if ((WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mCurrentBssid != null) &amp;&amp;
    (WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mCurrentBssid != WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mEmptyBssid)) {
    WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mIWCChannel.sendMessage(CMD_IWC_ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL); // 135376
    int rssi2 = wifiInfo.getRssi();
    if (rssi2 &lt; -90) {
        if (!WifiConnectivityMonitor.this.mClientModeImpl.isConnected()) {
            Log.i(TAG, "already disconnected : " + rssi2);
            removeMessages(ACTIVITY_CHECK_POLL);
            sendEmptyMessage(ACTIVITY_CHECK_STOP);
            break;
        }
        if (rssi2 &lt; -95) {
            if (rssi2 == -127) break;
           …</pre></div></div></article></div></div>

And I only managed to hit my work goals for the week by pulling in extra hours on Saturday. </p><p>Exhausted, I was racking my brains on what should I write about.</p><p>In the weekly content brainstorm call with the DelightChat tribe on Friday, there were a few potential topics I talked about - Ask dumb questions, Life is not a zero sum game, Generalist vs Specialist - none of them flowed out of me like it does every week.</p><h2>How I write on my blog</h2><p>You see, every weekend when I sit down to write, the entire writeup just kinda flows in one continuous stream of thoughts. </p><p>A monologue but on paper.</p><p>But more importantly, what allows that to happen is that whatever I write about each weekend is a topic that naturally came up in my life - in my thoughts, readings, conversations with friends, with team members, with my co-founder, my girlfriend, or family members.</p><p>And because I would had lived and gone through the meat of the topic already, writing it down would feel natural and effortless.</p><p>This week when I tried to write on some of the topics mentioned above, I felt stuck. </p><p>Honestly, what I wrote after an hour of applied effort read like gibberish. </p><p>I told Sankalp that I’m not sure I’ll be able to write anything good this weekend, and his reply was - “The weekly content writing is supposed to be therapeutic and fun. It’s not supposed to be something you are forced to do.”</p><p>He was right, the purpose of this whole exercise is to release our thoughts, learnings, ideas from our minds onto paper and then to the whole world. And feel great in the process. I wasn’t feeling great.</p><p>But then my reply to Sankalp was - “I do want to write something. So I'll dedicate 2 hours to it and write the newsletter early morning. Keeping the consistency is important to me.”</p><h2>Consistency</h2><p>A few years ago, I was the sort of person who would have a string of habits, strict (and exhaustive) morning routines, a diary where I was checking off whether I performed my habits each day, you get the picture. </p><p>And if I ever missed a day or two of my habits or routines, my whole routine would break down. </p><p>My habits and routines were not anti-fragile, and I knew that was a problem.</p><p>The game changer for me was over a long conversation one evening, over a few drinks, with my friend Sandesh. He explained to me that I’m being too hard on myself, and that my system has a single point of failure which drags me down every time I hit it. I cannot let missing a day or two of routine breakdown the whole routine.</p><p>“So how do you do it?”, I asked.</p><p>“I’m flexible”, he said.</p><p>Sandesh went on to explain how he discovered this flaw in strict routines and rituals, and therefore came up with weekly goals - do X task Y times this week. </p><p>For example - exercise 4 times this week, no matter which days and at which times. </p><p>It’s alright to miss 3 days in the week, it’s alright if he didn’t go every morning to the gym, he can go in the evening, he can skip that day. As long as he went 4 times a week (or even 3), he was good.</p><h2>Consistency with flexibility</h2><p>There were fireworks in my mind. Introduce flexibility into my rigid and consistent routine? </p><p>Flexibility and consistency are contrasting values, yet it was the simple and obvious solution to my problem.</p><p>Even though earlier I would be fine if I performed a habit 5 out of 7 times in a week, it was my mindset that needed a change.</p><p>Instead of seeing the 2 times I missed as a failure and being down about it, what if I accounted for failure in the routine? What if I embraced failure?</p><p>It was a simple change in mindset - from “perform a habit 5 times a week” to “you are allowed to fail upto 2 times a week”. </p><figure id="w-node-87a844fb7189-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f2639438357e7276aeaeb9e_Monthly%20Habit%20Tracker.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Have room for failure, so that when it does eventually happen, it doesn't set you back.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This is reflected in the <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/habit-tracker-app" target="_blank">habit tracker app</a> that I created, where there’s a column for ‘Goal’, ‘Achieved’ and a final column that says ‘Yay’ or ‘Nay’ if you crossed the goal. If the goal was to meditate 20 times a month, you get 10 chances to fail. </p><p>That eases off so much pressure from the mind and allows for serendipity to take over.</p><p>Consistency and flexibility are contrasting values. Yet combining them increases your chances of success, and helps you foster better mental health.</p><h2>Topics come organically</h2><p>Over a 2 hour conversation that often went too deep into philosophy (we couldn’t help it because it was so much fun) with Siddharth and Rahul who host The Indian Dream podcast, when the topic of keeping ourselves healthy during the times of Covid-19 came up, we talked about flexible consistency. </p><p>We talked about the importance of having a routine, yet being kind enough to ourselves to allow room for failure. These are tough times and nobody was prepared for this in advance.</p><p>I was reminiscing this conversation last night while talking to Mausumi, my girlfriend, thinking that I will skip writing anything this weekend and that it’s okay. </p><p>I went on to explain the concept of <a href="https://nesslabs.com/flexible-consistency" target="_blank">flexible consistency</a> to her, a phrase coined by Anne-Laure in her blog. I borrowed her phrase because it sounds and reads way cooler than how I used to describe it earlier - “Consistency with flexibility”. </p><p>That’s when it struck both of us at the same time.</p><p>I’d found my topic for the week.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we were taught the Set theory at school, I wondered why they dedicated an entire chapter in math to teach us about how to group items into categories. Isn’t it obvious that entities that have similar properties get clubbed together?<br></p><p>More than a decade later I realised that when they teach you something, maybe the entire topic is not as important as that one small nugget of information about this topic that might come in handy down the line.<br></p><p>For me, this nugget of information about Set theory was this.<br></p><figure id="w-node-9bd5380d78e6-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f89ba9979e92b0e781ddd42_LfDXNcBl9XXlc_zSVncWIpmdoJD04pJhaLJimLGvE8O2j9cX6z2wpEYXfmE6XX3JwYbQ0JvFSOU7DOdSMxjhcI219Ksul3dSqhNYRhNfXipgHZAtf_IIXj6HMelTmUbhVbCIiu-7.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Most important aspect of a Set.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Why did this seemingly insignificant fact become the key to my mental sanity? And more importantly how did it help me prevent my codebase from turning into spaghetti? <strong>‍</strong></p><h3><strong>The problem</strong><br></h3><p>I am building a <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">customer support tool</a> where the CS agent can solve customer queries raised from multiple channels of communication. <br></p><p>So by its very design we required a UI element which indicated how many conversations are left unattended for each of the channels.<br></p><figure id="w-node-27c4f9faeadc-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f89bae0425ec7344afac63a_YAjgaMGj963ZtjICveHP_c9Sgiyzrw1YyiN09vNE9ArwLj-jZRSRIIhjSkcS-3dXlERcyErMht4mKnJ-fbxuH1llqLC2NIn31zCsD0Nzheu4RWJ4sOIEykUZjjzQXEVj9_VvsQIL.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Open conversations in every support channel</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>As you may have guessed, this information is being retrieved on every refresh of the browser page and therefore running a count query through the conversation database for each support channel on every refresh is not very efficient. <br></p><p>Sure, it may not be a big deal at first but if we scale to even half of what we plan to hit with this product, a query like this will bite me in the rear sooner than I would want it to.<br></p><h3><strong>The obvious solution</strong><br></h3><p>The solution that occurred to me was to cache the count of open conversations for each support channel. This made sense at first but it quickly turned into a nightmare when I gave it a little more thought.<br></p><p>Okay so I plan to save a count of the open conversations in the cache, which means every time a conversation is opened I increment the count and every time a conversation is closed, I decrement the count? <br></p><p>Alright that doesn’t sound so bad but how do I trigger this increment/decrement operation? I suppose I could do it whenever a conversation gets updated in the database.</p><p><strong>And the problems begin</strong><br></p><p>But wait, I can’t trigger it every single time a conversation is updated, what if a conversation is open but some other data in the conversation gets updated while the status is still open? <br></p><p>Do I have to write an if-else condition to run the increment/decrement operation only when status changes from open to closed or from closed to open? <br></p><p>What happens if a conversation update finished running but the increment/decrement operation failed for some reason or vice versa? How do I re-run an update without corrupting the data?<br></p><p>In case you haven’t guessed where I was heading with this, here is a nice visual aid.<br></p><figure id="w-node-8acd9e28438e-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f89bb0e233bae24f8426a98_4bpq9EhUO8t33FNJqWPsuFDUSKjgAkCndQBpK2Jp7vpODzh6eHAOGqskq5yJvkAE8LOMREF-CxlbpE-pvimw4nHMM-hR5H4s6nbxjxsx-X1mLFRykaGlaJqzQomxlq0IGL9dNF6j.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>This is not how a codebase should look</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The elegant solution</strong><br></h3><p>So how did Set theory get me out of this mess? What if I maintained a Set of IDs that belong to open conversations for each support channel? <br></p><p>All I have to do now is this: On every conversation update, if status is open, I add that conversation ID to the Set and I remove it from the Set if status is closed.<br></p><p>This Set would be stored on the RAM of course and yes it would take up more memory than storing just a single count for every support channel but all we are doing is storing IDs and not the entire data object so it would hardly cost much in terms of memory.<br></p><p>How does this help with the problem? Well, if you want the count of open conversations just get the number of elements in the Set, the cardinal number of the Set if you will. <br></p><p><strong>Why is this elegant? </strong></p><p>Because a Set cannot have duplicates. It does not matter how many times I add an item to a Set, a unique conversation ID can be added to it only once and similarly once a remove operation is performed, subsequent remove operations on the same conversation ID won’t have an affect on the data. The data has become idempotent.<br></p><p>This means that I don’t need an if-else condition when a conversation update operation is performed. All I need to do is perform an add/remove operation based on the status of the conversation post update. <br></p><p>It doesn’t matter if there is an explicit status update or not. Every update can trigger this logic and the data remains incorrupt. If any of the operations fail midway, the conversation update can just be re-run.<br></p><p>The code now looks like this</p><figure id="w-node-2d277519589a-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f89bb36be27e6c99c326654_oWQzIzHYO33Ha-W8vdEpTLGwdR7nKhkY8uILJGhi3ZAblDClNkJunvOEY924v0u7r1ifijiRdBMkLccDknHuDPcqlSCp3N2wcwP1-xCXIW_P4SzsERz1-WtEfa-2r1XA-QhL4vSW.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>This is how a codebase should look</figcaption></figure><h3>‍<br><strong>How to implement a Set data structure in your application</strong><br></h3><p>The most obvious way to do this is to use a JSON dictionary data structure like this for every support channel.</p><figure id="w-node-a0c1c2ac391e-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f89bd048b9f4952f3ada401_s9ykghBfc4x32sr5cNPo-eOKI5lEI__XDz9HLD6WEGjw-EKesvHt8nc1wAV5JWX412TWIvLOMvE4oLB8xXrJMmQrdoAcoIxlozV1fWJpA0tQZU85OnJol_Mweheo2JKrLENl1aBM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A Set data structure using JSON</figcaption></figure><p>If a conversation needs to be added to the Set, update the dictionary with the key as the conversation id and value as true or 1. For remove operations first check if the conversation id is already in the dictionary and remove It from the dictionary. Do nothing if it’s not already present. <br></p><p>This dictionary can now be stored in a variable in memory and used throughout the application. To get the count of open conversations for a support channel, just get the number of keys present in the dictionary.<br></p><h3><strong>Skip the trouble and use Redis instead</strong><br></h3><p>Clearly somebody else figured out the importance of a Set as a data structure way before I did, because <a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank">Redis</a> - an elegant In memory database used for caching data already offers the Set data structure along with operations that let you add, remove and find number of items in a Set. <br></p><p>I would highly recommend using this in your application instead of maintaining a dictionary in a variable because the good folks at Redis already solve a host of other problems that might occur as a result of maintaining an in-memory cache. <br></p><figure id="w-node-6542e37d9ac4-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f89c17824a1dd7eb0b270cd_MLAse7rDGCwNyfvu57U6jsKkIhElVm5CVv2VFGw40wVqTRgeC7ask0Pk54wni7F785D-5h1p-EH_Cn2kO6Dl2EBRPYOsJf586yIAyQDQ5aeJzFXglgG4ws7mLatx90ZyPaGORstQ.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Set data structure in Redis</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong><br></h3><p>Perhaps there is some merit in revisiting some of the concepts we learnt as children and see if they are still relevant and can somehow be applied to the real world.<br></p><p>At the very least this would give us closure and instil hope that maybe everything we were taught that seemed useless at the time has a certain aspect to it that might come in handy at some point or the other in our lives and we just have to keep our eyes, ears and most importantly our minds open.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Amazon provides the ability to create <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html">Billing Alarms</a> that can be used to alert whenever your AWS bill exceeds a certain threshold. However, this approach has a few shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You need to set a predefined threshold. When you are first starting to use AWS, it’s hard to know what your AWS bill will look like. A lot of people set this threshold pretty low to be safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An alert like this tends to be reactive instead of proactive. The alarm gets triggered once the threshold has already crossed. For example, I had forgotten to turn off an EC2 instance I was no longer using but I only found out about a week later once my billing threshold crossed the limit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/">Cost Explorer</a> does provide an easy-to-use interface that can help keep you on top of your billing data. However, this requires one to use the tool regularly to ensure we don’t miss anything.</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at how to build a simple pipeline to send us billing reports over email. The generated report will look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-cost-alerts/billing-email.png" alt="billing-alert-email" title="Billing Alert Email"></p>
<p>The tools we will use are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Lambda</li>
<li>Simple Email Service</li>
<li>Cost Explorer API</li>
</ul>

<p>We will create a new folder called <code>app</code> which will store the application logic for the Cost Explorer API as well as using SES.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>mkdir </span>app

<p>We will also create a file called <code>handler.py</code> in the root directory. This file will contain the logic used to generate billing reports.</p>

<h2 id="cost-explorer-api">Cost Explorer API</h2>
<p>We will be using the <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/ce.html#CostExplorer.Client.get_cost_and_usage">Cost And Usage</a> endpoint from Cost Explorer to get the billing data we need.</p>

<h4 id="advertencia">Advertencia</h4>
<p><strong>El kernel que viene con las distribuciones es suficiente para la mayoría de los casos. Usar un kernel compilado a mano puede dejar el sistema inusable sino se realiza correctamente. No debería usarse en sistemas en producción salvo que se sepa exactamente qué, por qué y para qué se hace. Hay distribuciones que limitan o no proveen el soporte en sistemas Linux con kernels compilados a mano. Siempre es recomendable hacer un backup tanto del directorio /boot como del directorio /lib/modules.</strong></p>
<h4 id="motivacion">Motivación</h4>
<p>Si no has leído la <strong>Advertencia</strong> por favor no sigas. Leela detenidamente y seguimos.
¿Ya está? ¡OK! ¿Por qué compilar un kernel hoy en 2020? Un razón es que al compilar se puede aprender que funcionalidades proporciona el kernel, deshabilitar funciones que <em>sabemos</em> no vamos a usar, probar nuevas características ausentes en la versión del kernel de la distribución y también para entender más cómo trabaja el sistema operativo. Este <em>how-to</em> ha sido probado tanto en Debian 10 como en CentOS 8. En una máquina con 2GB y un único procesador llevaría menos de una hora hacerlo (obviamente cuantos más sean los módulos o componentes agregados más va a tardar). Recordar que se puede compilar como un ususuario común y luego pedir privilegios de root para instalar. 
Basta de palabras y manos a la obra. </p>

<h3 id="1-instalar-los-pre-requisitos">1. Instalar los pre-requisitos</h3>
<pre><span></span><span>yum groupinstall "Development Tools" &amp;&amp; yum install ncurses-devel zlib-devel binutils-devel elfutils-libelf-devel libkcapi-hmaccalc openssl-devel</span>
</pre>


<p>En Debian, deberíamos instalar:</p>
<pre><span></span><span>apt -y install build-essential libncurses-dev</span>
</pre>


<h3 id="2-bajar-las-fuentes-del-kernel">2. Bajar las fuentes del kernel</h3>
<p>Recomendable bajar o la rama <em>Longterm</em> o bien la <em>Stable</em>, por ejemplo:</p>
<pre><span></span><span>curl -L -O https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.8.15.tar.xz</span>
</pre>


<h3 id="3-desempaquetar-las-fuentes">3. Desempaquetar las fuentes</h3>
<pre><span></span><span>tar avxf linux-5.8.15.tar.xz</span>
</pre>


<h3 id="4-entrar-en-el-directorio-de-las-fuentes">4. Entrar en el directorio de las fuentes</h3>
<pre><span></span><span>cd linux-5.8.15</span>
</pre>


<h3 id="5-tomar-como-referencia-el-kernel-que-estamos-usando">5. Tomar como referencia el kernel que estamos usando</h3>
<pre><span></span><span>cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config</span>
</pre>


<h3 id="6-tomar-como-base-los-modulos-del-kernel-que-estan-en-uso-actualmente">6. Tomar como base los módulos del kernel que están en uso actualmente 😉 😉</h3>
<pre><span></span><span>make localmodconfig</span>
</pre>


<p>(Le damos Enter hasta que termine)</p>
<h3 id="7-configuramos-nuestro-kernel-a-medida">7. Configuramos nuestro kernel a medida</h3>
<pre><span></span><span>make menuconfig</span>
</pre>


<p>Esta parte es la más importante. Podemos dejar todo como está pero probablemente haya algo que no estamos usando que no se va a compilar y necesitaremos después. Entonces es importante recorrer algunas secciones para revisar si falta algo, en especial lo que tiene que ver con <strong>Netfilter</strong>, <strong>File Systems</strong>, etc . Por ejemplo: tomar los recaudos suficientes si el sistema está virtualizado o si usa containers.</p>
