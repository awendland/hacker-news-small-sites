                    <p>Much has been covered about developer salaries based on coding language, location, job title, and so on. However, little has been done to chart the rise and fall of developer salaries over the years.</p><p>Tracing developer salaries over the last 20 years was an interesting endeavor. Researching the topic meant changing the language I used to search for data. <br>Back in the early 2000s, tech and software were referred to as “Information Technology” (IT) or “Information and Communications Technology” (ICT), developers were still referred to as “IT workers” and little was mentioned about the many specialized roles we have today.</p><p>To go back in time, I mainly referred to data published by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> as they offered the most comprehensive year on year data. I looked at data from alternate years, from 2001 to 2019.</p><h2 id="starting-in-the-year-2000">Starting in the year 2000</h2><p>At the turn of the century, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2000/07/21/career/q_degreecompsci/">CNN Money</a> reported that the average starting salary for an entry-level computer programmer was $40,800.</p><p>Fresh graduates were also paid differently based on the degrees they held:</p><ul><li>Computer engineering: $49,505</li><li>Computer science: $48,740</li><li>Information science: $38,900</li><li>Management information systems: $41,800</li></ul><p>Due to the shortage of skilled workers going into tech fields, salaries in America for IT graduates became more and more competitive. Salaries in 2000 were already 10% higher than the previous year and, apart from information science majors, were well above the <a href="https://www.naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/salary-trends-through-salary-survey-a-historical-perspective-on-starting-salaries-for-new-college-graduates">national average starting salary</a> of $39,824.</p><figure><img src="https://codesubmit.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/cs-grads-2000-2.png"><figcaption>The "IT Industry" looked different in 2000 than it does today</figcaption></figure><p>The following table shows the average annual salary for developers, programmers, and other IT-related job functions, across all industries in the year 2000:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

That year, while wages did not fall despite the dot-com burst, around 400,000 Americans working in IT-related roles lost their jobs going into 2001.</p><p>2008 was when the stock market crashed. Similar to the dot-com burst in 2001, wages in 2008 remained relatively unchanged. However, roughly 111,000 Americans working in IT-related fields lost their jobs going into 2009. </p><p>2008 was also the year when wages began to increase at a slower rate compared to previous years. While individuals enjoyed an average of $5,000 increase every two years previously, after 2008, wages only increased by $2,000 every two years. </p><p>Generally speaking, from 2001 to 2011, individuals working in tech had at least a 21% increase in wages over time. Systems Software Engineers experienced the largest jump in wages, an increase of 35%.</p><p><strong>Average salary increase from 2001-2011:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-to-expect-in-the-future">What to expect in the future</h2><p>In the years to come, industry experts expect <a href="https://medium.com/predict/are-programmers-headed-toward-another-bursting-bubble-528e30c59a0e">low-level coding and programming jobs to become obsolete</a> with the development of new tools that remove the need to code completely. Take for example the role of Web Developers when it comes to building websites. With popular CMS tools like WordPress and Squarespace, almost anyone can build a website for their business, reducing the need for people who know “just a little bit of front end web development”. </p><p>As automation takes away the need for “basic” coding jobs, new skills or a combination of skills will be needed in the future for roles that don’t even exist yet. The need for field experts and true problem solvers will never disappear. The key is to adapt and learn as new technologies emerge. </p><p><strong>Additional sources:</strong><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/digital/ieconomy/1939833.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2000</a><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/37620123.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2004</a><br><a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/it_outlook-2010-sum-en.pdf?expires=1612698150&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=7DC9765AA37510F78D7BBDA7FF42254D">OECD Information Technology Outlook Summary 2010</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iGfVr1j-VStKVwSWvVvSo3qbwwHTL_V9tPttpeBTmK4/edit?usp=sharing">BLS data in Google Sheets</a></p>

        <p>With the emergence of Bitcoin and recently proposed stablecoins from BigTechs, such as Diem (formerly Libra), central banks face growing competition from private actors offering their own digital alternative to physical cash. We do not address the normative question whether a central bank should issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not. Instead, we contribute to the current research debate by showing how a central bank could do so, if desired. We propose a token-based system without distributed ledger technology and show how earlier-deployed, software-only electronic cash can be improved upon to preserve transaction privacy, meet regulatory requirements in a compelling way, and offer a level of quantum-resistant protection against systemic privacy risk. Neither monetary policy nor financial stability would be materially affected because a CBDC with this design would replicate physical cash rather than bank deposits.</p>

<p><i>To celebrate this announcement, we will be around at this years <a href="https://www.embedded-world.de/en/exhibitor-list">embedded world digital</a>. You can watch our pitch talk on Wednesday, March 3rd, from 11:10am - 11:20am UTC.
We're available for 1:1 meetings all week.<p>

You can book those through the embedded world web application by searching for "Rust" or "Critical Section" in the exhibitors list.</p></i>
</p>



<p>Ferrocene is an effort led by Ferrous Systems and its newly formed subsidiary Critical Section GmbH to qualify the Rust Language and Compiler for use in the safety-critical domain. This is the third post in a series detailing our plans and actions around this effort, addressing topics discussed in <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/sealed-rust-the-pitch/">The Pitch</a> and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/sealed-rust-the-plan/">The Plan</a>. Ferrocene's draft name was "Sealed Rust."</p>

<p>Our goal is to <strong>improve the status-quo of software quality and correctness in safety-critical domains</strong> by enabling the use of the Rust Programming Language for safety-critical software development. We believe that Rust is a significant improvement over existing tools both from a safety and quality perspective and as an improvement for developer productivity.</p>

<p>You can follow the progress on these efforts on the <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/">Ferrous Systems' Blog</a>, by <a href="https://eepurl.com/guoC6P">subscribing to our newsletter</a>, or by <a href="mailto:ferrocene@critical-section.com">contacting us directly</a>.
Ferrocene is currently looking for partner commitments! Please get in <a href="mailto:contact@critical-section.com">touch via email</a> if interested.</p>

<p>Since our last post in February 2020, we have moved Ferrocene from an idea to an actual project. We strengthened our contacts with interested companies and went deeper into our industrial and language research.</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-route-user-research">Finding a route: User Research</h2>

<p>Over the last 1.5 years, we have conducted several interviews with parties deploying software in safety-critical or mission-critical environments. The participants were diverse, from cloud providers to vehicle manufacturers. We found broad interest in adopting Rust in those industries.</p>

<p>There were several key takeaways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rust as a language is seen as the big contender in critical spaces. Particularly, its focus on rigor and stability is seen as a major competitive advantage.</li>
  <li>At the same time, language evolution and improvement speed is also a crucial factor of interest.</li>
  <li>There is a desire for improvement over current language specification practices.</li>
  <li>Rust only having one main compiler at the moment is seen as a strength at the current phase of the language.</li>
  <li>Interviewed organisations see the language on a good trajectory towards their needs.</li>
</ol>

<p>On further investigation, we found a lot of openness and desire for modern, tool-assisted specification and verification techniques. Rust was regarded as being on a good path and quoted as being a language that was already easier to analyze and inspect than other languages. For that reason, we researched existing practices.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, we overwhelmingly found that the projects and tools already providing analysis and further safety guarantees operate on <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">MIR</a>, Rust's mid-level intermediate representation, and other IR rather than the Rust source language. They utilized MIR to carry program meaning in a simplified manner, enabling easier analysis and reasoning. As such, a desire expressed was visibility into changes to MIR and versioned stability.</p>

<p>When further interviewed on stability, organizations expressed a desire to adopt a technology that continually increases safety and assurance levels. Most organizations considered stability a consequence of structured, deliberate changes between documented milestones one can predictably target. We summed this up as "addressability". This framing resonated in interviewed organizations.</p>

<p>There was a high respect for Rust's software practices both inside and outside of the main project. It was mentioned as a strong point that many traditionally research-related tasks are conducted within the project.</p>

<p>In conclusion, there was a shared desire to produce safer, higher-quality software <strong>faster</strong> and a sense that <strong>fundamental changes are necessary</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="finding-an-orientation-why-ferrocene">Finding an orientation: why Ferrocene?</h2>

<p>A key question from these discussions with industry-leaders: what is Ferrocene, the product, and how does it relate to Rust? There was strong interest from potential clients that work that <em>can be</em> upstreamed into the Rust compiler <em>should be</em> wherever possible. We believe this points to a focus shift in the industry. Companies understand the value of FOSS as a neutral commons but also want to invest through initiatives that work towards their goals.</p>

<p>There are services required for mission and safety-critical industries that go beyond shipping a compiler. This includes (very) long-term support, qualification packages, industry-specific tooling, backends and targets, training, verification help and industry-specific advice. This is Ferrocene, the product.</p>

<p>During our conversations with industry leaders, we found that there's a need for Ferrocene as a wider initiative. Increasing the trust level of the Rust compiler will benefit many industries, and focusing only on typical safety-critical environments is one part of the picture. Improvements in the trust level of the core technology benefit <em>all</em> participants in the ecosystem. For example, we see efforts in better describing the semantics of Rust as it exists today as an important baseline for guiding the evolution of the language.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is both. It is a product to serve markets that need high assurances and committments. It is an initiative to take Rust to the next level of reliabilty and trust. Out of that comes a strong desire for collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="having-a-direction-first-waypoints">Having a direction: First Waypoints</h2>

<p>We intend to publish a solidified roadmap for Ferrocene by June 2021.</p>

<p>A major early milestone for Ferrocene is achievable criticality levels. Currently, we're aiming at ISO 26262/ASIL-B qualification readiness and general availability by the end of 2022. Along the way, we will work closely with early adopters to increase the toolchain's quality and gather feedback and experiences.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is a vehicle for a versioned Rust and MIR specification, paired with automated verification of Rust semantics. These "runnable specs" give developers in mission-critical and high-security environments a sound, proven, and addressable foundation for building critical libraries, analysis tools, and further system assurances.</p>

<p>Critical Section is also committed to improving the developer experience in mission and safety-critical industries. Ferrocene includes efforts to bring existing verification tools, like MIRI, to a production-ready state, while also improving the ease and advanced capabilities of formally verifying Rust programs.</p>

<h2 id="finding-partners-the-travel-group">Finding Partners: The travel group</h2>

<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us, but also a lot of experiences to tap into.</p>

<p>Ferrous Systems and Critical Section are calling for additional partners to join that effort! We're interested in partners from many industries, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Safety-critical sectors, such as automotive, railway and aerospace</li>
  <li>Operators of mission-critical infrastructure with high-reliability and security concerns, such as cloud vendors</li>
  <li>Hardware vendors</li>
  <li>Compiler vendors</li>
  <li>Organisations that require structured knowledge of their base systems</li>
  <li>Is interested in building strong, deep Rust knowledge now</li>
</ul>

<p>Partners also get early access to Ferrocene releases and can follow the development closely with engineer support.</p>

<p>If that describes your organisation, <a href="mailto:contact@critical-section.com">we're happy to be in touch</a>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-engine">Starting the engine</h2>

<p>In August 2020, Ferrous Systems GmbH created a wholly-owned subsidiary called Critical Section GmbH. Critical Section started work on Ferrocene in September 2020, setting up roadmaps, finalizing user research, and outreach to partners. Ferrocene is currently managed by Florian Gilcher and Sabree Blackmon.</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>We would like to thank Tim Reed and Jack Greenbaum from Green Hills Software for their constant advice, guidance and collaborative experimentation along the way.</p>

<p>YOUR ORDER HISTORY. Your credit card information. Even your intimate health data.</p>



<p>Amazon is amassing an empire of data as the online retailer ventures into ever more areas of our lives. But the company's efforts to protect the information it collects are inadequate, according to insiders who warn the company's security shortfalls expose users' information to potential breaches, theft and exploitation.</p>



<p>The warnings about privacy and compliance failures at Amazon come from three former high-level information security employees — one EU-based and two from the U.S. — who told POLITICO they had repeatedly tried to alert senior leadership in the company's Seattle HQ, only to be sidelined, dismissed or pushed out of the company in what they saw as professional retaliation. </p>



<p>The EU-based employee is fighting the terms of their departure from Amazon through European courts. All three spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern they could face retaliation or difficulties in the job market for discussing the details of non-public legal proceedings. </p>



<p>Put together, their accounts paint a picture of a corporate culture at Amazon that they say prioritizes growth over other factors, such as the security of customers' information, compliance with rules designed to safeguard that data and the careers of employees the company hired specifically to flag problems.</p>



<p>“Imagine if a company the size of Amazon had a breach? The issue is millions of people's personal identifiable information is at risk,” the first former U.S.-based information-security employee said.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Amazon said that maintaining customers' trust by protecting their privacy and ensuring the security of their data is a "long-standing top priority" for the company. </p>



<p>"These inaccurate, unsubstantiated and dated claims don’t reflect our commitment to keeping personal information safe. Amazon has comprehensive, long-established privacy and security policies, procedures and technologies in place. We regularly audit our services to ensure compliance and have zero tolerance for employees at all levels who do not follow our policies," he said. </p>



<p>At a time when lawmakers and government officials are ramping up scrutiny of tech companies on both sides of the Atlantic, the employees' complaints are likely to strike a chord with regulators.</p>



<p>While Amazon has faced plenty of heat over its labor practices — including alleged efforts to suppress union activity at its warehouses — its handling of data has received less attention.</p>



<p>Yet the company is one of Big Tech's most powerful players when it comes to data, thanks to the hoards of customer information it collects via its e-commerce platform, its online advertising business and its gigantic cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services. </p>



<p>Garfield Benjamin, a British academic <a href="https://inforrm.org/2020/01/29/amazon-echos-privacy-issues-go-way-beyond-voice-recordings-garfield-benjamin/" target="_blank">who has previously written about Amazon’s privacy lapses</a>, said that the company's "disregard for privacy and security" was indicative of a "big problem."</p>

<p>“It seems bizarre — although perhaps unfortunately all too common — that a company so intent on making data its primary business should have such poor practices,” Benjamin said when shown POLITICO’s findings. He added, "Is their hubris so great, their assumed power so unassailable, that they see themselves as completely untouchable?” </p>



<p>The consequence for consumers is more than potential loss of trust in Amazon's privacy and security practices. The company's practices leave it vulnerable<strong> </strong>to potential breaches or hacks that could put highly sensitive information into the hands of malicious actors. </p>



<p>The data Amazon holds includes order history, payment information, data collected through its advertising business and, for sellers on its platform, forms of identification. In the wrong hands, it could be held for ransom against the threat of online publication; deployed to defraud people; used to get access to other online accounts; or leveraged in phishing attacks in which stolen data is used to trick victims into paying a fee or revealing even more sensitive information.  </p>



<p>More broadly, the accounts raise questions about what corporate values are rewarded at a company that has risen quickly to become the world's dominant e-commerce player.</p>



<h3>Data labyrinth</h3>



<p>ACCORDING TO THE TWO U.S. information-security employees, data is at risk because Amazon has a poor grasp of what data it has, where it is stored and who has access to it. </p>



<p>“If you wanted to do a 'right to be forgotten,' it would be next to impossible for Amazon to identify all of the places where your data resides within their system,” said the first former U.S.-based employee. The right to be forgotten, or right to have data erased, is a key tool for citizens under several privacy regimes, including in Europe and California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second U.S.-based information-security professional confirmed Amazon's shaky understanding of what reams of personal information it holds. “Amazon has grown so fast, it doesn't know what it owns … &nbsp;They don't know where their data is at, so they don’t know if they are protecting it correctly,” the person said.</p>



<p>The company’s track record on key data-security principles — controlling who has access to what data, patching vulnerabilities, ability to detect hacks, even whether passwords are changed regularly — came in for particular flak<strong> </strong>from all of the insiders who, together, have decades of experience in the area of information security.</p>



<p>“The quality of the controls that Amazon has in place is appalling. We found hundreds of thousands of accounts where the employee is no longer there but they still have system access,” said the first former U.S.-based employee, adding that such a vast number was possible because of Amazon's massive workforce and rapid staff turnover.<strong> </strong>Amazon said it has strict procedures in place when employees leave the company that remove their access.</p>



<p>Amazon has struggled to patch vulnerabilities in its systems. According to internal security reports from 2016 and 2017 seen by one of the former employees,<strong> </strong>the company declared that it was managing to patch between 55 to 70 percent of its systems. The first former U.S.-based employee likened that to leaving a house with several windows and doors open. </p>



<p>“Amazon’s information technology general controls, considering my experience and where I've been in the past, would not have passed muster with most auditors,” the first former U.S.-based employee said. "They were just poorly managed."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weak controls mean the company may not even detect a hack. An internal Amazon memo seen by one of the former employees from June 2018 deemed there was a “very high” possibility of critical financial loss or reputational damage to the business because of the company’s “inability to identify adversarial events.”</p>

<p>Amazon said it was not aware of the reports and does not believe the claims to be accurate. It said that any historic concerns that are flagged through routine internal reporting would be fixed, which is the purpose of these processes.</p>



<p>The second former U.S.-based employee confirmed that Amazon fails to properly control access to systems, and that, in a company whose workforce has grown to more than 1 million, reams of personal information are accessible to people who do not have the appropriate role or responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You've got tens of thousands of … teams connecting to big data," said the second former U.S.-based employee. "You should have a way to follow all the different types of data. From a technology point of view, you need to know where the data is going and how it's being protected. That does not exist,” they said.</p>



<p>The former employees were careful to distinguish between issues around Amazon’s internal approach to data compliance and the company’s leading track record in data-security engineering — visible through the products and services developed by AWS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS’s cloud computing products are used by the likes of the U.S. government, and are widely seen as world-beating in terms of data security. One ex-employee described the security tools at Amazon’s disposal as “second to none,” but they said the strength of AWS tools in keeping systems secure is still dependent on how the end user applies them. They also noted that AWS is largely run separately from the rest of the company.  </p>



<p>The issue, they said, is that Amazon's data-security capabilities are undermined by the willingness of the company to override internal controls.</p>



<p>For instance, according to two of the former information-security professionals, data needed for new projects was sometimes improperly classified so that it would go through fewer internal checks. </p>



<p>The company said this is false. A spokesperson said it has comprehensive privacy and security policies, procedures and technologies in place that are observed by executives at all levels. The company regularly audits services to ensure compliance and employees may not be involved in decision-making outside of their role’s remit.</p>



<h3>'Woefully behind'</h3>



<p>EUROPE'S DATA-PROTECTION RULEBOOK, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is credited by many for putting privacy on the agenda — especially within company boardrooms, where the fines of 4 percent of global turnover introduced by the legislation are often perceived as an existential threat.</p>



<p>Even so, it was only in late April 2018 — weeks before the regulation came into force — that Amazon created a dedicated team in the information-security department to address the incoming regulation. “The organization was woefully behind,” said the first former U.S.-based employee. Amazon said it had long-standing privacy and security teams and made a standard organizational change to centralize privacy resources in 2018.</p>

<p>Around 6 minutes (1250 words). Published 2021-02-24.</p>


<p>Postgres (or PostgreSQL, if you like) is an amazingly powerful database engine. I’ve recently been working hard on <a href="https://couchers.org/">Couchers.org</a>, and as part of that, I’ve come to really dig into Postgres and understand the incredible value of it. For our use case in an open-source project built by a handful of passionate volunteers, it’s very useful when we don’t need to pull in additional dependencies and complicate the architecture. To this end, we’ve found Postgres to be a really great fit: it just has so much functionality packed right into a stable and well supported package.</p>
<p>As part of implementing text search for Couchers, I’ve spent some time learning about the different ways of going about this using Postgres, so I jotted down some of the basic ideas.</p>
<p>Postgres has two types of text search: full text search, and trigram-based “fuzzy” search. What makes text special is the many idiosyncrasies of our natural language. In most SQL databases, you like to do very straightforward relational queries, <code>SELECT user_id, display_name WHERE username = 'aapeli'</code>, but text is not so easy. There’s a variety of differences that make the problem qutie tricky. Firstly, a word does not always come in the same form, for example <code>Examples!</code> has roughly the same semantic meaning as <code>example</code> (we also have synonyms, but these are much harder). Also, we’re all humans and we make mistakes, so often you will see spelling errors, and it’s nice to have a search engine that can be somewhat resilient to it. One can get away for very basic needs with <code>LIKE</code> and <code>ILIKE</code>, as we did, but it quickly starts limiting the usefulness of search when users really want to find topics of interest. (Note that the trigram module is able to speed up these queries as well through its index.)</p>
<p>This is not a full overview of the power of these tools, rather, it’s a quick teaser and introdution to how they work! I encourage you to go read the full Postgres docs if you find this fascinating, most of the content here is from reading those pages, playing around with these, and implementing a search for Couchers.</p>
<h2 id="full-text-search">Full text search</h2>
<p>Postgres full text search works by trying to <em>normalize</em> words, then match them up exactly. That is, it tires to get around the mesiness of the language by trying to understand it and turn all words with the same semantic meaning into one symbol. These symbols are called <em>lexemes</em> in Postgres. (Each original word may result in multiple lexemes at the end.)</p>
<p>Here’s an example using the default configuration:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.');
      to_tsvector
------------------------
 'exampl':4 'sentenc':5
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Stop words (short words that aren’t useful for search, e.g. ‘this’, ‘is’, ‘an’) are eliminated, punctuation is discarded, and the rest of the words are <em>stemmed</em>, so ‘example’ maps to the lexeme ‘exampl’, and so on. Notice that each lexeme is accompanied with positional information.</p>
<p>This allows indexing large document and matching up words exactly. To query now against this representation, we convert a query string into a <code>tsquery</code>:</p>
<pre><code># select websearch_to_tsquery('examples of sentences');
 websearch_to_tsquery
----------------------
 'exampl' &amp; 'sentenc'
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>That is, we’re looking for <em>documents</em> whose normalized forms contain both <code>exampl</code> and <code>sentenc</code> (the <code>&amp;</code> signifies logical “and”). Indeed, we get a match:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.') @@ websearch_to_tsquery('examples of sentences');
 ?column?
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Note that full text search is very language dependent due to the use of language-specific dictionaries. There are a variety of dictionaries available, and Postgres is additionally able to use different standard formats of dictionaries.</p>
<p>In Couchers, we’re currently using English. It’s not therefore good for words that aren’t “Englishy” and not in the dictionary, for example local place names. This causes some headaches for us.</p>
<p>There is a lot more Postgres full text search can do, including weighting different parts of a document (e.g. title, address, content) differently, ranking results with a variety of algorithms, and automatically creating snippets highlighting the matched portions of text. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html">Read more about these on the Postgres docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-details-in-couchers">Implementation details in Couchers</h3>
<p>We use the Postgres A/B/C/D classes for ranking, where each different searchable type has different sets of A/B/C/D. A is normally the title of the entity, e.g. the name of the community, the name of the user (or their username), page title, etc. B is normally the address or the user’s typed in city. C is any other primary text that’s more important than just the content, and D is all other text, main content, and so forth.</p>
<p>We use <code>websearch_to_tsquery</code> to turn an input into a <code>tsquery</code>. It’s safe to use with user-supplied input, and it has the usual web searchy operators:</p>
<ul>
<li>unquoted text requires each word to be in the search</li>
<li>quoted text requries each word to appear consequtively in the text</li>
<li>supports <code>or</code> and <code>-</code> (for negation)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trigram-search-fuzzy-search">Trigram search (fuzzy search)</h2>
<p>Trigram search works by breaking up words into consequtive triplets of characters, then looking these up in an index (though indexing is of course optional). With the right indexes, this scales to insane size and can be even used to implement indexed regular expressions over huge sets of text. Postgres supports this straight out of the box!</p>
<p>The basic search however, just basically needs to count overlapping trigrams.</p>
<p>To get started you need to install the <code>pg_trgm</code> extension which comes pre-packaged with Postgres:</p>
<pre><code># CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE EXTENSION
</code></pre><p>You can then get matching! Here’s an example sentence turned decomposed trigrams:</p>
<pre><code># select show_trgm('This is an example sentence.');
                                                                 show_trgm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"  a","  e","  i","  s","  t"," an"," ex"," is"," se"," th",amp,"an ","ce ",enc,ent,exa,his,"is ","le ",mpl,nce,nte,ple,sen,ten,thi,xam}
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>A search query with a spelling error:</p>
<pre><code># select show_trgm('example sentnences');
                                         show_trgm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"  e","  s"," ex"," se",apl,ces,enc,ent,"es ",exm,"le ",map,nce,nen,ntn,ple,sen,tne,xma}
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Now we can match against it:</p>
<pre><code># select word_similarity('example sentnences', 'This is an example sentence.');
 word_similarity
-----------------
       0.6666667
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Note that full text search would not match due to the spelling mistake:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.') @@ websearch_to_tsquery('example sentnences');
 ?column?
----------
 f
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Good on placenames:</p>
<pre><code># select word_similarity('joens', 'Joensuu, Finland');
 word_similarity
-----------------
       0.8333333
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Trigram search is much better for “fuzzy” matching, but it doesn’t understand text semantics at all, so it’s not ideal for proper full text search or when trying to locate topics in text, and it’s a bit trickier to rank large documents. It can also be a bit tricky to get the indexes right: if a search query results in no trigrams, Postgres falls back to a full table scan… ouch!</p>
<p>However, it should be very good for searching short titles/addresses, and we in Couchers use it against the “A” class from above. Meaning basically that we do this kind of trigram matching against usernames, city names, users’ display names, and so on. Things that don’t generally have a lot of “semantic meaning” and where people easily make typos! <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html">Read more about <code>pg_trgm</code> on the Postgres docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-details-in-couchers-1">Implementation details in Couchers</h3>
<p>We use <code>unaccent</code> first on the query and text to be queried to remove accents and normalize text before trigram matching (which discards non-alphanumeric characters). We match against the A list only. We weight trigram similarity a bit higher than the text search results.</p>

        <p><a href="https://architectelevator.com/strategy/complex-topics-stick/">Part 1 of this mini-series</a> described how a good presentation should combine actual experience, mental models, and a punch line, realizing that this model closely maps to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion" target="_blank">Aristotle’s Modes of Persuasion</a> from some 2300 years ago:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ethos: Credibility or authority of the presenter (literally meaning “character”)</li>
  <li>Logos: Reasoning and logical appeal</li>
  <li>Pathos: An appeal to the audience’s emotions (“empathy” is a related term that helps memorizing this one)</li>
</ul>

<p>Experience adds to ethos because it gives you credibility, mental models use logos to show the audience how pieces relate to each other (one could say, this is “architecture”), and a memorable punch line can stir emotions, such as surprise or humor. Having been around some 2300 years, Aristotle’s model is widely cited and shared, including in my own book.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-alone-dont-make-a-cake">Ingredients Alone Don’t Make a Cake</h2>

<p>To make these elements fruitful in a presentation, they need to be strung together into a flow. Here we encounter the limitations of a simple model like this one that’s included in <a href="https://architectelevator.com/book">The Software Architect Elevator</a> in the chapter about Showing Pirate Ships (to figure that one out, you’ll have to go and read <a href="https://architectelevator.com/book">the book</a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/presenting_modes_persuasion.png" alt="Modes of persuasion"></p>

<p>This picture is a prototypical model (by now you surely know that I like models): it breaks down a complex topic into its components, abstracting away noise and highlighting the important aspects. One could even say it’s the architecture of a good speech—at least it passes the test of having lines.</p>

<p>However, the model is missing some important aspects. It’s like a recipe that shows us the ingredients but it doesn’t tell much how much of each ingredient we need and how we put them together. It’ll be rather difficult to bake a tasty cake based on a list of ingredients alone (insert my pet peeve about “my architecture is <em>product X</em> and <em>product Y</em>” right here).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Upping ethos and pathos from the typical 2% (allocating 96% to logos) to about 20% makes a world of difference for technical presentations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s start with the percentage of ingredients (I’ll leave the putting together for <em>Part 3</em>). The typical technical presentation tends to consist of 96% logos, leaving perhaps 2% each for ethos and pathos, leaving a lot of improvement to balance things out. Shifting things to perhaps 60% logos and 20% ethos and pathos each will make a world of difference. After all, we are still talking about complex technical topics, but we shouldn’t make it a purely technical talk.</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/complex_topics_2_balance.png" alt="Balancing out a technical talk" title="Balancing out a technical talk"></p>

<p>At the same time, technical presentations needn’t be 1/3 each or flip completely the other way, like many Ted talks do. You might be making your IT great again but your audience is likely to want to hear some logos on how exactly that’s going to work.</p>

<h2 id="going-to-extremes">Going to Extremes</h2>

<p>Injecting more logos and pathos into technical presentations has been one of my favorite exercises in my <a href="https://architectelevator.com/workshops">live workshops</a> (I don’t offer them at the moment). To highlight the power of ethos, logos, and pathos, I presented the same argument in three short speeches that turn each dial to “10”, respectively.</p>

<p>Let’s assume your job is to convince people that moving faster is the essential element of your organization’s digital transformation (I do like very realistic examples). Here are three ways to go about this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>The digital world charts new territory with new business models and new ways of interacting with customers. Such novel techniques have to be tested via experiments. Now, it doesn’t do much good if each experiment takes 18 months, therefore moving fast is the most essential property for organizations that are successful in economies of speed.</em>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>We often debate how we can better compete with so-called digital disruptors. Well, after spending over a decade working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, I point to one fundamental advantage those companies have: they are simply moving faster.</em>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>Our company just posted another record quarter. So did Kodak, a few quarters before they went bankrupt. They were simply not moving fast enough. But we don’t have to make the same mistake.</em>”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As you likely guessed correctly, the first snippet is 90% logos (“from A follows B follows C”), the second one 90% ethos (“I was there and am here to tell you”), and version three is pure pathos (“hey, we’re doing great! No, actually we’re doomed. But there’s hope…”).</p>

<p>Going to extremes (bonus points for anyone who was thinking of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QorpDX-GgY" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope</a> by Paul van Dyk with vocals by Jan Johnston) demonstrates that the three elements aren’t just minor variations, but result in completely different speeches. That’s the magic of ethos, logos, and pathos. Digital transformations are the perfect place for such mixes as they are at the intersection of technology and organizational changes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ethos, logos, and pathos aren’t just minor variations but result in completely different speeches.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="amplifying-ethos-and-pathos">Amplifying Ethos and Pathos</h2>

<p>After understanding the potential of ethos and pathos, it’s useful to know some handy techniques to increase their share in your presentations. It’s like putting more butter and sugar into your cake or your cookies: they can only get better!</p>

<p>The big difference between ethos and pathos is that ethos about you, whereas pathos is mostly about the audience. Let’s start close to home:</p>

<h3 id="more-ethos">More Ethos</h3>

<p>A little ethos goes a long way. It helps overcome the initial hurdle that any presentation must take: convince the audience that listening to you is more valuable than checking email or browsing the web.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ethos helps overcome the initial hurdle that any presentation must take: convince the audience that listening to you is more valuable than checking email or browsing the web.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experience</strong>: We saw already in part 1 that experience builds ethos. Sharing your experience from a concrete project leaves a stronger impression than an abstract framework.</li>
  <li><strong>Affiliation</strong>: Related, your affiliation (along with titles or degrees) can also impact your ethos. Before you add “ex-Google, ex-ThoughtWorks” to your LinkedIn tag line, remember that this can go both ways–you wouldn’t write “failed at most  big tech companies” either, so it’s all about the dosage (yes, Mr./Mrs. “PMP, PRINCE, CCP, MCTS, MIA”, I am looking at you).</li>
  <li><strong>References</strong>: The experience doesn’t always have to be yours–you can also cite external, credible sources. If <a href="https://martinfowler.com/aboutMe.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a> / Gartner / Jeff Bezos said it, it must be (mostly) true!</li>
  <li><strong>Appearance</strong>: We shouldn’t base technical credibility on appearance alone but your audience is pre-programmed to form judgment base on your looks and outfit. If you don’t like it, you might need to have a work with the ultimate chief architect, or just accept it. For example, who would want to question <a href="https://handbookofsoftwarearchitecture.com/about/" target="_blank">Grady Booch’s credibility about architecture</a>?</li>
  <li><strong>Speech Patterns</strong>: Some have observed my annoyance with the fact that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/naturally-selected/201306/the-sound-leader-ceos-deep-voices-do-better" target="_blank">deep voices make speakers more credible</a>. Not only does it amplify gender bias, but I also end up listening to deep, slow voices far too often. But before you get the vocoder out, there are more subtle ways to boost a bit of ethos. For example, slowing down your pace, pausing, or varying your vocal patterns can also make you appear more authoritative.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="more-pathos">More Pathos</h3>

<p>Pathos is about your audience: many speakers are very excited about their topic but the audience isn’t. That’s not pathos, but pathetic. First, I tend to remind technical speakers of the breadth of emotions that we can feel, in case one or two became forgotten while typing code into a text editor all day. A nice way to illustrate emotions is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plutchik" target="_blank">Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/plutchik-wheel.svg" alt="Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions"></p>

<p>In my little speech above I used at least four emotions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I began with <em>pride</em> and <em>optimism</em></li>
  <li>Next, I gave the audience a <em>surprise</em></li>
  <li>Then I triggered <em>fear</em></li>
  <li>I conclude with <em>hope</em> and <em>anticipation</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Not all pathos relies on strong, one-dimensional emotions like these. There are many simple techniques to “liven up” technical presentations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stories and Anecdotes</strong>: stories used to be the way knowledge was passed for millennia, so humans are well attuned to listening to stories. Watch people cry when watching a move - that’s the power of pathos. Again, success lies in the balance - some people feel that they need to package their technical content into a long heart-wrenching story. That’ll surely miss many people’s (surely mine!) marks. So think about short anecdotes more than long-winded stories. You don’t want your core messages gone with the wind…</li>
  <li><strong>Analogies and Metaphors</strong>: Analogies allow you to relate your mental models (logos!) to something the audience is already familiar with and often has positive associations with (pathos!). One of my favorite examples is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqEeIG8aPPk" target="_blank">short speech by the late Russ Ackoff</a> on continual improvement. Almost each statement he makes about complex systems is related back to the automobile (<a href="https://youtu.be/OqEeIG8aPPk?t=252">4:12</a>) or the human body (<a href="https://youtu.be/OqEeIG8aPPk?t=274" target="_blank">4:34</a>)  - notice the audience’s emotion as they are listening to an academic talk about complex systems theory.</li>
  <li><strong>Concrete Figures</strong>: Even little things like replacing words like “big”, “sizable”, or “many” with concrete figures can make a presentation more relatable. So, next time you talk about scalability, reference the customer who had “thousands” of microservices and had to manage “several hundred” custom VMs.</li>
  <li><strong>Punch Lines</strong>: We saw in Part 1 that short, memorable punchlines or slogans can also stir emotions, and such boost pathos. “Don’t run software you didn’t build” is more pathos than “a modern enterprise prefers a SaaS model of cloud computing for COTS applications”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-right-kind-of-pathos">The Right Kind of Pathos</h3>

<p>Not all emotions are positive, though. Remember Plutchik’s wheel: there you’ll find contempt, loathing, rage, and sadness. That’s not the kind of pathos you’re going to want to inject into your audience. Therefore, here a (likely incomplete) list of techniques that avoid some of the biggest emotional pitfalls in technical presentations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Arrogance</strong>: Most people listen to you because you can tell them that they don’t …</li></ul></section></div></div>

<p>I mainly wrote this blog post to help advertise Shopify as a great place to intern at, but I'm sure all of these aspects can be found at other great companies, though maybe not all at one company/team. I recommend this blog post not only for those looking to apply to Shopify, but to know how great internships can be and what qualities you would want from an internship. </p>
<p>I'm currently writing this in my last week at Shopify as I have decided to go elsewhere full-time, though I still love Shopify enough that I chose to intern there over joining a YCombinator cohort! It is a very special place to be, which is also why I returned three times (started interning at Shopify in Summer 2018). </p>
<h2 id="flexibility">flexibility<a href="#flexibility" aria-label="Anchor link for: flexibility"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This is an underlying factor in a lot of other things I'll talk about, but I like that Shopify doesn't often have "rules" for anything. Shopify let me do two (two month) internships to accommodate for my two-month summers. They also let me work part-time after I graduated! Most importantly, they don't require interns to be enrolled in a bachelor's degree program bringing epic diversity to intern classes from people with degrees in other fields or former chefs. I got the same epic flexibility at Hatch Canada, working part-time and being allowed to work on projects of my choosing.</p>

</h2>
<p>I'd say I'm three times better of a programmer than I was when I started at Shopify. It happen partially through the classic "learning on the job". By building applications and getting code reviews from coworkers I became a better programmer. However, I think the key that made learning on the job effective was being able to ask a shitload of questions. Shopify was good at building an environment where I felt I could do that without feeling like I was asking bad questions or bothering anyone. This let me spend less time confused, make better decisions, learn about things I could apply in the future (or just sate curiosity).</p>
<p>Another great thing is that I had the room to dedicate time to learning. That included working through a book, reading papers or attending conferences. Shopify funded me buying textbooks and I felt alright taking a day to read up on a subject. I often spent time going down rabbit holes of reading even after completing a task. I was approved to go to Japan for a conference (cancelled due to COVID-19) and spent a day attending a workshop on VMs (didn't even bother getting approval for that).</p>
<p>Learning is good. Especially in internships, your focus should be investing in yourself and great companies should want to invest in you (within reason of course).</p>

</h2>
<p>A lot of companies end up giving interns a special project of sorts. While the project may be substantial, interesting and potentially impactful, they often get iced as soon as the intern leaves. This may not be valuable to <em>everyone</em>, but at Shopify I was apart of the weekly sprints and worked on producing features and fixes that other engineers were actually relying on. Not having intern projects would also help you better understand how much you'd enjoy working at a company full-time. The downside of course, is that you might not actually have anything to call "your own" and you will lose engineering time to things like planning meetings (which are important and fun too!). But then... the next section.</p>

</h2>
<p>For my third internship at Shopify, I switched from the Facebook team to a neighbouring team with people I had worked with in the past (so it was still fairly familiar). It was a bit weird, as for those four months I'd be working part-time at 20 hours a week. This would make it hard for me to be involved in day-to-day work, especially with it being Black Friday Cyber Monday (huge week for Shopify). So, I went on to champion my own project where I extended an open source app into being able to generate code (Rails and NodeJS) to build Marketing Activity extensions. This meant that I was the lead on the project, and was responsible for informing stakeholders on the status. I interacted with numerous teams and became the "person to go to" for information on the project. Yes, there was a risk of it ending up more like an intern project, but that's why it was also apart of the job to communicate with other teams and do health checks to make sure the project was ontrack and useful. Though it was not a huge project, it was exciting, impactful and "my own"!</p>

</h2>
<p>My first four months at Shopify were on the Facebook Ads / Instagram Checkout team, where we worked on an application for Shopify merchants to be able to directly advertise on Facebook through Shopify and to sell products via Instagram. Throughout my time there, I not only worked with the Facebook API but was in contact with Facebook engineers about goals and for technical support. The Facebook team also flew in to work with us and have social events, which was pretty fun! These experiences were unique, and helped me exercise some remote-working communication skills (which are really being tested during this quarantine).</p>

</h2>
<p>At the beginning of my current internship, I wrote a blog post about the first PR I shipped. The Engineering Blog doesn't have any special barrier for interns submitting work - if you did something cool, you can write about it! Through writing the post, I was able to talk to some cool folks on the Eng Comms team and sharpen my shoddy writing skills. My post now lives on <a href="https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/optimizing-ruby-lazy-initialization-in-truffleruby-with-deoptimization">Shopify Engineering Blog</a>! It was great exposure for a personal brand to, as the post made it to the top post of Hacker News and stayed on the front page for over twelve hours.</p>
<h2 id="people-who-really-care">people who really care<a href="#people-who-really-care" aria-label="Anchor link for: people-who-really-care"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This is the aspect I think Shopify is likely most special for, and the reason I was most afraid to leave Shopify. I always felt like my team members and lead had my best interests, and wanted to make sure that I felt productive and happy at Shopify. Weekly 1:1s, frequent kind words and so many other things really brought this together. Our CTO reached out to me to compliment me for my blog post. When the company went remote due to COVID-19, I got a personal message from my Director making sure that I was doing alright (which was ridiculous because he was dealing with being quarantined with kids) along with a little casual chat. Shopify didn't even let go of culinary workers when we went remote. The list could go on! Choosing to leaving Shopify was a really emotional experience (I cried when verbally turning down the offer) because of all the kindness, patience and care people there have offered me.</p>
<hr>
<p>So keep an eye out for Shopify internships postings, and go do internships in general! Internships at Shopify run three times a year (January, May, September) for 4 to 8 months. Applications open 4 months before start dates~</p>
<p>Feel free to email me (<code>hello@carolchen.me</code>) with any questions about choosing internships, or questions about working at Shopify or anything! Courage to talk to strangers on the internet will earn you my respect &lt;3. However, please try to avoid questions along the lines of "how do I get an internship?" as quite frankly I don't have insight beyond knowing exactly what I did (some of which I have forgotten). Requests for resume reviews, for example, is something I could actually help out with.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> There is work in progress to bring compact debug type information into the kernel, which will be leveraged by <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> to get it to the next level in terms of developer experience and capabilities. We developed an algorithm that compresses <strong>124MB</strong> of DWARF type data into just <strong>1.5MB</strong> of compact BTF type data, making it suitable to be included in the Linux kernel image by default.</p>
<!--truncate-->

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> is a technology that allows unprecedented ability to execute custom external code <strong>safely</strong> inside the Linux kernel in response to various events/hooks. This enables all kinds of applications, that are either impossible or expensive to achieve by other means (e.g., low-overhead profiling and tracing, rich introspection, fast custom packet processing, etc.).</p>
<p>While the BPF technology is already very capable and is constantly being developed further, the current developer experience with it is not exactly a walk in the park yet. One way to smooth out the developer experience with BPF is through better introspection and debuggability of BPF code. To allow that, BPF needs to know a bunch of metadata information about the BPF program. Type information is one of a few critical pieces of metadata necessary to bring the BPF experience to the next level. Eventually, this metadata will enable not just introspection, but also much higher levels of re-usability of BPF code across different versions of the Linux kernel (the so-called "compile once, run everywhere" approach).</p>
<p>How is such metadata represented in normal, non-BPF programs? It's typically done through <a href="http://www.dwarfstd.org/doc/Debugging%20using%20DWARF.pdf">DWARF</a> debug information. The problem with DWARF though, is that it's very generic and expressive, which makes it a quite complicated and verbose format, and thus unsuitable to include in the Linux kernel image due to size overhead and the complexity of parsing it.</p>
<p>Enter BTF (<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg226733.html">BPF Type Format</a>). It's a minimalistic, compact format, inspired by Sun's CTF (Compact C Type Format), which is used for representing kernel debug information since Solaris 9. BTF was created for similar purposes, with a focus on simplicity and compactness to allow its usage in the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>We won't describe BTF in a lot of detail here—see the links above to get complete information. Suffice it to say that BTF represents each type with one of a few possible type descriptors identified by <em>kind</em>: <code>BTF_KIND_INT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_ENUM</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_STRUCT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_UNION</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_ARRAY</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_FWD</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_PTR</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_CONST</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_VOLATILE</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_RESTRICT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_TYPEDEF</code>—a few more might be added soon for functions support. Depending on the kind, there might be additional variable-sized information available. Some kinds of types can reference other types using their type IDs (e.g., <code>int*</code> type is two type descriptors: <code>PTR</code> → <code>INT</code>). The type descriptor's ID is its position in the input array of all descriptors. BTF type information is stored in <code>.BTF</code> ELF section, which contains two parts: BTF type descriptors, followed by <code>\0</code>-separated strings section.</p>
<p><img src="https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/assets/btf-dedup-example.png" alt="Sample C code and its corresponding BTF type graph"></p>
<p>The diagram above should give a pretty good idea of the BTF type graph. It shows some C source code on the left and its corresponding BTF type graph on the right. The type with ID 0 is special, it represents <code>void</code> and is implicit: the first type descriptor in the <code>.BTF</code> section has type ID 1. In all the diagrams  in this blog post, type IDs are written out in the top-left corner of each type node. Type references are marked with arrows. For structs/unions it should be obvious from the diagrams which field references which type. Note that type nodes are shown in two different colors: green for non-reference types, and red for reference once (this distinction will be explained further below).</p>
<p>A well-known (within the kernel community) tool, <code>pahole</code>, was recently updated with the ability to convert DWARF into corresponding BTF type information in a straightforward, one-to-one fashion. It iterates over each DWARF type descriptor, converts it trivially into a BTF type descriptor and embeds all of them into the <code>.BTF</code> section in the ELF binary. Simple and easy. We're done, right? Unfortunately, not yet.</p>
<p>DWARF information is emitted by the compiler for each compilation unit (CU) (e.g., in the C/C++ world that is a single compiled .c/.cpp file) independently and in isolation from other compilation units that form the resulting binary. This means that DWARF information within a single CU has to describe all types referenced directly and indirectly (e.g., through struct fields) by code within that CU, down to primitive types like <code>int</code> and <code>long</code>. DWARF data from all CUs is then concatenated by the linker and put into the resulting binary <code>.debug_info</code> (and a few other) ELF sections. As you can imagine, this results in a great duplication of type information. For instance, for the kernel image on my machine, DWARF type data (<code>.debug_info</code> section) takes 121.31MB and strings (<code>.debug_str</code> section) take another 2.68MB. After <code>pahole</code>'s DWARF-to-BTF conversion there are 3.15 million BTF type descriptors: BTF type data takes 101.7MB, and strings take an additional 3.03MB.</p>
<p>There are still other problems though. The same type hierarchy (e.g., struct and all the types that struct references) can be represented in DWARF/BTF to various degrees of completeness (or rather, incompleteness) due to struct/union forward declarations.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at an example, that we'll use throughout this note to better understand the problem and solution. Suppose we have two compilation units, each using same <code>struct S</code>, but each of them having incomplete type information about struct's fields:</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> a;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};




<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> b;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>In the case of CU #1, DWARF (and subsequently, BTF) data will know only that <code>struct B</code> (but no other) exists, but will know the complete type information about <code>struct A</code>. While for CU #2, it will know the full type information about <code>struct B</code>, but will only know about the forward declaration of <code>struct A</code> (in BTF terms, it will have <code>BTF_KIND_FWD</code> type descriptor with name <code>B</code>).</p>
<p>This compilation unit isolation means that it's possible there is no single CU with complete type information describing structs <code>S</code>, <code>A</code>, and <code>B</code>. Also, we might get tons of duplicated and redundant type information. Unfortunately, for BPF use cases that are going to rely on BTF data, it's important to have a single and complete type information per each unique type, without any duplicates and incompleteness.</p>
<p>That means we need to have an algorithm, that would take this duplicated and potentially incomplete BTF information and emit nicely deduplicated type information, while also "reconstructing" complete type information by merging pieces of it from different CUs. Such BTF data can then be embedded into the Linux kernel image and readily utilized by both the kernel itself (e.g., by BPF verifier for more advanced verification scenarios), as well as external tooling to allow types introspection and better debugging capabilities.</p>
<p>Additional complications we need to keep in mind come from the fact that types, in general, can form graphs containing cycles, not just DAGs. The example above has few type cycles, which we'll use as an opportunity to better demonstrate in subsequent sections how the algorithm works. Type cycles are very common in real programs: they're typical for linked list nodes, but any moderately complex program probably would form much more complicated cycles. The Linux kernel's <code>struct task_struct</code> is part of pretty big connected type graph with multiple cycles!</p>
<p>So, in summary, we need an algorithm that will:</p>
<ul>
<li>deduplicate redundant BTF information and leave single instance of each unique type;</li>
<li>merge and reconstruct complete type information across multiple CUs;</li>
<li>handle type cycles correctly and efficiently;</li>
<li>do all of the above fast and reliably to become a part of Linux kernel build process.</li>
</ul>
<p>This note describes one such BTF deduplication (or "dedup", for short) algorithm.</p>

<p>The BTF dedup algorithm takes as an input an in-memory blob representing <code>.BTF</code> ELF section with all BTF type descriptors and string data, that comes separately from descriptors. It overwrites that memory in-place with deduplicated types and strings without any loss of information.</p>
<p>While the algorithm does deduplication, it also merges and resolves type information, whenever possible. For instance, in the example above with two compilation units having partial type information for structs <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, the output of the algorithm will emit a single copy of each BTF type that describes structs <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>S</code> (as well as type information for <code>int</code> and pointers), as if they were defined in a single compilation unit (see the diagram below for a visual representation of input and expected output BTF type graphs):</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> a;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> b;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};
</code></pre>

<h2>Algorithm summary</h2>
<p>The algorithm completes its work in five separate passes, which we'll describe briefly here and in detail in subsequent sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strings deduplication:</strong> Deduplicate string data, re-write all string offsets in BTF type descriptors to simplify string comparisons later.</li>
<li><strong>Non-reference types deduplication:</strong> Establish equivalence between and deduplicate integer, enum, struct, union and forward types.</li>
<li><strong>Reference types deduplication:</strong> Deduplicate pointers, const/volatile/restrict modifiers, typedefs, and array.</li>
<li><strong>Type compaction:</strong> Compact type descriptors leaving only unique ones.</li>
<li><strong>Type IDs fix up:</strong> Update all referenced type IDs with new ones established during compaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also a few important ideas and data structures the algorithm relies on, which are critical to understanding it and would be useful to keep …</p></span></p></div></div></div>

The most fun was <strong>webmentions</strong> and I'm here to convince you to add them!</p><p>First, let me step back and explain why webmentions exist—the IndieWeb.</p><p>Check out this official description of the IndieWeb:</p><blockquote><p>The IndieWeb is a community of individual personal websites, connected by simple standards, based on the principles of owning your domain, using it as your primary identity, to publish on your own site (optionally syndicate elsewhere), and own your data—<strong>indieweb.org</strong></p></blockquote><p>So, a community of personal websites, connected together, used as identities, that makes ownership of data possible. 🦄 🌈 How does this all work?</p><ul><li>There's a <a href="https://indieweb.org/">great IndieWeb resource</a> that will tell you everything you need to know</li><li>But, start here if you want to know <a href="https://indieweb.org/why">why the IndieWeb deserves your attention</a></li><li>When you're convinced, see this handy page for a <a href="https://indiewebify.me/">quick start to becoming a citizen of the IndieWeb</a></li><li>International IndieWebCamps are here to help—I wrote a <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/indiewebcamp/">post about my first IndieWebCamp visit</a><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/grow-the-indieweb-with-webmentions/img/indiewebcamp2017.png" alt="Nuernberg IndieWebCamp 2017"><figcaption>Nürnberg IndieWebCamp 2017 (I'm in the bottom right)</figcaption></figure></li></ul><p>Now the juicy stuff!</p><p>I think the coolest thing about the IndieWeb is that it is decentralised. Currently, there is a handful of corporations that own much of our data. With webmentions, each person owns their own data and each person can communicate with others. Webmentions are basically a way to display on your personal site ways that others have interacted with your content.</p><p>On my site I display mentions and bookmarks. It's possible for someone to link to one of my blog posts within one of their blog posts or bookmarks. If they do this, I won't know about it unless they let me know about it. <a href="https://webmention.app/">Letting others know you've mentioned their posts can be done manually or can be automated</a>.</p><p>I also display likes, retweets and replies on blog posts that I have tweeted about. If the URL to my post is in my tweet, I can gather the interactions on that tweet and display them on that post. Although most social media platforms do not support webmentions, it's possible to gather them by using a great free service called <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a>.</p><p>Some people have had webmentions on their site for many years, so I am a bit behind. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/6495">Jeremy has had webmentions since 2013</a>. But, there are more people posting content online than ever before, and personal websites aren't shown the love they used to get.</p><p>So, there has never been a more pressing need to put content creation platforms (e.g. Medium) and social media platforms (e.g. Twitter) second, and put your very own little corner of the web first 💖</p><p>I used Max Böck's post on <a href="https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/">using webmentions in Eleventy</a> to get started. I was able to get something on the screen quickly with Max's advice, and then I refined the incoming data a bit. Here is a summary of what I did:</p><ul><li>Sign up via <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> - if this doesn't work right away, check out ways to <a href="https://indielogin.com/setup">set up your website for indie logins</a> (I'm able to sign in by linking to my GitHub account on my site's homepage)</li><li>Add two <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags to your HTML document's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element: <code>&lt;link rel="pingback" href="https://webmention.io/{your-domain-here}/xmlrpc"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel="webmention" href="https://webmention.io/{your-domain-here}/webmention"&gt;</code></li><li>For social media mentions, sign up to <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a></li><li>Fetch <strong>all</strong> of your site's webmention data in JSON format using one of the <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io#api">webmention endpoints described by IndieWebCamp co-founder Aaron Parecki</a> and the API token provided by <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a></li><li>Shape your webmention data however you like - I filter webmentions into separate re-tweet, reply, like, mention, and bookmark functions using the <code>'wm-property'</code> (check out the <a href="https://github.com/ambrwlsn/website/blob/1d713ad9fbce19a9bd8821790fd51c1be62e1f76/src/filters/webmentions-filter.js#L51">filter functions</a> and before you say anything, yes I know they could be DRYer)</li><li>Use the data to display webmentions on your blog posts</li></ul><p>Here are some of my webmentions (from <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/from-gatsby-to-eleventy/">my Gatsby to Eleventy post</a>):</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/grow-the-indieweb-with-webmentions/img/webmentions.png" alt="Amber's webmentions on her Gatsby to Eleventy post"></p><p>If all of this seems too difficult and inaccessible, please don't give up! I thought getting webmentions on my little static site would be <strong>way too difficult</strong>. But there are so many wonderful posts about setting up webmentions, and so many great people willing to help. I count myself as one of those people :) If you want to implement webmentions on your site and are stuck on any of the points I listed above, ping me on Twitter and I'll do my best to help out.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>sK1 is an open source cross-platform vector graphics editor like CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, or Freehand.
    The major feature of sK1 is a professional precise printing and prepress ready PDF output.</p>

<p>sK1 2.0 is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">licensed under GPL v3</a>.
    So you may use this application as for personal or commercial purposes without any fees.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Application supports basic vector graphics primitives: rectangles, rounded rectangles, ellipses, pies, sectors,
        chords, polygons, Bézier curves, text and bitmaps.</p>

    <p>The objects may be structured on pages, layers and just in selectable groups/containers. Pages within a document
        can be of different sizes.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Bézier curves are fundamental rendering units. All the primitives can be converted into curves. We use
        <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cairo library</a>
        to render these curves on the screen. </p>

    <p>Thanks to cairo we have cross-platform unified antialiased rendering, similar to PostScript/PDF definitions.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Like PS/PDF definitions, sK1 2.0 provides solid fill, gradient fill and pattern fill for graphics primitives. Also
        the objects can be outlined by solid stroke</p>

    <p>Like for PDF objects, alphachannel is available for solid fill, gradient stops and for stroke color.
        Application supports RGB, CMYK and Grayscale colorspaces. SPOT colors are also supported.</p>
    <p><i>Note: PANTONE® colors are just a special case of SPOT colors.</i></p>

    </p>
    <p>Inside sK1 2.0 all the color values and raster images are under color management. We use
        <a href="http://www.littlecms.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LittleCMS library</a>
        for these purposes. </p>

    <p>Despite of built-in profiles, end users can use own color profiles to customize color management engine.
        Printer emulation on screen option is also available.</p>

            <img src="https://sk1project.net/content/pages/00005/page_sk1_05_preview.png"></a>
    </p>
    <p>sK1 2.0 text engine has a full-function rendering of multi-language text and cross-platform support because it's
        powered by <a href="https://pango.gnome.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pango library</a></p>

    <p>Thanks to this library, application handles text layout for particular combinations of script and font backend.
        Modules for Hebrew, Arabic, Hangul, Thai, and a number of Indic scripts are supported.</p>
    <br>
</div>

<p><a href="https://sk1project.net/uc2/">UniConvertor 2.0</a> is a core package of sK1 2.0 application. UC2 provides extended import/export
        functionality of different vector graphics, raster image and color palette file formats. Thus sK1 2.0 is connected
        to existent open source and commercial graphics software like Inkscape, Gimp, CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator,
        Xara Designer etc.</p>

<p>sK1 2.0 user interface is built on <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
        wxWidgets toolkit</a>. This toolkit allows easy porting application on MS Windows and macOS without rewriting
        tonnes of GUI code.

You might have never heard of an "<a href="https://wor.do/idle_asset">idle asset</a>" before. But you probably have a good idea of what it means. Even your grandmas first guess of what an “idle asset” is, is likely to be correct.</p><p>

This cannot be said of <i>“product market fit”</i>.<br>
Ask 10 people, grandmas or even Y-Combinator applicants, and the answers will be all over the place.</p><p>

<b>Michael Seibel chips in</b></p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xx912ku.jpg" width="100%">

<small><i>"You have reached product market fit when you are overwhelmed with usage—usually to the point where you can’t even make major changes to your product because you are swamped just keeping it up and running."</i>[1]</small></p><p>

Another YC partner said that demand is growing <i>soooo</i> fast, that you just want to die.</p><p>
<i>"If you don't want to die, you don't have product market fit"</i>.</p><p>

So the people who popularized the term, say it's synonymous to <i>extreme growth</i> or <i>incredible demand</i>. Then why not call it that? Anyone and their grandma will understand such terms right away.</p><p>


<b>"Dominance"</b></p><p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UHRVkCj.png" width="100%"></p><p>
Google basically <i>owns</i> the search market. They absolutely <i>dominate</i> it. Perhaps, "product market fit" is just a euphemism to avoid using the term dominant. Hmm.</p><p>

<b>So what does product market fit really mean?</b><br>
It simply means that your product and its market have found each other, and by extension, that often means seeing serious growth. Though sometimes, the product is catered towards a niche audience, in which case it might not become the next Google, while still enjoying <i>product market fit</i>.</p><p>

<b>Naval's got something to say too</b></p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9g9dJVk.png" width="100%"><br>

Is that really so Naval? 🧐<br>
By that definition, many of the sideprojects I built, that went absolutely nowhere, all had product market fit. Yay. </p><p>

In reality, many nice sounding quotes require the stretching of a definition in order to make sense.<br>Example: <i>"Real wealth is having lots of free time"</i>.</p><p>
It sounds great, right? But, can you transfer this "real wealth" to your cousin from Bangladesh who's working 14 hours a day? I like Naval, though, I think that one was a miss. But I digress..</p><p>

<b>OK, so now what?</b><br>
When possible, use simple words. YC is big on avoiding <a href="https://wor.do/buzzword">buzzwords</a>, yet they throw around <i>product market fit</i> left and right, leaving many people confused. Just say <i>extreme growth</i>, or any alternative that is understood quickly.




</p><!--
Here’s a few terms that do a better job at describing product market fit, than product market fit<br>

* Extremely rapid growth<br>
* Painfully fast growth<br>
* Long lasting growth<br>
* Rapid Compound growth<br>
</li>

<br><br>
I could write a PHP random word generator, and come up with many more terms that do a better job at describing product market fit, than product market fit does.

February 24, 2021 | https://mainestartupsinsider.com/running-tides-attracts-big-vc-names/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mainestartupsinsider.com/running-tides-attracts-big-vc-names/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
							<p>Running Tide Technologies, a Portland-based company that operates traditional oyster farms, has just emerged from stealth with a big, bold plan to sequester gigatons of CO2 on the ocean floor over the next several years by growing kelp and then sinking it to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>The company has been keeping its cards close to the vest, but Fast Company magazine <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90548820/forget-planting-trees-this-company-is-making-carbon-offsets-by-putting-seaweed-on-the-ocean-floor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article</a> today revealing Running Tide’s plan to leverage its aquaculture expertise to tackle the issue of climate change. Its plan, according to the magazine, is to grow kelp, which like other plants extracts carbon dioxide from the environment, on floating rigs and then sink them to the ocean floor. Once there, the CO2 could remain sequestered for centuries.</p>
<p>“Once it goes down below 1,000 meters, it’s not coming back up, because the pressures are so great,” Marty Odlin, Running Tide’s founder and CEO, told Fast Company. “So you can get at least 1,000 years of sequestration. More likely, it will turn into oil or sediment and be sequestered on the geologic timescale—millions of years.”</p>
<p>Unlike terrestrial forests that can burn or degrade and release the carbon back into the atmosphere, marine plants don’t break down as easy. Plus, coastal&nbsp;ecosystems sequester up to 20 times more carbon per acre than land forests, <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2019/how-kelp-naturally-combats-global-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to this article</a> published by Harvard University.</p>
<p>Running Tide <a href="https://www.runningtide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated its website</a> this week. While previously focused on traditional shellfish aquaculture, it now includes language about its “negative emissions journey” to combat climate change with its kelp. It also says that Running Tide will be selling “kelp carbon credits.”</p>
<p>Maine Startups Insider had heard rumors about the company and how it had been able to attract big-time VC money. MSI <a href="https://mainestartupsinsider.com/has-silicon-valley-big-shot-chris-sacca-invested-in-a-maine-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article last week</a> speculating that Chris Sacca, one of Silicon Valley’s most well-known venture capitalists, had invested in the company via his new VC firm, Lowercarbon Capital. Sacca did not respond to MSI’s requests for confirmation, but did announce his firm’s investment in the Portland company on Twitter after the Fast Company article was published.</p>
<p>“Bonkers scale, unreasonable ambition, massive impact on the plant. During insane times, it’s entrepreneurs like @martyodlin that fire us up,” Sacca tweeted.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Shopify, the ecommerce behemoth, also revealed itself this week as an investor in Running Tide. The ecommerce-platform company last year launched its Sustainability Fund to fight climate change. On Monday, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/about/environment/sustainability-fund/ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it shared in a blog post</a> how it invested its first $5 million, including an investment of undisclosed size in Running Tide.</p>
<p>“All work is important in carbon reduction, but some people have to try to kill the monster,” Odlin told Shopify. “Everyone should try to slow it down, but we should pick 15–20 technologies that might be able to stop the whole thing all by themselves. That’s what we’re trying to build.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“All work is important in carbon reduction, but some people have to try to kill the monster.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I have not been successful getting the company to confirm how much it raised, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/266342-50#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but Pitchbook claims</a> it raised $11.2 million in November 2019. In addition to Lowercarbon Capital and Shopify,&nbsp;PitchBook lists three additional investors: Soraya Darabi, an angel investor, San Francisco-based Pathbreaker Ventures, and San Francisco-based Yes VC.</p>
<p>David Frankel, a partner at Boston-based Founder Collective, also revealed on Twitter on Tuesday that he had led the seed financing.</p>

<p><i>February 24, 2021</i></p>


<p>
This post will explore the distinction between <i>values</i> and <i>metavalues</i> (representations) as the
objects of computation, particularly in a mathematical software context.
A clear separation between values and metavalues
is an idea that
appears in symbolic computation systems,
compilers, code analysis tools,
and interval arithmetic software (among other settings),
but it has arguably
never been pursued to its full potential,
especially at the level of programming language design.
</p>

<p>
The case can be made that many bugs and footguns
in computer algebra systems and programming languages
are the result of a confused treatment of values and metavalues (see Figure 1),
and the title of this post could just as well have been "Why is my mathematical software full of bugs?".
A satisfactory answer to that question would require considering other
aspects; for example,
<a href="https://fredrikj.net/blog/2021/01/infinity-in-calcium-and-fungrim/">infinities
and singularities</a> are a largely orthogonal issue (though there are
points of overlap with the value-metavalue problem),
and then of course there are all the usual categories of
bugs that are not specific to mathematical software. Nevertheless,
I believe that metavalue mismanagement is particularly fundamental.</p>

<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ligozzi_(Una_quimera).jpg"><img src="https://fredrikj.net/blog/2021/02/computing-with-metavalues/chimera.jpg"></a><br>Figure 1: <i><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ligozzi_(Una_quimera).jpg">A chimera</a></i>, Jacopo Ligozzi (1547-1627).</p>

<p>
This topic is closely related to the problem
of defining equality/equivalence/isomorphism
(see for example <i><a href="http://people.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf">When is one thing equal to some other thing?</a></i>
by Barry Mazur) and other problems in metamathematics, though my concern in this post will be more with
concrete software implementation issues than with foundations of mathematics.
Complex isomorphisms are a challenge when formalizing modern abstract mathematics,
but misuse of metavalues leads to
incorrect present-day implementations of mathematical objects that had correct foundations 2000 years ago.
</p>



<h2 id="section1">Values and metavalues</h2>

<p>
I will use <i>value</i> to refer to any mathematically definable object
and <i>metavalue</i> to refer to a description of a value used for computations.
An isomorphic representation of a value qualifies a metavalue,
but a metavalue need not unambiguously identify a specific value;
it suffices for a metavalue to describe a property of a value
(possibly shared by several possible values),
or to provide an approximate or heuristic description.
It may also carry extra information (metadata) that has nothing
to do with the value itself.
</p>

<p>
This notion of <i>metavalue</i> is informal, and the terminology is
not necessarily standard, with apologies to any professional logicians who happen to read this.
I want to avoid using a term that either sounds too general or has a preexisting technical meaning
(model, abstraction, representation, approximation, image, etc.).
In software, metavalues may appear explicitly (as distinct entities from values), implicitly (in the semantics of operations),
or informally (in usage patterns).
The distinction is mainly one of <i>intent</i>: a metavalue is meant
to be used as a substitute for a (true) value.
</p>

<p>
Values are the objects we would ideally like to
represent and manipulate in software.
Here are some examples of interesting values, all of which
can defined formally within standard foundations of mathematics
(I will ignore issues such as the meaning of definability and whether foundations are consistent):</p>

<ul>
<li>The tuple $(1, 2, 3)$.</li>
<li>The boolean $\operatorname{True}$.</li>
<li>The real number $2 \pi$.</li>
<li>The set $\mathbb{Q}$.</li>
<li>The sequence $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, \ldots)$.</li>
<li>The function $\exp : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$.</li>
<li>The category $\operatorname{Top}$ of topological spaces.</li>
<li>The integer $\operatorname{TREE}(3)$.</li>
<li>The truth value of the proposition "white has a winning sequence of moves from the starting position in chess".</li>
<li>The set of nonreal zeros of $\zeta(s)$ with real part not equal to $1/2$.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why do we need metavalues? Simple values such as the tuple $(1, 2, 3)$
correspond quite well to the values of native types in programming languages.
More formally, it is easy to encode such simple values on a Turing machine in a way
that permits carrying out natural operations (addition of integers, concatenation of tuples, testing equality, etc.) algorithmically.
However, the vast majority of specific mathematical objects are
impractical or impossible to represent as such.
Indeed, most individual real numbers, sets, etc. cannot be represented in any conceivable form on an actual computer since they would require an infinite amount of data:
a number like $2 \pi$ or a set like $\mathbb{Q}$ is an exception which happens to admit a simple symbolic description using standard formalisms.
Even if we acknowledge that objects we cannot even describe are beyond scope for any form of computation,
there are plenty of difficulties left when working with finitely definable objects:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Most objects with finite descriptions are too large to represent explicitly on a physical computer (for example, $\operatorname{TREE}(3)$ is a tad too large to store in a <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> <tt>mpz_t</tt>).</li>
<li>Values that are clearly representable need not be computable in an explicit, meaningful way. For example, if a predicate is undecidable, we cannot explicitly reduce it to True or False (although either is perfectly representable). If it is undecidable whether a given real number $x$ represents zero, we cannot evaluate $\operatorname{sgn}(x)$ to an explicit number $-1, 0, +1$.</li>
<li>Even explicitly representable and computable values may be too costly or inconvenient to actually implement.</li>
<li>In some cases, we deliberately want to avoid representing specific values,
in order to model a range of possible outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For these reasons, it is often convenient (and sometimes necessary)
to work with metavalues—indirect, partial or approximate descriptions of values—instead of (perfectly faithful representations of) the values themselves.</p>

<p>
<i>Computing with metavalues</i>, in a narrow sense,
means taking a (mathematically specified) program and
running it with metavalues instead of values, either by explicitly executing
the steps of the program with metavalues instead of values or by performing
an abstract or symbolic analysis to deduce a metavalue for the return value of
the program (for simplicity, I will only consider pure functional programs).
More generally, it is often useful to move between
levels of abstraction and treat metavalues
themselves as values; unfortunately, this comes with the risk of
conflating value and metavalue semantics (an extremely common error in actual software).
</p>

<p>
Using metavalues, we can simulate
programs running on abstract mathematical machines manipulating perfect mathematical objects.
Indeed, computing with metavalues
even allows us to simulate nonstandard models of computation
which cannot be realized on ideal Turing machines,
let alone on physical computers with limited resources.
For example, floating-point arithmetic can be viewed as
a method of using approximate metavalues
to simulate (imperfectly!) the operation of Blum-Shub-Smale machines (abstract machines capable
of storing exact real numbers in registers).
</p>

<h3 id="section2">Examples</h3>

<p>Here are some examples of abstractions, computational paradigms and specific
techniques that may be considered use of metavalues:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<b>Abstract interpretation</b> is a special
case of computing with metavalues.
In the terminology of abstract interpretation,
values are called <i>concrete values</i> and metavalues are called <i>abstract values</i>.
(This terminology assumes that concrete values are actually representable
and computable, whereas the view I'm taking here is that values are mathematical
abstractions while metavalues are concretely representable,
so the use of concrete/abstract is in some sense reversed.)
</li>

<li><b>Type inference</b>: the type of a value (or a typeclass of a value) is an example of a metavalue, and type inference is essentially abstract interpretation using types as the metavalues (abstract values).</li>

<li><b>Floating-point arithmetic</b> as a model of real arithmetic, with floating-point numbers
as metavalues approximating ideal real numbers.
More generally, any form of truncation or approximation can be seen as metavalue computation; this includes
truncated power series as an approximation of infinite
power series, Chebyshev series as a model of functions on $\mathbb{R}$ (see <a href="https://www.chebfun.org/">Chebfun</a>),
matrices as an approximation of infinite-dimensional linear operators, and so on.
</li>

<li>
<b>Word-size integers</b> as an approximate model of integers (or more generally, residue class rings as an approximation of various rings).
</li>

<li><b>Interval arithmetic</b> (as well as <b>ball arithmetic</b>) is a nonexact but rigorous model of real arithmetic, where real numbers
are represented by enclosing sets.
More generally, interval arithmetic can be generalized to computing enclosures for arbitrary sets of values
(this is closely related to abstract interpretation and type inference).</li>

<li><b>Symbolic computation</b> with free variables. A symbolic expression such as $3x+4y$ can be viewed as a metavalue representing the possible values
resulting from substituting specific values for $x$ and $y$, and if $x$ and $y$ are specified with constraints (for example, $0 \le x, y \le 1$), this can
be viewed as a kind of enclosure, which additionally allows tracking dependencies between the free variables.</li>

<li><b>Significance arithmetic</b> is an extension of floating-point arithmetic where each approximation carries an estimate of the error.</li>

<li><b>Fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets, fuzzy intervals</b> are generalizations of interval arithmetic that allow assigning varying probabilities
to different elements of the enclosing sets.</li>

<li><b>Conjectural results, and outright guessing</b>. Results computed using Monte Carlo algorithms or assuming unproved conjectures (such as the Riemann hypothesis)
can be considered metavalues; even when the output value is represented exactly, it implicitly carries with it some degree of uncertainty.</li>

<li><b>Results carrying proof certificates or software information</b>. More on this later.</li>

<li><b>Error values and exceptions</b> can in some cases be viewed as metavalues representing loss of information.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is not especially newsy, but ever since I first heard of the idea a year ago I’ve been obsessed with universal Fed Accounts.</p><p>On the Federal Reserve’s website they have an FAQ which, among other things, debunks some kind of fraud which is based on saying that everyone can get a bank account with the Fed based on their Social Security number:</p><blockquote><p>A recent hoax circulating on the internet asserts that the Federal Reserve maintains accounts for individuals that are tied to the individual's Social Security number, and that individuals can access these accounts to pay bills and obtain money. These claims are&nbsp;false. The Federal Reserve does not maintain accounts for individuals, and individuals should not attempt to make payments using Federal Reserve Bank routing numbers or false routing numbers. Individuals who attempt to pay bills or conduct other transactions using a Federal Reserve Bank routing number may face penalty fees from the company they were attempting to pay, or the suspension or closure of their commercial bank or payment service provider accounts. Law enforcement, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is aware of this scheme, and individuals who participate in such schemes could also face criminal charges.</p></blockquote><p>So to be clear: It is not true that the Fed maintains basic checking accounts for all Americans that can be used to pay bills and obtain money, with the accounts numbered after your unique Social Security number. </p><p>But shouldn’t it be true? </p><p>Once upon a time, governments didn’t issue paper currency, and instead banknotes were printed privately by banks. But over time, we came to see this as a worthwhile public service. Paper money still exists, obviously, but for most people most of the time electronic transactions are the predominant form of currency. When we say “stimulus checks” we are mostly talking about direct deposits, not literal checks, and we are definitely not talking about envelopes full of $100 bills. </p><p>The Fed should provide everyone with access to electronic currency on an equitable basis by giving everyone a bank account. You can read a <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/06/22/a-public-option-for-bank-accounts-or-central-banking-for-all/">detailed treatment of the issue from Morgan Ricks, John Crawford, and Lev Menand</a> if you’d like, but honestly the basic idea is exactly the myth the Fed debunked. Everyone would have an account; everyone would be able to deposit checks or accept direct deposits into the account; everyone would be able to pay bills through the account; and you could use the Post Office to provide the retail branches of the system. </p><p>Commercial banks will obviously hate this idea.</p><p>But to be fair to them, I think the Fed accounts should pay no interest and offer no services beyond basic deposits, payments, and ATM withdrawals. The idea is to solve the social problem of the unbanked, not to get into the full panoply of financial services — because the benefits of universal banking are considerable, even if the accounts themselves don’t have any bells and whistles.</p><h4>Helping the unbanked</h4><p>In a direct sense, the big benefit here is that a universal banking initiative would help out the “unbanked” — <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2019execsum.pdf">people who don’t have bank accounts</a> — typically because they don’t have enough money to meet the minimum balance thresholds. This is only about 5% of households in the most recent data (which was from before the pandemic), but as you can see in the FDIC’s chart, this looks to be a somewhat cyclical phenomenon where people lose their bank accounts when the economy is bad.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd736b7dc-9895-47ea-bbe7-42962748d6d1_1370x896.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd736b7dc-9895-47ea-bbe7-42962748d6d1_1370x896.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d736b7dc-9895-47ea-bbe7-42962748d6d1_1370x896.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:896,&quot;width&quot;:1370,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:237997,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Life as one of the unbanked is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/costs-of-being-unbanked-or-underbanked/#:~:text=Using%20the%20FDIC's%20estimate%20that,in%20annual%20costs%20per%20person.">full of annoying fees</a> to check-cashing joints or providers of prepaid debit cards. </p><p>A public bank would do away with all that, which is good. </p><p>But the issue of the unbanked is, in some ways, bigger than it looks. </p><p>Oftentimes you might look at a scummy banking practice charging people huge overdraft fees instead of simply not processing excess payments and think to yourself “why doesn’t Congress just ban that?”</p><p>Well, bank lobbyists are part of the answer. But what the lobbyists will tell you is that administering checking accounts is not very lucrative. That’s why the minimum account balances that push people out of banking exist in the first place. The harder you make it to rip people off, the higher the minimum balance needs to be to make the business make sense. If that sounds shitty to you, well — it’s shitty! And public bank accounts are the solution. But the even broader benefit is that solving the problem of the unbanked will supersede the need to find other solutions for the problems of the unbanked.</p><h4>Toward a cashless tomorrow</h4><p>Back 10 years ago when cities were first setting up bikeshare systems, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-12-26/bike-sharing-for-the-unbanked">how to make them accessible to the unbanked</a> became a constant source of tension, because actually fixing the underlying problem of people not having bank accounts wasn’t on the table.</p><p>This comes up basically any time a progressive jurisdiction wants to roll out something new that involves paying fees — you can’t just ignore the unbanked minority, so you need a complicated workaround. </p><p>And it’s now spreading to the private sector. Philadelphia was the first city to <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/business/cashless-ban-philadelphia-stores-sweetgreen-bluestone-lane-20191004.html">ban cashless stores</a> back in 2019, and <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/policy/technology/cashless-ban-highlights-new-yorks-unbanked-problem.html">New York City did it last year</a>. D.C.’s cashless ban is so new I didn’t even <a href="https://dcist.com/story/20/12/02/cashless-businesses-ban-dc-council/">realize it had passed</a>, but after a unanimous D.C. Council vote in December, it will be taking effect soon.  </p><p>The cost of these kinds of bans can be sneakily high precisely because cashless retail is so rare. You’re not taking away anything that most businesses are actually familiar with, so opposition is muted and the consequences are hidden. But cashlessness seems like a promising idea for a world where the vast majority of the customer base can pay electronically over your smartphone. Most immediately, you don’t need to worry about theft or handling of cash. The checkout line moves faster. </p><p>Down the road, though, cashlessness lets you try to reimagine the entire flow of the business to raise productivity. Maybe your coffee place or fast-casual lunch spot doesn’t need cashiers at all — ordering is just done on your phone and then you pick it up. Most companies probably aren’t interested in rethinking their whole operation along those lines right now. But if we do the right thing on fiscal and monetary policy, get full employment and see wages start rising, then increasing your productivity with a combination of new technology and new business processes will be huge. But not if we make it standard to legally require the use of legacy payment methods.</p><p>On the other hand, I sincerely sympathize with what these cities are trying to accomplish. If I were on the D.C. Council, I might’ve voted for the cashless ban. My point is just that requiring cash is not a real solution to this problem — what we need to do is give everyone bank accounts. It’s a fairness issue, but it’s also an infrastructure and innovation issue. Creating a uniform, reliable, national currency was a huge step forward in its day. But people want cards and electronic transactions. Making the private sector the sole provider of those services is holding the whole country back, even though most people have them. </p><p>Meanwhile, Fed accounts could be the basis for further public sector innovation.</p><h4>“Checks” for everyone</h4><p>One of the great policy innovations of the Trump years was the idea of the government sending out flat stimulus checks that, though not truly universal, did go to the vast majority of the population, phasing out only for the affluent. </p><p>These checks had two big upsides. One is that they seemed genuinely very popular, curing the problem that bedeviled us in the 2009-13 period when it seemed hard to get a political consensus on how to stimulate. The other is that they hit the pockets of greatest need — nobody was excluded on the basis of spotty work history or anything like that. </p><p>The problem with this sort of loosely targeted approach is you get very little bang for your buck. Plenty of money went to people who were just employed continuously throughout the pandemic and who, while surely glad to have some extra money, were not in any particular distress. Aggregate statistics show that caught between extra cash from the Treasury and health warnings from the CDC, these people mostly just built up a savings cushion or paid down old credit card debt. There’s nothing wrong with that, but to the extent that your concern is only with stimulating the economy, it’s better to spend the money in more targeted ways. But targeted spending inevitably becomes politically controversial because it creates some winners and some losers. It’s much more tractable to give the money to everyone, even if that involves more spending than is strictly necessary. </p><p>As far as I’m concerned, the solution is obvious — do completely untargeted checks, and just make them really big. In effect, you’d be taking debt off of private balance sheets and putting it on the public sector, which has an easier time bearing it. </p><p>But just accumulating public sector debt willy-nilly frightens a lot of people. Even when interest rates are super-duper-low, you can always worry that they might rise in the future, creating rollover risk. </p><p>I think reasonable people can disagree as to how much sense it makes to worry about that versus how much debt stock is a purely political problem. But Fed Accounts solve the problem. If Congress wants to make $2,000 materialize in everyone’s account, they can just pass a law that makes that happen. The money doesn’t have to “come from” anywhere or add to the debt stock. And rather than doing it through one-off appropriations, Congress could <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/voxs-the-weeds/episode/fix-recessions-by-giving-people-money-66991306">follow Claudia Sahm’s suggestion and make disbursements automatic</a> based on labor market conditions. Alternatively, if Congress doesn’t feel like taking responsibility for making policy choices, they could give the Fed’s Open Market Committee (the people who make monetary policy decisions) the authority to make drops into everyone’s Fed account as a stabilization tool. </p><p>Now to be clear, just because you can print unlimited sums of money …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <div><p>In the software industry, changing a running system is dangerous. As the saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Unfortunately, even if code were perfect, progress marches ever forward, and new features are continually being added. One of the worst feelings for a developer is learning that something you just shipped has caused an issue, or even worse, an incident.</p><p>For companies like Shopify that practice continuous deployment, our code is changing multiple times every day. We have to de-risk new features to ship safely and confidently without impacting the million+ merchants using our platform.</p><p>Beta flags are one approach to feature development that gives us a number of notable advantages, among them:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Reduce blast radius of changes–if they happen not to go as planned–by rolling out the beta to a percentage of the subject group.</li>
<li>Instantaneously choose when the change is active in production. Without beta flags, changes would be active at the time of deployment.</li>
<li>Instantaneously rollback the feature.</li>
<li>Ship new code paths, typically inactive, but allow devs to test these code paths in production.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Anatomy of a Beta Flag</h2>
<div><p>The word “beta” is a bit overloaded in the software industry, being used even to refer to launched products. We’ll define some primitives for clarity.</p><p><strong>Subject</strong>: A concept that you want to define a control plane against. For multi-tenant SAAS applications, this is typically the model corresponding to your tenant. For Shopify, this is typically our concept of a shop. While designing, consider a polymorphic approach so you can implement betas against multiple types of things.</p><p><strong>BetaIdentifier</strong>: This is often a simple string that represents the feature you are developing. For example, “multi_location.” Keep in mind that if you use a string instead of an auto-incrementing integer, you should be wary of case-sensitivity and of accidentally re-using this same string in the future. Metadata can be associated with this and should be considered for internal documentation/tooling purposes. For example, a high-level description of the feature, a list of chat channels requiring notification about this feature’s rollout, a list of owners, descriptions of the behavior when this feature is enabled or disabled, etc.</p><p><strong>BetaFlag</strong>: At the lowest level, this is a small piece of data associated with a Subject. This can be implemented as a “Subject <code>has_many</code> BetaFlag” relationship. Inside the BetaFlag, we have a BetaIdentifier and typically some <code>created_at/updated_at</code> timestamps.</p><p>For a given BetaFlag, we can:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Check if an instance of Subject has this BetaIdentifier? If so, the feature is turned on for the Subject.</li>
<li>Grab a list of all Subjects with this BetaIdentifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>This check allows us explicit per-Subject feature toggling.</p>
<p><strong>BetaRollout</strong>: This is data that lives unrelated to any one particular Subject. Inside BetaRollout, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>beta_name</strong>: a BetaIdentifier, so we can know which concept we’re dealing with.</li>
<li>
<strong>percentage_rollout</strong>: an integer (0..100) reflecting which percentage of Subject you wish to enable the BetaFlag for.</li>
<li>A&nbsp;method to calculate whether to consider a Subject as “rolled out”.</li>
</ul>
<div><p>For a given BetaRollout, we can ask, “Does an instance of Subject have this BetaIdentifier?” If so, the feature is turned on for the Subject.</p><p>If the BetaRollout record does not exist, we will assume that the feature is turned off.</p><p>Here’s an example of a performant way to implement the <code>BetaRollout#enabled?</code> method:</p></div>
<div>
<p>
By calculating a digest of the two identifiers and converting it into an integer modulo 100, we ensure that each percentage rollout will hit a different set of Subjects as the % increases. This means that a different subset of Subjects is affected every time for every beta rollout we do. Why does this matter? This prevents potential negative effects that occur due to rollouts from affecting the same subset of subjects consistently.</p><p>This implementation also has a nice invariant: As the percentage increases (For example, from 0% to 11%, then 11% to 20%, etc.), the previous set of Subjects that saw the feature is still seeing the feature. The digest modulo 100 remains static even as the rollout_percentage changes. This is key to ensuring a nice user experience because it would be frustrating to experience a feature appearing and disappearing (seemingly randomly) as the rollout percentage increases.</p><p>The ultimate effect is that every BetaRollout has a uniquely consistent growing set of Subjects experiencing the feature in the journey from 0% to 100% (or from <em>X</em>% to 0%).</p></div>
<h2>Bundling These Concepts</h2>
<p>Once we define a BetaIdentifier, we can do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply the new feature to a particular Subject by creating and associating a new record of BetaFlag to the Subject.</li>
<li>Roll out the feature to <em>X</em>% of Subjects by creating a BetaRollout and setting it to a particular % value.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two separate concepts are related to the BetaIdentifier. The question about whether or not a new feature is enabled then looks something like this for a given Subject:</p>

<div><p>In English, this equates to “Does the subject have the flag explicitly (via BetaFlag) or implicitly (via BetaRollout)?” It’s helpful to define this in some fashion, so we’ll call this unified view the <strong>Beta</strong>.</p><p>What happens when we want to revert the beta flag? Perhaps the feature is bugged. There are two cases to consider:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>The flag was rolled out using the % mechanism only.</li>
<li>The flag was rolled out by manually applying the flag to specific instances of the Subject.</li>
</ul>
<div><p>When the flag is rolled out using the % mechanism only, the rollback process is extremely straightforward: change the % rollout value of the BetaRollout to `0`. Note that anyone with the explicit application of the flag will still see the feature.</p><p>When the flag is rolled out to potentially thousands of Subjects by direct application, we find ourselves in a more challenging situation. We have an ongoing incident and thousands of records in the DB that we can’t quickly remove. In the best case, we have to write a maintenance task to alter the database for these thousands of Subjects. In the absolute worst case, it’s just not possible!</p><p>It would’ve been tempting to refer to the Beta concept directly throughout our code because it seems to give us all the flexibility we want. However, we’ve just discovered a case where we can’t easily rollback. How do we proceed?</p></div>
<h2>Taking Things a Step Further</h2>
<p>Instead of having all of our code refer to a Beta directly, we should be writing an abstraction a layer higher. In our hypothetical situation, we can imagine something called a “Feature” that is defined like:</p>

<p>With another layer above the primitives like this, we’ve just introduced flexibility for developers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply a feature directly to a specific Subject (or thousands of them).<br>For example: Adding a feature to a production Subject for testing or for a particularly unique rollout that cannot be %-based.</li>
<li>Apply this feature to a random %-based sampling of all other Subjects.<br>For example: A typical rollout of a feature might encompass slowly rolling out to an ever-increasing population of Subjects</li>
<li>Apply an escape hatch for specific Subjects that encounter problems with the feature by applying the my-cool-new-feature-opt-out flag directly to the Subject.<br>For example: Some bugs encountered might not be severe enough to roll back the rollout for all Subjects, but we want to allow a specific Subject to disable the feature</li>
<li>Apply a kill switch for all Subjects by rolling out the my-cool-new-feature-opt-out flag to 100%.<br>For example: A Beta has been applied to thousands of Subject but can’t easily be removed, but we need to halt the feature immediately</li>
</ul>
<div><p>If we imagine a runaway train of an incident caused by rolling out your feature, we see that we should hopefully be able to instantly resolve it by applying the kill switch! Power, safety, speed.</p><p>Often, beta features might start with some simple qualifications. Invariably, they often evolve to become something more like:</p></div>

<p>Using a higher-level abstraction makes room for the feature to easily change qualification as the business demands change. In our experience, even things that seem like simple Yes|No Beta flags often evolve to have other requirements. This is all to say that you should consider avoiding referring to the lower level primitives directly. It’s easier to change one method than dozens of interspersed <code>Beta.enabled?(...)</code> invocations. This generalizes nicely to exposure over an API: If the feature evolves, but <em>N</em> clients are still referring directly to the primitives, we can’t necessarily update all of them simultaneously without the higher-level abstraction being exposed.</p>
<h2>Some Things to Keep in Mind</h2>
<p>This is just one path to developing new features safely and efficiently that we’ve found to be highly effective at Shopify. The formulations we developed here are informative, and your implementation will surely differ.</p>
<h3>Data Structure Differences and Reconciliation</h3>
<div><p>If code path A generates data incompatible with code path B, you will likely have problems when you roll back unless you have preemptively considered the rollback experience upfront. Always consider what happens when you switch paths.</p><p>This beta pattern optimizes the ability to change code paths in production quickly, but the lingering data can often be forgotten.</p></div>
<h3>Not all Features Can be Developed Sanely in this Manner</h3>
<p>Similar to the previous point, some features have impacts on your underlying data model. Even if we considered migrating between the two code paths, you might encounter a feature where rolling back leaves things in a worse or nonsensical state. Some things simply don’t make sense to have the ability to be rolled back. Some features are better developed iteratively rather than switched on all at once.</p>
<h3>Not all Features Can be Rolled Back Without a User Disruption</h3>
<div><p>Imagining a new feature: once a user has come to depend on it, it may be impossible to roll back without leaving the user confused. Imagine introducing a new business concept that wasn’t fully …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Cryptographers and cryptography engineers love to talk about the latest attacks and how to mitigate them. <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/26/learning-from-ladderleak-is-ecdsa-broken/">LadderLeak</a> breaks ECDSA with less than 1 bit of nonce leakage? <a href="https://raccoon-attack.com/">Raccoon attack</a> brings the Hidden Number attack to finite field Diffie-Hellman in TLS?</p>



<p>And while this sort of research is important and <em>fun</em>, most software developers have much bigger problems to contend with, when it comes to the cryptographic security of their products and services.</p>



<p>So let’s start by talking about Java cryptography.</p>







<h2 id="java">Cryptography in Java</h2>



<p>In Java, the way you’re supposed to encrypt data using symmetric cryptography is with the <code>javax.crypto.Cipher</code> class. So to encrypt with AES-GCM, you’d call <code>Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding")</code> and use the resulting object to process your data. <code>javax.crypto.Cipher</code> can be used for a lot of ill-advised modes (including ECB mode) and ciphers (including DES).</p>



<p>Can you guess what class you’d use to encrypt data with RSA in Java?</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9nSQs0Gr9FA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p><figcaption>The square hole is javax.crypto.Cipher.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That’s right! RSA goes in the <code>Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding")</code> hole.</p>



<p>(Or, more likely, <code>Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding")</code>, which is <em><a href="https://robotattack.org/">not great</a></em>.)</p>







<p>Also, as a reminder: <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/01/20/please-stop-encrypting-with-rsa-directly/">You don’t want to encrypt data with RSA directly</a>. You want to encrypt <em>symmetric keys</em> with RSA, and then encrypt your actual data with those symmetric keys. Preferably using <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2021/01/22/hybrid-encryption-and-the-kem-dem-paradigm/">a KEM+DEM paradigm</a>.</p>



<p>Fun anecdote: The naming of <code>RSA/ECB/$padding</code> is misleading because it doesn’t actually implement a sort of ECB mode. However, a few projects over the years missed that memo and decided to implement RSA-ECB so they could be “compatible” with what they thought Java did. That is: They broke long messages into equal sized chunks (237 bytes for 2048-bit RSA), encrypted them independently, and then concatenated the ciphertexts together.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t end there. <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">AES-GCM</a> explodes brilliantly if you ever reuse a nonce. Naturally, the <code>Cipher</code> class <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/Cipher.html">shifts all of this burden onto the unwitting developer that calls it</a>, which results in a regurgitated mess that looks like this (from the Java documentation):</p>


<pre title=""> GCMParameterSpec s = ...;
 cipher.init(..., s);

 // If the GCM parameters were generated by the provider, it can
 // be retrieved by:
 // cipher.getParameters().getParameterSpec(GCMParameterSpec.class);

 cipher.updateAAD(...);  // AAD
 cipher.update(...);     // Multi-part update
 cipher.doFinal(...);    // conclusion of operation

 // Use a different IV value for every encryption
 byte[] newIv = ...;
 s = new GCMParameterSpec(s.getTLen(), newIv);
 cipher.init(..., s);
 ...
</pre>


<p>If you fail to perform this kata perfectly, you’ll introduce a nonce reuse vulnerability into your application.</p>



<p>And if you look a little deeper, you’ll <em>also</em> learn that <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/a50725db2ab621e1a17cb5505f78e4bc73972a27/src/java.base/share/classes/com/sun/crypto/provider/AESCrypt.java">their software implementation of AES</a> (which is used in any platform without hardware AES available–such as Android on older hardware) isn’t <a href="https://www.bearssl.org/constanttime.html#bitslicing">hardened against cache-timing attacks</a>… although <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/a50725db2ab621e1a17cb5505f78e4bc73972a27/src/java.base/share/classes/com/sun/crypto/provider/GHASH.java#L69-L126">their GHASH implementation <em>is</em></a> (which implies cache-timing attacks are within their threat model). But that’s an implementation problem, not a design problem.</p>



<p>Kludgey, hard-to-use, easy-to-misuse. It doesn’t have to be this way.</p>

<h2 id="php-does-it-better">Learning From PHP</h2>



<p>In 2015, when PHP 7 was being discussed on their mailing list, someone had the brilliant idea of creating a simple, cross-platform, extension-independent interface for getting random bytes and integers.</p>



<p>This effort would become <code>random_bytes()</code> and <code>random_int()</code> in PHP 7. (If you want to see how messy things were before PHP 7, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat/blob/master/lib/random.php">the appropriate polyfill library</a>.)</p>



<p>However, the initial design for this feature sucked really badly. Imagine the following code snippet:</p>


<pre title="">function makePassword(int $length = 20): string
{
    $password = '';
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $length; ++$i) {
        $password .= chr(random_int(33, 124));
    }
    return $password;
}
</pre>


<p>If your operating system’s random number generator failed (e.g. you’re in a chroot and cannot access <code>/dev/urandom</code>), then the <code>random_int()</code> call would have returned <code>false</code>.</p>



<p>Because of type shenanigans in earlier versions of PHP, <code>chr(false)</code> returns a NUL byte. (This is <a href="https://3v4l.org/k3Sb3">fixed since 7.4</a> when strict_types is enabled, but the latest version at the time was PHP 5.6.)</p>



<p>After a heated debate on both the Github issue tracker for PHP and the internal mailing lists, the PHP project <a href="https://www.sammyk.me/security-changes-to-the-php-7-csprng-in-rc3">did the right thing</a>: It will throw an Exception if it cannot safely generate random data.</p>



<p>Exceptions are developer-friendly: If you do not catch the exception, it kills the script immediately. If you decide to catch them, you can handle them in whatever graceful way you prefer. (Pretty error pages are often better than a white page and HTTP 500 status code, after all.)</p>







<p>In version 7.2 of the PHP programming language, they also made another win: <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages">Libsodium</a> was promoted as part of <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/libsodium">the PHP standard library</a>.</p>



<p>However, this feature isn’t as good as it could be: It’s easy to mix up inputs to the libsodium API since it expects <code>string</code> arguments instead of dedicated types (<code>X25519SecretKey</code> vs <code>X25519PublicKey</code>). To address this, the open source community has provided <a href="https://dholecrypto.com/">PHP libraries that avoid this mistake</a>.</p>



<p>(I bet you weren’t expecting to hear that PHP is doing better with cryptography than Java in 2021, but here we are!)</p>







<h2>Towards Usable Cryptography Interfaces</h2>



<p>How can we do better? At a minimum, we need to internalize Avi Douglen’s rule of usable security.</p>



<blockquote><p>Security at the expense of usability comes at the expense of security.</p><cite><a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/6116">AviD</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I’d like to propose a set of tenets that cryptography libraries can use to self-evaluate the usability of their own designs and implementations. Keep in mind that these are tenets, not a checklist, so the spirit of the law means more than the literal narrowly-scoped interpretation.</p>



<h3>1. Follow the Principle of Least Astonishment</h3>



<p>Cryptography code should be boring, <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrincipleOfLeastAstonishment">never astonishing</a>. </p>



<p>For example: If you’re comparing cryptographic outputs, it should always be done in constant-time–even if timing leaks do not help attackers (i.e. in password hashing validation).</p>



<h3>2. Provide High-Level Abstractions</h3>



<p>For example: <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes">Sealed boxes</a>.</p>



<p>Most developers don’t need to fiddle with RSA and AES to construct their own hybrid public-key encryption designs (as you’d need to with Java). What they really need is a simple way to say, “Encrypt this so that only the recipient can decrypt it, but not the sender.”</p>



<p>This requires talking to your users and figuring out what their needs are instead of just assuming you know best.</p>



<h3>3. Logically Separate Algorithm Categories</h3>



<p>Put simply: Asymmetric cryptography belongs in a different API than symmetric cryptography. A similar separation should probably exist for specialized algorithms (e.g. multi-party computation and Shamir Secret Sharing).</p>



<p>Java may have got this one horribly wrong, but they’re not alone. The JWE specification (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#page-2">RFC 7518</a>) also allows you to encrypt keys with:</p>



<ul><li>RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding (asymmetric encryption)</li><li>RSA with OAEP padding (asymmetric encryption)</li><li>ECDH (asymmetric key agreement)</li><li>AES-GCM (<strong>symmetric</strong> encryption)</li></ul>



<p>If your users aren’t using a high-level abstraction, at least give them separate APIs for different algorithm types. If nothing else, it saves your users from having to ever type <code>RSA/ECB</code> again.</p>



<p>N.b. this means we should also collectively stop using the simple <code>sign</code> and <code>verify</code> verbs for Symmetric Authentication (i.e. HMAC) when these verbs imply digital signature algorithms (which are inherently asymmetric). Qualified verbs (<code>verify</code> –&gt; <code>sign_verify</code>, <code>mac_verify</code>) are okay here.</p>



<h3>4. Use Type-Safe Interfaces</h3>



<p>If you allow any arbitrary string or byte array to be passed as the key, IV, etc. in your cryptography library, someone will misuse it.</p>



<p>Instead, you should have dedicated {structs, classes, types} (select appropriate) for each different kind of cryptography key your library expects. These keys should also provide guarantees about their contents (i.e. an Aes256GcmKey is always 32 bytes).</p>



<h3>5. Defaults Matter</h3>



<p>If you instantiate a new SymmetricCipher class, its default state should be an authenticated mode; <em>never ECB</em>.</p>



<p>The default settings are the ones that 80% of real world users should be using, if not a higher percentage.</p>



<h3>6. Reduce Cognitive Load</h3>



<p>If you’re encrypting data, why should your users <em>even need to know what a nonce is</em> to use it safely?</p>



<p>You MAY allow an explicit nonce if it makes sense for their application, but if they don’t provide one, generate a random nonce and handle it for them.</p>



<p>Aside: There’s an argument that we should have a standard for <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/issues/138">committing, deterministic authenticated encryption</a>. If you need non-determinism, stick a random 256-bit nonce in the AAD and you get that property too. I liked to call this combination AHEAD (Authenticated Hedged Encryption with Associated Data), in the same vein as <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/03/hedged-signatures-with-libsodium-using-dhole/">Hedged Signatures</a>.</p>



<p>The less choices a user has to make to get their code working correctly, the less likely they’ll accidentally introduce a subtle flaw that makes their application hideously insecure.</p>



<h3>7. Don’t Fail at Failure</h3>



<p>If what you’re doing is sensitive to error oracles (e.g. padding), you have to be very careful about how you fail.</p>



<p>For example: RSA decryption with PKCS#1v1.5 padding. Doing a constant-time swap between the actual plaintext and some random throwaway value so the decryption error can result from the symmetric decryption is better than aborting.</p>



<p>Conversely, if you’re depending on a component to generate randomness for you and it fails, it shouldn’t fail silently and return bad data.</p>



<p>Security is largely about understanding how systems fail, so there’s no one-size-fits-all answer for this. However, the exact failure mechanism for a cryptographic feature should be decided very thoughtfully.</p>



<h3>8. Minimize Runtime Negotiation</h3>



<p>This is more of a concern for applications than libraries, but it bears …</p></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</em></p>

<p>If you read my profile from my high-school yearbook for the class of 2011, you’ll find the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Tom is a man who takes pleasure in doing exactly the opposite of everyone[, such as his] early adoption of Bitcoin, a universal currency more inherently worthless than the Zimbabwean Dollar”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In truth, I didn’t really own any Bitcoin, at least not enough to be meaningful even today. I’d tried mining a bit on my 2006 Macbook, but back then people were giving it away for free in an effort to kick-start the crypto-economy. The focus of the ‘Bitcoin community’ in those days was on building a real, workable currency – in other words, it was yet to become the crypto-Marxist doomsday cult it is in 2021. Certainly lots of the people involved in it had a strong libertarian, anti-Fed ethos, but that was secondary: the sort of things people wanted to buy with bitcoins were pizzas and beer. The early bitcoiner’s idea of bitcoin’s success was it being accepted as legal tender at your local bar.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2021 and that dream is further away than ever. Spending bitcoin is one of the most difficult things you can do. I’m going to be generous and leave aside all of the technical problems around transaction costs, the time it takes for transactions to be added to the blockchain, and other such matters which can probably (or have been) solved.</p>

<p>Let’s examine why I can’t buy a beer with bitcoin today [1]. As of writing (and this will surely become quickly out of date), bitcoin’s market cap has exceeded $1tn. By comparison, there are just under 50 billion Swiss Francs in circulation today, which are worth around $56bn USD. However, despite having under 6% of the market cap of bitcoin, you will find tens of thousands of businesses which will gladly sell you goods and services for your Swiss Franks (they all just happen to be in Switzerland). Why, despite this huge market cap, has bitcoin fundamentally failed to enter our daily lives?</p>

<p>A currency only works when there are enough buyers and sellers on each side. This much is obvious. However, the subtlety that’s lost here is that there have to be buyers and sellers on both sides who are also interested in buying and selling things other than bitcoin! You can find people all over the world who are willing to trade Pokemon cards, even some people willing to pay hard currency, but you can’t build an economy out of them because the people trading Pokemon cards are only interested in trading Pokemon cards for cash, or vice-versa. And in a liquid market, why would a business owner accept Pokemon cards when you can just insist they trade their cards for cash first?</p>

<p>What’s so strange about all of this is that it totally flies in the face of Bitcoin’s original vision. It’s telling that, if you read Satoshi Nakamoto original whitepaper [2], monetary policy, the fed, or currency debasing aren’t even mentioned (the word “currency” appears only once). The original purpose of bitcoin was to solve the very specific problem of transferring value between two parties without the need for an intermediary – the word “transaction” appears 69 times. Not only do people not use bitcoin for goods and services in this way today, they largely don’t even trade cryptocurrencies in this way! Most trades happen on big, centralised platforms, which are vulnerable to government shutdowns, theft, or technical issues.</p>

<p>If this is the case, then what’s the point of owning bitcoin? And why have so many people decided that it’s worth a lot of USD to own bitcoin?</p>

<p>What has happened in the last year or so is that a fringe idea – the idea that the Fed engages in regular debasement of the US dollar, which is the reserve currency of the world – suddenly went mainstream in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. I’m not going to opine too much on the validity of this view – I think it’s basically true, and that all of the risks the bitcoin bulls point out regarding modern monetary policy (lower-case or upper-case) are real and worrisome. Relatedly, when reading Marx, I can nod along with the correct diagnosis of the ills of capitalism. Where he loses me is his belief in the inevitability of a revolution which will bring about a socialist utopia which will usher in a reign of peace and love, and everyone gets a mansion.</p>

<p>This utopian/dystopian binary mindset is the fatal flaw. Communism was the 20th century’s “idea that eats smart people”. More recently it was the Singularity (I highly recommend you read this excellent essay on the subject: [3]). Today it’s bitcoin. What all these three things have in common is that they are the careful, sophisticated, and elegant application of pure reason. Like a well-crafted conspiracy theory, they glide from precept to conclusion along an unbroken chain of impeccable logic [4]. Unfortunately for them is that the world does not fit neatly into Platonic forms of Revolution, Superintelligence or (what I’ve only recently heard referred to as ) “The Flippening”.</p>

<p>“The Flippening” is the idea that hyperinflation of the USD is inevitable and imminent, and that therefore Bitcoin is the One True store of value. By their logic, holding onto any currency is akin to holding onto sand as it runs through your fingers – your hard work which earned it literally turning it to dust as the US government debases the global reserve currency to pay for ever spiralling public services bills, military spending, and bailing out American Big Business. And I basically agree with this – Bitcoin is a good hedge against the US dollar dropping its status as the global reserve currency. With a $1tn market cap, mathematically provably limited supply, and the complete freedom from the clutches of any individual or nation state, what else could it be?</p>

<p>But this is not the only possible outcome. And perhaps, most damning, I don’t even think it’s a very likely outcome.</p>

<p>A general point about investing: if the price of an asset is closely tied to the probability of a particular future event, and you disagree with the probability that the market assigns to it, then in your view that asset is mispriced. It’s hard to measure what the actual probability of an event like The Flippening is, but what isn’t so hard to measure is how pervasive this narrative has suddenly become. The problem with Bitcoin is that, although you can’t just print more of it, you can get Elon Musk to retweet it endlessly. Bitcoin’s price goes up as a function of retweets in a similar way to how the stock market goes up as a function of the Fed printing dollars.</p>

<p>Gamestop should have been the wake-up call. No one bought Gamestop because they thought its stock would become the reserve currency of the future, but perhaps they might as well have done. People were buying and holding GME because other people were buying and holding GME (and because some people were forced to buy GME). Similar to Bitcoin, there was a narrative that started with an observation in early 2020 that GMEs financials weren’t in as bad shape as the market seemed to think, and that the company had a good shot at a turnaround, and morphed into the narrative that big hedge funds had huge short positions which they would be forced to cover if enough retail investors bought the stock. After climbing 1800% in 20 days, it eventually fell back to a pedestrian 4x multiple over its 2020 trading value. The party was over.</p>

<p>What GME demonstrated was the power of the meme in the stock market, and that an asset price could increase its value by over 20x for no fundamental reason. People point to the rising price of bitcoin as evidence of the truth in their narratives, but the reality is that bitcoin could be rising for no reason at all.</p>

<p>Ok, so maybe bitcoin specifically is overpriced – what about other crypto as a hedge against the USD? Imagine a revolutionary new asset class that’s fungible, has a finite supply, and whose supply is decentralised. Actually, this sounds a lot like gold. Is gold all that great? Well, the main benefit that crypto has over gold is that (a) as well as weighing gold you need to verify its purity, which is expensive to do for every transaction; and (b) gold can’t be transmitted over the internet. But if you don’t care about buying stuff, then gold is a pretty good way to store value: you can keep it at home and ‘be your own bank’ (with all the hazards that entails), store it in a safe-deposit box, or just buy some as a paper commodity – the exact same options open to crypto currency traders (with the nice bonus that you can actually get insurance up to certain amounts if you decide to go down the safe-deposit route). If you can’t buy stuff with crypto then there’s really no advantage to it over gold at all.</p>

<p>In summary, there are two reasonable arguments (and one spectacularly bad one) for buying bitcoin/crypto:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The believer</strong>: You believe in the imminent ‘Flippening’ in which you and all your crypto buddies are unimaginably rich in a post-USD economic wasteland</li>
  <li><strong>The hedger</strong>: You don’t necessarily believe in the ‘Flippening’ but are worried about inflation and want an asset which won’t lose value in the future</li>
  <li><strong>The speculator</strong>: Price always goes up [rocket emojis]</li>
</ol>

<p>(1) needs you to buy into a messianic world-view, and, similar to how there are many religions which purport to worship the ‘one true god’, there are many cryptocurrencies which you can own, and many ways the rapture could play out. My non-consensus view is that, like every single other time there is a mass-hysteria that we are approaching the ‘end of history’, history will chug along all the same, fiat currencies and all. (2) seems a bit more reasonable on the face of it, but you can get all of the benefits with almost none of the volatility from buying gold. That leaves (3), to which I can only say, if you can get in while the price is going up and get out before the institutions do, profiting off the ‘true …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>If you imagine your organization as a sea-faring vessel, infosec’s goal is to ensure the boat can survive krakens or canon-wielding pirates and successfully complete its journey. If you ignore the existence of sea terrors, you may not make it to your destination unless Poseidon grants you merciful passage. If you prioritize defense above your vessel’s mission, you will find yourself aboard a battleship that is entirely inadequate for transporting revenue-generating cargo. — <a href="https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/on-yolosec-and-fomosec/">On YOLOsec and FOMOsec</a>, Kelly Shortridge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Startups are all about focusing on the right thing at the right time. Juggling everything through the fog of product development, managing your runway, and growing a team are tough on their own. Unless it’s a primary piece of your product offering<sup>1</sup>, security is rarely prioritized in the early days of a startup. Contemporary startups have the benefit of the accumulation of best practices becoming more commonplace and accessible: appsec best practices get caught in code reviews, infrastructure providers bias toward secure defaults, engineers are accustomed to using things like password managers and MFA apps. However, beyond that, founders in search of product-market-fit do not have the cycles to focus on infosec. It’s a type of technical debt that is accrued while focus is elsewhere.</p>

<p>As your traction begins to grow, paying down technical debt becomes a recurring focus for the team. This typically takes the form of application, infrastructure, and ops related debt. Preventing the CEO from accidentally deleting the production database is a more immediate threat than a targeted attack. Improving your processes to prevent shooting yourself in the foot will pay immediate dividends. Solving your startup’s problems around self-incurred outages and  data loss are more pressing than infosec.</p>

<p>There is no positive benefit when it comes to security — the best outcome you can expect and actually aim to get is a reduction of negative impact.  Your product or customer experience is not directly improved by an increased security posture. However, the amount of downside is unknown and potentially large. This is what will start keeping the founders up at night. Peace of mind. It all changes when there’s now something at stake. Reputation. Customer trust.  Reliability. Anything that’ll erode that hard earned product market fit. Any bad press that’ll reduce the slope of your week over week growth.</p>

<p>This is the right time a startup should start prioritizing infosec.</p>

<p><small><a href="https://avc.com/2012/03/the-startup-curve/">The Startup Curve</a> - Overlayed with paying down tech debt and when to start thinking about infosec</small></p>

<p>For all the fear-mongering related to security that’s out there, even for well-established companies, security’s priority with respect to product can be a tricky thing to pin down. Is it just another sign off like legal review? Was it just bolted on because an enterprise sale necessitated it?  The earlier your startup weaves infosec into the engineering culture, the longer head start you have in paying down security related technical debt. The dividends you get from this yields a resilient engineering organization which treats security as a partner in building the product and not an impediment.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Some other scenarios where security is an early priority for a startup. 1) Product mandated security considerations: it’s in the value prop of the product, mandated by a vendor (i.e. using the GMail API requires an external security audit); 2) Externally mandated security considerations: Government or industry regulatory considerations; product penalties if you are non-formant (i.e. amount of loan origination that can be a penalty if your banking startup is fails external security audits); 3) Customer mandated considerations: AWS GovCloud, SOC2, etc  — it’s forced by the need to acquire specific customers and/or drive sales.</p>

<p>To collect data for this post, I attempted to reset my password on 105 different applications and websites. I don't claim these are perfectly representative of all websites out there; developer-focused SaaS companies (e.g. <a href="https://www.contentful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contentful</a>, <a href="http://newrelic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NewRelic</a>, <a href="http://npm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">npm</a>) are overrepresented because I already had a lot of accounts with them. But I've also included retail websites (e.g. <a href="https://www.rei.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REI</a>, <a href="http://bookshop.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bookshop.org</a>), transportation applications (e.g. <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uber</a>, <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City Bike NYC</a>), utility companies (e.g. <a href="https://www.coned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Con Edison</a>, <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-Mobile</a>) and other industries to widen my perspective. I've included some of the largest presences on the internet (<a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>) as well as some much smaller ones (<a href="https://www.dstld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSTLD</a>, <a href="https://lichess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lichess</a>).</p>
<p>Throughout this post, I include some screenshots of things we at Mailclerk think are great examples of email UX, and some that aren't quite as good. If you're reading this from an organization we critique, please don't take it personally; this is all in pursuit of helping the world send beautiful and usable email! (We'd also <em>love</em> to help you out with your emails. Drop us a line at <a href="mailto:friends@mailclerk.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friends@mailclerk.app</a> 😉).</p>
<p>You can jump to the <a href="#conclusion">end of this post</a> to see our summary of best practices plus the raw data, or <a href="#hall-of-fame">here</a> if you just want to see some excellent examples.</p>
<h2 id="reset-method">Reset Method</h2>
<p>The most common way to let someone into their account when they've forgotten their password is to send them a link with a unique token that allows them to set a new one. We call this the "reset link" method. This is the classic. Since it's so common, you can be fairly sure your users won't need much coaching for this to work. Of the 105 applications we looked at, 83 used this method. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eventbrite</a> is a well-executed, simple example:</p>

<p>But this isn't the only method! Increasingly common is the use of one-time passwords (or <em>OTPs</em>, different from the usage in fanfiction 💕), where people are sent a short code or PIN by email or SMS that they enter into the application. This serves the same basic purpose as reset links: it confirms you still control the email (or phone number) you signed up with.</p>
<p>17 applications sent OTPs by either email or SMS. Four of these (<a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal</a>, <a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyft</a>, <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uber</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lemonade</a>) sent OTPs by text message <em>only</em>, taking them out of the scope of this (email-only) analysis.</p>
<p>It is notable that <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, some of the largest social networks and identify providers, all use the OTP method. Here is how Twitter does it:</p>

<p>A handful of applications made their own path:</p>
<ul>
<li>One application (<a href="https://circleci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CircleCI</a>) <em>only</em> allows access via SSO, which means they can completely sidestep password management.</li>
<li>Another (<a href="https://www.metabase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metabase</a>) doesn't allow password resets at all; people are prompted to ask their admins to reset their passwords for them.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.icloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple/iCloud</a> sends a push notification to one of your Apple devices. If you happen to make a device with the same reach as the iPhone, you should consider this method!</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> sends a new randomly generated password by email that Wikipedians can log in with:</p>

<p>I'm not sure why Wikipedia is going their own way with the reset password methodology here; I suspect this has something to do with the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&amp;returnto=Main+Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emails are not actually required to sign up</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Either a reset link or reset OTP will work. People may be less familiar with the use of OTPs, and so using reset links may generate less friction. However, OTPs may have some slight security benefits over password reset, as indicated by the major identity providers using it.</p>
<h2 id="subject-line">Subject line</h2>
<p>So far in this post we've been referring to "resetting passwords." This phrase, or variants on it, is used in 89% of email subjects we looked at. Some common variations:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
<th>Note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Reset your password</td>
<td>8 emails, all identical</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{{APPLICATION NAME}} password reset</td>
<td>11 emails</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reset your {{APPLICATION NAME}} password</td>
<td>8 emails</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The other common pattern is to call this process "account recovery" or variants on that.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> 6% of subject lines do so. Examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Steam Account Recovery</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Account Recovery - Stack Overflow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mailgun account recovery instructions</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For applications using OTPs, the email subject generally directly reference either the "code" or, less often, the "PIN". Examples:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
<th>Note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Google Verification Code Code</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{{NAME}}, here's your PIN</td>
<td><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>{{OTP CODE}} is your Facebook account recovery code</td>
<td><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> (and <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack</a>) includes the code in the subject</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Finally, here are a few subject lines with a bit more personality:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Subject</th>
<th>Note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>🔑 Password Reset</td>
<td><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duolingo</a>, getting points for being the only email with an emjoi in the subject line</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Your password reset instructions…</td>
<td><a href="https://www.dstld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSTLD</a> feels a little hesitant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ask and you shall receive... a password reset</td>
<td><a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a> has a better handle on the effective use of the ellipsis</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Many emails included the application name in the subject. This is particularly important for applications that don't send with their organization's name tied to the FROM address. Points docked from Shutterfly, APA League, The Economist, Amtrak, and David's Tea for doing neither, making their emails very hard to identify in my inbox:</p>

<p>If you don't have easy control over the "from" names on your application emails, <a href="https://mailclerk.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mailclerk can help with that</a>. 😉</p>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Be very clear in the subject line what the email is for (resetting your password/recovering your account). If it fits your application's tone, consider a small splash of humor. Make sure to include the name of your application as either the sender name or in the subject line.

<p>However, a surprisingly large number of templated emails include URLs in plaintext, instead of or in addition to a button. Of the 66 templated emails in our dataset that use the reset password method, 10 have reset URLs in plaintext instead of a button. The result is often jarring, like this email from <a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilio</a>:</p>

<p>Why do so many emails have plaintext URLs? At the dawn of templated emails, this was a good practice because not all email clients were able parse HTML emails, and so buttons wouldn't have displayed or been clickable. These URLs (and the advice to copy and paste them into a browser) was for their benefit.</p>
<p>Here in 2021, very few (if any) of your customers will be using email clients that can't display HTML emails. For <a href="https://useplaintext.email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those that are</a>, they're best served by your sending plaintext versions of your emails in addition to the styled HTML version, which you should definitely do anyway for deliverability reasons.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> The plaintext version should convert the button to a plaintext URL automatically. Here's what the plaintext version of that minimal Freedom.to email looks like:</p>

<p>We think the main reason this practice persists is people blindly copying other’s email design. Application email rarely gets the attention it deserves. (We are trying to change this!) Pointless email patterns perpetuate via people mimicking existing emails without pausing to think.</p>
<p>If you feel like you <em>must</em> include a plaintext link but still want to use a heavily-styled email template, consider adding the link to the footer of the email. We like how the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a> handles this:</p>

<p>In general though, we don't think it's necessary to include links in plaintext or instructions to copy URLs into a web browser.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> If you're sending email using a styled HTML template, use a button instead of a URL for password reset CTAs. Plaintext URLs are okay in minimally styled templates. Always make sure to provide a plaintext alternative to HTML.</p>
<h2 id="expiration-time">Expiration Time</h2>
<p>With both the reset password and OTP methods, it is imporant to make links and OTPs expire after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Otherwise, passwords could be changed long after they were sent, perhaps after the account in question was transferred to someone else (and the associated email changed) or perhaps if someone screenshot the emails in question and put them into a blog post.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Just because you make your links expire doesn't mean you need to tell people they do in the email though. 62% of the applications we looked at don't specify an expiration date in reset password emails. We expect that the vast majority of these companies do in fact implement links and code expiration. They just think it is distracting or unnecessary to draw attention to the expiration.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> splits the difference, coyly telling you the link will expire at some point but not telling you when:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In this post, we will discuss the following:</p><ol><li>The historical advantages and disadvantages to on-prem software deployments.</li><li>The ways Kubernetes makes it easier to deploy software to on-prem customer environments.</li><li>The remaining challenges with on-prem deployments that Kubernetes does not currently solve.</li></ol><p>On-prem software deployments have gotten a bad rap, at least from the perspective of the vendors that build and support such software. This reputation has been largely justified. In comparison to their cloud-hosted/SaaS counterparts, on-prem products are generally much more difficult to deploy, manage, and maintain. That being said, there are strong benefits to on-prem deployments, or else no one would bother (more on those later).</p><p>Enter Kubernetes. Kubernetes has dramatically shifted the tradeoffs of on-prem versus SaaS deployments. Thanks to the rich abstractions that Kubernetes provides, deploying a software product to a customer's on-prem environment can be significantly easier than before. Because Kubernetes has achieved such <a href="https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high market penetration</a> (and still growing), it is now a viable target environment for many B2B software products.</p><p>In response to this shift, companies such as <a href="https://www.okera.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okera</a>, <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sourcegraph</a> (self-hosted offering), and <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixie Labs have</a> decided to deploy their products directly on customers' Kubernetes clusters, rather than in a hosted cloud/SaaS environment. At Pixie Labs, we predict that more B2B tools will move to support deploying on-prem to their customers' Kubernetes clusters, a mirror of the most recent shift where many applications moved from on-prem to SaaS.</p><h2>What is on-prem?</h2><p>First, let's quickly define "on-prem" because that can mean different things to different people. Some people define "on-prem" to be running on a bare metal server environment, with machines managed by the customer themselves. We take a broader definition, where "on-prem" refers to deploying directly on the customer's servers, wherever they may be.
As long as it is running directly on a customer's environment rather than a hosted cloud, this includes all of the following:</p><ul><li>Bare metal servers (including air-gapped without external network connection)</li><li>Virtual private cloud</li><li>Managed cloud environment (such as ECS, GKE/AKS/EKS, etc)</li></ul><h2>Which applications should be considered for on-prem?</h2><p>Not all applications make sense to run on-prem in the first place. Some applications can live entirely in a vendor's hosted cloud and don't need to interact with a customer environment, such as a customer relationship management (CRM) product like Salesforce or JIRA. However, other types of applications may have heavy dependencies on the customer environment. For example, a log analytics tool will likely need to read a lot of data from a customer's production system. These types of tools are more likely to be a fit for an on-prem deployment. There are also business model reasons that will affect the decision, which are touched on below. However, the major emphasis is placed on the technical landscape shifts created by Kubernetes.</p><h2>Pros and cons of on-prem (summary)</h2><p>The table below summarizes the pros/cons we have historically seen for on-prem deployments. Each item gets more detail in the next section.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Pros</th><th scope="col">Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Customer data privacy (data remains in their environment)</td><td>Heterogeneous customer environments create higher technical complexity</td></tr><tr><td>Customer pays hosting costs (enables shipping "free" software)</td><td>Limited vendor visibility into bugs, crashes, and other problems</td></tr><tr><td>Support for more environments, such as air-gapped environments in finance/government</td><td>Vendor does not control deployed version</td></tr><tr><td>Lower network utilization (no need to export customer data to a remote cloud)</td><td>Orchestration and self-healing logic must be built out</td></tr><tr><td>Increased customer control over system</td><td>Resource utilization of system must be carefully managed</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Advantages of on-prem</h2><p>There are five major advantages to on-prem software deployments that we would like to highlight in this post.</p><h3>🟢 Customer data privacy</h3><p>Customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to their private data being shipped to remote clouds that they don't control. For certain types of highly sensitive data (logs, user information, etc), it can be tough to impossible to convince customers to take the risk of exporting that data outside their system.</p><h3>🟢 Customer pays hosting costs</h3><p>When an application runs on-prem and stores customer data on-prem, the software vendor doesn't need to pass on the hosting costs to the end user and can offer a free or cheaper plan than SaaS competitors. This is nearly mandatory for open source solutions, which can't afford to pay to host their entire user base.</p><h3>🟢 Support for more customer environments</h3><p>Many customer environments, especially in fields like finance or government, are air gapped (no external network connection). It isn't possible to connect those environments to a vendor's remote cloud so products requiring such a connection are dead on arrival from a sales perspective.</p><h3>🟢 Lower network utilization</h3><p>SaaS applications often ingest significant amounts of data from their customer's production environment. Exporting large amounts of data to a remote SaaS environment can put a significant burden on the network resources of the customer's production system.</p><h3>🟢 Increased customer control over the system</h3><p>Many customers strongly prefer the ability to control the applications that they purchase, and are frustrated when there is downtime of SaaS applications which they can't fix. When a product deploys on-prem, the customer has the ability to have much greater control over the system and address issues as they arise, rather than being at the mercy of the vendor.</p><h2>Historical disadvantages of on-prem</h2><p>Though there are significant advantages to on-prem deployments, they've come at a significant cost in the past, hence the shift to SaaS in many applications. Let's review some of the challenges of on-prem deployments, pre-Kubernetes.</p><h3>🔴 Heterogeneous customer environments create higher technical complexity</h3><p>When customer environments vary significantly, multiple parallel code paths must be built out for flows such as deployment, scale-up, updates, and error management. For example, binaries must be created for many different operating systems and environments. Additionally, there might be different network policies in a cluster, different resource amounts, and different endpoints/addresses for each of the nodes.</p><h3>🔴 Limited vendor visibility into bugs, crashes, and other problems</h3><p>In a SaaS offering, the vendor has easy access to logs, errors, crashes, etc, since they control the system. In a customer environment that vendor may have no idea that a problem is occuring in the first place. Usually, the customer must discover the problem for themselves and manually restart the system.</p><h3>🔴 Vendor does not control deployed version</h3><p>Many on-prem customers resist updating because "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". Since updating is usually controlled by the customer, vendors need to support a large number of versions of their product at any given time. In contrast, with SaaS, the vendor can control the running version to a small number of versions, or even a single version</p><h3>🔴 Orchestration and self-healing logic must be built out</h3><p>It's one thing to build a set of binaries for your application for each target OS that you want to support. It's another task altogether to deploy those binaries to many different customer nodes, and support new nodes coming online, old nodes disappearing, and fault tolerance in the case that the application encounters an error. Investing in this logic can eat up a large amount of the development budget, away from features, bug fixes, and other higher priority items.</p><h3>🔴 Resource utilization of product must be carefully managed</h3><p>Resource-intensive applications that need a lot of CPU or memory can impose a significant burden on their host system. Many of us have seen supposedly "lightweight" agents using 50% of CPU or memory on our production clusters, so resource utilization must be carefully managed, especially in sensitive environments.</p><p>Kubernetes provides a powerful and rich set of abstractions across highly diverse customer environments. As a result, it is now significantly easier for developers to deploy their products on-prem directly on a customer Kubernetes cluster. Thanks to the high adoption of Kubernetes, this is a very large section of the market, which is likely to continue to increase for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Let's dive into how Kubernetes mitigates some of the above "cons" when deploying software on-prem to a customer.</p><h2>Deployment and Orchestration</h2><h3>Containerization</h3><p>Kubernetes allows the user to create a single binary packaged inside a container. This container can be run on a variety of operating systems or environments. This benefit is offered by any container-based system, but it's still worth noting.</p><h3>Orchestration and self-healing</h3><p>Previously, the vendor would build logic to deploy their product to every relevant customer node in the system. This would involve scaling up the deployment when nodes came online or went away.</p><p>Kubernetes provides a declarative, config-based solution for any system to do the following:</p><ul><li>Deploy to every node</li><li>Deploy to specific nodes</li><li>Update deployments when new nodes come online or go away</li></ul><p>Rather than building out the complex logic to perform these tasks, the vendor only needs to create a YAML or JSON config. This is a win for the customer too, who only needs to apply that config file to their cluster.</p><p>Kubernetes also comes with self-healing and scaling logic, built in to configs as well.</p><ul><li>Crash handling</li><li>Restarts</li><li>Autoscaling of services based on load</li></ul><p>While it was certainly possible to build out support for all of these cases in the past, it would be a significant investment. Reducing it to a system-agnostic YAML/JSON config file greatly reduces the barrier to building scalable, fault-tolerant on-prem products. Previously, supporting all of the above wouldn't just be done one time, but many times depending on the operating …</p></div></div></div></div>

Two MPs&nbsp;formally abstained.</p>  <p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and almost all of his cabinet colleagues were absent for the vote.&nbsp;Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau&nbsp;was the only cabinet minister present. When it was his turn, he said he abstained "on behalf of the Government of Canada."&nbsp;</p>  <p>The motion also calls on the government to lobby the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympic Games out of Beijing.</p>  <p>It was passed over the strenuous objections of&nbsp;Chinese Ambassador to Canada&nbsp;Cong Peiwu, who denounced the vote as&nbsp;meddling in China's internal affairs.</p>    <p>China also condemned&nbsp;the motion. At a briefing in Beijing Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China has lodged stern representations with Canada.</p>  <p>After the vote,&nbsp;Garneau issued a statement saying the federal government remains "deeply disturbed by horrific reports of human rights violations in&nbsp;Xinjiang,&nbsp;including the use of arbitrary detention, political re-education, forced labour, torture and forced sterilization.</p>  <p>"The government of Canada will continue to work with international partners to defend vulnerable minorities and we once again repeat our call for transparency and a credible international investigation in response to allegations of genocide.</p>  <p>"This investigation must be conducted by an international and independent body so that impartial experts can observe and report on the situation first-hand."</p>  <h2>'Stop spreading disinformation,' says China</h2>  <p>Media reports and academic and UN experts have accused China of imprisoning Uighurs in concentration and "deradicalization" camps and targeting them for&nbsp;forced labour, sexual violence, population control methods and sweeping surveillance. China's foreign ministry has denied the accusations.</p>  <p>The motion calls on the government to officially adopt the position that China is engaged in genocide, and to coordinate a response with the U.S. and other allies.</p>  <p>While it's not&nbsp;clear what impact —&nbsp;if any —&nbsp;the non-binding resolution will have on the Liberal government's approach to China, it threatens to inflame relations between the two countries at a time when they're already tense due to the arrest of Huawei&nbsp;chief financial officer&nbsp;Meng Wanzhou by Canadian authorities more than&nbsp;two years ago, and China's subsequent imprisonment of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.</p>  <p>In a statement posted to the Chinese embassy's website prior to the vote, Cong insisted the reports of Uighur persecution&nbsp;are based on lies.</p>  <p>"A few people in Canada and some other western countries are talking about upholding values, but one important part of the values should be: respect facts and stop spreading disinformation and even lies," Cong said in the statement.</p>  <p>"We urge the Canadian side to take seriously China's solemn position … so as not to cause further damages to China-Canada relations."</p>  <h2>'A time for moral clarity'</h2>  <p>At a press conference this morning, Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said the evidence of China's crimes is overwhelming.

The problem was that each time they had an idea for a new recommendation based on a metric already in the database (like the 50% decrease in HRV), they’d have to ask Arun and Lucas to add it instead of doing it themselves. </p><p>Our DevOps team realized that as Point grows, it’d be essential for them to update and add content independently using a CMS. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Enter <a href="http://forestadmin.com/"><strong>Forest Admin</strong></a>. <br></p><h3 id="creating-new-content-seamlessly"><strong>Creating new content seamlessly &nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>We chose Forest Admin to create Point’s admin panel, where the Point team can now create new user-facing content at any time. Forest Admin was the perfect choice for a few reasons: <br></p><ol><li><strong>Seamless integration:</strong> Forest Admin runs into Point’s servers and databases to collect and store information using the infrastructure we already built, so there’s no need to set up a separate database, server, or API. The Point team can write new content in the Forest Admin panel and connect it to the data and insights already stored in their servers. <br></li></ol><p><em>“We have a product offering that’s rooted in biometric health data, digital content, and data science, yet we’re an early-stage startup that also needs to experiment and iterate quickly. Forest Admin’s CMS allows us to do that because of how seamlessly it integrates with our core architecture.”</em></p><div><p><strong>–Kingsley McGowan, CEO of Point</strong></p></div><p><strong>2. <strong><strong>Quality performance: </strong></strong></strong>Since both the database and CMS are handled internally, the latency involved in connecting the two is dramatically reduced, and content updates and additions can be made quickly. The admin panel’s flexible, customizable features make it intuitive and straightforward to use. &nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>3. <strong><strong>Security: </strong></strong></strong>With both the CMS and database servers managed internally by our DevOps team, we can ensure that users’ personal health data remains secure. It doesn’t need to be sent around to third parties. <br></p><figure><img src="https://ae.studio/blog/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-7.19.18-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://ae.studio/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-7.19.18-PM.png 600w, https://ae.studio/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-7.19.18-PM.png 1000w, https://ae.studio/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-7.19.18-PM.png 1600w, https://ae.studio/blog/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-7.19.18-PM.png 2240w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Forest Admin's simple API makes it easy to create &amp; update content</figcaption></figure><p><em>“The UI/UX within Forest Admin allows us to iterate on copy and content while ensuring that if we have any changes, everyone on the team is empowered to do so. If I had to do anything differently, it would be to use Forest Admin sooner.”</em><br></p><h3 id="expanding-possibilities"><strong>Expanding possibilities</strong></h3><p>Forest Admin helped us build a customizable and flexible platform for the Point team to write and serve recommendations to end-users. The platform also complies with our development team’s initial constraints around architecting the recommendation engine.</p><p>But it’s not limited to that. Point can use this same structure to abstract several messaging and marketing strategies.</p><p>Right now, Point’s content exists within its app, but Forest Admin’s flexible admin API could eventually help Point leverage push notifications, SMS, emails, and other forms of messaging to bring customized content to users outside of the app.</p><p>Instead of traditional calls-to-action that rely on buttons and URLs, the team is also considering incorporating additional media components like video streams, podcasts, webinars, and more using Forest Admin.</p><p>We’re excited to see how Point grows and helps people make sense of their health data!</p><p><em>We'd love to jump on a call with you to explore how AE Studio and Forest Admin can drive your business and make you generally happier about things. 😀</em></p><p><em>Book some time <a href="https://calendly.com/jevanfox/ae-studio-forest-admin" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for a deep dive into Forest Admin’s awesome solutions, or just a brief ‘hi, hello, how are you?’ call.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-6264">
		<div>
		
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://amycastor.com/2021/02/23/tether-bitfinex-to-pay-18-5m-to-nyag-cease-trading-in-new-york/">quick article</a> this morning about the New York attorney general settlement, wherein Bitfinex and Tether agreed to pay $18.5 million in penalties, stop servicing New York customers, and submit quarterly transparency reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there are more details to highlight. Namely, the <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf">settlement agreement</a> reveals the games Bitfinex and Tether have played over the years—games they will keep on playing until someone puts an end to their shenanigans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also reveals how the firms have long misled the public about Tether’s reserves. From 2014 until late February 2019, Tether advertised that tethers were fully backed 1:1 by cash in some bank accounts somewhere—but that was not true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tether now has 34 billion tethers in circulation—a number that is growing by leaps and bounds every day. </p>



<p>Here are my random thoughts and notes from the 17-page agreement. </p>



<h2>Phil Potter</h2>



<p>In the agreement, the office of the NY attorney general writes: “During the time period relevant to the OAG’s investigation, and as late as early-to-mid 2018, one of Bitfinex and Tether’s senior executives lived in, and conducted his work from, New York.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m assuming this is Phil Potter, Bitfinex and Tether’s chief strategy officer, and one of its three top execs. Potter allegedly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/chief-strategy-officer-of-bitfinex-and-tether-resigns/">stepped away</a> from the company in mid-2018, about the time the NY attorney general started its investigation. Though the public did not learn of the investigation until <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/04/26/new-york-attorney-general-bitfinex-is-hiding-850-million-in-losses/">April 2019.</a></p>



<p>The fact that Bitfinex and Tether had one executive and large customers in the state—and no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLicense">BitLicense</a>—opened the door to the NY attorney general’s probe. Per the terms of the settlement, Bitfinex and Tether can no longer do any business in the state, which means New York crypto firms can no longer use tethers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, although Bitfinex and Tether claim to have barred New York residents (retail investors) in January 2017, they still served <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eligible_contract_participant.asp">eligible contract participants,</a> meaning individuals or trading firms with assets in the millions. </p>



<h2>Commingled funds</h2>



<p>Tether and Bitfinex lost their banking in March 2017 when they were cut off by Wells Fargo, a correspondent bank. Subsequently, their banks in Taiwan also dumped them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two months later, when Tether had 108 million tethers in circulation, Bitfinex opened an account at Noble Bank in Puerto Rico. (Noble Bank, by the way, was co-founded by Brock Pierce, the child star who also created Tether.)</p>



<p>Tether, however, did not open an account at Noble—or at any bank—until September 2017, according to the office of the NY attorney general’s findings.  </p>



<p>Instead, Tether deposited the “vast majority” of its cash into a trust account held by its general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, at the Bank of Montreal in Canada. The account never held more than $61.5 million dollars. </p>



<p>The rest of Tether’s money was mixed in with Bitfinex customer money at Bitfinex accounts at Noble Bank. Between June 1 and September 2017—Bitfinex held hundreds of millions of dollars in Tether’s funds in its accounts, the prosecutor said. </p>



<p>Commingling of funds is a terrible idea—legally and logistically. (Failed crypto exchange QuadrigaCX also commingled funds. And its now-allegedly-deceased CEO used customer money like his own personal slush fund.)&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Mystery NY trading firm</h2>



<p>Because Tether had no bank account between March and September 2017, it could not directly take money for tethers. At the same time, according to the NY attorney general, “neither the Tether website or Bitfinex allowed for the direct purchase or exchange of tethers in exchange for any other virtual currency, including the two most popular virtual currencies, bitcoin and ether.”  </p>



<p>Between June and September 2017, “Bitfinex’s Noble Bank account received USD deposits from only two institutional trading firms, one of which was located in New York. Neither of those firms purchased tethers directly from Bitfinex or Tether during this time period.”</p>



<p>This part of the NY attorney general’s findings puzzles. Why were these trading firms sending money to Bitfinex if they were not getting tethers in exchange? What were they getting instead?&nbsp;And who was the New York firm?</p>



<p>Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is based in New York. And we know it was onboarding as a Bitfinex customer in October 2018, based on court documents that point to <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=neWR7TrbmgYhmz/mrk7drA==">letters</a> Galaxy sent to Bitfinex. But it is not clear if Galaxy was a customer of Bitfinex or Tether in 2017. (In April 2019, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190709094915if_/https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1121761199547457536">Novogratz claimed</a> Galaxy had “zero exposure” to Bitfinex and Tether.)</p>



<h2>Staging the Friedman audit</h2>



<p>According to the office of the NY attorney general, until September 15, 2017, the only U.S. dollars held by Tether backing 442 million tethers in circulation was $61 million at the Bank of Montreal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever other money Tether had was held in Bitfinex accounts. </p>



<p>In the summer of 2017, rumors were afoot that tethers were not fully backed. To quash those rumors, Tether and Bitfinex arranged for accounting firm Friedman LLP to perform an <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf">attestation</a> on September 15, 2017. </p>



<p>They had to move quickly to set things up though. </p>



<p>On that morning, Tether opened an account at Noble Bank. And Bitfinex transferred $382 million from Bitfinex’s account at Noble Bank into Tether’s account at Noble Bank. Friedman conducted its verification of Tether’s assets that evening. </p>



<p>“No one reviewing Tether’s representations would have reasonably understood that the $382,064,782 listed as cash reserves for tethers had only been placed in Tether’s account as of the very morning that Friedman verified the bank balance,” the NY attorney general wrote. The attestation included the money at the Bank of Montreal as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Friedman’s relationship with Bitfinex <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-confirms-relationship-auditor-dissolved">ended a few months later.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s never a good sign when your auditor quits. Worse, there was no official announcement—Friedman simply&nbsp;<a href="https://www.friedmanllp.com/search-results/#/?query=bitfinex">deleted all mention</a>&nbsp;of Bitfinex from its website, including past press releases.</p>



<h2>Massive loss of funds</h2>



<p>In 2017 and 2018, Bitfinex began to increasingly rely on Crypto Capital to handle its customer deposits and withdrawals. Oz Yosef, was Bitfinex’s contact at the Panamanian payment processor.</p>



<p>By 2018, Crypto Capital held over $1 billion of Bitfinex funds.&nbsp;That’s when the real trouble started.</p>



<p>In April 2018, the government of Poland froze a Crypto Capital bank account holding $340 million. Adding to that, Oz told Bitfinex that a Crypto Capital account in Portugal containing $150 million of Bitfinex client funds also had been frozen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These events threw Bitfinex into a liquidity crisis. And in the summer of 2018, Bitfinex began dipping into Tether’s cash reserves to fund customer withdrawals. Bitfinex told customers that rumors of its insolvency were false, but behind the scenes, the crypto exchange was pleading with Oz to release the money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Later we learn that another $350 million in missing Crypto Capital funds were linked to <a href="https://decrypt.co/40020/suspect-in-bitfinex-case-held-accounts-at-a-dozen-of-the-worlds-top-banks">60 accounts</a> held by Arizona businessman Reginald Fowler, who was indicted in April 2019 for bank fraud. Some of these accounts were frozen in 2018. Oz’s sister, Ravid Yosef, was also indicted for her role in assisting Fowler set up those accounts. She is still at large.) </p>



<p>(And in October 2019, Crypto Capital President Molina Lee was <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/44591/ceo-of-crypto-capital-arrested-in-alleged-money-laundering-operation">arrested by Polish authorities</a> in connection with laundering money for Columbian drug cartels via Bitfinex.)</p>



<h2>Deltec Bank &amp; Trust</h2>



<p>In October 2018, Bitfinex and Tether ended their relationship with Noble bank. Soon after, they announced they were banking with Deltec in the Bahamas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tether-Letter.pdf">letter</a> dated Nov. 1, 2018, Deltec said Tether’s account held $1.8 billion, enough to back the tethers in circulation at the time. The letter was signed but had no name under the signature.&nbsp;The signature itself was illegible. </p>



<p>The following day, Tether began moving hundreds of millions of dollars out of its bank account at Deltec to Bitfinex’s bank account at Deltec. And as part of a “loan arrangement,” between the two closely related firms, Tether assumed Bitfinex’s losses on its own balance sheet. (We can’t be sure of the total loan amount, but an estimate is $750 million.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tether’s misrepresentation that tethers were fully backed continued to Feb. 2019 when it updated its <a href="https://tether.to/legal/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=7668a26d4d01f6c71aa2a4e2386841f2e201f35b-1610342909-0-AY_w4JoCzqaSyoOGw55agsM3ipnbJEMQqOZXufVTDhfHyDJgPtqJMrB15TqMqiVpiH4fi3cHl8TF038Xyhhx-IrJzDFGLw0KEdRAkQIFlwbDu4u8pXptiipGJ6EU4g5fZ-WV_HpN5AqYabrPiCmsz1B5m4BG4fXUt3aibkmFaxtvodop17vaeJ3QjQ3szVNn6AbuPHV02Rxjjan_wMUoCwiNvehow9kb1BvElZjTD8t44E7C-oRdICUfQZ_Mc0RZ1Q-D9Thlmz3DmF6-fs07YB8nmVP_BVvqy3ko5OVQ_Mz4CV1THXyqhq5R8jf41iBg7Q">terms of service</a>&nbsp;to say that tethers are backed by “traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.”</p>



<p>Bitfinex says it <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/600">paid off the loan</a> to Tether in January, and <a href="https://amycastor.com/2021/01/10/tethers-paolo-ardoino-stuart-hoegner-do-a-podcast-transcript-and-comments/">the firms now claim tethers are fully backed</a>—but the question is, backed by what? Loans? Bitcoins? We’ll find out in 90 days when Tether and Bitfinex publish their first transparency report. Per the terms of the settlement agreement, the firms will need to publish these reports quarterly for two years. </p>



<p>Also, $18.5 million—the amount of the settlement—is no small number.&nbsp;We have no idea how much cash Tether and Bitfinex actually have on hand. </p>



<p>The bitcoin community is calling the settlement a win for Tether and Bitfinex. They say the fine is nothing but a slap on the wrist. In reality, it’s another way for Tether and Bitfinex to buy time. The NY attorney general has set its trap; now we wait.</p>



<p><em>Updated Feb. 24 to note that Novogratz claimed zero exposure to Bitfinex and Tether in 2019. </em></p>

February 24, 2021 | https://kerkour.com/blog/rust-for-web-development-2-years-later | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kerkour.com/blog/rust-for-web-development-2-years-later">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I started developing web services (JSON APIs) in Rust a little bit more than 2 years ago, so I thought it was time to shake the preconceived ideas and share what I’ve learned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m writing a book  (available in early access) about Rust where I share everything I’ve learned and more. Here is a <a href="https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG">coupon to save 10€ on the book</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-prejudices">The prejudices</h2>
<p><strong>Rust code is ugly</strong>: Rust is explicit. Undeniably. But when I write code, my IDE helps me a lot, and I don’t have to press that many keys. When I read code, this explicitness is just awesome! No hidden surprises, no weird things.</p>
<p><strong>Memory management is a distraction</strong>: Actually, no. I don’t use that many lexical lifetimes and use instead smart pointers. So yes, I have to understand the differences between a <code>Box</code>, an <code>Rc</code> and an <code>Arc</code>, but my productivity is not impacted compared to Node.JS or Go.</p>
<p><strong>Compiler is a pain in the a</strong>**: At the beginning, yes. But after a few months, I was able to understand all the errors instantly and fix them in a blink. Today I really don’t spend much time fighting with the compiler. Instead, it became my best friend, especially when refactoring large portions of code or upgrading dependencies :)</p>
<p><strong>Slow compile times</strong>: I accord you this one. When in Node.JS or Go a medium-sized service’s Docker image takes 3 to 10 mins to build and deploy, in Rust it will be about 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>The ecosystem is not there</strong>: Yet. Yes, some pieces are missing, such as official Stripe and AWS SDKs, but the community is really active and built all these missing pieces.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-things-i-particularly-appreciate">A few things I particularly appreciate</h2>
<p><strong>Static linking is remarkably easy</strong>: Creating <a href="https://github.com/skerkour/bloom/blob/main/Dockerfile">small Docker images</a> is a delight.</p>
<p><strong>Rust will make you a better programmer</strong>: Rust is complicated and won’t leave you alone if you don’t understand how it works in detail. It takes time and patience to master, but once you do, you’ll have learned so many things that you’ll never approach programming as before. I understood how Go’s runtime works while learning how <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">tokio</a> works.</p>
<p><strong>Once it compiles, it works</strong> (usually): This is my favorite thing about Rust. When my program compiles, it works as I planned. Just remember not to block the event loop, and the compiler will take care of the rest. You no longer have to spend time writing tests for the quirks of the language.</p>
<p><strong>Rust is productive</strong>: Because Rust is multi-paradigm, it really shines when writing complex business logic, thanks to its functional aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Crates I use</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/actix/actix-web">actix-web</a> for the HTTP layer.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx">sqlx</a> for the database (PostgreSQL).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto">rusoto</a> to interface with AWS services for storage (S3), background jobs (SQS) and sending emails (SES).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Keats/tera">tera</a> for email templates.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror">thiserror</a> for my error types.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust">sentry</a> for error monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rust is a real pleasure to use for web development, and I thoroughly recommend to give it a try.</p>
<!-- It is so versatile that, without a doubt, it's the last programming language I learn. Ever. -->
<p>It’s a <ins>loooong</ins> journey to become effective, but totally worth it, and even if you don’t use it every day, you’ll for sure become a better programmer by learning it and, if lost, rediscover the joy of programming 🤗</p>
<p>In a word: Rust brings calm. No more bad surprises at 3 A.M. No more bugs because a dependency updated its API. No more annoying configuration for auto-scaling or whatever. And welcome response times so small that your users will fall in love with your product.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more from real-world Rust experience, I’m writing a book (available in early access) where, among other things, we will create and deploy HTTP services in Rust. Here is a coupon to save 10€ on the book: <a href="https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG">https://academy.kerkour.com/black-hat-rust?coupon=BLOG</a></p>

                        <blockquote>"Young men should prove theorems, old men should write books."</blockquote>
                        <p>- G.H. Hardy</p>
                        <h4>Why I wrote a book?</h4>
                        <p>During my graduate studies, I have been enthralled with how books often stay relevant and how quickly papers sink into obscurity. I wanted to write something that had value and durability. Why a book? Because books can last. </p>
                        <p>I am not old, but I wanted to take a break from theorem proving to write something light-hearted and decidedly non-academic.</p>
                        <h4>Why this book?</h4>
                        <p>My background is in mathematics, theoretical computer science, and machine learning. However, I got started down this path because of my love for data. Data can tell some pretty incredible stories, but it also can be extremely misleading. There are scores of introductory books about data science that start with Aggregation and finish with $z \sim N(0,1)$. They are designed for a technical audience and are often SO boring.</p>
                        <p>Don't get me wrong, I love these books. I helped with the recently released 2nd edition of Kevin Murphy's famed Machine Learning a Probabilistic Perspective. But I wanted my book to be more inspiration and less perspiration.</p>
                        <h4>Who is it for?</h4>
                        <p>This book is for people as untechnical as my Mom or as technical as my Applied Scientist friends working in big tech. The book is a nice, fun, and inspirational collection of stories.</p>
                        <p>These stories about data should get you thinking about your own life. I hope you ask if there are ways you can collect interesting data and learn something about yourself.</p>
                        <h4>So what's in the book?</h4>
                        <p><img src="https://andrewnc.github.io/blog/blog_files/toc.png"></p><p>It is 114 pages long with 8 chapters. The chapters cover a wide range of fun data topics like how to use language models (and word vectors) to improve your resume, or how a man used statistics to qualify for the Olympics. As a fun warm up, chapter 2 shows how to use A/B testing to make the perfect glass of lemonade.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://andrewnc.github.io/blog/blog_files/a:b_out_routing1.png"></p><p>It starts with naive A/B testing then moves to Thompson sampling as a solution to Multi-Armed Bandit problems which are significantly more efficient and only takes a few lines of extra code.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://andrewnc.github.io/blog/blog_files/a:b_bandit1.png"></p><p>Chapter 3 talks about how a man keeping track of his personal health markers detected colon cancer and was able to get life saving treatment just in time. It gives a good example of how to reason about yourself vs the popluation. </p>
                        <p>Further on I analyze our dog's potty habits, weight loss using differential equations, and how you can figure out who is carrying your phone just using on-board accelerometer data.</p>
                        <p>The book has fun illustrations and nice color coded explanations for equations</p>
                        <p><img src="https://andrewnc.github.io/blog/blog_files/Odebirds.png"><img src="https://andrewnc.github.io/blog/blog_files/cosine.png">
                        </p>
                        <p>I've gotten some nice feedback so far, with people saying things like "This is the book I wish I had written", or "I literally have 3 new ideas of how I'm going to use my daily data". Plus, my Mom liked it, so that has to count for something.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the day, I wrote this book to inspire and encourage people to be aware of their lives, be mindful of what is happening around them, and take control with the techniques often used in data science.</p>

                        <p>If any of this sounds interesting, you're welcome to buy a copy for yourself. I tried to make the PDF version affordable so it is accessible to everyone.</p>

February 24, 2021 | https://www.twingate.com/blog/introducing-identity-first-networking/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.twingate.com/blog/introducing-identity-first-networking/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>If there's anything we've learned since we <a href="https://www.twingate.com/blog/introducing-twingate">founded Twingate</a>, it's that companies jump through extraordinary hoops to grant, manage, and secure access to their networks. Whether it's whitelisting ever-changing IP addresses; maintaining complex subnet assignments and VLAN segments; or manually piecing together network events across hybrid networks, these heroic tasks all have something in common: making up for the shortcomings of TCP/IP.</p><p>Where open, trusted access made sense at the inception of computer networking almost 50 years ago, the exact opposite is true today. Trust can no longer be assumed based on being physically hardwired to a network, and devices may have multiple IP addresses and hop across many networks in a single day. New layers of authentication, anomaly detection, and monitoring are continually being added to every layer of the network stack, but these approaches do not address the foundational shortcomings.</p><p>Twingate turns this model on its head by rethinking these base assumptions around networking. Rather than attempting to filter every network session looking for anomalies or performing additional checks on every network connection that arrives at a destination, Twingate starts by asking a simple question: should a network request even be allowed to leave a device? And if so, whose identity should be attached to it?</p><p>Once you start to think about every connection on your network as <em>requiring</em> an identity that just <em>happens</em> to have a source IP address, it makes setting parameters and understanding network activity a lot easier. Because network connections are never allowed to enter your network without an identity attached to an explicit authorization, there is no longer any question of who a network connection belongs to and why it was authorized.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.twingate.com/customers/">customers</a> have been thrilled with the experience of throwing out their clunky VPN and replacing it with Twingate's new approach to managing network access, which we call <strong>Identity-First Networking</strong>. Today we're proud to announce the launch of this foundational approach with the following new product features and partnerships.</p><p><h3>Major identity provider support &amp; SCIM-based synchronization</h3></p><figure><div></div></figure><blockquote><em>Twingate is pushing the boundaries of security and usability in the world of Zero Trust. They have created a product that starts with identity at the center. OneLogin is proud to partner with Twingate to bring Identity-First Network security to the most demanding and innovative companies in the world.<br>— Chelsea Wadsworth, Director of Global Alliances, OneLogin</em></blockquote><p>Modern organizations—with a myriad of applications used by a distributed workforce—depend on centralizing user identity to ease management and improve security. Given the benefits, user identity as a primitive has been applied across virtually every application that enterprises use today, but the network layer has been left behind.</p><p>Twingate enables the benefits of identity at the network transport level (any TCP or UDP connection), allowing our customers to unify both network and application access centrally. Now every resource on your network—including databases, servers, k8s clusters, etc.—that are typically very difficult (if not impossible!) to integrate with your identity provider natively can be managed in one place. If a user is not entitled to access a network destination, their traffic will never traverse your network.</p><p>User authentication is only part of the story. Equally important is ensuring that user lifecycle state and applicable group membership is synchronized promptly and accurately. Twingate supports SCIM for user and group synchronization, extending automatic onboarding and offboarding to every resource on your network. Twingate integrates with the major identity providers including Okta, OneLogin, Google Workspace, and Microsoft Azure AD.</p><p><h3>Universal Two-Factor Authentication</h3></p><figure><div></div></figure><p>Today we're launching <strong>native two-factor authentication</strong> to our Business and Enterprise customers, which will allow more fine-grained controls independent of your chosen identity provider and independent of the destination. We call this experience <strong>Universal 2FA</strong> because it can be applied to any type of resource with zero application changes.</p><p>One of the "wow" moments for our customers is using Twingate's Universal 2FA to apply discretionary security levels to resources according to their sensitivity. For example, admins can ensure that users with production network SSH access are subject to an additional 2FA challenge. The lack of application changes, and flexibility to work with any protocol or resource, means that security changes can be made immediately. The user experience is also seamless, operating in-line with the user's workflow thanks to Twingate's transport-level network routing.</p><p><h3>Identity-indexed network flow logs and analytics</h3></p><figure><div></div></figure><p>With every network connection authenticated against a central user identity and authorized by security policies defined in Twingate, for the first time ever, our customers now have an identity-first view of their private network flow. All private traffic is always directly associated with user identity, including the authorization rule that allowed the connection, network path information, data volume transferred, and port details.</p><p>Identity-indexed network analytics make it straightforward to not only determine who accessed internal resources, but to quickly identify usage patterns, trends, and spot anomalous behavior. For forensic investigations, gone are the days of piecing together time-stamped network logs and IP addresses from disparate systems to try to understand a sequence of events. Identity ties all access information together, regardless of location, device, operating system, or network.</p><p><h3>Secure your internet traffic with DNSFilter</h3></p><figure><div></div></figure><blockquote><em>In 2020 we saw a huge increase in the number of online threats targeting companies who have transitioned to a remote work environment. Our partnership with Twingate allows these companies to, through the use of our products, have access to true end-to-end threat protection while connecting from anywhere on earth. We’re excited to partner with a Zero Trust solution like Twingate that provides an alternative to traditional VPNs. <br>— Ken Carnesi, CEO, DNSFilter</em></blockquote><p>Twingate secures your private network traffic, but we also recognize the risk that public internet access introduces to company devices, particularly as the prevalence of ransomware and phishing attacks has surged in our work-from-anywhere reality. Working from home, without the protection of a corporate firewall, has left devices more vulnerable. DNS filtering is a critical component in protecting employees from these threats.</p><p>Since our inception we've made it an explicit product goal to ensure that we "play nice" with other network security products. Our belief is that a combination of specialized products, with the companies behind them focused on solving their problem space in depth, presents the best possible outcome for customers.</p><p>As we've gotten to know the team at DNSFilter, they couldn't embody this spirit of focus in depth more fully, and we're excited to partner with them to offer a complete solution to protect employees. With DNSFilter’s AI-powered content filtering solution and multi-platform roaming client, admins can now deploy DNSFilter and Twingate side by side to fully protect both private and public user traffic, no matter where they are and what device they’re on.</p><p><h3>The most innovative companies are adopting Twingate</h3></p><figure><div></div></figure><blockquote><em>From our company Zoom call after rolling out Twingate: <br>"Already changed my entire life. Run, don't walk, to Twingate!" <br>— Neal Harris, Director of Security, Persona</em></blockquote><p>Since we launched Twingate, we have been fortunate to partner with some of the most innovative, fastest-growing companies around the world. Most of <a href="https://www.twingate.com/customers">our customers</a> are facing similar challenges—juggling efforts to rapidly scale their teams while dealing with the realities and limitations of remote work using outdated technology.</p><p>Most notably, our customers have found tremendous value in moving away from their existing piecemeal network access solutions built on top of VPNs, which have become brittle and difficult to manage after years of accumulating tech debt. Fast-growing companies like Human Interest, Frame.io, and Persona have been able to simplify access for employees, contractors, and admins, while achieving a more robust security posture by transitioning to Twingate.</p><p>Twingate customers report that they often reduce deployment time by 80% and ongoing client setup and support load by 90% compared to their previous VPN, all while expanding their distributed workforces in a more secure way.</p><p><h3>This is just the beginning</h3></p><p>We have an ambitious 2021 product roadmap that will continue to build on the foundation that we've laid out above. We're proud of our focus on ease of use, which has allowed our customers to adopt our vision of Identity-First Networking with minimal effort.</p><p>Give Twingate a <a href="https://www.twingate.com/">try for free</a> today. We'd love to hear <a href="https://www.twingate.com/contact/">what you think</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><b>The short version:</b> Each extra drink you have per day probably takes an extra year off your life. This may or may not be true for the first 1-2 drinks per day, but it definitely is after that. If you feel like you’re drinking too much, you may want to quit; although some people succeed at drinking in moderation, people are more likely to succeed if they set out to stop drinking entirely. If you’re currently drinking more than about five drinks per day or so, you will want to take steps to avoid potentially dangerous withdrawal when you quit. Once you’ve quit, you will need to maintain your sobriety; many people find support groups or medication helpful. The support group could be Alcoholics Anonymous, but it doesn’t have to be, and there are various good secular alternatives. The medication could be an anti-craving medication like naltrexone, acamprosate, or gabapentin. You could also “tie yourself to the mast” by taking disulfiram (“Antabuse”), which makes drinking alcohol extremely unpleasant or even dangerous. People who want to pursue moderate drinking can benefit from the Sinclair method, in which they take the medication naltrexone just before drinking, which breaks the link between alcohol and neural reward. Good support and medication can raise your chances, but most people won’t succeed the first time they try to quit, and should be prepared for a two-steps-forward, one-step-back process of gradually achieving better control.</p>
<p><b>The long version:</b></p>

<h5 id="anchor1"><span id="1_Whats_a_safe_amount_to_drink_What_are_the_risks_of_drinking_more_than_that">1. What’s a safe amount to drink? What are the risks of drinking more than that?</span></h5>
<p>I’m going to start with a boring technical answer, and then move on to a meaningful answer later.</p>
<p>The boring technical answer is: experts define a “standard drink” as about the amount of alcohol in a can of beer, a glass of wine, or a shot of whiskey, usually about 12g. If you want to get fancier or more complicated than that, you can use <a href="https://www.rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/tools/calculators/drink-size-calculator.aspx">this calculator</a>.</p>
<p>US guidelines say that women should limit themselves to at most 14 drinks/week, and women to 7 drinks/week. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommended_maximum_intake_of_alcoholic_beverages">Other countries</a> are more permissive; I did some of my medical training in Ireland, which allows 17 for men and 11 for women.</p>
<p>(Why do women get fewer drinks? Women generally weigh less, and store more of their weight <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090302115755.htm">as fat</a> to provide an energy reserve for future childbearing. That means they have less lean mass for the alcohol to disperse through. Women also have <a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12696080/">lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenase</a>, a stomach enzyme that breaks down alcohol safely. I have no idea why there would be sex differences in ADH levels – please let me know if you understand this.)</p>
<p>Here’s what the data tell us about drinking and health:</p>
<center><img src="https://lorienpsych.com/htdocs/wp-content/Images/alcohol_mort.jpg"></center>
<p>Risk of death is the lowest (about 80% of the risk of a non-drinker) at about two drinks a week. On the face of it, this suggests people who drink a small amount are much healthier than people who drink nothing at all.</p>
<p>Most researchers are skeptical. Some non-drinkers are alcoholics in recovery (whose bodies have already been damaged by their previous heavy drinking). Others are very sick people who have been warned off alcohol by their doctors. Still others are poor people who can’t afford alcohol. When these unhealthy groups die at increased rates, it looks like teetotaling is bad for you, or like moderate drinking is good for you. The most recent large <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26997174/">big study</a> seems to confirm this critique (though see <a href="http://alcoholresearchforum.org/critique-183-an-unusual-analysis-of-the-association-of-alcohol-consumption-with-mortality-24-march-2016/">these objections</a>). The CDC currently <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/moderate-drinking.htm">sides with</a> the skeptics and says that basically any amount of drinking is at least a little bad for you, even if you stay within the recommended guidelines.</p>
<p>But a few people still believe moderate drinking helps, citing for example <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d636">this review article</a> of randomized controlled trials that showed people randomized to moderate drinking saw improvements on some cardiovascular measures. What I would really like to see are animal studies – whether animals randomized to zero vs. light alcohol consumption had higher mortality. Some people <a href="http://alcoholresearchforum.org/archives-april-2010-april-2011/genetic-factors-alcohol-use/">claim</a> these studies have been done and support light drinking, but they don’t provide links and I can’t evaluate them.</p>
<p>Right now I lean to thinking probably there is no protective effect. It’s not obvious what to do with this information. Should we assume healthy teetotalers would do just as well as the current best group, twice a week drinkers? Or extrapolate the line from heavy alcohol consumption backwards and assume they would do better than twice a week drinkers by the same amount that (eg) 30-time-a-week drinkers would do better than 32-time-a-week drinkers?</p>
<p>If we use the first method, we find that men who drink the upper limit of the guidelines have about a 5% higher mortality rate than (extrapolated) teetotalers; if we use the second method, they have more like a 20% higher rate. </p>
<p>Without doing any extrapolation or guesswork at all, just looking at the observed data, we find that men who have two drinks/day more than the limit (ie 4 drinks a day instead of just 2) have about a 10% higher risk of death than the people right at the limit. Bringing back our extrapolations, they also have a 15% – 30% higher risk than (extrapolated) teetotalers.</p>
<p>What does “10% higher risk of death” mean? You can figure it out from this graph (<a href="https://joshmitteldorf.scienceblog.com/files/2012/11/Mortality_and_LifeExpectancy1.png">source</a>):</p>
<p>Someone with a 10% higher risk of death will die about one year earlier; someone with a 30% higher risk of death will die about 4 years earlier.</p>
<p>As a very weak rule of thumb, putting these two graphs together, I think it would make sense to say that each extra drink-per-day will take about one additional year off a man’s life, and a little more off a woman’s life.</p>
<p>That roughly matches results from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-alcohol/even-one-drink-a-day-linked-to-lower-life-expectancy-idUSKBN1I42H6">this study</a>, which finds that people who drink 150 grams of alcohol weekly (a little over one drink a day) live six months shorter than people who drink less than this. People who drink about 300 grams weekly (a little over two drinks a day) live about two years less, and people who drink more than this (a catchall bin anywhere from three drinks/day up) live about five years less.</p>
<p>It also potentially matches <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4402015/">this study</a> from Scandinavia which finds that severe alcoholics (people admitted to a hospital with alcohol use disorder) die about 25 years earlier than the general population (ie around age 50), if we assume these people are drinking about 25 drinks per day, which would not be atypical for a severe alcoholic.</p>
<p>Along with increased risk of death, alcoholics are at increased risk for various unpleasant diseases, and tend to <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320091#Heavy-drinking-predicts-signs-of-aging">look</a> and feel older and be less healthy than non-drinkers of the same age. </p>
<h5 id="anchor2"><span id="2_How_can_I_tell_if_Im_an_alcoholic">2. How can I tell if I’m an alcoholic?</span></h5>
<p>Alcoholism probably isn’t <a href="https://lorienpsych.com/2020/10/30/ontology-of-psychiatric-conditions-taxometrics/">a taxon</a>; there isn’t some hard-and-fast line dividing people into alcoholics and non-alcoholics. There are just people who drink more or less, and who find their drinking is harming them more or less. So only you can answer this question. Are you unhappy with the amount you’re drinking? Do you feel like you can’t stop? Is it reaching a point where it’s harmful to your health, your relationship, or your ability to do the things you want to do? Is it harmful enough that it’s worth using the label “alcoholic” to signal that you feel like things are out of control and you need to start thinking about yourself in a medical way?</p>
<p>In case that answer is too vague to be useful, people have come up with various heuristics that you can use to judge how concerned to be. The most famous is the CAGE questions:</p>
<p>1. Have you ever felt you needed to cut down on drinking?<br>
2. Have people ever annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?<br>
3. Have you ever felt guilty about drinking?<br>
4. Have you ever felt you needed a drink in the morning (“eye-opener”) to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover?</p>
<p>If you answer “yes” to at least two of the questions, you should at least consider the possibility that you might have a drinking problem. When experts do a more thorough evaluation on people who gave at least two “yes” answers to the questions above, they <a href="https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/64/6/473/1432970">end up diagnosing on average 77% of them</a> with alcoholism.</p>
<p>Doctors very specifically don’t diagnose alcoholism based on number of drinks per day, because some people are able to drink a lot without having too many problems, and other people start having problems even at seemingly low levels. But if doctors <i>did</i> diagnose alcoholism based on drinks per day, I think the cutoff would be around 10 or 11. I’m gathering this from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/11/study-one-in-eight-american-adults-are-alcoholics/">this article</a> saying that about 12% of Americans have an alcohol use disorder, plus <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/25/think-you-drink-a-lot-this-chart-will-tell-you/">this article</a> giving deciles of alcohol use; the heaviest-drinking 10% of the population starts at about 10 drinks a day. So if we wanted to come up with a completely number-of-drinks based criterion for alcohol use disorder, and keep the same percent of the population alcoholic, it would be around 10 or 11 drinks. I have known people (especially women) who were definitely alcoholic even though they drank much less than this. I’ve also known people who seem to be doing okay with more – but these people are probably taking a decade off their lives, so I’m skeptical of their claims that they can “quit any time they want” – why don’t they want to??</p>
<h5 id="anchor3"><span id="21_But_what_is_alcoholism_exactly">— 2.1. But what is alcoholism, exactly?</span></h5>
<p>This is a good question; instead of me answering it, please accept this IOU for a broader Lorien Psychiatry page on the nature of addiction.</p>
<p>The very short version is that, while free will isn’t exactly an illusion, it’s an abstraction on more complicated calculations that your brain uses to determine what to do at any given time. One input into this calculation is based on whether similar actions have gone well or badly in the past. The brain processes information about how well an action is going using a chemical called dopamine in a structure called the nucleus accumbens; the more dopamine, the more surprisingly well the action has gone and the more you try to do it in the future. Alcohol <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12827641/">increases</a> the level of dopamine in this structure. It’s not exactly clear why, but the most likely explanation is something like – it vaguely resembles …</p></div></div></div>

        <p>Well, not like Carbon. Don’t be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl7xQ8i3fc0">so dramatic</a>!</p>

<p>More like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation">Core Foundation</a>. It’s still there behind the scenes, but programmers use high-level Objective-C and Swift wrappers from Foundation. If something is missing, you can call an underlying C API. The relation between SwiftUI and AppKit is similar, for now<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is a native <a href="https://github.com/kean/Pulse">macOS app</a> written entirely in SwiftUI, from <code>@main</code> to bottom. Not a prototype, not a toy. A full-featured app. The intention is to deliver the best macOS experience possible.</p>

<p>The two main reasons this app is possible are SwiftUI and Big Sur. I have extensive experience with iOS, so I started with it. When the time came to adopt it for macOS, I was anxious. I had no idea what to expect from SwiftUI on a Mac. But thanks to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10041/">new</a> SwiftUI APIs and the Big Sur design changes, everything just made sense!</p>

<!-- <img alt="Triple column navigation on macOS using SwiftUI" class="NewScreenshot" src="https://kean.blog/images/posts/macos/00-columns.png"> -->



<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/a_grebenyuk/status/1363882900136095745?s=20">first step</a> was to get the navigation right. I knew I wanted to use triple-column navigation<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup>. SwiftUI makes this setup ease.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>ContentView</span><span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>some</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>NavigationView</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>SidebarView</span><span>()</span>
            <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"No Sidebar Selection"</span><span>)</span> <span>// You won't see this in practice (default selection)</span>
            <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"No Message Selection"</span><span>)</span> <span>// You will see this</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The key is the type system. What you used to configure in code, e.g. by passing a number of columns to <code>UISplitViewController</code>, you now configure using generic parameters. In my case, the type of the view is <code>NavigationView&lt;TupleView&lt;(Sidebar, Text, Text)&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Use navigation links as usual. To make the first tab active by default, pass <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationlink/init(_:destination:isactive:)-3v44"><code>isActive</code></a> in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationlink"><code>NavigationLink</code></a> initializer with a value of <code>true</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>SidebarView</span><span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>@State</span> <span>private</span> <span>var</span> <span>isDefaultItemActive</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>

    <span>var</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>some</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>List</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>NavigationLink</span><span>(</span><span>destination</span><span>:</span> <span>ConsoleView</span><span>(),</span> <span>isActive</span><span>:</span> <span>$</span><span>isDefaultItemActive</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>Label</span><span>(</span><span>"Console"</span><span>,</span> <span>systemImage</span><span>:</span> <span>"message"</span><span>)</span>

        <span>}</span><span>.</span><span>listStyle</span><span>(</span><span>SidebarListStyle</span><span>())</span> <span>// Gives you this sweet sidebar look</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By default, the toolbar displays a title in the main panel. To disable it, I used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scene/windowtoolbarstyle(_:)"><code>UnifiedWindowToolbarStyle(showsTitle: false)</code></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To learn more about triple-column navigation, see <a href="https://kean.blog/post/triple-trouble"><strong>Triple Trouble</strong></a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t use the List <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list#topics"><code>selection</code></a> API for navigation. It only exists to support single or multiple item selection of items in <em>edit</em> mode.</p>
</blockquote>
    
      



<p>The “Toggle Sidebar” button does not appear by default. To add it, use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/rotatedshape/toolbar(content:)-53znx?changes=latest_mino_8"><code>.toolbar</code></a> modifier.</p>

<!-- ```swift
SidebarView(model: model)
    .toolbar {
        Button(action: toggleSidebar) {
            Image(systemName: "sidebar.left")
                .help("Toggle Sidebar")
            }
        }
    }
}
``` -->

<div><div><pre><code><span>SidebarView</span><span>(</span><span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>model</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/rotatedshape/toolbar(content:)-53znx?changes=latest_mino_8"><span><span>toolbar</span></span></a> <span>{</span>
        <span>Button</span><span>(</span><span>action</span><span>:</span> <span>toggleSidebar</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Image</span><span>(</span><span>systemName</span><span>:</span> <span>"sidebar.left"</span><span>)</span>
                <span>.</span><span>help</span><span>(</span><span>"Toggle Sidebar"</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a way to hide the sidebar programmatically using <code>NavigationView</code>. I had to use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapp"><code>NSApp</code></a> APIs. One of the few AppKit usages in the app.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>private</span> <span>func</span> <span>toggleSidebar</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>NSApp</span><span>.</span><span>keyWindow</span><span>?</span><span>.</span><span>firstResponder</span><span>?</span>
        <span>.</span><span>tryToPerform</span><span>(</span><span>#selector(</span><span>NSSplitViewController.toggleSidebar(_:)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>with</span><span>:</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>The relationship between SwiftUI and AppKit are not documented and not guaranteed to be supported. This workaround is useful for now, but might stop working in the future.</p>

<p>To add a “Toggle Sidebar” shortcut, use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/sidebarcommands"><code>SidebarCommands</code></a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kean.blog/images/posts/macos/01-menu-items.png"></p>

<p>To create a collapsing section, use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/disclosuregroup"><code>DisclosureGroup</code></a>. You can even nest sections. To open a section programmatically, use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/disclosuregroup/init(isexpanded:content:label:)"><code>isExpanded</code></a> binding.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>DisclosureGroup</span><span>(</span><span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>

      </h2>

<p>With the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/windowgroup"><code>WindowGroup</code></a> API introduces in Big Sur, SwiftUI takes care of certain platform behaviors. For example, users can open more than one window from the group simultaneously. When the user double-clicks on a list item in the main panel, it opens the details in a separate window. This happens automatically.</p>



<p>It also comes with a standard set of shortcuts: <code>Command-Tilde</code> to switch between open windows, <code>Command+W</code> to close, <code>Command+M</code> to minimize, etc.</p>

<p>You can also open a new window group using <code>Command+N</code>. In my case, the app remembers the database you selected. This way you can have multiple views on the same set of logs with different filters. Very useful when investigating complex issues!</p>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The way <code>WindowGroup</code> works is clever: it’s just struct copying. Every window created from the group maintains independent state. For example, for each new window created from the group the system allocates new storage for any <code>State</code> or <code>StateObject</code> variables instantiated by the scene’s view hierarchy.</p>

          List Search <a href="#list-search">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>



<p>Search is probably the most complex UI feature I built. It felt like I was pushing it.</p>

<p>The search field, the search toolbar, and how the searches are performed is not particularly interesting – same as in AppKit. What is, is how do you scroll to the next item and activate the navigation link each time the user hits the Return (↩) key?</p>

<p>For programmatic scrolling, I used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scrollviewreader"><code>ScrollViewReader</code></a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>ConsoleContentView</span><span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>@ObservedObject</span> <span>private(set)</span> <span>var</span> <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>ConsoleViewModel</span>

    <span>var</span> <span>body</span><span>:</span> <span>some</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span>

                <span>ConsoleMessageListView</span><span>(</span><span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>model</span><span>)</span>

                    <span>}</span>

            <span>}</span>
            <span>filterToolbar</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When the user hits Return (↩), <code>ConsoleViewModel</code> updates the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/published">published</a> <code>selectedObjectId</code> property value observed by the view.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every declarative framework is imperative if you try hard enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, what about activating the navigation links? We already know how to do that using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/navigationlink/init(_:destination:isactive:)-3v44"><code>isActive</code></a>. But what do you do in a dynamic list? The solution I came up with is to create an array of bindings and grow it every time the number of items increases.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>ConsoleViewModel</span><span>:</span> <span>ObservableObject</span> <span>{</span>

<p>By the way, this is not the only way to navigate a list with a keyboard. By default, on macOS, List can also be navigated with “Up” and “Down” arrows!</p>

          Text View <a href="#text-view">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>



<p>A similar search is also available on a details screen. This is the only place (except for <code>NSSearchField</code>) where I had to use <code>AppKit</code> components directly. SwiftUI doesn’t yet have a wrapper for <code>NSTextView</code> (except for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/texteditor"><code>TextEditor</code></a>, but it doesn’t support attributed strings that I needed for syntax highlighting). So I had to create one.</p>

<p>Now here is the question. Does it mean that SwiftUI is somewhat incomplete? Maybe. After all, text view is a common component. But SwiftUI is built on top of AppKit, it is not going anywhere. Just because I had to wrap two components doesn’t mean that SwiftUI was in the way. Quite the opposite! The AppKit integration works great.</p>

<p>Despite the rumors of SwiftUI’s lack of programmatic navigation, it exists.</p>

<p>One of the cool Pulse features is the ability to <em>pin</em> important messages. Imagine you are investigating a bug report, you found some related messages, but you are not sure. You can pin them and get back to them later in the “Pins” tab.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can also pin a selected item using <code>Command+P</code> shortcut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this isn’t enough, is it? What you want to do is the ability to open pinned messages in the list. Pulse allows you to just that.</p>

<p>To implement it, <code>PinsViewModel</code> …</p></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"> 



<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  In the history of shortwave receivers, the Wadley loop played an
  important role. It was invented by the South African engineer Trevor
  Wadley in 1946 and it was applied in professional shortwave receivers
  from Racal in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1970s it was popular in
  amateur shortwave receivers until it gave way to PLL synthesizer
  circuits.

</p><p>
  It is a very clever circuit that made it possible to construct
  shortwave receivers that covered the entire HF spectrum with good
  image rejection, good dial accuracy and good frequency stability
  (adequate for SSB). Circuit complexity and cost were modest compared
  to other receiver designs that met the same requirements.

</p><p>
  The Wadley loop utilizes two tuning knobs that tune two different
  continuously variable frequency oscillators (VFOs). The first tuning
  knob tunes to the required megahertz band from 0 to 29. Though it
  controls a continuously variable oscillator, it appears to act as a
  band switch. Due to drift cancelation, any deviation from an integer
  multiple of 1MHz is canceled out. The second tuning knob tunes to
  the exact frequency within one megahertz band.
 
  
</p><h2>History of shortwave receivers</h2>

<p>
  The very first shortwave receivers used regenerative circuits. They
  typically had one or more RF amplifiers (vacuum tubes) with tuned
  circuits between them. All of these tuned circuits were tuned to the
  received frequency. This is called a TRF (Tuned Radio Frequency)
  receiver. The final RF amplification tube had positive feedback,
  such that it nearly oscillated but not quite. This provided much
  gain and selectivity, but setting the feedback level just right was
  critical. Too much and the circuit would oscillate. Satisfactory
  results could already be had with just the regenerative tube without
  any other amplifiers before it. But if you made such receiver to
  oscillate, the whole neighborhood would be treated to a howling
  sound. This was a problem especially in the normal broadcast bands
  (mediumwave and in Europe also longwave).

</p><p>
  After 1930, the superheterodyne receiver would be used nearly
  universally.  It would provide uniform and good nearby selectivity
  across the tuning range, something a TRF receiver could not do. Plus
  that you did not treat the whole neighborhood to a howling sound if
  you did not know how to tune properly. In a superheterodyne
  receiver, a variable oscillator is used to mix the received signal
  to a fixed frequency, the Intermediate Frequency of IF. Further
  amplification and filtering is performed at that fixed frequency. By
  varying the oscillator frequency you tune to a different station. As
  the oscillator is at a frequency different from the received
  frequency and the signal is not very close to the antenna
  input. radiation from the local oscillator is typically not a
  problem for the neighbors.
  
</p><p>
  Around World War 2, even professional communications receivers were
  still standard superheterodynes. They may have used a higher than
  standard IF and an extra tuned RF stage to improve image rejection,
  but the basic system was the same.

</p><p>
  In the 1950s and 1960s many professional communications receivers
  would use double conversion (two different IF frequencies). Further
  they would use one carefully calibrated Variable Frequency
  Oscillator (VFO) and mix its output with numerous different crystal
  frequencies to obtain the local oscillator signal for all bands.
  This way the VFO could have only one tuning range at a comparatively
  low frequency, so its stability and dial accuracy could be good
  enough for SSB and RTTY. Double conversion for these receivers still
  meant IF frequencies of 1 to 3MHz, certainly not 40MHz or higher.

</p><p>
  For example the German Rohde &amp; Schwarz EK07 receiver of the 1960s
  has a first IF of 3.3MHz (for the higher bands) and it has a VFO at
  a 3.4-6.4MHz, a 3MHz wide range. To obtain the required
  stability and dial accuracy for such a comparatively wide range it
  relied heavily on mechanical precision engineering, rather than clever
  circuit design.
   
</p><p>
  One brand of professional communications receivers however, used
  the Wadley loop. This brand was Racal, producer of the famous RA17
  receivers.  And yes, it does use a first IF of around 40MHz, hence it
  does not require special treatment of the lower bands (which would
  need single conversion if the first IF was lower). Now the RA17 did
  use mechanical precision engineering for the VFO, but the
  requirements were less strict than for the EK07 (having only a third
  of the tuning range). And the number of switches and band-dependent
  filters was drastically reduced compared to the EK07.

</p><p>
  In 1973 the same Wadley loop was introduced in a consumer grade
  receiver, the Barlow Wadley XCR30. Although its performance was much
  less than that of the Racal, it cost only a small fraction (around
  1/25th of price of the Racal). Its performance was much better than
  that of any general coverage receivers you could buy in this price
  range. The Yaesu FRG-7 was introduced in 1977 and it performed
  considerably better than the Barlow Wadley. 
  
</p><p>
  The Wadley loop had its limitations though and in the 1970s,
  professional communications receivers moved to PLL synthesizers to
  generate their tunable local oscillator signals to mix the received
  signal to a high first IF. Amateur receivers followed suit after
  1980. In the meantime there were some very interesting designs that
  combined a VFO (tuning a 1MHz wide range) with a PLL synthesizer to
  generate 1MHz multiples. This system was used by the Kenwood R1000
  and Yaesu FRG-7700.

</p><p>
  Modern receivers use direct digital synthesis (DDS) instead of (or
  combined with) PLL synthesizers. In the 1990s some high end
  communications receivers digitized the final IF signal and did the
  IF filtering and demodulation digitally in a DSP (digital signal
  processor). This technique is now commonplace, even in cheap
  receivers. Instead of a dedicated DSP chip one can use the power of a
  modern personal computer to do the job. There is now a trend to use
  a low first (and only) intermediate frequency, typically less than
  48kHz, in the range of normal sound cards. To suppress the image
  frequency, one can use two mixers and two AD converters, each fed by
  oscillator signals of the same frequency and 90 degrees apart. This
  is called quadrature mixing.

</p><p>
  As of 2016 it is now even possible to directly digitize the entire HF
  spectrum from 0 to 30MHz and do all further processing in a
  computer. No more mixers, no more image frequencies (but you still
  need good anti-aliasing filters).

  
</p><h2>The superheterodyne receiver</h2>

<p>
Let's start with an ordinary superheterodyne circuit for a standard
LW/MW radio, whose diagram is shown below. Such radios were made from
the 1930s to the 1990s. The received signal (either in the longwave
range 150-350kHz or in the mediumwave range 530-1620kHz) is fed
through a preselector, typically a parallel resonant LC circuit of a
fixed coil and a variable capacitor. The coil could be wound on a
ferrite bar, so the coil itself would act as an antenna. The received
signal is mixed with a variable oscillator to obtain the desired 455kHz
intermediate frequency. The oscillator also contains a resonant LC
circuit containing a fixed coil and a variable capacitor. The
variable capacitor is typically a dual variable capacitor where both
capacitors are on a single shaft so they are varied both by rotating
the shaft. Both the preselector and the oscillator have two tuning
ranges. The coils for both ranges can be switched using a band switch.

</p><p>
<img src="https://lennartb.home.xs4all.nl/radio/superhet.svg" width="1000" alt="Block diagram of a superheterodyne receiver">

</p><p>
The 455kHz IF signal is fed through a series of narrow band filters
and amplifiers. The filters select the 455kHz signal with a well
defined bandwidth (around 10kHz in an AM broadcast receiver). The
amplified signal is then demodulated using a diode detector. The
demodulated signal is further amplified and fed to a speaker.

</p><p>
In traditional radios these filters were constructed from transformers
and capacitors. In more modern radios you would find ceramic
resonators. Communications receivers would contain several ceramic
filters with different bandwidths, that can be
selected. Communications receivers would also contain a BFO, a Beat
Frequency Oscillator that oscillates near the 455kHz IF. The diode
detector could then be replaced by a product detector, which is
basically another mixer.

</p><p>
Finally we would have an AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit. The
amplified IF signal is detected by another diode and then smoothed
using a much larger capacitor to eliminate all modulation and just
retain the carrier level. This signal is used to control (reduce) the
gain of the IF amplifiers. This reduces the effect of fading and it
reduces the difference in audio level between strong and weak
stations.

  
</p><h2>Problems with the superheterodyne for shortwave</h2>

<p>
  The standard superheterodyne works surprisingly well for mediumwave
  and longwave. But if we move on to shortwave, we will run into the
  problem of image frequencies. In a superheterodyne circuit, two
  frequencies will mix to the desired IF (f1) if you tune the
  oscillator to a given frequency f2. f2+f1 and f2-f1. So if you tune
  the oscillator to 1455kHz and the IF is 455kHz, both an input signal
  of 1000kHz (f2-f1) and an input signal of 1910kHz (f1+f2) will mix
  to the IF. We do have a tunable preselector and 1910kHz (unwanted) is far
  removed from 1000kHz (wanted), so there will be no problem.

</p><p>
  But on shortwave the situation is different. If you tune to
  15100kHz, the image frequency is at 16010kHz, well within the range
  of a single resonant LC circuit used a a preselector.

</p><p>
  There are two straightforward ways to reduce the
  problem. Professional shortwave receivers of the 1940s would
  typically use both methods combined:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Add preselection. A straightforward way to do it is …</li></ul></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just one year before the first web page went live in 1991, Microsoft began shipping perhaps the most well-known icon font, <em>Wingdings</em>. However, it would be nearly 22 years later before icon fonts would become a design trend on the internet.</p><p>The introduction of the <code>@font-face</code> CSS at-rule allowed web designers to specify custom fonts with which to display text. By 2011, all major browsers supported it. This gave birth to the idea that fonts composed of pictograms, like <em>Wingdings</em>, could be used in place of raster images on the web. Considering that real SVG support across all major browsers didn't become stable until early 2020, icon fonts were the defacto way to add vector-based icons on your web site.</p><p>But icon fonts on the web were fundamentally flawed from the beginning. And now, with full SVG support at our disposal, it's time to put a stop to their use, once and for all.</p><h2 id="flawed-icon-fonts">Flawed Icon Fonts</h2><h3 id="flash-of-unstyled-content-(fouc)">Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)</h3><p>When utilizing <code>@font-face</code>, you are instructing the browser to make an HTTP request for the required font file. This request isn't immediately dispatched either. When the browser begins parsing the HTML and all linked files referenced in the markup, it is building the Document Object Model (DOM) in realtime. When a linked font is found, the request is fired. How long it takes to retrieve the font can depend on the size of the font asset, network conditions, and user hardware.</p><p>While waiting for the font asset, the browser will choose to display the textual content of the HTML before actually receiving it. This results in a flash of unstyled content (FOUC). These flashes can be very jarring to your visitors. Icon fonts typically assign their glyphs to codepoints outside of the normal range that most normal fonts operate in. However, if they do not, it is possible that random characters or glyphs will appear in place of your icons before the font is fully loaded.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: It is possible to use newer directives, such as <code>preload</code>, on font resources to avoid FOUC. However, this does not solve all the other issues defined in this article and is not recommended.</p></blockquote><h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3><p>Icon fonts are notoriously bad for accessibility and can lead to some frustrating experiences for those who rely on assistive technologies.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Treated like text</strong> — The browser treats fonts like text because that is what fonts are supposed to be. Screen readers have become increasingly smarter over the years, but they still have a hard time discerning what is legible text and what is a pictogram. Most screen readers will read aloud text inserted via CSS, so when they come across your icons they may say "unpronounceable," or they may be skipped entirely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stylesheet overrides</strong> — Those with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/basics/ced/fastfacts.htm" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">visual impairments</a> often use custom stylesheets to override default styles of the websites they visit to make them easier to use. This might include changing color schemes, increasing font size or weight, or even changing the font face completely. If your site relies on icons in a non-contextual way, someone using an assistive font (e.g. <a href="https://opendyslexic.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OpenDyslexic</a>) will cause your icons to be replaced and disappear completely, potentially leaving your web site unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cannot provide metadata</strong> — The process of implementing an icon font on the web requires the use of the <code>::before</code> or <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements. Semantically, the <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements are meant to add cosmetic content to an existing element. For icon fonts, this makes sense as long as the icon is being used contextually with another element. However, there are many times in which an icon is used as the primary focus. For example, an "x" for "close" or a house for returning "home". By themselves, these icons don't provide any semantical information about their contents; You cannot label them or describe them directly.</p></li></ol><h3 id="size-and-maintainability">Size and Maintainability</h3><p>Icon fonts are not cheap assets. Every time a visitor downloads your icon font, they are downloading every icon you intend to use anywhere on your site, regardless if they see them all or not. That fact alone makes icon fonts difficult, and rather annoying, to maintain. If your icon font contains 200 icons and you use 10 of the, you are forcing your visitors to download 190 icons that they'll never see. This will degrade your visitor's experience by increasing load times and extending FOUC.</p><p>Maintaining an icon font means adding and removing icons as necessary to keep the size of the font, and subsequent stylesheets, to a minimal. This also means that every time you update your font, you need to invalidate your visitor's cache of the assets and force them to re-download them.</p><h3 id="degraded-visual-quality">Degraded Visual Quality</h3><p>All modern browsers and operating system employ anti-aliasing on text to some degree. Textual anti-aliasing is agnostic about whether or not your font is made up of letters and numbers or pictograms. This has the potential for negative side-effects in terms of visual quality, especially if you stack glyphs to make multicolor icons. Your icons may look blurry or misaligned.</p><h3 id="difficult-to-style%2Fposition">Difficult to Style/Position</h3><p>As if I haven't said it enough, icon fonts are fonts first and icons second. This mean that your icons follow text-based CSS rules, such as <code>font-size</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code>, <code>line-height</code>, etc. This can make positioning icons more difficult and less consistent. Additionally, icon font glyphs are monochromatic, meaning any stylistic changes you make affect the entire glyph.</p><p><img src="https://www.irigoyen.dev/assets/blog/svg-logo.png" alt="SVG Logo"></p><h2 id="svg's-to-the-rescue!">SVG's to the Rescue!</h2><p>With the release of Chromium-powered version Microsoft's Edge browser in early 2020, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) became fully supported across all major browsers. Even before that, SVGs have been supported in all browsers since 2012, <a href="https://caniuse.com/svg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">albeit with some scaling caveats in Internet Explorer and pre-Chromium Edge</a>. And guess what? SVGs are <em>awesome</em> for web icons!</p><h3 id="icons-just-work">Icons Just Work</h3><p>SVG image data is stored directly in your HTML document.

Simply provide a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/title" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/desc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><code>&lt;desc&gt;</code></a> element in your SVG container. Screen readers will pick these values up and read something of use to your visitor. And because SVGs are just elements in your HTML, you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ARIA attributes</a>, such as <code>aria-labelledby</code> with ease.</li></ul><h3 id="easier-to-maintain">Easier to Maintain</h3><p>Compared one-to-one, a collection of 100 SVGs versus a WOFF2 of 100 icon glyphs will be larger. However, the benefits of SVGs easily outweigh an icon font implementation.</p><p>With SVGs, you will only be including the icons that are required for that individual page, directly in your code. The most efficient way to do this is by using the SVG <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/defs" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><code>&lt;defs&gt;</code> element</a> to define your icons once, and then referring to them with the <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> element. You can also inline your SVG icons directly, however if you use the same icon multiple times on the same page, you're just adding to overall page weight.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're creating a Single Page Application (SPA), be sure to look into proper <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">code-splitting</a> techniques to keep your bundle sizes down.</p></blockquote><p>Another advantage is that you do not need to maintain a font and its supporting CSS files outside of your site. A common practice for those who do use icon fonts is to cherry-pick the icons they need and rebuild a smaller font that only includes those icons. Utilizing SVG icons allows you to do this within your codebase without the need for generating the font assets in external tools.</p><h3 id="sharp-dressed-images">Sharp-Dressed Images</h3><p>SVGs are straight up vector images. Anti-aliasing methods employed by your browser or operating system on text have no effect on SVGs and your icons will be noticeably sharper.</p><h3 id="full-css-control">Full CSS Control</h3><p>With SVGs, you have access to all the same CSS controls as with a font and more! You can directly target specific parts of a multi-part icon and apply different style to each. You may also use SVG-specific CSS controls, like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><code>stroke</code></a> property.</p><p>Additionally, SVGs are simply the size they are. They are not affected by text-based CSS rules.</p><h3 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h3><p>To fully support the use of SVGs on your site, make sure you're following other common best practices:</p><ul><li><strong>Optimize your SVGs</strong> — <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Run your SVG images through an optimizer</a> to get the size down. (Most, if not all, icon libraries that offer SVG packages do this by default.)</li><li><strong>Enable Compression</strong> — Configure your server to send all textual assets (HTML, JS, CSS) with <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=brotli" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Brotli</a> (or GZIP). This will include the SVG data in your HTML and/or JS files.</li><li><strong>Cache effectively</strong> — Set appropriate caching headers so your visitors only download things as they change. Since your SVGs will be part of your HTML and/or JS files, you'll only want your visitors to download them again if they change.</li></ul><h2 id="get-started-with-svg-icons">Get Started with SVG Icons</h2><p>Most major icon libraries offer SVG packages of the library. Two popular icon libraries, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/svg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Material Design Icons</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>, both have packages you can install via <code>npm</code>.</p><p>If you're using a framework, many of the major icon libraries also have released packages for the more popular ones so that you can get going fairly quickly. For example, if you're using <a href="https://reactjs.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">React</a>, both Material Design Icons and Font Awesome have easy solutions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Material Design Icons</strong> - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/react" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@mdi/react</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/js" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@mdi/js</a></p><pre><code><span>import</span> Icon <span>from</span> <span>'@mdi/react'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> mdiCoffee <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@mdi/js'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> element <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span>Icon path<span>=</span><span>{</span>mdiCoffee<span>}</span> size<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Font Awesome</strong> - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/react-fontawesome" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@fortawesome/react-fontawesome</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons</a></p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> FontAwesomeIcon <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> faCoffee <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> element <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span>FontAwesomeIcon icon<span>=</span><span>{</span>faCoffee<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Both of these solutions only bundle the icons you use because of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">tree-shaking</a>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Continued use of icon fonts is a detriment to your visitors and a time-sink for you.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elixir in Production is a series where we interview people that have used Elixir for significant projects: apps, services, startup MVPs.</p><p>Our today’s guest is Alex Reichert, the co-founder of <a href="https://papercups.io/">Papercups</a>, an open-source customer messaging tool.</p><p>In the interview, we talk about their open-source involvement, the benefits of Elixir for their startup, and which libraries they have found to be useful for their project.</p><h3 id="could-you-tell-us-a-little-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</h3><p>Papercups is an open-source alternative to customer messaging tools like Intercom, Drift, and Crisp. Our goal is to make it easier for businesses to communicate and build relationships with their customers across various channels.</p><p>At the moment, our core product is a customizable live chat widget that people can embed on their websites, through which they can message their customers in real time. Being open-source, we also make it possible for people to host our app on their own servers. This is particularly important for companies that care a lot about data privacy.</p><p>Kam and I started Papercups for a couple of reasons. We had both felt the pain of building out messaging software at our previous companies and wanted to build something extremely developer-friendly and customizable. We also felt that companies should be able to own and have complete control over all of their customer data. So these are the problems we’re striving to solve.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/ma/majwcz4l.card.jpg" alt="Alex Reichert" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="could-you-talk-a-little-about-the-stack-of-papercups%3F">Could you talk a little about the stack of Papercups?</h3><p>Papercups is built on top of an Elixir/Phoenix API, backed by a PostgreSQL database. At the moment, all of our frontend code is built with React/TypeScript. (Though I’d love to explore LiveView at some point!)</p><p>For authentication, we’re using the <a href="https://github.com/danschultzer/pow">Pow</a> library. And for our workers and job processing, we use <a href="https://github.com/sorentwo/oban">Oban</a>.</p><h3 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-choosing-elixir-for-a-saas-product-like-papercups%3F">What are the benefits of choosing Elixir for a SaaS product like Papercups?</h3><p>Since our core functionality revolves mostly around real-time communication, Elixir (and Phoenix) gave us a lot of super useful tooling right out of the box. Though we jumped into the project without any prior Elixir experience, I believe it allowed us to move a lot faster than we may have otherwise, even with a more familiar language.</p><p>I mean, we ended up managing to both teach ourselves the basics of Elixir and ship our MVP… all within ~3 weeks! And it’s not like we’re geniuses or anything. Most of the credit goes to the language, the tooling, the documentation, and the community support.</p><p>At a more technical level, Elixir also scales quite nicely for our use case. We use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html">Phoenix Channels</a> to manage all of our chat threads, where each connection is backed by a lightweight BEAM process, working in parallel and maintaining its own state. As the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html">docs</a> say:</p><blockquote>
<p>This architecture scales well; Phoenix Channels can support millions of subscribers with reasonable latency on a single box, passing hundreds of thousands of messages per second. And that capacity can be multiplied by adding more nodes to the cluster.</p>
</blockquote><h3 id="are-there-any-libraries-or-frameworks-that-you-would-especially-like-to-feature%3F">Are there any libraries or frameworks that you would especially like to feature?</h3><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://github.com/sorentwo/oban">Oban</a>, which we use for our background workers and asynchronous tasks.</p><p>I loved how easy it was to set up. In my experience, most job processing libraries require setting up something like Redis or MongoDB to manage everything, but Oban works with PostgreSQL right out of the box. I loved that it “just works” without requiring any additional dependencies. (This is especially nice for the people that want to self-host our product because it makes it simpler to maintain.)</p><h3 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-while-developing-papercups-with-elixir%3F">What was the biggest challenge while developing Papercups with Elixir?</h3><p>Since we jumped into it without any prior knowledge or experience with Elixir, it took some time for me to wrap my head around GenServers and Phoenix Channels. It just wasn’t something I was used to. Reading Saša Jurić’s <em>Elixir in Action</em> definitely helped me understand those concepts better. I highly recommend that book.</p><p>Setting up authentication was also a bit tricky since a lot of the examples I found online were written for server-rendered apps. But auth is always a challenge!</p><h3 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h3><p>Yes! I’m really proud of how everything has turned out so far. It’s been a lot of fun to work on.</p><h3 id="i%E2%80%99ve-seen-papercups-make-a-lot-of-effort-in-introducing-new-people-to-open-source-elixir-with-beginner-friendly-issues-and-other-assistance.-how-important-is-the-connection-to-open-source-for-papercups%3F">I’ve seen Papercups make a lot of effort in introducing new people to open-source Elixir with beginner-friendly issues and other assistance. How important is the connection to open-source for Papercups?</h3><p>I’d love for our project to give more developers a chance to get their feet wet with Elixir. We still have some work to do to improve engagement with the open-source community, but we have a few ideas in the works that I’m excited about.</p><p>Kam and I really want to make our products more and more “hackable”, in the sense that developers can build completely customizable chat (and other messaging) products on top of our APIs.  For example, we’ve had a few frontend developers reach out about building their own completely custom chat UI on top of our APIs. Some are using Svelte, others are using Flutter, and some want to use Vue. We want to support all of these use cases.</p><p>We’ve also had several backend developers reach out about building “plugins” that would allow them to do things like connecting their own NLP (natural language processing) APIs into Papercups to manage automating responses and building their own bots. This makes me really excited to see what the open-source community will come up with, which is why over the next couple months we want to invest more into our API documentation, webhook events, and other forms of customizability.</p><h3 id="if-a-person-wants-to-contribute-to-papercups%2C-what-are-the-steps-they-should-take%3F">If a person wants to contribute to Papercups, what are the steps they should take?</h3><p>The easiest way to get started is to join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/papercups-io/shared_invite/zt-h0c3fxmd-hZi1Zp8~D61S6GD16aMqmg">public Slack workspace</a> and let us know you’re interested in contributing! I’m always happy to help people find a good ticket to start with.</p><p>Otherwise, we try to regularly add “good first issues” on GitHub, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/papercups-io/papercups/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">here</a>.</p><p>For anyone interested in learning Elixir, I’d highly recommend first thinking of a project that excites you, rather than just jumping into tutorials. This was a game changer for me. I had personally spent a bit of time tinkering with Elixir tutorials, but I would either quickly become bored or find that I hadn’t really learned much in the end, since I was mostly just copy/pasting code.</p><p>By having the goal of building a prototype for Papercups, it very much helped me accomplish the secondary goal of learning Elixir. It really motivated me to figure things out for myself.</p><p>Also big thanks to the community on the <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">Elixir Slack</a> workspace for helping me out whenever I had any noob questions :)</p><hr><p>I would like to thank Alex for the interview and wish Papercups the best of luck in conquering the market: we love open-source projects like these. ❤️ They have recently launched <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/papercups-2-0">Papercups 2.0</a> on Product Hunt, so I’d highly suggest checking them out if you’re interested.</p><p>If you wish to read more stories like these, don’t forget to follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/serokell">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://serokell.medium.com/">Medium</a>, or <a href="https://dev.to/serokell">Dev</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

February 24, 2021 | https://amasad.me/decade | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amasad.me/decade">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>It's wild: Almost everything I worked on has become a great success on a global scale. I was struck by this fact earlier today when the news came out that Codecademy, where I was a founding engineer, is now a <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1364296435059974149">fast-growing business</a>. The news came on the heels of our <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/replit-raises-20-million-for-collaborative-browser-based-coding/">Series A announcement</a> at <a href="https://repl.it/">Replit</a>, where we shared some great numbers too. At Facebook, I was a founding engineer on React Native, which also had a <a href="https://shopify.engineering/react-native-future-mobile-shopify">fantastic last year</a>. And all the <a href="https://amasad.me/2016">open-source projects</a> I've been part of --  Babel and Jest most famously -- became standard tools that measurably increased productivity and changed industries.</p>
<p>Across all my work -- the millions of developers we helped mint, the CS teachers we empowered, and the entrepreneurs we enabled -- I've probably had a significant impact on the world economy, perhaps even meaningfully increased productivity. </p>
<p>Reflecting on this, first, I'm grateful to be able to be useful on such a large scale. After all, just ten years ago, I was a kid in Amman who'd just graduated from university and was interviewing at random companies (including a cigarette factory for VB6 work that comes with a free carton of cigarettes a week).</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, I think it's time to be more ambitious. With every project, I stopped short of what was possible. I let haters &amp; doubters change my plans and assumed a sense of fake humility because that's what people expected.</p>
<p>The culmination of my work is Replit, where we're working to give people computer superpowers. We want to nudge the world away from rampant digital consumption to one where there are more creators and entrepreneurs. Anyone anywhere can participate in the digital economy and build and leverage software to better themselves and their communities.</p>
<p>Now that I've seen what's possible in a decade while starting from nothing, in this decade, I'd like to create trillions of dollars in value for the world in the form of better access to technology and tools.</p>
<p>My only regret is my mum is not here to see all this. </p>

<p>As part of <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">YCW21</a>, <a href="http://dendron.so/">Dendron</a> was eligible for significant credits from all major cloud providers. This articles goes over my experience redeeming credits in two in particular: AWS and Google Cloud.</p>
<ul>
<li>DISCLAIMER: I used to work at AWS and have both conscious and unconscious biases towards my former employer 😅</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aws">AWS</h2>
<ul>
<li>reach out to dedicated YC email</li>
<li>response within an hour</li>
<li>scheduling a call a few days out
<ul>
<li>talked to AWS Startup Rep, a team comprised of former startup founders </li>
<li>talk about my use case and also got connected with team leads of folks in respective AWS services where I had questions</li>
<li>got all credits applied immediately after the call</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>access to AWS YC slack as well as free business support</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="google-cloud">Google Cloud</h2>
<ul>
<li>enroll in a google cloud for startup program</li>
<li>book an appointment with a sales rep 
<ul>
<li>sales rep wanted to know how much money I would spend with google cloud and repeatedly came back to that question (even though we were a pre-revenue startup with no pricing model at this point)</li>
<li>told rep about infrastructure we were thinking of using but they needed a dollar monthly amount since they were in sales and didn't have an understanding of the infrastructure</li>
<li>after some hypothetical numbers, got forwarded to a <em>google cloud partner</em>, a third party consulting firm that would help get me credits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>first available slot for partner was three weeks out</li>
<li>got a small chunk of google cloud credit with terms that more would be added if these credits ran out</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2>
<ul>
<li>aws process
<ul>
<li>completed in under a week</li>
<li>got all credits and perks right away</li>
<li>access to first party support from AWS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>google process
<ul>
<li>process is still ongoing (its been three weeks now)</li>
<li>get credits in chunks and still not sure what the terms are and when they renew</li>
<li>first point of contact was a sales rep, now talking to a third party partner</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>We used to have a joke at Amazon that if someone didn't make it pass the interview loop, then they were once again <em>upgraded</em> to the position of a <strong>customer</strong>. While I personally loved my time there, it is awesome being at the other end of the customer obsessed machine. </p>
<p>As for google, I'm wondering at this point if I'll even get to talk to a google account manager. The initial onboarding call was entirely about how much money I was planning on spending with google (as opposed to the Amazon call where they wanted to help me architect my service). Google Cloud has really nice ergonomics and world class engineers but an awful reputation for customer support. My anecdotal experience seems to support this. </p>

									<p>The European Commission Wednesday <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_653" target="_blank">proposed to extend rules</a> for people to use mobile services in another European country without additional costs, known as "roaming," for 10 more years.</p>
<p>The EU <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/done-roaming-four-acts-no-heroes-plenty-of-pratfalls/">agreed</a> to scrap additional costs for roaming within the EU in 2017, effectively ending sky-high phone bills for people that used their mobile phone in another European country. The policy that was 13 years in the making and was heralded by the institutions as proof of the EU's value toward its citizens. </p>
<p>But the rules are due to expire in 2022. The Commission's proposal to extend the rules needs approval from national governments and the European Parliament, potentially leading to new hiccups in the coming year. </p>

<p>The new proposal also includes requirements to make sure people using mobile services in another European country are entitled to "the same quality and speed of their mobile network" at home, the Commission said.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>There is a large and ever-growing number of use cases for graph databases and many of them are centered around one important functionality: <strong>relationship traversals</strong>. While in traditional relational databases the concept of foreign keys seems like a simple and efficient idea, the truth is that they result in very complex joins and self-joins when the dataset becomes too inter-related.</p>
<p>Graph databases offer powerful data modeling and analysis capabilities for many real-world problems such as social networks, business relationships, dependencies, shipping, logistics… and they have been adopted by many of the world’s leading tech companies.</p>
<p>The use case you’ll be working on is <strong>Fraud Detection</strong> in large transaction networks. Usually, such networks contain millions of relationships between POS devices, logged transactions, and credit cards which makes it a perfect target for graph database algorithms.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a simple Python web application from scratch. You will get a basic understanding of the technologies that are used, and see how easy it is to integrate a graph database in your development process.</p>
<p>You can also find all of the code <a href="https://github.com/g-despot/card-fraud">here</a> if you don’t want to work on it as you go through the tutorial. If at any point in this tutorial you have a question or something is not working for you, feel free to post on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/memgraphdb">StackOverflow</a> with the tag <code>memgraphdb</code>.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Since you will be building a complete web application there is a number of tools that you will need to install before getting started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/">Flask</a></strong>: a very powerful web framework that provides you with tools, libraries and technologies used in web development. A Flask application can be as small as a single web page or as complex as a management interface.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker and Compose</a></strong>: an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It enables you to separate your application from your infrastructure (host machine). If you are installing Docker on Windows, Compose will be already included. For Linux and macOS visit <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">this site</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/quick-start">Memgraph DB</a></strong>: a native fully distributed in-memory graph database built to handle real-time use-cases at enterprise scale. Follow the <a href="https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/getting-started/installation/docker-installation"><strong>Docker Installation</strong></a> instructions. While it’s completely optional, I encourage you to also install <strong><a href="https://memgraph.com/product/lab">Memgraph Lab</a></strong> so you can execute <strong>Cypher</strong> queries on the database directly and see visualized results.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understanding the Payment Fraud Detection Scenario</h2>
<p>First, let’s define all the roles in this scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Card</strong> - a credit card used for payment.</li>
<li><strong>POS</strong> - a point of sale device that uses a card to execute transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong> - a stored instance of buying something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your application will simulate how a POS device gets compromised, then a card in contact with that POS device gets compromised as well and in the end, a fraudulent transaction is reported.
Based on these reported transactions, Memgraph is used to search for the root-cause (a.k.a. the compromised POS) of the reported fraudulent transactions and all the cards that have fallen victim to it as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://public-assets.memgraph.com/how-to-develop-a-credit-card-fraud-detection-application-using-memgraph-flask-and-d3js/pos-graph.png" alt="Credit card fraud detection graph visualization"></p>
<p>Because this is a demo application you will create a set number of random cards, POS devices, and transactions. Some of these POS devices will be marked as compromised. If you find a compromised POS device, while searching for frauds in the network, then you’ll mark the card as compromised as well. If the card is compromised, there is a 0.1% chance the transaction is fraudulent and detected (regardless of the POS device). You can then visualize all the transactions and cards connected to that POS device and resolve them as not fraudulent if need be.</p>
<h2>Defining the Graph Schema</h2>
<p>After we defined the scenario, it’s time to create the graph schema!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A graph schema is a “dictionary” that defines the types of entities, vertices, and edges, in the graph and how those types of entities are related to one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so you know that there are three main entities in your model: <strong>Card</strong>, <strong>POS</strong> and <strong>Transaction</strong>.</p>
<p>The next step is to determine how these entities are represented in the graph and how they are connected. If you are not familiar with graph databases, a good rule of thumb is to use a relational analogy to get you started. All of these entities would be separate tables in a relational database and therefore they could be separate types of nodes in a graph. And so it is!
<img src="https://public-assets.memgraph.com/how-to-develop-a-credit-card-fraud-detection-application-using-memgraph-flask-and-d3js/graph-nodes.png" alt="Nodes"></p>
<p>Each type of node has a different label: <code>Card</code>, <code>Pos</code> and <code>Transaction</code>.
All of them have the property <code>id</code> so you can identify them. The nodes <code>Card</code> and <code>Pos</code> also have the boolean property <code>compromised</code> to indicate if fraudulent activity has taken place. The node <code>Transaction</code> has a similar boolean property with the name <code>fraudReported</code>.</p>
<p>But how are these nodes connected? The nodes labeled <code>Card</code> and <code>Transaction</code> are connected via a relationship of type <code>:USING</code>. Internalize the meaning by reading it out loud: a transaction is executed <em><strong>USING</strong></em> a card. In the same fashion, a transaction is executed <em><strong>AT</strong></em> a POS device so the relationship between <code>Transaction</code> and <code>POS</code> is of type <code>:AT</code>.</p>
<p>Using the Cypher query language notation, the data structure when there are no frauds looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>(:Card {compromised:false})&lt;-[:USING]-(:Transaction)-[:AT]-&gt;(:Pos {compromised: false})
</code></pre>
<p>The data structure when frauds occur:</p>
<pre><code>(:Card {compromised:true})&lt;-[:USING]-(:Transaction)-[:AT]-&gt;(:Pos {compromised: true})
(:Card {compromised:true})&lt;-[:USING]-(:Transaction {fraudReported:true})-[:AT]-&gt;(:Pos)
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://public-assets.memgraph.com/how-to-develop-a-credit-card-fraud-detection-application-using-memgraph-flask-and-d3js/graph-schema.png" alt="Credit Card Fraud Detection Graph schema"></p>
<h2>Building the Web Application Backbone</h2>
<p>This is presumably the easy part. You need to create a simple Python web application using Flask to be your server. Let’s start by creating a root directory for your project and naming it <code>card_fraud</code>. There you need to create a <code>requirements.txt</code> file containing the necessary PIP installs. For now, only one line is needed:</p>
<pre><code>Flask==1.1.2
</code></pre>
<p>You can install the specified package by running:</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Add a new file to your root directory with the name <code>card_fraud.py</code> and the following code:</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask
 
app = Flask(__name__)
 
 
@app.route('/')
@app.route('/index')
def index():
   return "Hello World"
</code></pre>
<p>You are probably rolling your eyes while reading this, but don’t mock the <em><strong>Hello World</strong></em> example! Let’s compile and run your server to see if everything works as expected. Open a terminal, position yourself in the root directory and execute the following two commands:</p>
<pre><code>export FLASK_APP=card_fraud.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
</code></pre>
<p>This way, you have defined the entry point of your app and set the environment to <code>development</code>. This will enable development features like automatic code reloading. Don’t forget to change this to <code>production</code> when you’re ready to deploy your app. To run the server, execute:</p>
<pre><code>flask run --host 0.0.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>You should see a message similar to the following, indicating that your server is up and running:</p>
<pre><code>* Serving Flask app "card_fraud"
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/
</code></pre>
<h2>Dockerizing the Application</h2>
<p>In the root directory of the project create two files, <code>Dockerfile</code> and <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. At the beginning of the <code>Dockerfile</code>, you specify the parent image and instruct the container to install CMake, mgclient, and pymgclient. CMake and mgclient are necessary to install pymgclient, the Python driver for Memgraph DB.</p>
<p>You don’t have to focus too much on this part, just copy the code to your <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span> python:<span>3.8</span>
 

<span>RUN</span><span> apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
  apt-get --yes install cmake</span>
 

<span>RUN</span><span> apt-get install -y git cmake make gcc g++ libssl-dev &amp;&amp; \
  git <span>clone</span> https://github.com/memgraph/mgclient.git /mgclient &amp;&amp; \
  <span>cd</span> mgclient &amp;&amp; \
  git checkout dd5dcaaed5d7c8b275fbfd5d2ecbfc5006fa5826 &amp;&amp; \
  mkdir build &amp;&amp; \
  <span>cd</span> build &amp;&amp; \
  cmake .. &amp;&amp; \
  make &amp;&amp; \
  make install</span>
 

<span>RUN</span><span> git <span>clone</span> https://github.com/memgraph/pymgclient /pymgclient &amp;&amp; \
  <span>cd</span> pymgclient &amp;&amp; \
  python3 setup.py build &amp;&amp; \
  python3 setup.py install</span>
 

<span>COPY</span><span> requirements.txt ./</span>
<span>RUN</span><span> pip3 install -r requirements.txt</span>

<p>If you are not familiar with Docker, do yourself a favor and take look at this: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/">Getting started with Docker</a>.</p>
<p>Next, you need to create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file. <strong>Compose</strong> is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. For this project, you’ll need two services. One is the web application (<code>sng_demo</code>) and the other a database instance (<code>memgraph</code>).</p>
<p>If you followed the instructions on <a href="https://docs.memgraph.com/memgraph/getting-started/installation/docker-installation">how to setup Memgraph DB with Docker</a> correctly you only need to add the following code to your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to run the container:</p>
<pre><code>version: "3"
services:
  memgraph:
    image: "memgraph"
    ports:
      - "7687:7687"
  card_fraud:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      MG_HOST: memgraph
      MG_PORT: 7687
    depends_on:
      - memgraph
</code></pre>
<p>When it comes to the <code>ports</code> key, there is an important distinction between the <strong>HOST_PORT</strong> and the <strong>CONTAINER_PORT</strong>. The first number in the key is the <strong>HOST_PORT</strong> and it can be used to connect from your host machine to the service (for example with <strong>Memgraph Lab</strong>). The second number specifies the <strong>CONTAINER_PORT</strong> which is used for service-to-service communication. More specifically, your service <code>card_fraud</code> can use this port to access the service <code>memgraph</code> and connect to the database.</p>
<p>The <code>environment</code> key contains <code>MG_HOST</code> and <code>MG_PORT</code> which represent environment variables in the service’s container. They store the <code>memgraph</code> service address and port which are needed to establish a database connection.</p>
<p>The <code>depends_on</code> key is used to start services in dependency order because
need the database to start before the web application.</p>
<p>The <code>build</code> key allows us to tell Compose where to find the build instructions as well as the files and/or folders used during …</p></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Over the years, company merchandise or, as the cool kids call them, swag (which stands for “stuff we all get”), especially from tech companies, has become something of a talking point and even a status symbol in some circles. </p><p>For some, it’s a status symbol to signal to others that you’re old school, you were around before <em>it all began</em>. As one <a href="https://qr.ae/pNjt1g">Quora user</a> pointed out, “what you really want is the swag from companies that looked impressive, but then died... You want that Enron keychain. You want the stuff that says, <em>I was there. I'm still here. They're not.</em> It makes a statement. ” </p><p>For others, it’s not about getting yet another Google water bottle or Facebook T-shirt. It’s about getting really useful stuff that’s durable, exclusive and memorable. That could be a <a href="https://qr.ae/pNjttJ">messenger bag from Quora</a>, a <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/what-happened-when-we-asked-200-companies-for-free-swag/">Tile from Airtable</a>, or <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/what-happened-when-we-asked-200-companies-for-free-swag/">an apron from Airbnb</a>. </p><p>According to <a href="https://swapnil.net/">Swapnil Agarwal</a>, the developer behind <a href="https://devswag.io/">DevSwag</a>, a site that curates opportunities for developers to collect swag, developers love swag because it helps them find their community. </p><blockquote><em>“For some developers, scoring swag feels like a badge of honor, achievement unlocked! They are more than happy to don a tee with a geeky quote or put a sticker on their laptop. This helps them project their preferences and find their tribe easily.” </em></blockquote><h3 id="why-do-companies-bother-with-swag"><strong>Why do companies bother with swag? </strong></h3><p>Companies invest in swag for various reasons. The most obvious one is to create hype and buzz around your brand. Did you know that one of the <a href="https://brightideaspromotional.co.uk/info/the-history-of-the-promotional-merchandise-industry/">earliest forms of swag</a> were the commemorative buttons produced to celebrate George Washington becoming the first President of the newly formed United States of America in 1789? It was 100 years later when two printers in Ohio, Jasper Meek and Henry Beach, realized that they could print advertisements on school bags, card cases and even horse hats, that the swag industry really began. </p><p>Since then, companies have been using swag to promote their brand, products and services. Think about those Slack socks, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tferriss/status/320447454657003520?lang=en">Tim Ferriss’ favorite Duolingo shirt</a>. The exposure those companies got from their swag, and still do to this day, is an investment that has definitely paid off. </p><p>Swag is also a good way to market to your own employees or show them your appreciation. It is also a great <a href="https://qz.com/work/1860082/employee-swag-is-a-remote-worker-culture-builder/">physical representation of a company's culture</a>. With the pandemic keeping people at home and employees working remotely, company swag offers that little bit of “connectedness” that we used to get from conversations around the coffee machine. &nbsp;</p><p>Companies are also using swag to incentivize people to contribute or engage with a brand or products. “Let's say (a company) wants to get beta users for a dev tool. It's far easier to get them with swag giveaways rather than traditional advertising,” says Swapnil.</p><p>Launched in 2018, <a href="https://devswag.io/">DevSwag</a> curates different opportunities available for developers to collect swag, and ranks the task difficulty for each opportunity. Tasks and rewards range from leaving a review for a podcast in exchange for stickers, to fixing a bug in exchange for a pair of socks. </p><figure><img src="https://codesubmit.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/swapnil-agarwal-devswag-1.png"></figure><h3 id="who-s-giving-out-swag"><strong>Who’s giving out swag? </strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/asi-reports-2019-promo-sales-hit-high-of-25-8-billion-301010174.html">Advertising Speciality Institute</a> (ASI) reported that sales for company merchandise rose by 4.7% compared to 2018, &nbsp;reaching a record high of USD 25.8 billion in 2019. </p><p>At the height of the promotional products industry, the team at <a href="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/what-happened-when-we-asked-200-companies-for-free-swag/">Kapwing</a> noticed that companies seemed to be giving out swag liberally and wanted to test out how common this was. So, they posed as college seniors “fan mailing” 201 companies asking if they could get some swag. </p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rGPMgvcTt4KKhIrcgICRVaaLcLqUBPx6ZDykvj2O426dHotfPZDHP7FBx9dMPLAI9YNP2DzBdetRrZsT6vnX3B2k0_nJ_mTpcKNCUzyfGNX7RxO50JckzK013wyzXDFZT74STRby"><figcaption>Source: Kapwing</figcaption></figure><p>Out of 201 companies, they successfully contacted 188 of them. They eventually received a response from 146 companies. Of those, they noted that B2C companies were more likely to respond than B2B companies, and B2C companies were more likely to offer swag than B2B companies. </p><p>Interestingly, tech or SaaS companies were the least likely to respond compared to other business types like apparel, beverage, and consumer goods. Their response rate was at 64% compared to other business types (82% to 87%). They also found that small to medium sized companies were more likely to give out company swag; these are companies with 11 to 49 employees, or companies with 50 to 249 employees respectively. </p><h3 id="is-swag-losing-its-swag"><strong>Is swag losing its <em>swag</em>?</strong> </h3><p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/apr/03/patagonia-fleece-vest-tech-bro-uniform">Patagonia</a> decided to shift its sales program to only work with companies that meet certain social and environmental standards, or in their words “mission-driven companies that prioritize the planet”. &nbsp;The company now requires more information about the type of company “whose name will appear on the Patagonia product and how the product will be used. We reserve the right to refuse service.”</p><p>Just as companies are becoming more conscious about what their brands stand for, their swag, their suppliers and swag recipients are becoming increasingly integrated into the brand’s narrative. The public’s perception of a brand, especially those of global powerhouses like Google, Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon, largely impact the swaggi-ness of a brand’s swag. </p><p>In January 2021, in light of Facebook banning former US President Donald Trump on social media, Facebook’s internal security team released a memo warning employees not to wear or carry Facebook-branded swag in public. As reported by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/facebook-warns-employees-not-to-wear-company-gear-in-pu-1846040220">Gizmodo</a>, “while the memo doesn’t appear to explicitly say Facebook employees are at risk of physical assault by Trump supporters, it’s easy to read between the lines”.</p><p>Public perception and public events also play a large role in the perceived swaggi-ness of a company. Just a week after Facebook’s memo, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-rebrands-storm-hill-event-capitol-violence-washington-dc-2021-1">Goldman Sachs</a>, had to quickly rebrand a virtual event they had organized to lobby Congress to help small businesses across America. The event that was originally called “Storm the Hill” definitely did not sit well with both organizers nor participants after what happened in Washington DC, and participants were urged not to wear the branded t-shirts that were mailed out to them prior.</p><p>Another factor that keeps swag cool and swaggy is its exclusivity. Slack’s socks, once exclusive, have now made their way to <a href="https://slack.shop/">Slack.shop</a>. Slack fans can now buy a pack of six pairs of socks for €49.80 along with a Slack t-shirt and a baby onesie. </p><figure><img src="https://codesubmit.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/slack-socks-1.png"><figcaption>The exclusivity of Slack's socks are gone, but fans and aspiring employees can <em>almost</em> live the dream by purchasing them online.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="the-environmental-impact-of-swag"><strong>The environmental impact of swag</strong></h3><p>At the end of 2019, the Meeting, Incentives, Conferences and Events (MICE) industry was <a href="https://www.cwt-meetings-events.com/futuretrends/page/3/1">expected to grow by USD 840 billion (8%) in 2020</a> with 52% more event websites popping up compared to 2019. CWT Meetings and Events reported that companies were spending 25% to 30% of their overall marketing budgets on live events. </p><p>It is common for people to attend these conferences and collect as many tote bags, t-shirts, water bottles, usb sticks, pens, stress balls, stickers, notebooks, hats, rubber wrist bands, beer bottle openers, and everything else that can be made cheaply and quickly, with a company’s logo slapped on for swagginess. </p><p>As <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90260185/its-time-to-stop-spending-billions-on-cheap-conference-swag">Elizabeth Segran</a> wrote, many of these companies’ merchandise aren’t well made or well designed, meaning that we’re likely to throw them out after just a handful of uses. </p><blockquote><em>“When you think about all the energy and resources that go into making just one of the tote bags that I have just thrown into the trash–only to end up in a landfill–the impact is staggering.”</em></blockquote><p>A quick Google search will show you that companies often compete over costs, but low costs comes at a high price for workers in countries like China, where most of these promotional products are made. By now, we’re aware of <a href="https://www.globalsources.com/NEWS/SIC-making-it-in-china-the-factory-workers-that-make-your-products.HTM">poor working conditions</a>, lack of safety standards, and very low wages. </p><p>This is why companies like Google have a vetted list of merchandise suppliers they work with—companies that sustainably source their materials and do not violate labour laws, meaning without child labour or inhumane working conditions. This could be the way forward for other companies who want to invest in company merchandise. </p><p>For Segran, the answer to both creating hype while reducing swag’s impact on the environment is to get rid of it entirely. As an alternative, she writes, “consider offering experiences. For instance, I’d appreciate a back massage at a conference, or perhaps a yoga class, or a free headshot. I’d even enjoy a good meal instead of a swag bag.” </p><p>She continues, “if you wrap the event in your branding, there’s a good chance your target customer will remember that experience long after the tote bag is stuffed in a landfill somewhere.”</p><h3 id="to-swag-or-not-to-swag"><strong>To swag or not to swag?</strong></h3><p>A quick browse of some HR groups on Facebook and LinkedIn uncover conversations where HR professionals are debating whether to give out company merchandise to employees over the recent year-end holidays, or if they should opt for gift cards as they’re a more “practical” way to support employees in this economic climate. Many rallied behind gift cards, especially the ever-versatile Visa gift cards, accepted nearly everywhere in the United States.</p><p>But if we’re real here, a multi-billion dollar industry is not going to disappear overnight or any time in the near future. In fact, ASI reported that while total swag sales dropped by 44% in Q2 2020, it had recovered about 20% of sales in Q3 2020 and a further 8% in Q4 2020. Total product sales for 2020 was USD 20.7 billion. </p><p>With the world going remote and people working from home, what swag did we spend all that money on? In 2020, it comes as no surprise that products like hand sanitizers contributed USD 1.4 billion in sales (7%), while other pandemic-related swag like branded cloth masks and other PPE made up USD 4.6 billion in sales (22%). </p><p>I believe that companies are becoming more intentional with the swag they give out. <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/thinking-outside-the-box-engaging-our-team-with-interactive-care-packages/">Duolingo</a>, for example, worked with <a href="https://www.swagup.com/">SwagUp</a> to create monthly “Interactive Care Packages” for employees during the pandemic to break up the monotony of staying at home. The care packages were designed to …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div id="ron_db"><p>We are pleased to introduce <a href="https://www.rondb.com/" target="_blank">RonDB</a>, the world’s fastest key-value store with SQL capabilities, available now in the cloud. RonDB is an open source distribution of NDB Cluster, thus providing the same core technology and performance as NDB, but as a managed platform in the cloud. RonDB is the best low-latency, high throughput, and high availability database available today. In addition, it also brings large data storage capabilities. RonDB is a critical component of the infrastructure needed to build feature stores, and, in general, real-time applications.</p><h2>Introducing RonDB</h2><p>RonDB is an <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/rondb" target="_blank">open source</a> distribution of NDB Cluster which has been used as a key-value store for applications for almost 20 years. The name RonDB is a synthesis of its inventor, Mikael Ronström, and its heritage NDB. RonDB is offered as a managed version of NDB Cluster, providing the fastest solution targeting the traditional applications that use NDB Cluster such as those used in telecom, finance, and gaming. RonDB provides a solution as the data layer for operational AI applications. RonDB gives online models access to reliable, low-latency, high-throughput storage for precomputed features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>RonDB is ideal for developers who require a real-time database that can (1) be quickly deployed&nbsp; (RonDB provides a possibility to set up an RonDB cluster in less than a minute), (2) handle millions of database operations per second, and (3) be elastically scaled up and down to match the current load, reducing operational costs.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>What is a key-value store?</h2><p>A key-value store associates a value with a unique identifier (a key) to enable easy storage, retrieval, searching, and updating of data using simple queries - making them ideal for organisations with large volumes of data that needs to be constantly retrieved and updated.<br></p><p>Distributed key-value stores, such as RonDB, are optimal for organisations with heavy read/write workloads on large data sets, thus being a good fit for businesses operating at scale. For example, they are a critical component of the infrastructure needed to build feature stores and many different types&nbsp; of interactive and real-time applications.</p><h2>The value of RonDB</h2><h3>Key-value store applications</h3><p>RonDB can be used to develop interactive online applications where storing, retrieving and updating data is essential, but there is also the possibility to search for data in the same system. RonDB provides efficient access using a partition key through either native APIs or SQL access.&nbsp;<br></p><p>RonDB supports distributed transactions enabling applications to perform any type of data modification. RonDB enables concurrent complex queries using SQL as part of the online application. Through its efficient partitioning scheme, RonDB can scale nodes to support hundreds of CPUs per node and then scale to hundreds of data nodes (tens of thousands of CPUs in total).</p><h3>SQL applications</h3><p>RonDB supports writing low latency, high availability SQL applications using its full SQL capabilities, providing a MySQL Server API.</p><h2>LATS: low Latency, high Availability, high Throughput, and scalable Storage</h2><p>RonDB is the fastest key-value store currently available and the only one with general purpose query capabilities, through its SQL support. The performance of key-value stores are evaluated based on low Latency, high Availability, high Throughput, and scalable Storage (LATS).&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/60364af8c8f5d47b1f1f70ce_graph_white.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><a href="http://www.irondb.com/"><strong>LATS</strong>: low <strong>L</strong>atency, high <strong>A</strong>vailability, high <strong>T</strong>hroughput, scalable <strong>S</strong>torage.</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Low Latency</h3><p>RonDB has shown the fastest response times: it can respond in 100-200 microseconds on individual requests and in less than a millisecond on batched read requests; it can also perform complex transactions in a highly loaded cluster within 10 milliseconds. Moreover, and perhaps even more importantly, RonDB has predictable latency.</p><h3>High Availability</h3><p>NDB Cluster can provide <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/mikaelronstrom/ndb-cluster-80requirements">Class 6 Availability</a>; in other words, an NDB system is operational 99.9999% of the time, thus <strong>no more than 30 seconds of downtime per year</strong>. RonDB brings the same type of availability now to the cloud, thus <strong>ensuring that RonDB is always available</strong>. RonDB allows you to place replicas within a cloud region on different availability zones, ensuring that failure of availability zones does not result in downtime for RonDB.</p><h3>High Throughput</h3><p>RonDB scales to up to hundreds of millions of read or write ops/seconds. A single RonDB instance on a virtual machine can support millions of key value operations per second,&nbsp; and, without downtime, can be scaled up&nbsp; to a large cluster that supports hundreds of millions of key value operations per second.</p><h3>Scalable Storage</h3><p>RonDB offers large dataset capabilities, being able to store up to petabytes of data.Individual RonDB data nodes can store up to 16TBytes of in-memory data and many tens of TBytes of disk data. Given that RonDB clusters can scale up to 144 data nodes, an RonDB cluster can be scaled to store petabytes of data.</p><h3>LATS Performance</h3><p>The combination of predictable low latency, the ability to handle millions of operations per second, and a unique high availability solution makes RonDB the leading LATS database, that is now also available in the cloud.</p><h2>RonDB as online feature stores</h2><p>RonDB is the foundation of the <a href="https://www.hopsworks.ai/utm_source=rondb">Hopsworks Online Feature Store</a>. For those unfamiliar with the concept of feature store, it is a data warehouse of features for machine learning. It contains two databases: an online database serving features at low latency to online applications and an offline database storing large volumes of historic feature values.&nbsp;</p><p>The online feature store provides the data (features) that underlie the models used in intelligent online applications. For example, it helps inform an intelligent decision about whether a financial transaction is suspected of money laundering or not by providing the real-time information about the user’s credit history, recent card usage, location of the transaction, and so on. Thus, the most important requirements from the feature store are quick and consistent responses (low latency), handling large volumes of key lookups (high throughput), and being always available (high availability). In addition an online feature store should be able to scale as the business grows. RonDB is the only database available in the market that meets all these requirements.<br></p><h2>Get Started</h2><p>We’re not releasing RonDB publicly just yet. Instead, we have made it available as early access. If you think your team could benefit from RonDB, <a href="https://www.rondb.com/">please contact us</a>!<br></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

Sean Moriarity and I are glad to announce that the project we have been working on for the last 3 months, Nx, is finally <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx">publicly available on GitHub</a>. Our goal with Nx is to provide the foundation for Numerical Elixir.</p>
<p>
In this blog post, I am going to outline the work we have done so far, some of the design decisions, and what we are planning to explore next. If you are looking for other resources to learn about Nx, you can <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/podcast-episodes/034-jose-valim-reveals-project-nx/">hear me unveiling Nx on the ThinkingElixir podcast</a>.</p>
<h2>
  Nx</h2>
<p>
Nx is a multi-dimensional tensors library for Elixir with multi-staged compilation to the CPU/GPU. Let’s see an example:</p>

As you see, tensors have a type (s64) and a shape (2x2). Tensor operations are also done with the <code>Nx</code> module. To implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">the Softmax function</a>:</p>

<p>
The high-level features in Nx are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
Typed multi-dimensional tensors, where the tensors can be unsigned integers (<code>u8</code>, <code>u16</code>, <code>u32</code>, <code>u64</code>), signed integers (<code>s8</code>, <code>s16</code>, <code>s32</code>, <code>s64</code>), floats (<code>f32</code>, <code>f64</code>) and brain floats (<code>bf16</code>);    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/NamedTensor">Named tensors</a>, allowing developers to give names to each dimension, leading to more readable and less error prone codebases;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Automatic differentiation, also known as autograd. The <code>grad</code> function provides reverse-mode differentiation, useful for simulations, training probabilistic models, etc;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Tensors backends, which enables the main <code>Nx</code> API to be used to manipulate binary tensors, GPU-backed tensors, sparse matrices, and more;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Numerical definitions, known as <code>defn</code>, provide multi-stage compilation of tensor operations to multiple targets, such as highly specialized CPU code or the GPU. The compilation can happen either ahead-of-time (AOT) or just-in-time (JIT) with a compiler of your choice;    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For Python developers, <code>Nx</code> currently takes its main inspirations from <a href="https://numpy.org/"><code>Numpy</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/jax"><code>JAX</code></a> but packaged into a single unified library.</p>
<p>
Our initial efforts have focused on the underlying abstractions. For example, while Nx implements dense tensors out-of-the-box, we also want the same high-level API to be valid for sparse tensors. You should also be able to use all functions in the <code>Nx</code> module with tensors that are backed by Elixir binaries and with tensors that are stored directly in the GPU.</p>
<p>
By ensuring the underlying tensor backend is ultimately replaceable, we can build an ecosystem of libraries on top of Nx, and allow end-users to experiment with different backends, hardware, and approaches to run their software on.</p>
<p>
<em>Nx’s mascot is the Numbat, a marsupial native to southern Australia. Unfortunately the Numbat are endangered and it is estimated to be fewer than 1000 left. If you are excited about Nx, consider donating to Numbat conservation efforts, such as <a href="https://www.numbat.org.au/">Project Numbat</a> and <a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/">Australian Wildlife Conservancy</a>.</em></p>
<h2>
Numerical definitions</h2>
<p>
One of the most important features in <code>Nx</code> is the numerical definition, called <code>defn</code>. Numerical definitions are a subset of Elixir tailored for numerical computing. Here is the <code>softmax</code> formula above, now written with <code>defn</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Formula</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="4374234550-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>Nx.Defn</span><span>

    </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-4">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-4">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-5">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-6">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-6">)</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-5">)</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="4374234550-3">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The first difference we see with <code>defn</code> is that Elixir’s built-in operators have been augmented to also work with tensors. Effectively, <code>defn</code> replaces Elixir’s <code>Kernel</code> with <code>Nx.Defn.Kernel</code>.</p>
<p>
However, <code>defn</code> goes even further. When using <code>defn</code>, <code>Nx</code> builds a computation with all of your tensor operations. Let’s inspect it:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0485630283-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>inspect_expr</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-3">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-4">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-4">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-5">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-6">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-6">)</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-5">)</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-3">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Now when invoked, you will see this printed:</p>

</span><span data-group-id="0315994704-21">&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>
This computation graph can also be transformed programatically. The transformation is precisely how we implement automatic differentiation, also known as <code>autograd</code>, by traversing each node and computing their derivative:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>grad_softmax</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6961223907-2">do</span><span>

</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Finally, this computation graph can also be handed out to different compilers. As an example, we have implemented bindings for <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/">Google’s XLA</a> compiler, called EXLA. We can ask the <code>softmax</code> function to use this new compiler with a module attribute:</p>
<pre><code><span>@defn_compiler</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="9487003846-1">{</span><span>EXLA</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>client</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:host</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-1">}</span><span>

  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-4">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-4">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-5">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-6">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-6">)</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-5">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-3">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Once <code>softmax</code> is called, <code>Nx.Defn</code> will invoke <code>EXLA</code> to emit a just-in-time and highly-specialized compiled version of the code, tailored to the tensor type and shape. By passing <code>client: :cuda</code> or <code>client: :rocm</code>, the code can be compiled for the GPU. For reference, here are some benchmarks of the function above when called with a tensor of one million random float values on different clients:</p>

Where <code>keep</code> indicates the tensor was kept on the device instead of being transferred back to Elixir. You can see the benchmark in the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/bench"><code>bench</code></a> directory and find some examples in the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/examples"><code>examples</code></a> directory of the EXLA project.</p>
<h3>
Compiling numerical definitions</h3>
<p>
Before moving forward, it is important for us to take a look at how numerical definitions are compiled. For example, take the <code>softmax</code> function:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0256028582-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-3">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-4">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-5">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-5">)</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-4">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
One might think that Elixir takes the AST of the softmax function above and compiles it directly to the GPU. However, that’s not the case! Numerical definitions are first compiled to Elixir code that will emit the computation graph and this computation graph is then compiled to the GPU. The multiple stages go like this:</p>
<pre><code>Elixir AST
-&gt; compiles to .beam (Erlang VM bytecode)
   -&gt; executes into defn AST
      -&gt; compiles to GPU</code></pre>
<p>
This multi-stage programming is made possible thanks to Elixir macros. For example, when you see a conditional inside <code>defn</code>, that conditional looks exactly like Elixir conditionals, but it will be compiled to an accelerator:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>any?</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-3">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">do</span><span>
    </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">else</span><span>
    </span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In a nutshell, <code>defn</code> provides us with a subset of Elixir for numerical computations that can be compiled to specific hardware, such as CPU, GPU, and other accelerators. All of this was possible without making changes or forking the language.</p>
<p>
And while <code>defn</code> is a subset of the language, it is a considerable one. You will find support for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Mathematical operators  </li>
  <li>
Pipes (<code>|&gt;</code>), module attributes, the access syntax (i.e. <code>tensor[1][1..-1]</code>), etc  </li>
  <li>
Elixir macros constructs (imports, aliases, etc)  </li>
  <li>
Control-flow with conditionals (both <code>if</code> and <code>cond</code>), loops (coming soon), etc  </li>
  <li>
Transformations, an explicit mechanism to invoke Elixir code from a <code>defn</code> (which enables constructs such as <code>grad</code>)  </li>
</ul>
<p>
And more coming down the road.</p>
<h2>
Why functional programming?</h2>
<p>
At this point, you may be wondering: is functional programming a good fit for numerical computing? One of the main concerns is that immutability can be expensive when working with large blobs of memory. And that’s a valid concern! In fact, when using the default tensor backend, tensors will be backed by Elixir binaries which are copied on every operation. That’s why it was critical for us to design <code>Nx</code> with pluggable backends from day one.</p>
<p>
However, as we move to higher-level abstractions, such as numerical definitions, we will start to reap the benefits of functional programming.</p>
<p>
For example, in order to build computation graphs, immutability becomes an indispensable tool both in terms of implementation and reasoning. The JAX library for Python, which has been one of the guiding lights for Nx design, also promotes functional and immutable principles:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>JAX is intended to be used with a functional style of programming</em>  </p>
  <p>
— <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.ops.html?highlight=functional#indexed-update-operators">JAX Docs</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>Unlike NumPy arrays, JAX arrays are always immutable</em>  </p>
  <p>
— <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/thinking_in_jax.html?highlight=immutable#JAX-vs.-NumPy">JAX Docs</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, frameworks like <a href="https://thinc.ai/">Thinc.ai</a> argue that functional programming can provide better abstractions and more composable building blocks for deep learning libraries.</p>
<p>
We hope that, by exploring these concepts in a language that is functional by design, Elixir can bring new ideas and insights at the higher-level.</p>

What is next?</h2>

There is a lot of work ahead of us and we definitely cannot …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>RabbitMQ and Google Pub/Sub are both powerful and reliable message queue implementations, and if you need to pick one of them for your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, the choice may not be simple. We recently started a new project that required a message broker integrated into the solution, and although there are several choices on the market, we quickly narrowed down our options to these two products. This blog post is the first part of the summary of our analysis.</p><p>The project in question — an apartment rental platform for Swiss clients — had to meet both scalability and geographically restricted hosting requirements. When we began, GCP was the most viable option for meeting these requirements. However, the technology was new to us, which meant we needed to reconsider some of our technology choices.</p><p>In this new software, some of our services were going to communicate via message queues, which meant we also needed to choose a message queue implementation that could be deployed to GCP. Additionally, it was important that we decided on something reliable.</p><p>In a non-GCP project, RabbitMQ would be the preferred choice because it’s well-known among our team, it has a convenient administrative interface, it has extensively configurable message distribution and routing, and most importantly, its documentation is well-maintained and thorough.</p><p>However, RabbitMQ is not a native building block of the GCP infrastructure — we can still install it fairly easily from the GCP Marketplace as a Click to Deploy container, but as a custom install, there’s no service-level agreement (SLA) for it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pub/Sub is GCP’s native implementation for message queues. We hadn’t used it before, but after a quick look at the official developer documentation, our first impressions were positive. Setting up queues requires just a few clicks, and there’s documentation with examples of how to use the queues with some widely used programming languages.</p><p>Let’s explore the benefits of each solution and see how easy it is to build up a queue topology with RabbitMQ and Pub/Sub.</p><p>The general idea of a message broker is to relay messages from publishers to consumers by routing them to different delivery queues. So, we’ll first look at the basic building blocks of RabbitMQ and Pub/Sub to see how much they differ from one another.</p><figure><img src="https://engineering.3ap.ch/message-broker-generic.svg" alt="publishers routing logic queues consumers" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The idea of a message broker</figcaption></figure><p><em>RabbitMQ</em> is an open source message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) standard, and with its various plugins, it also supports other protocols, including Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) and MQ Telemetry Transport. In this post, we’ll focus on RabbitMQ’s AMQP features.</p><p>In RabbitMQ, the topology is built up from <strong>exchanges</strong> and <strong>queues</strong> that are connected by <strong>bindings</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://engineering.3ap.ch/rabbitmq-broker.svg" alt="publishers exchanges bindings queues consumers" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The RabbitMQ broker building blocks</figcaption></figure><h2 id="exchanges">Exchanges</h2><p>Exchanges make it possible to define the routing of messages to queues connected to the exchange. Message publishers have to send their messages to exchanges, and from there, they’re routed to queues.</p><p>Exchanges can be created on demand by the publisher or the consumer, and they must be declared with a name and a type. The table below shows the four possible types of exchanges, along with their behaviors:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Exchange Type</th><th>Behavior</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Direct</td><td>The message goes to the queues with a binding key that matches the routing key of the message exactly.</td></tr><tr><td>Topic</td><td>This routes messages to queues based on a wildcard match between the routing key and the routing pattern.</td></tr><tr><td>Headers</td><td>These are similar to Topic exchanges, but they use headers and optional values for routing.</td></tr><tr><td>Fanout</td><td>This broadcasts all the messages it receives to all the queues it knows. Routing keys are ignored.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In a <em>topic exchange</em>, wildcards can be used for defining bindings based on routing keys.</p><p>Let’s suppose our broker propagates messages with routing keys following this structure: <code>transaction.&lt;product&gt;.&lt;city&gt;.&lt;productcode&gt;</code> — for example, <code>transaction.stock.london.ABC</code>, <code>transaction.bond.frankfurt.DEF</code>, and <code>transaction.stock.newyork.JKL</code>. We can define the following kinds of binding rules for such routing keys:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Binding Rule</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>transaction.stock.london.#</code></td><td>Matches any routing key starting with <code>transaction.stock.london.</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>transaction.*.london.#</code></td><td>Matches routing keys starting with <code>transaction</code>, then with any string as the second element, followed by <code>london</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>With <em>header exchanges</em>, you can specify matching rules for header attribute values.</p><p>Let’s suppose all our messages have a <code>format</code> and a <code>type</code> header attribute and they look like <code>{format = jpg, type = profilephoto}</code>, <code>{format = pdf, type = workpermit}</code>, or <code>{format = jpg, type = workpermit}</code>. The header exchange may define conjunctive and disjunctive binding rules by listing headers with their expected values, such as:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Binding Rule</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>{format = jpg, type = workpermit, x-match = all}</code></td><td>Matches messages with the arguments <code>format = jpg</code> AND <code>type = workpermit</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>{format = jpg, type = profilephoto, x-match = any}</code></td><td>Matches messages with the argument <code>format = jpg</code> OR <code>type = profilephoto</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>By default, every RabbitMQ broker installation comes with a set of <em>predeclared exchanges</em> for each exchange type:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Exchange Type</th><th>Default Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Direct</td><td><code>amq.direct</code> or empty string</td></tr><tr><td>Topic</td><td><code>amq.topic</code></td></tr><tr><td>Headers</td><td><code>amq.headers</code> (and the AMQP standard <code>amq.match</code>)</td></tr><tr><td>Fanout</td><td><code>amq.fanout</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <em>default exchange</em> is the direct exchange with no name (empty string). It has a useful feature that comes in handy for simple applications: Every queue that’s created is bound to this direct exchange with a routing key that’s the same as the queue name.</p><p>In addition to types, exchanges have some other important features, outlined below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Durability</td><td>Durable exchanges survive broker restarts, while transient ones don’t.</td></tr><tr><td>Auto-delete</td><td>An exchange can be deleted automatically as soon as the last queue is unbound from it.</td></tr><tr><td>Internal</td><td>This specifies whether or not the exchange is reserved for internal use by the broker only.</td></tr><tr><td>Arguments</td><td>This is a user-definable attribute list where the values can be of type string, list, number, or Boolean. A reserved argument name is <code>alternate-exchange</code>.</td></tr><tr><td>Alternate exchange</td><td>If the routing of messages isn’t possible via any of the bindings, messages will be sent to the alternate exchange if specified.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="queues">Queues</h2><p>Queues are named resources that store messages consumed by applications. Some important attributes (or arguments, as they’re referred to in RabbitMQ) are outlined below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>x-max-priority</code></td><td>If this is set, the queue can handle message priorities.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-message-ttl</code></td><td>After the TTL period expires, the message will be discarded from the queue.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-expires</code></td><td>If the queue remains unused for the specified period, it’ll automatically be deleted.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-max-length</code></td><td>This is the maximum number of messages in the queue.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-max-length-bytes</code></td><td>This is the total body size of messages a queue can contain.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-overflow</code></td><td>This specifies what should happen with messages if the queue is full. It can start dropping the oldest or the newest messages or republish the newest ones to the dead letter queue.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-dead-letter-exchange</code></td><td>This is an optional dead letter exchange.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-dead-letter-routing-key</code></td><td>The routing key of dead-lettered messages can be optionally replaced.</td></tr><tr><td><code>x-queue-mode</code></td><td>If this is set to <code>lazy</code>, all the messages are written to disk. This causes some performance degradation, but it eliminates unexpected glitches in performance.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Consumers get messages from the queues using a push or a pull mechanism. Push-style delivery happens via consumer channels that should be registered by the consumer application with a <code>basic.consume</code> request. When the broker pushes a message to the consumer (<code>basic.deliver</code>), the consumer has to acknowledge the receipt. This acknowledgement can be positive (<code>basic.ack</code>), negative (<code>basic.nack</code>), or a rejection (<code>basic.reject</code>). The broker doesn’t remove the message from the queue until it gets some kind of acknowledgement. Depending on the acknowledgement type, the message can be deleted, requeued, or rerouted.</p><p>The consumer can be registered in auto-acknowledgement mode, but it’s quite risky, because in this case, the queue automatically removes the message from the queue once it’s been pushed to the consumer, and it doesn’t wait for any processing acknowledgement (meaning that if the consumer dies, the message gets lost).</p><p>The other possibility for the consumer is to poll the queues directly by using <code>basic.get</code> requests. This is expensive compared to push-style delivery, because the consumer has to both repeatedly check if there are new messages in the queue and wait for a response.</p><h2 id="dead-letter-exchanges">Dead Letter Exchanges</h2><p>We can use dead letter exchanges to catch messages that weren’t processed by the consumer for some reason. Messages can be republished to a dead letter exchange if:</p><ul><li>The message was negatively acknowledged (<code>basic.nack</code> or <code>basic.reject</code>).</li><li>The message expired due to its TTL.</li><li>The message was dropped because its queue is over the length limit.</li></ul><h2 id="rabbitmq-messages">RabbitMQ Messages</h2><p>A message consists of the message body and additional attributes (some of them are known as headers). Some predefined attributes include:</p><ul><li>Content type</li><li>Encoding</li><li>Routing key</li><li>Delivery mode (persistent or not)</li><li>Priority (effective only on queues that have priorities enabled)</li><li>Publishing timestamp</li><li>Expiration period</li><li>Publisher application ID</li></ul><h2 id="sending-a-message-with-rabbitmq">Sending a Message with RabbitMQ</h2><p>Messages have to be published to exchanges, and the exchanges route them to the queues. When sending a message, the publisher has to specify the routing key and the exchange name. If the exchange name is specified as an empty string, the message is directly routed to the queue that has the same name as its routing key (see the explanation of default exchanges in the <a href="#exchanges">Exchanges section above</a>
).</p><p>Pub/Sub is Google’s message broker implementation. It’s a native building block of the Google Cloud infrastructure and can be used exclusively in Google Cloud. We only have to enable the Pub/Sub Services in our GCP project, and then we can start integrating our application with this service.</p><p>In Pub/Sub, we can build our queue topology from <strong>topics</strong> and <strong>subscriptions</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://engineering.3ap.ch/pubsub-broker.svg" alt="publishers topics subscriptions consumers" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The Pub/Sub broker building blocks</figcaption></figure><h2 id="topics">Topics</h2><p>Topics…</p></div></div>

                        <div>
                            <h3>How we got to this decision and what we got out of it.<br></h3>
                            <div><p>We develop our main product, the Cranmera MPC engine, in C++20. (Why we chose Modern C++ and not, for example, Rust, is a topic for another blogpost.)&nbsp;Because&nbsp;C++ doesn’t come with a default build system like Rust’s Cargo, it&nbsp;means that it is up to the programmer to choose an appropriate build&nbsp;system.&nbsp;(Strictly speaking, I should say ‘build system generator’, as&nbsp;Ninja is the actual build system that we use, but let’s not get into that today.)</p><p>This choice is of course not just a disadvantage; in that you actually have a choice. As CMake is quite popular in the C++ community these days, I had been using CMake for several years now. (And before that I used GNU’s Automake.) Anyway, in the beginning, I was satisfied with my choice for CMake, although I never had the feeling that I really mastered CMake.</p></div>
                            <h4>"I want to have that ultimate control also over my build system"<br></h4>
                            <div><p>In my previous role as academic researcher, I mainly wrote scientific code for which the build system played a minor role. I&nbsp;liked to view the build system as a part that you ‘mess around with it&nbsp;until it works, and then keep your hands off it’, which served my&nbsp;purpose well enough at the time. Now that I have the role of CTO in a&nbsp;privacy-technology company, I bear much more responsibility for the&nbsp;quality and robustness of the developed codebase.</p><p>Even before you have to choose a build system, there is the choice of&nbsp;the programming language for a new project. In a nutshell: choose the right tool given the problem. For us, that choice happens to be C++, which gives us ultimate control. (There is a price to pay for this level of control, namely that you become responsible for managing all resources within the program, and for protecting yourself against the footguns that any language with low-level features happily offers you. </p><p>The purpose of having all that control is that it should ultimately pay off in terms of better performance: smaller memory footprint, faster code, etc., though it comes with the price of extra cognitive load during development.)<br>I want to have that ultimate control also over my build system, but as I already indicated above, with CMake it never felt like having that level of control.</p></div>
                            <h4>Coming from CMake<br></h4>
                            <div><p>Recently,&nbsp;we have migrated from CMake to Meson, and in the rest of this blogpost I&nbsp;want to tell the story of how we got to this decision and what we got out of it. </p><p>The&nbsp;main reason for migrating our build system, is that I wanted to prevent&nbsp;the scenario where some parts of the codebase, of which you actually know that those are a bit messy (in this case, our CMake scripts), suddenly start playing up at a very bad moment, for example just before&nbsp;the deadline of shipping a new product. </p><p>If&nbsp;you have some engineering experience, you will agree that the more subtle kind of technical problems like to manifest themselves in&nbsp;atypical situations or corner cases. What I mean, in terms of a build system, is that you won’t notice the actual quality of your build system&nbsp;scripts until you start doing special things, like porting to other&nbsp;OSes, architectures and cross-compiling. At that point you will be penalized for every ‘hack’, where you did not follow the idiom prescribed by the makers of the (build) system. And where are those&nbsp;hacks actually located? In your own build scripts, or in the “FindXXX.cmake” scripts you found somewhere on GitHub? </p></div>
                            <h4>Modern CMake<br></h4>
                            <div><p>Then there is the topic of “Modern CMake”, caused by the paradigm shift that&nbsp;took place a few years ago in CMake, due to which we now have the “old”&nbsp;(read: “wrong”) directory-based style, versus the “modern” (and recommended) target-based style. “Modern CMake” is probably coined to make us think of “Modern C++”, the latter being the novel style of C++ that encourages the use of updated and less error-prone language and standard-library constructs.&nbsp;<br>With respect to the language C++, I value the backwards compatibility guarantees that C++ offers, and I agree that those backwards-compatibility benefits make up for the ugly parts of its syntax. With respect to a build system, however, I am not convinced of the value of such backwards compatibility, and in my opinion, a clean syntax and well-thought-out structure is much to be preferred.&nbsp;</p><p>By the way, googling for “modern CMake” yields quite many blog posts in which authors explain the intricacies of Modern CMake. One could view the abundance of such stories as a positive thing, though I can’t help regarding it as an indicator for the poor style of CMake’s own documentation. Compared to that, Meson’s documentation, together with its design, simply feels ‘right’.&nbsp;</p><p>Before deciding to switch our build system, I have tried to convert our CMake scripts to the “Modern CMake” idiom and polish them up. After putting some work in it, meaning reading CMake docs and changing scripts, I was still not satisfied with the result. Probably it was my own fault; I still did not yet fully understand CMake’s new idioms, and as a consequence our build system setup still felt brittle. On the other hand, given that our build system requirements are not that complex, why&nbsp;should I invest more time to become an expert in a system (CMake) that I anyway appreciate less the more I read about it... What about&nbsp;alternatives?&nbsp;</p></div>
                            <h4>Choosing Meson<br></h4>
                            <div><p>Before choosing Meson, I also considered build2 by Boris Kolpackov / Code Synthesis. Build2 is famous for being one of the earliest build systems&nbsp;to support C++20 Modules, and based on its descriptions and the author’s&nbsp;talks (e.g. at CPPCon) this system seems to be well-designed, more&nbsp;advanced than most other build systems, and to have a lot of potential. However, given my limited amount of time, I was unable to quickly figure&nbsp;out from its documentation how I could accomplish common tasks, like linking with libs that are not included in the related cppget.org repository, such as Boost. I think improving documentation-for-the-impatient is something where Build2 could improve.&nbsp;BTW, I am curious to see how Meson’s approach to dealing with C++20&nbsp;modules will develop; we do not yet use them in our project.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not want claim that our build system requirements are very complex, though we do need some special setup:&nbsp;<br>- we need multi-compiler support (Clang for debug and GCC for release builds);<br>- depending on the use of Address Sanitizer, or Valgrind, we need&nbsp;differently compiled versions of some Boost libs (Boost.Context and Boost.Fiber); and<br>- we use a some generated code, which originates from Cap’n Proto, a protobuf-like library for object serialization.</p><p>With&nbsp;Meson, all these were easy to accomplish (for the third I use a little helper Python script), and, maybe even more importantly, in such a way that I fully understand what is going on under the hood.</p><p>Furthermore, some personal favourites about Meson are:<br>-&nbsp;the concept of a dependency, which lets you bundle libraries with include paths, and the different ways to obtain such dependency (automatic vs. manually)<br>- one does not have to specify header files in the executable target to make IDEs happy<br>- integration with pkg-config and CMake, to locate system-installed libs<br>- easy-to-manage configuration options&nbsp;<br>- out-of-the-box support common stuff (sanitizer support, coverage builds, stripping binaries, etc.)<br>- easy-to-extend while maintaining transparency<br>- parallel unit tests</p></div>
                            <h4>To conclude<br></h4>
                            <div><p>A&nbsp;key benefit of a good and transparent build system is that it will save you time, and that it makes it much easier to use helper tools that&nbsp;will improve code quality, like Clang’s static analyzer, Address Sanitizer, coverage builds, etcetera. We are very happy with Meson,&nbsp;thanks Jussi Pakkanen!</p></div>

<pre><span>def</span> <span>start_a</span>(b: B, c: C) -&gt; A:
    ...
      <span>"--b-url"</span>, b.url,
      <span>"--c-url"</span>, c.url,
    ...
    <span>return</span> A(...)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This defines a function which takes two arguments, of types "B" and "C",
and which returns a value of type "A".
</p>

<p>
Naturally, if you want an A, you've got create a B and a C first:
exactly the invariant we want to enforce.
</p>

<p>
One can define such types for one's own services,
and include all the relevant information in them,
such as URLs to use to interact with them.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Keep track of complex values using types.
</p>

<p>
Suppose service D can run in multiple different modes;
say, it can either listen on an HTTP or HTTP2 URL.
And suppose some other service E can only work with service D if it's in HTTP2 mode.
</p>

<p>
We can represent this with types:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>def</span> <span>start_e</span>(d: D[HTTP2Url]) -&gt; E:
    ...
      <span>"--d-url"</span>, d.url, <span># </span><span>an HTTP2Url</span>
    ...
    <span>return</span> E(...)


<span>def</span> <span>main</span>(d: D[HTTPUrl]) -&gt; E:
    <span># </span><span>type error!</span>
    <span>return</span> start_e(d)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The D class here takes a type argument specifying what the type of <code>d.url</code> is.
We can do this with generics or templates in most modern languages.
</p>

<p>
In <code>main</code>, we call <code>start_e</code> with the wrong type of <code>D</code>,
and we'll get a compile-time type error as a result.
</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>
Create different environments by <a href="http://catern.com/config.html">passing different arguments to functions</a>.
</p>

<p>
Suppose service F has an optional dependency on service G;
it can run whether or not service G is available.
</p>

<p>
We can represent this by passing different arguments to our <code>start_f</code> function in different environments:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>def</span> <span>start_f</span>(g: Optional[G]) -&gt; F:
    ...
    <span>if</span> g:
       ... <span>"--g-url"</span>, g.url ...
    <span>else</span>:
       <span>pass</span>
    <span>return</span> F(...)

<span>def</span> <span>environment_one</span>() -&gt; <span>None</span>:
    g = ...
    <span>f</span> = start_f(g)
    ...


<span>def</span> <span>environment_two</span>() -&gt; <span>None</span>:
    f = start_f(<span>None</span>)
    ...
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can use <code>environment_one</code> or <code>environment_two</code>, each where appropriate.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Test the distributed system through normal language-level tests.
</p>

<p>
Since our distributed system is started by a normal program,
we can use standard testing libraries to write our tests.
</p>

<p>
For example, Python's standard library has a <code>unittest</code> module which works fine:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>import</span> unittest

<span>class</span> <span>TestThings</span>(unittest.TestCase):
    <span>def</span> <span>setupTest</span>(<span>self</span>) -&gt; <span>None</span>:
        ...
        <span>self</span>.h = start_h(...)

    <span>def</span> <span>test_some_things</span>(<span>self</span>) -&gt; <span>None</span>:
        <span>self</span>.assertIn(<span>"OK"</span>, requests.get(<span>self</span>.h.url + <span>"/status"</span>))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
These tests should be stored alongside the code,
just as with normal programs.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Explore interactively using the REPL or debugger.
</p>

<p>
The functions that start our system can be called from a REPL or debugger with no additional effort.
</p>
<div>
<pre>&gt;&gt; <span>i</span> = start_i(...)
&lt;I <span>object</span> at 0x7fb3a45a4290&gt;
&gt;&gt; <span>j</span> = start_j(i, ...)
&lt;J <span>object</span> at 0x7fb3a45a4490&gt;
&gt;&gt; j.url
<span>"https://example.com"</span>
</pre>
</div></li>
<li><p>
Use asynchronous code to monitor multiple processes in the background.
</p>

<p>
Each process needs to be monitored for failure.
If, for example, a process exits, appropriate action needs to be taken,
such as restarting that process or a larger collection of processes,
or signaling a fatal error.
</p>

<p>
You can use the asynchronous support in your language to monitor all the <a href="https://github.com/catern/rsyscall">processes</a> at once.
</p>

<p>
If a process exits, that can be indicated through your language's usual error-handling method
(by raising an exception, for Python),
and the error can be caught and reacted to at the appropriate level,
or allowed to propagate.
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>async def</span> <span>start_k</span>(nursery: trio.Nursery) -&gt; <span>K</span>:
    nursery.start_soon(run_command_and_wait_on_subprocess, [<span>"k"</span>, ...])
    <span>return</span> K(...)

<span>async def</span> <span>main</span>():
    <span>async with</span> trio.open_nursery() <span>as</span> nursery:
        k = <span>await</span> start_k(nursery)
</pre>
</div></li>
<li><p>
Avoid external dependencies and special privileges.
</p>

<p>
Most normal programs don't require calling out to external services,
nor do they require that the user hold special privileges in some authorization system.
</p>

<p>
A program or library which starts distributed systems will be more useful
if it likewise can be used without such special setup.
It will be usable in a wider range of environments,
and by a wider range of users.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
By using these techniques,
I've found it's even easier to achieve a <a href="http://catern.com/run.html">runnable system</a>.

February 24, 2021 | https://tailscale.com/blog/rotate-ssh-keys/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/rotate-ssh-keys/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>If you’re like most people, your answer to this is… “What? Why?”</p>
<p>When ssh was introduced back in the 1990s, its appeal was simple. Passwords are too short, too guessable, too <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190114">phishable</a>, too often <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5586/why-do-people-think-that-this-is-bad-way-to-hash-passwords">stored incorrectly</a>, too MITM-able, too brute-forceable. Also its primary competition was rsh’s classic “no authentication,” but we don’t talk about that.</p>
<p>Compared to that, ssh public-key authentication was a dream. Generate a keypair, don’t ever share the private key with anyone, and if an attacker ever steals your authorized_keys file, the joke’s on them, because all they can do with your public key is authorize <em>you</em> to break into <em>their</em> server. Suckers!</p>
<p>It’s pretty great. And that greatness might lead you to wonder: why, then, 25 years after we learned this important lesson, are all the most secure websites on the Internet still using password authentication? Well, some good reasons, some not-so-good reasons. TLS client-side certs in web browsers have been tried many times and failed many times. That’s a story for another day.</p>
<p>My story for today is about ssh and how even public keys, while much better than simple passwords, are still not a perfect solution.</p>
<p>The danger is credential theft, which is a fancy way of saying “someone stole your private keys.” Back in the 1990s, that problem was pretty far from our minds; Windows 98 didn’t even have the concept of a separate administrator account, never mind the idea of app sandboxing or the inkling that someone might intentionally want to load malware onto your computer and encrypt all your files for ransomware. Those were the days when some people thought ActiveX controls (essentially loading .exe files from web sites) might be a good idea. Actually, maybe even a great idea as long as there was an “are you sure?” dialog box first.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, how did anything ever work? What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>Anyway, public key authentication was an amazingly advanced level of protection at the time. Normal people who used ssh keys didn’t have to worry much about attacks, because there were much easier targets: the <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?IdontHaveToBeTheFastestJustFasterThanYou">run faster than the bear</a> solution.</p>
<p>Time has passed, though, and attackers are getting more advanced all the time, and some of the limits are starting to show.</p>
<p>Here’s a story someone told me last year: one company had an employee they fired for bad behaviour. A few months later all their production servers got wiped out. They didn’t have enough forensics to identify how it happened, so they hired a consultant to help them reassemble it with a bit more logging for next time. A month later, it happened again! Everything gone.</p>
<p>But this time they had logs. And what the logs showed is that one of their employees had ssh’d into all the servers and smashed everything. The employee, however, had logged in from some other country where the employee demonstrably wasn’t. And it didn’t seem like an employee who couldn’t be bothered to hide their login would have bothered to use a fake IP. What happened?</p>
<p>What happened was that the rogue employee, months before they were fired, had waited until everyone went to lunch, walked around from one PC to the next, and collected the ssh private keys from any of them that weren’t locked. (Note in case you’re thinking of fixing this with a screen-locking policy: that’s not a bad start, but it’s not quite enough defense. Make sure to at least enable full-disk encryption on all your computers too, and you’re getting closer.) Then, a while after getting fired, he used a co-worker’s ssh key to login and destroy everything.</p>
<p>When they rebuilt the server cluster after the first breach, they had been super careful, constructed all the servers from scratch, avoided any possibility of installed backdoors… and then promptly dropped in the same set of ssh public keys as before. Because ssh keys are secure, right? If there’s one thing we know for sure about security, it’s that. It’s even in the name!</p>
<p>And they are secure, right up until they’re stolen. But the problem with static ssh keys is that if they are stolen, it’s undetectable. Many people avoid rotating their public keys for 10+ years. Someone might have stolen your private key 9 years ago, and is just waiting for the right moment to strike.</p>
<p>Key rotation is the simple answer to this problem. Like <a href="https://duo.com/decipher/microsoft-will-no-longer-recommend-forcing-periodic-password-changes">forced password changes (which are out of vogue now)</a>, rotating your ssh keys protects, “eventually,” against key theft, which is a lot better than no protection at all. Of course, it has some of the disadvantages of password rotation too: notably, if you have your ssh private key on several machines, you have to remember to copy it to all those places. And if you have your ssh public key on many machines - which is the whole point - now you have to correctly delete the old one and add the new one. It’s a lot of tedious, error-prone work, which is why people don’t like to do it.</p>
<p>An even more robust approach is to use some kind of hardware token that can sign short-lived ssh keys, and teach all your servers how to deal with those. That’s neat, but it’s hard to deploy (needs custom ssh settings). The deployment could be fixable - convince upstream ssh to do it in an easier way. But you still have the problem of the obnoxious hardware tokens, which then get into USB (which has too many connector types and mostly doesn’t work on a phone) or Bluetooth (which works maybe 97% of the time, which is simply not good enough for your emergency production login credentials).</p>
<p>An easier approach is to set up an <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-ssh-to-proxy-through-a-linux-jump-host/">ssh jumphost</a>, where you can contain your ssh fanciness to a single server (and even if you just use normal ssh keys, you only have to rotate them in that one place). This works pretty well, but creates added latency (the jumphost isn’t always near the server you want to jump to; or if you have a jumphost in every region, now you have to maintain a bunch of jumphosts), and of course, means that you have to do everything through ssh; you can’t route traffic directly.</p>
<p>By the way, all these credential theft problems apply to more than just ssh: WireGuard and OpenVPN private keys can be stolen in the same ways, and are a liability unless you rotate them periodically.</p>
<p>The approach we take in our own infrastructure, modeled after TLS certificate infrastructure and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> in particular, is to authenticate each device+person combination with a separate private key; that way, if a credential is stolen, we always know from where. Each device can rotate that device-specific key as often as it wants, since the private key only lives in one place, and the public keys are all distributed rapidly from our coordination server to every other device that needs them. Because of this highly consistent key rotation (which is hard with ssh keys or passwords), we always know exactly when a particular keypair has been retired, once and for all, so we can always detect if that keypair makes a surprise reappearance: it must mean credential theft, which means a breach, which can trigger forensics. After all that, we hide our ssh keys behind this network-layer key rotation, which means that unrotated ssh keys are mostly harmless; only an authorized person with non-stolen credentials can even try to exploit a stolen ssh key.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to our original question: how often should I rotate my ssh keys? More often than never! As often as you can. And make sure you retire old keys when you’re done with them.</p>

<p>Lightmeter uses trademarks for the project (Lightmeter), applications (e.g. Lightmeter Control Center), and technology components or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brand-ingredients-powerful-business-strategy-q-uirino-malandrino/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ingredients</a> (e.g. <a href="https://lightmeter.io/introducing-ray-chaser-email-tracing-engine/">Ray Chaser</a>).</p>



<p>Trademarks are a type of intellectual property, and they therefore restrict people’s freedom to use certain words and images in some contexts. Does this mean that using trademarks contradicts Open Source <a href="https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/freesoftware.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">principles</a> of maximising freedom and collaboration?</p>



<p>The short answer is “no”, because some trademark protections are necessary to ensure that broader freedoms exist for everyone.</p>



<h2 id="motivations-to-trademark">Motivations to trademark<a href="#motivations-to-trademark"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>There’s a long history of the abuse and misuse of Open Source software which could have been avoided if trademarks had been effectively used to defend it. </p>



<p>The effects of Open Source trademarks and their absence are not intuitive, and by the time a related problem arises it’s often too late to resolve it, due to the <a href="https://www.legalteamusa.net/trademark-law-first-to-use-v-first-to-file/">central role of timing</a> in trademark litigation.</p>



<p>Neither the terms “Open Source” nor “<a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Free Software</a>” are themselves trademarked, which unfortunately allows anyone to use them to describe anything – companies <a href="https://openwashing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regularly</a> <a href="https://opensource.org/node/1099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploit</a> this to undermine public understanding of the freedoms which the words originally conveyed.</p>







<p><strong>This is why we are using trademarks early and often in Lightmeter</strong> — to avoid problems for users and ourselves later on.</p>



<h2 id="in-theory-trademarks-protect-freedom">In theory: trademarks protect freedom<a href="#in-theory-trademarks-protect-freedom"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>For many people to posses broad <strong>freedom to</strong> do what they like, they must have <strong>freedom from</strong> certain obstacles to freedom such as, in the extreme, their imprisonment or murder. This is called <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive vs negative freedom</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Freedom from</strong> those obstacles entails limits on other people’s <strong>freedom to</strong> do the imprisoning and murdering. Trademarks constrain the freedom of a minority of people who would use it to abuse the freedom of others. In this way trademarks are used to guarantee the freedom of the majority.</p>



<h2 id="in-practice-trademarks-prevent-abuse">In practice: trademarks prevent abuse<a href="#in-practice-trademarks-prevent-abuse"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>Having trademarks impacts many specific avoidable problems; they:</p>



<ul><li>Help guarantee the quality of releases made in our name (e.g. no <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2699814/filezilla-warns-of-large-malware-campaign.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">malware included</a>)</li><li>Help build a brand and identity to attract users and contributors</li><li>Prevent companies from <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lying about endorsements</a> and support from us</li><li>Prevent companies from <a href="https://www.gerv.net/hacking/pay-download-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charging people</a> to download our Free Software</li><li>Prevent the false attribution of bad behaviour to us</li><li>Avoid legal liability for products which pretend to be made by us</li><li>Allow us to register domains and social media accounts which require trademarks</li><li>Prevent other software pretending to have the same innovations we do</li><li>In the case of a software fork distinguish between the two editions</li></ul>



<p>Additionally opportunities are provided by using trademarks because they:</p>



<ul><li>Help communicate how innovative features are different to competing systems</li><li>Make several aspects of providing future commercial services more viable</li></ul>



<h2 id="proactivity-is-not-optional">Proactivity is not optional<a href="#proactivity-is-not-optional"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>By the time that bad behaviour as occurred which relates to trademarks, new trademarks cannot be registered to help. </p>



<p>Trademarks must be registered early and actively asserted and defended in order to have legal meaning. In many countries whoever registers a particular name or image first gets to own it forever.</p>



<h2 id="our-strategy">Our strategy<a href="#our-strategy"><i></i></a></h2>



<p>Open Source products should not be at a disadvantage to proprietary ones or vulnerable to exploitation. To make empowering new tools we must protect our collective interest and investment, and trademarks are legitimate and necessary means of doing so.</p>



<p>For these reasons we trademark Open Source software at Lightmeter, and you will see the ™ trademark symbol and the ® registered symbol next to some words and images. We look forward to adding more as Lightmeter shares additional innovations in future.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Later last year (2020) I bought a few bitcoin, that went up in value. A few months later, in January 2021, in a moment’s panic, as the price dropped, I sold them.</p>



<p>I now found myself in a neutral position again to see if it was worth reinvesting what I’d made (and by this time I had done a lot more research). To cut a long story short, yes, but no.</p>



<p>Yes, because for the time being, I expect Bitcoin to continue increasing in value.</p>



<p>No, because Bitcoin has mutated into a monstrous, unethical ponzi scheme that utterly fails to live up to what was described in the original <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">whitepaper</a>. Instead of peer to peer cash-like payments, it is now being used for speculation, as “digital gold”, with holders of Bitcoin egging others on to buy Bitcoin at increasingly ridicolous prices, with little to no regard for those who will be left holding the bag when the music stops.</p>



<h2>Tim Bray</h2>



<p>The first article online that made me pause for thought was written by Tim Bray, who’s been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tim+bray+bitcoin&amp;oq=tim+bray+bit&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i22i30j69i64j69i60l3.3420j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">experimenting</a> with Bitcoin for years and is clearly familiar with the technology.</p>



<p>Here’s the key paragraph in his <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/01/20/When-You-Know">recent</a> post:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>What I see now: Run screaming from Bitcoin</strong> · It is completely unambiguously obvious to me that Bitcoin, a brilliant achievement technically, is functioning as a Ponzi scheme, siphoning money from the pockets of rubes and into those of exchange insiders and China-based miners. I’m less alone in this position than I was in some of those others, I think a high proportion of tech insiders know perfectly well that this is a looming financial disaster.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Amy Castor</h2>



<p>Tim then references <a href="https://twitter.com/ahcastor">Amy Castor</a> who’s been researching various cases of what seems like fraudulent activity at the very centre of Bitcoin, such as USDT: a token used on exchanges to buy Bitcoin, but which hasn’t properly been audited. For all we know these tokens are being produced out of thin air and then being used to buy Bitcoin, encouraging others to then spend their hard-earned <em>real</em> money in fear of missing out of getting rich. </p>



<h2>Crypto Anonymous</h2>



<p>Then I found an <a href="https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3">article</a> by someone clearly wanting to remain anonymous explaining the rate at which Tether (USDT) is being used to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies:</p>



<figure><img src="https://f0pub.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/ee7bc-185xfugkrpm_9krgpn8-irw.png" alt="Image for post"></figure>



<p>There’s a shocking level of reliance on these USD-T tokens, and a strong correlation between their issuance and the price of Bitcoin going up. The issuers have a <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/">questionable history</a>, and we don’t even know if their books are clean yet.</p>



<h2><a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/02/03/tether-printer-go-brrrrr/">David Gerard</a></h2>



<blockquote><p>Tether (USDT) is the cryptocurrency trading economy’s favourite substitute US dollar.&nbsp;<em>Most</em>&nbsp;Bitcoin trading is against USDT — not against actual money. There’s about 27 billion tethers in circulation.</p></blockquote>



<h2><a href="https://kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/">Patrick Mackenzie</a></h2>



<blockquote><p>A friend of mine, who works in finance, asked me to explain what <a href="https://tether.to/">Tether</a> was.</p><p>Short version: <strong>Tether is the internal accounting system for the largest fraud since Madoff</strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>That said, be sure to read the <a href="https://kalzumeus.com/2019/10/28/tether-and-bitfinex/">long version</a> too. Patrick now works at Stripe, and although he probably can’t speak for them, he likely sees the writing on the wall, with his employer planning accordingly. If Stripe too saw Bitcoin as the next big thing, they’d be preparing APIs for it. Instead <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support">Stripe publicly dropped support for Bitcoin in 2018.</a></p>



<h2>“Decentralisation”</h2>



<p>That bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are decentralised is just a huge dangerous lie.</p>



<ul><li>The<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin"> source code</a> is controlled by a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/people">central committee</a> of developers who control the direction of the project.<ul><li>They’re human and far from perfect, having previously cancelled <a href="http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi">Gavin Andresen</a>, one of the original co-creators of Bitcoin for naming <a href="https://craigwright.net/">Craig Wright</a> as the original creator of Bitcoin (“Satoshi Nakamoto”).</li></ul><ul><li>If only a centralised committee of unaccountable developers can change the protocol that has critical mass at any time, it’s not decentralised. In fact it’s more dangerous than money being in the control of accountable government officials.</li></ul></li><li>Bitcoin is in some sense being sold as decentralised (all users are “equal”) in the way communism is/was sold as decentralised (all people are “equal”). Yet we know from history that such abdication of agency never ends well. When everyone pretends no one is in power and everyone is equal, it only sets the stage for some really dangerous characters to take control.<ul><li>This is no defense of the current financial system – it has flaws, but is also well regulated by the government with appointed staff (by those elected by people) who are accountable for the smooth and fair running of the system.</li><li>With “decentralisation” there is no notion of accountability – how can there be, when every node and user is equal? Who do you go to or appeal to if something goes badly wrong?</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Even if you on some level buy the decentralised argument, consider this:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Any currency/asset that offers uncapped upside will eventually centralise in its ecosystem. Bitcoin is not an economically decentralised currency. </p><p>In fact its already more centralised than the US economy (0.01% own 42% of the wealth, compared to 12% in the US economy)</p></div>— Oliver Sauter (@BlackForestBoi) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackForestBoi/status/1362756895581339648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h2>Bitcoin vs Fiat</h2>



<p>Bitcoin is commonly advertised as a hedge against fiat. Yet, put simply:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Fiat is backed by agency.</p><p>Crypto isn't. This renders it vulnerable to takeover by bad actors, which is exactly what we're seeing.</p><p>The real answer is better agency, not abdication of it.</p></div>— Gaurav Sharma (@gsharm1) <a href="https://twitter.com/gsharm1/status/1364356821104885760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h2>Usefulness</h2>



<p>The other argument often made is that Bitcoin has no actual use despite all the money flowing into it and other cryptocurrencies. Patrick explains this well:</p>



<blockquote><p>I don’t hold any position in cryptocurrencies. I continue to believe that they’ve produced substantially no value in the world. I’m not philosophically opposed to shorting them to zero, but the mechanics of doing that are non-trivial.</p><p>…</p><p>My intense skepticism of cryptocurrencies is probably the issue on which I am most in disagreement with many close friends, professional acquaintances, and some of the smartest people I know. That is part of the reason why the hobby of peeling back onion layers here is so engrossing: people really, passionately believe that there is <em>something here.</em> I’m intellectually curious. The thing people have told me exists should <em>smash</em> my interest buttons: <em>programmable money</em>! How could I not look!?</p><p>I have looked, quite a bit. I have not found a good use case yet, or the revolutionary technology advances that my friends tell me exist, but I have found some frauds.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Institutions</h2>



<p>Mark Cuban quips:</p>



<figure><div>
<div></div>
</div></figure>



<p>By whales, one usually means very wealthy individuals or more often institutions who can buy $millions or even $billions worth of bitcoin, like Square did. Yet:</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>As of yet, no answers. Meanwhile I’ll assume Bitcoin is not only unethical but impracticle too. Can you imagine Apple or Tesla having an asset that’s expected to go up and down in orders of magnitude through the years on their balance sheet?</p>



<p>Yet according to Bitcoin proponent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Saylor">Michael Saylor</a>, you’re expected to believe this is exactly where things are headed:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you are interested in the legal considerations firms face while integrating <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> into their corporate strategy, you are not alone.   We have professionals from more than 1400 firms joining us tomorrow for this discussion.  There is still time for your legal team to attend. <a href="https://t.co/fid9nrZUfP">https://t.co/fid9nrZUfP</a></p>— Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1356712865827332099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The inconsistencies in what’s claimed here just don’t add up. It’s either a stable balance-sheet worthy asset or a strange growing/shrinking cash pile – it can’t possibly be both.</p>



<h2>Drag forces</h2>



<p>Promoters of Bitcoin often mention how Bitcoin went up approximately by 100x during the last cycle before collapsing at a higher base level, and that this cycle will continue. What they forget to take into account is drag forces: it’s easier to find the first 1% who are attracted to such schemes, but harder to find the next 10%.</p>



<p>To assume Bitcoin will continue to grow a similar amount to that in previous cycles disingenuously assumes there’s no saturation point re: interest in Bitcoin, and people will keep paying ever higher prices. In reality, interest levels off. People won’t buy Bitcoin for $100k as casually they will for $100.</p>



<p>There’s an expectation by some Bitcoin proponents that the wealthy (billionaires, etc) will flock to Bitcoin and this will continue to drive up the price. But imagine you actually are a billionaire – why would you want to participate in a chaotic get-rich scheme in the first place? Instead, it’s some of the <a href="https://twitter.com/Tr0llyTr0llFace/status/1358126195926331393?s=20">poorest, desperate and most vulnerable </a>that are targeted to and impacted by such schemes.</p>



<h2>Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)</h2>



<p>There’s a reason why Bitcoin proponents often use the phrase “have fun staying poor” when challenged with logic and they have no logical answers. That phrase is not a statement aimed at the rich (who aren’t poor to begin with). Rather it’s designed to intimidate regular folks into buying Bitcoin in fear of missing out.</p>



<p>What’ll likely be be Bitcoin’s undoing is exactly what’s causing the current bubble – greed. Those piling in primarily for “number goes up” (the overwhelmingly majority of buyers) will just as quickly sell when “number goes down”. Bitcoin isn’t a stable store of value, it’s a macro pump and dump scheme.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>The reason I’m reluctant to go back into Bitcoin is that given what it’s turned into (a modified ponzi scheme), as much as I’d like to make money for investing in the right things, Bitcoin does not seem to me like a right thing. Rather it leaves one in the position of just hoping some <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp">greater fools</a> pay an even higher price further down the line for what is otherwise quite literally a useless asset, so that one earns a profit. Isn’t that how Ponzi schemes work?</p>



<p>Lastly, reading this reddit post for me may have been the nail in the coffin:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/"></a><p>In a world filled with chats and forums and apps, emails are still one of the most useful tools to communicate with people. I’m not an email power user by any means. My volume of emails is very low so this blog post may not be for you if you’re one of those people who receives hundreds of emails every day and uses dozens of smart folders and filters. If instead you’re looking for a simple way to handle emails this post could be a useful one.</p>
<p>Few premises: I’m on Mac and this post is Mac oriented. So if you’re on Windows or Linux, sorry. You could maybe achieve something similar using a different email clients though. Also, both my emails are hosted by Google. I have one traditional Gmail account for personal stuff and one GSuite account for work related things. Which means the two inboxes are 15 and 30GB respectively and I don’t have to worry about space. With that in mind let’s get started.</p>
<h2>My history with email clients</h2>
<p>I tried a bunch of different clients during the years. I went through Sparrow before it was bought and killed by Google, I tried AirMail, Polymail, Unibox and Spark. To be honest with you, I wasn’t happy with any of those clients. Don’t get me wrong, they were ok and did the job but I’m a weird person and I like simplicity. Sometimes I want a tool that does one thing and nothing more. Smart inbox is nice, filters are great but I don’t want to use them. I want to get my emails, read them, reply to them and archive them. And that’s it.</p>
<h2>My current setup</h2>
<p>My current inbox looks like this</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/f231b1b792-1611495857/inbox.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/f231b1b792-1611495857/inbox-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/f231b1b792-1611495857/inbox-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/f231b1b792-1611495857/inbox-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/f231b1b792-1611495857/inbox-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Yes, it’s quite minimal. I want my inbox empty. If there’s something in there, it means I have to do something about it. And that something is either archive it or reply to it. But before I dive into the ins and outs of this set up let’s see how you can set it up.</p>
<h2>The Settings</h2>
<p>The first thing you wanna do is set up Mail as your default client and turn off all notifications. I hate notifications. I don’t want my mac to ding or ring at random. Plus, no email is really urgent in my world. You can adjust this according to your preference though. That’s up to you.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d901fbfe07-1611495857/general.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d901fbfe07-1611495857/general-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d901fbfe07-1611495857/general-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d901fbfe07-1611495857/general-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d901fbfe07-1611495857/general-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>As for the font, I like to use San Francisco but that’s also a personal preference. Size is also up to you. 14 is the sweet spot in my opinion.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/1cccd174a5-1611495857/font.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/1cccd174a5-1611495857/font-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/1cccd174a5-1611495857/font-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/1cccd174a5-1611495857/font-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/1cccd174a5-1611495857/font-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Next up we have viewing options. A couple of things here. You don’t want to use the classic layout because it need too much horizontal space. You can however turn on the contact photos as well as the list preview.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/6ed23e49e9-1611495857/viewing.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/6ed23e49e9-1611495857/viewing-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/6ed23e49e9-1611495857/viewing-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/6ed23e49e9-1611495857/viewing-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/6ed23e49e9-1611495857/viewing-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>I have both turned off because I don’t need to see pictures and I don’t need to have a preview of the message. I want to open the email to see what’s inside and then decide what to do.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/9a2169b80b-1611495857/options-view.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/9a2169b80b-1611495857/options-view-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/9a2169b80b-1611495857/options-view-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/9a2169b80b-1611495857/options-view-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/9a2169b80b-1611495857/options-view-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Next you want to set Archive as the default action to the discard move. This will allow you to swipe left on the message to show the archive icon. As I said at the beginning, I archive everything since I have plenty of space available in my inbox.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/81246a9853-1611495857/archive.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/81246a9853-1611495857/archive-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/81246a9853-1611495857/archive-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/81246a9853-1611495857/archive-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/81246a9853-1611495857/archive-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>You also want to have the most recent message at the top. As for the option when you’re composing a new message, I’m not a fan of quoting the entire message every time so I turned off that option.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d44436d3dc-1611495857/composing.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d44436d3dc-1611495857/composing-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d44436d3dc-1611495857/composing-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d44436d3dc-1611495857/composing-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/d44436d3dc-1611495857/composing-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>With the settings done, we can now move into the <strong>View</strong> options and hide everything that’s not necessary. You want to hide the tab bar, sort the messages by date and have the most recent at the top, hide the Mailbox list, disable the Message Filter and hide the Favorites Bar.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/badcdbc7d2-1611495857/options.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/badcdbc7d2-1611495857/options-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/badcdbc7d2-1611495857/options-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/badcdbc7d2-1611495857/options-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/badcdbc7d2-1611495857/options-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>You do want to to keep the Toolbar though because that’s where the search fields lives. We can now move to the toolbar. If you right click on it you can customize it. As you can see from the picture below, I deleted everything and the only thing left is the search field. And in order to have the search field centered inside the window I added two spacer on each side of the search field.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/be8dd9224f-1611495857/toolbar.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/be8dd9224f-1611495857/toolbar-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/be8dd9224f-1611495857/toolbar-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/be8dd9224f-1611495857/toolbar-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/be8dd9224f-1611495857/toolbar-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Also make sure to display the icon only. As for the message window, things there are pretty straightforward.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/92c68c4abf-1611495857/single.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/92c68c4abf-1611495857/single-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/92c68c4abf-1611495857/single-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/92c68c4abf-1611495857/single-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/92c68c4abf-1611495857/single-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>Each message opens in a new window and as you can see from the picture, the only button left in the toolbar is the reply button. I’m not a fan of replying all but you can tweak that based on your needs.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/a4674a2eeb-1611495857/message-toolbar.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/a4674a2eeb-1611495857/message-toolbar-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/a4674a2eeb-1611495857/message-toolbar-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/a4674a2eeb-1611495857/message-toolbar-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/a4674a2eeb-1611495857/message-toolbar-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>And that’s pretty much it. You should now have an uber minimal email client. I particularly like it because it’s super focused. If something is in my inbox I need to act on it. And I have only two options available: reply and archive. If I need to get an old email I have a handy search bar always available at the top.</p>
<figure data-template="without"><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 2000px) 1216px, (min-width: 1000px) 1024px, (min-width: 500px) 776px,  340px" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/ba6b4b955c-1611495857/empty.jpg" srcset="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/ba6b4b955c-1611495857/empty-340x-q70.jpg 340w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/ba6b4b955c-1611495857/empty-776x-q70.jpg 776w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/ba6b4b955c-1611495857/empty-1024x-q70.jpg 1024w, https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/emails/ba6b4b955c-1611495857/empty-1216x-q70.jpg 1216w"></p></div></figure>
<p>If you decide to give this setup a go let me know. Also let me know if you have ideas about how to improve it. I'm always happy to try new things.</p></div></div>]]>

                    </figure>

                <section>
                    <p>Cassandra is a popular, tried-and-true NoSQL database that supports key-value wide-column tables. Like any powerful tool, Cassandra has its ideal use cases - in particular, Cassandra excels at supporting write-heavy workloads, while having limitations when supporting read-heavy workloads. Cassandra's eventual consistency model and lack of transactions, multi-table support like joins, subqueries can also limit its usefulness.</p><p>However, using Cassandra as a metadata database for an object storage system introduces significant complexity resulting in data integrity and performance issues at scale - particularly if one wants to use their object store as a primary storage system. Object storage needs are far simpler and different from what Cassandra is built for.</p><p>Because the implications of employing Cassandra as a object storage metadata database were not properly understood, many object storage vendors made it a foundational part of their architecture - unfortunately it keeps them from ever moving past simple archival workloads into the modern workloads that define the future of object storage (AI/ML, analytics, web/mobile applications).</p><p>Let’s explore why in a little more detail.</p><ol><li>Cassandra was never designed to manage file or object storage metadata and it is predictably weak in this regard. It is <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/2.2/cassandra/dml/dmlTransactionsDiffer.html">not ACID compliant</a>. It does not have the rigidity to prevent partially successful writes, dupes, contradictions and the like. Cassandra does not support joins or foreign keys, and consequently does not offer consistency in the ACID sense. Further, there is no capacity to roll back transactions in the event of a failure. <p>While Cassandra supports atomicity and isolation at the row-level, it trades transactional isolation and atomicity for high availability and fast write performance. </p></li><li>Cassandra is categorized as an AP system in CAP. Meaning it trades Consistency for Availability and Partition tolerance. When employing Cassandra as a metadata database for an object store, you can either be fast or consistent - but not both at the same time. <p>Cassandra’s tunable consistency is a compromise, not a feature. Any setting other than <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html">QUORUM or ALL</a> means you are at risk of reading stale data. It is important to apply this consistency setting for both read and write operations in addition to the object data operations performed outside of it. </p><p>In the object storage world, the implication is that you can be good for archival use cases (write once, read very infrequently) or you choose a different architecture. </p></li><li>Similar to the consistency problem, durability guarantee is also a tradeoff between performance and correctness. The storage engine’s default <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/storage_engine.html">commit log</a> is set to sync periodically every 10 seconds. This means you will lose up to 10 seconds worth of latest updates in the event of power failure. The only reasonable way to make Cassandra durable is to use the synchronous batch mode committer which comes with a performance penalty. </li><li>Cassandra’s high-availability guarantee is not suited for erasure coded object stores. With a replication factor of 3 and consistency quorum of 2, Cassandra can only tolerate a single node / drive failure within a replication group. Increasing the replication factor and quorum consistency to 5 or higher serves only to make the meta performance go from bad to worse. Unlike replication, erasure coding can tolerate multiple servers and drives failures in a distributed system. Even if you have configured the erasure code setting to 6 parity (any 6 nodes may fail) in a 16 node setup, you are still limited by the weak link, i.e Cassandra’s replication factor. The ops team is often unaware of these high-availability surprises until it is too late.</li><li>Object storage systems organize the data in a tree structured hierarchical namespace. Since Cassandra does not support a hierarchical key namespace, you will have to build a tree data model on top for each directory prefix and also maintain a flat list for direct lookups without directory walk. Atomically updating multiple tables with batched commit log and full read / write quorum is slow and prone to &nbsp;corruption.</li><li>While objects themselves are immutable, the object storage system is mutable. When you add, remove, overwrite objects and its metadata, apply policies, collect metrics, grant session tokens and rotating credentials, the metadata is always mutating. Cassandra is not designed to handle this level of metadata mutation and definitely not for the primary storage workloads. Long term archival use cases where the objects are large (GBs in size) and infrequently accessed, will work - other use cases will not..<p>The reason is that Cassandra's log structured storage system quickly appends new writes to the end of the log file, but delays the deletes and overwrites with a tombstone marker. Vacuuming these tombstones is an expensive operation, because the actual delete operation is applied by copying the SSTables to a new table sieving the stale entries in the process. This operation has to be performed on all the nodes simultaneously. If you delay vacuuming, excessive tombstones will result in increased read latencies, memory GC pauses and failed queries. Some object storage vendors use an additional Redis database to offload Cassandra’s pressure. Using two databases to manage an object stores metadata is hardly elegant and introduces additional points of failure. &nbsp;</p><p>The biggest gotcha? You won’t see these problems until you are deep into production and it is too late.</p></li><li>Small objects (KB to MB in size) will fill up the metadata drives dedicated to Cassandra much sooner than the data drives. Also small object workloads exacerbate Cassandra’s limitations, because they are sensitive to latency and consistency issues. &nbsp;Some vendors store small objects entirely inside Cassandra to address this problem. At this point, you are merely looking at an S3 proxy on top of Cassandra database. <p>This too is a bad practice. </p><p>If you use your object store for large objects and employ erasure coding and use Cassandra as your data store for small objects and use replication - you have introduced a non-trivial SLA problem. In this approach, data is protected by different guarantees. Given that drives die all the time, the probability of serving an old object or a corrupted object goes up considerably. </p><p>As noted above, your metadata database is now the weak link. Availability, consistency and durability guarantees are only as good as the weakest link. If the weakest link employs replication (three copies) you can only withstand one-node or one drive failure before losing data.</p><p>A counter argument might be to replicate five copies. The result is a massive performance hit and you can still really only withstand two-node or two-drive failure. </p><p>In using replication for small objects and erasure coding for large objects you also undermine the efficiency gains associated with EC. If you only use erasure code for large objects (likely a small percent of your overall object pool) you don’t gain much but increase your exposure considerably.</p></li><li>Employing Cassandra as your metadata database for an object store also introduces a troublesome Java dependency. This in turn can result in bloatware and memory management issues. Cassandra taxes the JVM memory management with constant large scale metadata allocation and mutation resulting in memory exhaustion and garbage collection pauses. </li></ol><p>The obvious takeaway is that it is a lot more complicated to operate a Cassandra cluster than a properly designed object storage system. Cassandra is built for a different purpose and object-storage meta-data is not one of them. The areas where Cassandra struggles are the areas that are core to a performant, scalable and resilient object store.</p><p>The last point is of note - object storage is a natural fit for blob data and that is why Erasure Coding is so effective and efficient. Cassandra is designed for replication. When you use that model for metadata it breaks the object store’s erasure coding advantage (or at the very least makes it brittle and prone to breakage).</p><p><strong>Bottom line. Write your metadata atomically with your object. Never separate them.</strong><br></p><p>We welcome your comments.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>Paavo contacted me about starting RecruitLab (we called it <em>bestrecruitment</em> then) when his <a href="http://brandem.ee/">employer branding agency</a> could not find a suitable applicant tracking system. They signed with Bullhorn initially but found some promised key features missing.</p>
<p>Within ~2 months we launched our MVP and signed our first client - the agency.</p>
<p>When entering an established (enterprise) software niche, "do one thing well" does not work. You have to do a thing well, but you also have to do a lot of other things good enough - the essentials. In the ATS space, for example, the essentials are applicant management, e-mail messaging, job board integrations, tools for GDPR compliance. Without those features, your software is just not that useful.</p>
<p>We spent the first 6 months pumping out these essential features - at a fast pace. As soon as one was deemed acceptable we moved on to the next one.</p>
<p>In retrospect, maybe the strategy to reach approximate feature parity real fast was not the optimal one. Maybe, if we had just cerebrated hard enough, we could have found some product-market fit with one of our <a href="https://get.recruitlab.co.uk/p/job-builder">unique features</a> as a standalone product.</p>
<p>Bugs don't happen when your SaaS is making $$$ while you sleep. Bugs happen when you change or build features. When you build many features, you get many bugs. During our 6-month building-spree, we started having discussions about our software quality. Not on an abstract level, but in the concrete "some clients are afraid to use some features" sense. Very bad, an existential threat.</p>
<p>We slowed down, held meetings and reflected. Our policy of zero tolerance for bugs was born and we wholeheartedly committed to it.</p>
<p>This does not mean that I stopped building buggy software or Paavo &amp; Marie started catching all bugs in staging. It is a culture of empathy towards our users. We try harder - we test more (both manually and automated). I put more emphasis on non-happy paths, handling faults. Bugs still slip through though, but we do our best to document and understand them, create tickets. When planning development, fixing bugs is always our top priority. We don't build new features before old ones are bug-free (to our knowledge).</p>
<p>The culture shift from yee-haw development to a more careful mode has paid off well for <a href="https://recruitlab.co.uk/">RecruitLab</a>. There are fewer fires to put out. The more diligent testing and development might even be a net time-saver due to fewer distractions from incidents and customer support.</p>

February 24, 2021 | https://blog.streetwriters.co/five-ways-writers-block/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.streetwriters.co/five-ways-writers-block/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>1. Careful what you call it</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">I always hear people say they have 'writer's block'. I have been writing poetry consistently for almost four years now and I can't say I've ever experienced it. Not in the way that other people have, or mean when they say it, anyway. Do I have periods of time where I write less? Sure! But I don't label it or complain about it, in my head or to anyone else. And I think this is part of the reason I do not struggle. I've never worried about those periods of time where I wrote less. I know from my own experience that those phases pass, and are not something to worry about. I always write again.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe some people really do struggle with some sort of mental blockage for months on end - and if that happens and it feels uncomfortable, I feel for those people. I would recommend not labelling it, for one, and having some faith in your own ability as a writer. Phases with less writing are normal, and should not be viewed as negative. As you'll learn from this post, there are many actions a writer can take if they do experience block and it bothers them, but not letting it bother you seems like a good start to me.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>2. Revisit your old work</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If I ever did feel like I hadn't written anything groundbreaking in a while, I would revisit my old work. Specifically, not just reading it, but actually rewriting it by hand in a notebook. For me, this worked some sort of magic, getting my brain to 'think in poetry' again. Sometimes my brain is in poetry mode, and sometimes it's not. This was one way I discovered I am able to get it to change lanes and 'activate' poetry mode, and I've used it successfully many times. I have also started making visual representations of my poetry, in the form of collage art. This gives me a new way to interact with my existing art, and gets the creative juices flowing as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Think about some ways you can revisit and reimage your existing body of work. You can copy it by hand to simply reconnect, try rewriting it and see if you like it better, or on the opposite end of the spectrum, try recreating it in different mediums. We should feel safe to explore and play, fail, and find happy surprises in doing so. I have created some really interesting songs and collages that I really loved, just because I decided to sit down and do the work.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>3. Get out of your head (and the house)</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If you haven't felt like writing in a while, I'd recommend exploring a new place. Or taking a long walk down a slightly different route than normal. Go to a gallery or see a film outside your normal genre. We need to give our brains fuel for creativity, and shake things up. It creates new neural pathways.</p><p dir="ltr">This is best supported and explained by an article from Fast Company:&nbsp;<i>"Perception and imagination are linked because the brain uses the same neural circuits for both functions. Imagination is like running perception in reverse. In order to think creatively, you must develop new neural pathways and break out of the cycle of experience-dependent categorization. You need a novel stimulus, such as a new piece of information or an unfamiliar environment, to jolt the attentional systems awake. The more radical the change, the greater the likelihood of fresh insights."&nbsp;</i>(<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1007044/neuroscience-sheds-new-light-creativity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a>)</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>4. Meditate</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">I started meditating at the end of 2016, and since then, I have been writing poetry and lyrics steadily and without much pause. I honestly feel like something changed in my own brain chemistry on the day of my first meditation, which as I later discovered, was quite a special experience. It felt afterwards like an eternal tap of creativity had been turned on, and I can tell you that it has never really stopped. I was changed that day. I had been exploring Buddhism and reading about mindfulness and meditation around that time, so I had already started to purposefully try to become more open-minded. I had been feeling unrest within myself too though, and I felt driven to sit down and meditate for the first time ever that Sunday.</p><p dir="ltr">I saw on my bed, with a candle lit on the windowsill and made sure I was very comfortable. I focused on sitting very still, and relaxing my entire body. This is an alternative to focusing on breath, if you find that doesn't work for you. You'll find your breath actually takes care of itself anyway, with this approach. Soon, I felt my perceptions of the room changing. Although my eyes were closed, I didn't feel like I was in the room anymore. I felt my body slowly disintegrate, and felt only my consciousness floating where my head should be. The space around me expanded, and was dark, but beautiful, like a galaxy of pureness. Like I was IN the source. I could hear my own thoughts, but they were&nbsp;<i>very</i>&nbsp;far away compared to normal, and they didn't bother me. They existed, and so did I - but we were separate. I remember thinking, wow - if anyone walks in the room right now, I don't know if I'll even be able to move right now! It was as if I was in a beautiful, miraculous trance.</p><p dir="ltr">The experience itself was something I learned to not chase after to get again - we should meditate for the sake of it, not to regain a particular experience or feeling. But in a way it did give me a bar to shoot for with future meditations, as long as I didn't hold onto it too tightly. There's also research that shows that meditation can stimulate creativity. An article on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mindful.org/does-meditation-boost-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mindful.org</a> cites some of these studies, mentioning that "meditation increases cognitive flexibility and reduces cognitive rigidity which are critical to the creative process". The article also says that "the ability to observe is closely related to openness to experience, a personality trait that several studies have shown to be one of the most robust indicators of creative success."</p><p dir="ltr">This also relates back to being open when you're experimenting with your art in different ways, because I believe that this kind of patience and openness is how we uncover our greatest works. Don't be afraid to create a bunch of things you don't like at first - that's a&nbsp;<i>much&nbsp;</i>better rite of passage to adhere to than being able to say you had writer's block. People don't care that you had it - they care how and that you overcame it.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>5. Read more</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">When I'm in a period of less writing, I take the opportunity to catch up on reading. I always have a stack of poetry books I still need to read (because I literally cannot stop ordering them), and I read as widely as I can to keep my mind open, curious and inspired. A couple of books I started years ago and need to finish are <i>Master and Margarita</i>&nbsp;by Mikhail Bulgakov and&nbsp;<i>Nausea</i> by Jean-Paul Sartre. I found them to be difficult to read, but their topics are fascinating - surrealist and existentialist. Those are the themes of my art and writing. I'm highly challenged by these texts, and I learn so much by reading as widely as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">I purchased a thick collection of poems by nobel prize winning poet Louise Gluck recently and I'm terrified of it. I call it (for want of a better phase)&nbsp;<i>high brow poetry</i>&nbsp;because I read a few and they went over my head. I didn't understand what was so wonderful about them. The poems are from across her collection from between 1962 - 2012 and the book has over 600 pages (!!), so clearly the woman is prolific, and she won a nobel prize. I need to discover what's so wonderful about her writing and I'm willing to do it. I'm sure I will learn something about myself in the process too.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2021-02-24</small>
        <p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik/status/1357226010215911425">asked my network on Twitter</a> about noting ideas quickly and got a lot of good responses. One mentioned saving them in Telegram. I don’t think I want to do specifically that but I do want a minimum friction way of noting ideas for later review and refinement. And sending them to a Telegram chat would be quite nice. So I started on the path of something like a note-taking system using Telegram for ingesting quick notes. And I want to share the satisfaction I felt with seeing the near real-time way that it works.</p>
<p>I’ll show some of the process I went through so you can repeat it for your own needs but the repo is open if you want to see where I’ve taken it since. You can find it as <a href="https://github.com/lawik/noted">lawik/noted</a> on GitHub. This guide recreates a simpler approach based off of what I learnt setting that up.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-your-project">Setting up your project</h2>
<p>I’m using Elixir and Phoenix with LiveView. You need to have the Phoenix project generator installed to follow along, you can follow the Phoenix installation instructions to get it.</p>

  

<p>It should create your project, you can certainly name it something different than <code>noted</code>. I left Ecto in because you’ll likely want it at some point though I won’t use it in this post.</p>
<h2 id="some-initial-setup">Some initial setup</h2>
<p>In <code>lib/noted/application.ex</code> I comment out the <code>Noted.Repo</code> because we’re not using the DB.</p>
<p>In <code>mix.exs</code> for deps I add:</p>

  <div data-file="mix.exs">
  <p>mix.exs</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir">    <span>..</span>
      {<span>:telegram</span>, <span>git</span>: <span>"https://github.com/visciang/telegram.git"</span>, <span>tag</span>: <span>"0.7.0"</span>},
      <span># Gun mismatch with telegram and cowboy</span>
      {<span>:cowlib</span>, <span>"~&gt; 2.7"</span>, <span>override</span>: true}
    <span>..</span></code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>The cowlib thing has to do with some weirdness in the telegram library deps. But adding this should allow you to do <code>mix deps.get</code> and have it work.</p>
<h2 id="get-yourself-a-telegram-bot">Get yourself a Telegram bot</h2>
<p>So get situated with a Telegram account and add <a href="https://t.me/BotFather">The Botfather (Telegram link)</a> as someone to talk to and that’s Telegrams bot for creating bots. Very meta. Pretty convenient.</p>
<p>You write <code>/newbot</code> to him and he’ll guide you through the rest. You’ll receive a secret that you should squirrel away and we’ll use it as a an API key for running our bot.</p>
<p>You’re going to want a convenient client to test things as well. I’m using the MacOS desktop client on this machine, it is nice and native.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-viable-bot">Minimum Viable Bot</h2>
<p>It needs to be self-aware. So let’s make that happen. To protect the bot token I put it in a file in my home dir called <code>.mybotcredentials</code> or something similar. This file is just:</p>

  <div data-file="~/.mybotcredentials">
  <p>~/.mybotcredentials</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="shell">export TELEGRAM_BOT_SECRET<span>=</span><span>"my_secret_goes_here"</span></code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>And before running the server I do: <code>source ~/.mybotcredentials</code></p>
<p>This prevents me from accidentally committing the damned things.</p>
<p>Okay, time to create this bot. Create a file in the project named <code>lib/noted/bot.ex</code>. In this file we do this:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted/bot.ex">
  <p>lib/noted/bot.ex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span>Noted.Bot</span> do
  use <span>GenServer</span>
  require <span>Logger</span>

  def start_link(opts) do
    <span>GenServer</span><span>.</span>start_link(__MODULE__, opts, opts)
  end

  <span>@impl</span> <span>GenServer</span>
  def init(opts) do
    {key, _opts} <span>=</span> <span>Keyword</span><span>.</span>pop!(opts, <span>:bot_key</span>)

    case <span>Telegram.Api</span><span>.</span>request(key, <span>"getMe"</span>) do
      {<span>:ok</span>, me} <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>Logger</span><span>.</span>info(<span>"Bot successfully self-identified: </span><span>#{</span>me[<span>"username"</span>]<span>}</span><span>"</span>)

        state <span>=</span> %{
          <span>bot_key</span>: key,
          <span>me</span>: me,
          <span>last_seen</span>: <span>-</span><span>2</span>
        }

        {<span>:ok</span>, state}

      error <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>Logger</span><span>.</span>error(<span>"Bot failed to self-identify: </span><span>#{</span>inspect(error)<span>}</span><span>"</span>)
        <span>:error</span>
    end
  end
end</code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>This is a GenServer and we want to add it to run when our application starts. So below your Noted.Endpoint, inside the list of children in <code>lib/noted/application.ex</code> add this:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted/application.ex">
  <p>lib/noted/application.ex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>..</span>
{<span>Noted.Bot</span>, <span>bot_key</span>: <span>System</span><span>.</span>get_env(<span>"TELEGRAM_BOT_SECRET"</span>)}
<span>..</span></code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>Now you can make sure you’ve run <code>mix deps.get</code> and then run <code>mix phx.server</code> to try it out. Check your logs, the happy message should be there.</p>
<h2 id="set-yourself-up-to-receive-updates">Set yourself up to receive updates</h2>
<p>So it still doesn’t really do anything. We will be using long polling which is a neat way of getting updates from a Telegram bot without publishing the server on the web on some real domain and in some systems it might be a bit of a pain. In Elixir, on a GenServer it is comparatively trivial. At least if you know your GenServers.</p>
<p>Just after we set up our state and before we return <code>{:ok, state}</code> in the bot we need to add a call to <code>next_loop()</code>. So the your <code>init/1</code> looks like this:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted/bot.ex">
  <p>lib/noted/bot.ex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>..</span>
  def init(opts) do
    {key, _opts} <span>=</span> <span>Keyword</span><span>.</span>pop!(opts, <span>:bot_key</span>)

    case <span>Telegram.Api</span><span>.</span>request(key, <span>"getMe"</span>) do
      {<span>:ok</span>, me} <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>Logger</span><span>.</span>info(<span>"Bot successfully self-identified: </span><span>#{</span>me[<span>"username"</span>]<span>}</span><span>"</span>)

        state <span>=</span> %{
          <span>bot_key</span>: key,
          <span>me</span>: me,
          <span>last_seen</span>: <span>-</span><span>2</span>
        }
        next_loop()

        {<span>:ok</span>, state}

      error <span>-&gt;</span>
        <span>Logger</span><span>.</span>error(<span>"Bot failed to self-identify: </span><span>#{</span>inspect(error)<span>}</span><span>"</span>)
        <span>:error</span>
    end
  end
<span>..</span></code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>Now to add the rest. This GenServer will send itself a message saying “ey, check for updates” and then act on that message until the activity is done and then call <code>next_loop/0</code> again to trigger another message. We’ll start with acting on the message with a <code>handle_info/2</code> callback. In your bot GenServer module:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted/bot.ex">
  <p>lib/noted/bot.ex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>..</span>
  <span>@impl</span> <span>GenServer</span>
  def handle_info(<span>:check</span>, %{<span>bot_key</span>: key, <span>last_seen</span>: last_seen} <span>=</span> state) do
    state <span>=</span>
      key
      <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Telegram.Api</span><span>.</span>request(<span>"getUpdates"</span>, <span>offset</span>: last_seen <span>+</span> <span>1</span>, <span>timeout</span>: <span>30</span>)
      <span>|&gt;</span> case do
        <span># Empty, typically a timeout. State returned unchanged.</span>
        {<span>:ok</span>, []} <span>-&gt;</span>
          state

        <span># A response with content, exciting!</span>
        {<span>:ok</span>, updates} <span>-&gt;</span>
          <span># Process our updates and return the latest update ID</span>
          last_seen <span>=</span> handle_updates(updates, last_seen)

          <span># Update the last_seen state so we only get new updates on the</span>
          <span># next check</span>
          %{state <span>|</span> <span>last_seen</span>: last_seen}
      end

    <span># Re-trigger the looping behavior</span>
    next_loop()
    {<span>:noreply</span>, state}
  end

  defp handle_updates(updates, last_seen) do
    updates
    <span># Process our updates</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Enum</span><span>.</span>map(fn update <span>-&gt;</span>
      <span>Logger</span><span>.</span>info(<span>"Update received: </span><span>#{</span>inspect(update)<span>}</span><span>"</span>)
      <span># Offload the updates to whoever they may concern</span>
      broadcast(update)

      <span># Return the update ID so we can boil it down to a new last_seen</span>
      update[<span>"update_id"</span>]
    end)
    <span># Get the highest seen id from the new updates or fall back to last_seen</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Enum</span><span>.</span>max(fn <span>-&gt;</span> last_seen end)
  end

  defp broadcast(update) do
    <span># Send each update to a topic for others to listen to.</span>
    <span>Phoenix.PubSub</span><span>.</span>broadcast!(<span>Noted.PubSub</span>, <span>"bot_update"</span>, {<span>:update</span>, update})
  end

  defp next_loop do
    <span>Process</span><span>.</span>send_after(self(), <span>:check</span>, <span>0</span>)
  end
<span>..</span></code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>Try it out, it should log messages as they are sent to your bot.</p>
<h2 id="getting-real-time-with-liveview">Getting real-time with LiveView</h2>
<p>We can repurpose the existing LiveView that the Phoenix generator gives us. So just open <code>lib/noted_web/live/page_live.ex</code> and its sibling the template <code>lib/noted_web/live/page_live.html.leex</code>. In the <code>page_live.ex</code> file we change it to this:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted_web/live/page_live.ex">
  <p>lib/noted_web/live/page_live.ex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="elixir">defmodule <span>NotedWeb.PageLive</span> do
  use <span>NotedWeb</span>, <span>:live_view</span>

  <span>@impl</span> true
  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    <span>Phoenix.PubSub</span><span>.</span>subscribe(<span>Noted.PubSub</span>, <span>"bot_update"</span>)
    {<span>:ok</span>, assign(socket, <span>messages</span>: [])}
  end

  <span>@impl</span> true
  def handle_info({<span>:update</span>, update}, socket) do
    {<span>:noreply</span>, assign(socket, <span>messages</span>: [to_message(update) <span>|</span> socket<span>.</span>assigns<span>.</span>messages])}
  end

  defp to_message(%{<span>"message"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> message} <span>=</span> _update) do
    firstname <span>=</span> get_in(message, [<span>"from"</span>, <span>"first_name"</span>])
    lastname <span>=</span> get_in(message, [<span>"from"</span>, <span>"last_name"</span>])
    username <span>=</span> get_in(message, [<span>"from"</span>, <span>"username"</span>])

    from <span>=</span>
      case {firstname, lastname, username} do
        {nil, _, username} <span>-&gt;</span> username
        {firstname, nil, _} <span>-&gt;</span> firstname

      end

    text <span>=</span> get_in(message, [<span>"text"</span>])
    %{<span>from</span>: from, <span>text</span>: text}
  end
end</code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>And we change the <code>page_live.html.leex</code> template file to:</p>

  <div data-file="lib/noted_web/live/page_live.html.leex">
  <p>lib/noted_web/live/page_live.html.leex</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>section</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"phx-hero"</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;<span>&lt;</span>%= gettext "Welcome to my Bot!" %&gt;&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;

  <span>&lt;</span>%= for message &lt;<span>-</span> <span>Enum</span><span>.</span><span>reverse</span><span>(@</span><span>messages</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>%</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;&lt;<span>strong</span>&gt;<span>&lt;</span>%= message.from %&gt;: &lt;/<span>strong</span>&gt;<span>&lt;</span>%= message.text %&gt;&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;
  <span>&lt;</span>% end %&gt;
&lt;/<span>section</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>Run this and you should see any message to type in the Telegram bot show up. I find it very gratifying just how instantaneous it can be.</p>
<h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2>
<p>This is just a start and in the <a href="https://github.com/lawik/noted">noted repo</a> you will find some of what I’ve done to push it further, structure the bot a little bit more. Add some responses. You can just try it out by cloning and setting it up.</p>
<p>I implemented some authentication. Currently this means that notes are separated by user. It also means that Noted allows new users by default if they find your bot :D</p>
<p>I implemented the database backing to save notes and tags. I added a bunch more LiveView code. I separated the polling for getUpdates from the handling of the updates a bit more and added a Supervisor to the pairing of GenServers.</p>
<p>Currently on my todo-list is to receive files and media in a nice way and integrate those with the markdown support. If you want practice with Tailwind CSS I’d love for someone to make it look better.</p>
<p>But this particular project aside I find the realtime nature of chat bots very satisfying. Telegram has a well-working API, nice native clients and a hilariously large feature set. And with how fast you can get this up and running when it isn’t your first time I really recommend trying it for things. Heck, you could use it for sending you notices about your app catching fire or occasional status updates from your system. There are so many fun options.</p>
<p>Slightly timely update, especially if you are curious about LiveView or want more of me. Me and a wild gang of Elixir community folks just put our new podcast out there. It is called <a href="https://beamrad.io/">BEAM Radio</a> and you find it at <a href="https://beamrad.io/">beamrad.io</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed the post. Let me know if this is something you would like to see more of as I have quite a few things I could go deeper into from this …</p></article></div>

            <p>Telling a business partner you’d be competing with them would never be easy, especially when both businesses still needed to work together.</p><p>So imagine a young Bill Gates telling Steve Jobs that Microsoft was building Windows and competing directly—on an operating system level, at any rate—with the Macintosh.</p><p>“We had to take a walk,” relayed Gates decades later to Jobs’ biographer Walter Isaacson. Jobs started the meeting taking Gates to task for building what he saw as a rip-off of Apple’s work—where Gates countered both companies had worked off Xerox’ innovation. The meeting was going nowhere. And so Jobs had to get out of the office, asked Gates to go for a walk. Maybe it was the clean air, the open sky, the grounding effect of nature. But it worked: “That was when he began saying things like, ‘Okay, okay, but don’t make it too much like what we’re doing,” recalled Gates. Crisis averted, at least momentarily.</p><hr><p>In the intervening years, as Jobs’ vision of a friendly computer and Gates’ of a computer on every desk morphed into today’s always-on computing, we all left the office. We took our word processing and coding, emails and chats, Photoshop and spreadsheets, into coffee shops and lunch queues. We’d think of things that needed done and do them all, anywhere.</p><p>All, that is, except meetings. Simply by virtue of computers and phones including cameras, video calls became the standard for remote meetings. It’s harder if anything to start a group voice call today; video reigns supreme in the workplace.</p><p>Thus my momentary surprise when, sometime in 2017, my editor started our weekly 1-1 meeting in Slack. My phone buzzed with a Slack notification, I tapped it, and seconds later I was on what seemed like a phone call—voice, with no video. Slack, thoughtfully enough, starts voice calls by default. Video’s a button tap away if you need it, but you might not. I brought the phone to my ear and we chatted about work and goals, no video or even headphones needed.</p><p>Maybe we didn’t need video calls for everything. Maybe audio is enough. And maybe it could get us over our collective Zoom fog.</p><h2 id="this-is-what-you-want-this-is-what-you-get-">This is what you want, this is what you get.</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-5.06.24-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-5.06.24-PM.png 600w, https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-5.06.24-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-5.06.24-PM.png 1424w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>AT&amp;T's original video phone, the MOD I, from 1964.</figcaption></figure><p>“Through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles,” <a href="https://nymag.com/vindicated/2016/11/these-6-visionaries-predicted-the-smartphone.html">predicted</a> the original Tesla in 1926, imagining a future smartphone small enough, “a man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.”</p><p>The future came, sure enough. We got Twitter instead of flying cars, but video calls came almost exactly as they’d been imagined. If phone calls had revolutionized communications, video calls would surely do even more.</p><p>We were so excited about video calls being possible, we collectively rushed into a future that neglected audio calls, with video being the default way to talk in Skype, Messenger, FaceTime, and more. “In some ways we kind of skipped over audio on the internet,” Capiche founder Austin Petersmith remarked to Protocol’s <a href="https://mailchi.mp/protocol/source-code-the-audio-revival-starts-here?e=188ee6bc42">David Pierce</a>. “The amount of experimentation of video is orders of magnitude more than audio, and I think that's because there's a tendency to go toward the highest-fidelity thing available.”</p><p>When every phone comes with a camera, surely we should use it.</p><blockquote>“We shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face.”</blockquote><p>Or perhaps not. Around the same time IBM added the first webcams to laptops in 1996, author David Foster Wallace in <em>Infinite Jest</em> <a href="https://kottke.org/10/06/david-foster-wallace-on-iphone-4s-facetime">imagined a world</a> where we’d try video calls, then decide they were more trouble than they were worth.</p><p>Traditional phone calls, to Wallace, were brilliant for the information they withheld, the fiction they created. “Good old traditional audio-only phone conversations allowed you to presume that the person on the other end was paying com­plete attention to you,” wrote Wallace. We could do anything, look any way you wanted, and the person on the other end of the line would be none the wiser.</p><p>Video calls, he predicted, “rendered the fantasy insupportable.” We’d had to perform for the call, act like we were looking at the speaker, look presentable at the last moment. “There was … no answer-as-you-are informality about visual-video telephone calls.” And perhaps that's what we liked about phone calls all around, without realizing it.</p><p>And so, in <em>Infinite Jest</em>’s imagined world, humanity would switch to video calls for a year, then quickly shift 90% of calls back to audio-only.</p><p>After a year where everything important has been held over video calls, it feels like Wallace may have not been too far off the mark.</p><h2 id="mirror-mirror-on-the-screen">Mirror, mirror on the screen</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-4.56.20-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-4.56.20-PM.png 600w, https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-4.56.20-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-4.56.20-PM.png 1012w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Searches for "Zoom Fatigue" peaked the end of March 2020, as much of the world went into lockdown and seemingly every interaction was suddenly over video calls.</figcaption></figure><p>It turns out, it’s tiring, being on camera all day.</p><p>You have to look at the camera, fake eye-contact with the speaker. But “in real life, how often do you stand within three feet of a colleague and stare at their face? Probably never,” surmised Liz Fosslien and Mollie West Duffy in the <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-combat-zoom-fatigue">Harvard Business Review</a>. “Having to engage in a ‘constant gaze’ makes us uncomfortable — and tired.”</p><p>You have to perform, keep up appearances, seem engaged and attentive. “When you're on a video conference, you know everybody's looking at you; you are on stage, so there comes the social pressure and feeling like you need to perform. Being performative is nerve-wracking and more stressful.” As the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200421-why-zoom-video-chats-are-so-exhausting">BBC quoted INSEAD professor Gianpiero Petriglieri</a>: “You cannot relax into the conversation naturally.”</p><blockquote>"When you're on a video conference, you know everybody's looking at you; you are on stage."</blockquote><p>And for all your effort, tech too often gets in the way. Your mic may not work, your video call app might crash, a siren might go by right as you need to talk. Even a slow internet connection can make you come across worse to your colleagues, as a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1071581914000287">2014 study by Berlin Institute of Technology researchers</a> found that when the audio is delayed more than 1.2 seconds, participants “are perceived less attentive, extraverted and conscientious.”</p><p>You’re performing. You’re trying to decipher unclear facial cues. Add context collapse—where every event happens in the same space, without the familiar separation between work and leisure spaces—and your brain never has time to turn off. All that together gives us “Zoom fog,” the mental blurriness after one too many video calls, and the dread of needing to do more.</p><h2 id="call-me-video-maybe-">Call me. Video, maybe.</h2><p>And so, just as remote meetings are more common than ever, <em>Infinite Jest</em>'s prediction that we might “actually prefer the retrograde old low-tech Bell-era voice-only phone interface after all” is new trend in the remote startup world, at least.</p><p>“Video makes many conversations worse,” <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1358801649381244928?s=21">Tweeted</a> Basecamp CEO Jason Freed recently, after decades of experience leading one of the first remote companies.</p><p>He’s not alone. The Gumroad team is switching meetings to audio talks after founder <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1358799625692479493">Sahil Lavingia</a> says they found “Video is largely unnecessary.” “We almost never use our cameras for internal meetings,” shared @MikeRaia in a <a href="https://capiche.com/q/what-are-your-video-call-defaults">Capiche discussion about video call defaults</a>, where @briana9 mentioned “My team is mostly video off.”</p><blockquote>We might actually prefer the retrograde old low-tech Bell-era voice-only phone interface after all.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hnshah/status/1161361656724635648">Hiten Shah</a>—founder of CrazyEgg, KISSmetrics, and FYI—shared that “having remote meetings while walking” and “sitting in nature during a meeting” were some of the things he does to make remote work more healthy, tips one suspects Jobs might have enjoyed. You could walk during video meetings, at the risk of making your team seasick—switch to audio calls, though, and you can move as much as you please.</p><p>You could even take it to the logical extreme and drop meetings altogether. Todoist founder <a href="https://twitter.com/amix3k/status/1361929937247236097">Amir Salihefendić</a> mentioned that his favorite company perk is “Async-first. This enables you to live wherever and work when it suits you.” You could share your thoughts in Slack or record them in tools like <a href="https://www.yac.com/">Yac</a>, and rethink if meetings are even necessary. Or, go in the other direction, and use something like Discord with always-on audio chat in the background to talk whenever you want, spontaneously.</p><p>Whether spontaneously, location-independent meetings are what your team needs, or working more async, audio’s part of making it happen. You can turn off the camera, relax a bit more on calls, and think more about what’s being said and less about how you look while you’re saying it. You could take a walk, or take the call from wherever you happen to be at the moment, when video's no longer a requirement.</p><p>It's part of the enduring appeal of radio shows and podcasts—you can listen and learn while doing other things, without being glued to a screen for yet another hour. Where video ties us down, audio lets us do more, frees us to work the way that fits best without performing for the camera. We can talk on Facetime Audio and Slack calls, host live audio shows on Capiche FM and more, all with just a microphone.</p><p>Sometimes more isn’t better. <a href="https://capiche.com/e/yo-atomized-communication">Sometimes less data can be more</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><a href="https://capiche.fm/"><img src="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/capichefm-5530d0860607af328a41b93b4c30d7247a7d55a14034c67f418a607f78da30f5.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/capichefm-5530d0860607af328a41b93b4c30d7247a7d55a14034c67f418a607f78da30f5.png 600w, https://blog.capiche.fm/content/images/2021/02/capichefm-5530d0860607af328a41b93b4c30d7247a7d55a14034c67f418a607f78da30f5.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><h5 id="image-credits-microphone-photo-by-jukka-aalho-via-unsplash-mod-i-video-phone-photo-via-bonhams-">Image Credits: Microphone photo by Jukka Aalho via <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/_t9c-kmMjl8">Unsplash</a>.

February 23, 2021 | https://tailscale.com/blog/modules-monoliths-and-microservices/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/modules-monoliths-and-microservices/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Lately, I get people asking me when microservices are a good idea. In <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227">systems design explains the world</a>, I talked about big-picture issues like second system effect, innovator’s dilemmas, and more. Can systems design answer the microservices question?</p>
<p>Yes, but you might not like the answers. First, we'll need some history.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-microservice">What is a microservice?</h4>
<p>You can find various definitions on the Internet. Here's mine: microservices are the most extreme possible backlash against <em>monoliths</em>.</p>
<p>Monoliths are what happen when you link everything your entire app needs into one giant program and deploy it as one big blob. Monoliths have a long history, going back to frameworks like CGI, Django, Rails, and PHP.</p>
<p>Right away, let's abandon the assumption that a monolith and a fleet of microservices are the only two options. There's a wide and nuanced continuum from "one giant service that does everything" to "infinite tiny services that each do nearly nothing."</p>
<p>If you follow fads, you'll have built a monolith at least once (whether on purpose or because that's what traditional frameworks encouraged you to do), then discovered some problems with monoliths, then heard that microservices are the answer, then started rearchitecting everything as microservices.</p>
<p>But don't follow fads. There are many points in between those extremes. One of them is probably right for you. A better approach starts with where you want to put your <em>interfaces</em>.</p>
<h4 id="boxes-and-arrows">Boxes and arrows</h4>
<p>An interface is the connection between <em>modules.</em> A module is a collection of related code. In systems design, we talk about "boxes and arrows" engineering: modules are the boxes, and interfaces are the arrows.</p>
<p>The deeper question then is: how big are the boxes? How much goes in each box? How do we decide when to split one big box into two smaller ones? What's the best way to connect the boxes? There are many approaches to all this. Nobody quite knows what's best. It's one of the hardest problems in software architecture.</p>
<p>Over the decades, we've evolved through many kinds of "boxes." <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf">Goto statements were "considered harmful"</a> largely because they prevented any hierarchy at all. Then we added functions or procedures; those are very simple boxes, with interfaces (parameters and return codes) between them.</p>
<p>Depending which branch of programming you go down, you then discover recursive functions, combinators, static function prototypes, libraries (statically or runtime-linked), objects (OOP), coroutines, protected virtual memory, processes, threads, JITs, namespaces, sandboxes, chroots, jails, containers, virtual machines, supervisors, hypervisors, microkernels, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel">unikernels</a>.</p>
<p>And that's just the boxes! Once you have boxes isolated from each other, then you need to connect them with arrows. For that, we have ABIs, APIs, syscalls, sockets, RPCs, filesystems, databases, message passing systems, and "virtualized hardware."</p>
<p>If you tried to draw a complete boxes-and-arrows diagram of a modern Unix system (which I won't), it would be wild: functions inside threads inside processes inside containers inside userspace, layered under a kernel, inside a VM, running on hardware in a rack in a datacenter in a cloud provider tied together by an orchestration system, and so on.</p>
<p>Each of those boxes at each of the abstraction layers is somehow isolated from and then connected to some of the others, at the same or other layers. Some are inside others. You couldn't draw an honest version of this picture in a mere two dimensions without lines criss-crossing hopelessly.</p>
<p>This all evolved over decades. Fancy people call it "path dependence." I call it a mess. And let's be clear: most of the mess no longer provides much value.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on what became very ugly evolutionary results, let's talk about what people were <em>trying</em> to do while they invented all that stuff.</p>
<h4 id="the-quest-for-modularity">The quest for modularity</h4>
<p>The top-line goals of module systems are always the same:</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolate each bit of code from the other bits.</li>
<li>Re-connect those bits only where explicitly intended (through a well-defined interface).</li>
<li>Guarantee that bits you change will still be compatible with the right other bits.</li>
<li>Upgrade, downgrade, and scale some bits without having to upgrade all the other bits simultaneously.</li>
</ol>
<p>The computer industry spends an absolutely immense amount of time messing around, trying to find the perfect balance of all these modularity issues, while still trying to keep development as painless and easy as possible.</p>
<p>We are, in short, not succeeding.</p>
<p>By far the part we're worst at is #1, isolation. If we could truly and efficiently isolate one bit of code from another, the other goals would mostly fall into place. But we simply do not know how.</p>
<p>Isolation is a super hard problem. Goodness knows people have tried. Yet browser sandbox escapes still happen regularly, undetected privilege escalation attacks are simply assumed to exist on every OS, iOS still gets jailbroken periodically, DRM never works (for better or worse), virtual machines and containers regularly have vulnerabilities discovered, and systems like <a href="https://blog.alcide.io/insecure-by-default-kubernetes-networking">k8s have their containers configured insecurely by default</a>.</p>
<p>People have even been known to <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/02/04/attack-of-week-tls-timing-oracles/">figure out encryption keys on remote servers by sending well-timed packets</a> to them over the Internet. Meanwhile, the most spectacular isolation failures in recent memory were the <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and Spectre attacks</a>, which allowed any program on a computer, even a javascript app in a web browser, to read the memory of other programs on the same computer, even across sandboxes or virtual machines.</p>
<p>Every new isolation technology goes through a cycle like the following, from optimism to despair:</p>
<ul>
<li>New idea: we'll finally get it right this time, once and for all!</li>
<li>Initial experiments seem to work.</li>
<li>(Users complain that it's even slower and more tedious than the last thing we tried.)</li>
<li>Early fatal flaws are discovered and fixed.</li>
<li>Widespread deployment.</li>
<li>Ever-more-subtle flaws are successively discovered and fixed.</li>
<li>Eventually, we find flaws that we simply don't know how to patch.</li>
<li>Lose hope that efficient isolation is even possible with this method.</li>
<li>But also we can never retire this isolation method because now too many people are depending on it.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, at this point security people simply don't believe that any of the following (each one the very best technology available at the time) is totally safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process isolation and memory protection on a Unix system.</li>
<li>Privilege separation between OS processes when remote code execution ("RCE" for security people) is allowed.</li>
<li>Filtering syscalls to isolate a process.</li>
<li>Mutually untrusted processes sharing a CPU hyperthread.</li>
<li>Memory isolation between virtual machines on a CPU core.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I know, the state of the art, the very best isolation, is something like the Chrome sandbox or <a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor">gVisor</a>. The big browser vendors and cloud providers all use tools like these. The tools remain imperfect, but providers do chase down every new breach as fast as they can, and the rate of new flaws is fairly slow.</p>
<p>Isolation is better than it's ever been before… if you put all your isolation at the virtual machine (VM) level so that your cloud provider can do it for you because nobody else knows how, or updates often enough.</p>
<p>If you trust your cloud provider's VM isolation, you can have hope that all known problems are mitigated; but we have every reason to think more problems will be found.</p>
<p>That's… actually pretty good, all things considered. At least we have <em>something</em> that works.</p>
<h4 id="great-vms-for-everything">Great! VMs for everything!</h4>
<p>Well, hold on. Spinning up an isolated VM for every little module is a pain. And how big is a module?</p>
<p>Long ago, when Java first came out, the dream was that every line of every function in every object could have permissions enforced, even between objects in the same application binary, so that CPU-enforced memory protection wouldn't be needed. Nobody believes anymore that they can make that work. And marketing claims like "cloud functions" aside, nobody really thinks you should try.</p>
<p>None of the currently-known isolation methods work <em>perfectly</em>, but each of them works to <em>some approximation</em>. Increasingly skilled attackers, or increasingly valuable targets, require better and more annoying isolation. The best isolation we know right now is inter-VM sandboxing provided by tier-1 cloud providers. The worst, well, it goes down to zero.</p>
<p>Let's also assume, skipping over the evidence, that most systems are so tightly coupled that <strong>a reasonably skilled attacker can break through laterally between modules.</strong> So, for example, if someone can link a malicious library into your Go or C++ program, they can probably take control of that entire program.</p>
<p>Similarly, if your program has write access to a database, attackers can probably make it write <em>anywhere</em> in the database. If it can contact the network, they can probably contact <em>anywhere</em> in the network. If it can execute arbitrary Unix commands or system calls, they can probably get Unix root access. If it's in a container, they can probably break out of the container and into other containers. If malicious data can <a href="https://imagetragick.com/">crash the png decoder</a>, they can probably make it do anything else the decoder program is allowed to do. And so on.</p>
<p>An especially powerful form of attack is getting the ability to commit code, because that code will eventually be run on developer machines, and some developer or production machine somewhere probably has access to do what you want to do.</p>
<p>The above is maybe a little too pessimistic, but making those assumptions can help avoid overcomplicating your systems without improving actual security. In <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf">Some thoughts on security after ten years of qmail 1.0</a>, Daniel J. Bernstein points out (if I may heavily paraphrase) that many of the defenses he added in qmail, particularly isolating the different components from each other using chroot and different Unix uids, were not worthwhile and have never paid off.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's take it for granted that attackers with the ability to execute code can "usually" jump …</p></div></div>

I moved a project from <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> + <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> to…&nbsp;Rails, baby! Back to the future. My earlier post on <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html"><em>Second-guessing the modern web</em></a> was inspired by this experience, that for the product we were building, a ‘modern’ stack was not working as well as a traditional one.</p><p>We didn’t do competitive analysis against Laravel, Django, or Phoenix. They’re similar, not radically better or worse. There are multiple acceptable solutions to a problem, and this was more a matter of choosing the right <em>kind</em> of solution than pursuing some kind of perfect choice and burning hours and motivation doing the window-shopping.</p><p>What helped Rails win was that the team had a little more experience in Ruby (with the exception of myself), and we found plenty of resources for developing and deploying the stack. Rails fit perfectly into the ideology of <a href="http://boringtechnology.club/"><em>Choosing boring technology</em></a>. Another part of the product would be the hard, innovative part, so it made no sense to grapple with bleeding-edge web frameworks.</p><p>This was a really fun experience. There’s a lot to love about Rails. Other communities could learn a bit from the Ruby &amp; Rails culture and wisdom. I won’t implement <em>everything</em> in Rails, but it’ll be part of the toolbox.</p><p>Before this, I hadn’t touched the stuff. And I bet a lot of people are like that - they came of age in the world of React and Go, and haven’t tried anything even remotely similar to Rails. For their benefit, and to debrief from 2020, here are some notes on the experience. Plus, <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html">Rails-like projects in JavaScript</a> are ramping up quickly, and it’s fun to know the origins.</p><h2 id="the-good">The good</h2><h3 id="debugging-rails-apps-is-amazing">Debugging Rails apps is amazing</h3><p>A while ago, I <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1321133460501585922">wrote on Twitter</a></p><blockquote><p>the real reason why javascript developers don’t use breakpoints and use console.log is that breakpoints don’t work</p></blockquote><p>After years of working in JavaScript, I’m used to bad debugging experiences. The Chrome debugger’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/05/automatically-pause-on-any-exception">automatic pause on caught exceptions</a> is amazing, sometimes. But throwing a <code>debugger</code> statement in some React code is dodgy as hell. Sometimes it works, mostly it doesn’t. You have to deal with code that might not have the right <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/">sourcemap</a> to translate from bundled &amp; minified code to original source. Subtle abstractions like React hooks and advanced transpiler stuff like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/regenerator">Regenerator</a> mean that your code’s stacktrace probably looks nothing like what you expect, with lots of internal garbage. Sure, you can learn better techniques for diagnosing and debugging errors, but it’s not just you - the debugging story in JavaScript is pretty bad. This applies even to Node.js, where one of the debugging stories is to connect Chrome’s debugger to a Node.js instance:&nbsp;a finicky solution that doesn’t consistently work.</p><p>In Rails, there is <a href="https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug">byebug</a>. You write <strong><code>byebug</code></strong> in your source code, and you get an interactive REPL right there. It works in views, controllers, database migrations, everywhere. It almost always works. Variables are named what you expect. The whole system is paused at that moment, and you can actually interact with it, using all of the Rails utilities and your installed gems.</p><p>If a page crashes unexpectedly, you get a similar REPL experience, in your browser, automatically. With an automatically cleaned-up stacktrace that excludes Rails’s own frames. Like the byebug interface, this REPL actually works and is consistently helpful in finding root causes. Rarely will you need to use <code>puts</code> to print something to the console because this debugging system is so good.</p><h3 id="the-magic-mostly-works">The magic mostly works</h3><p>Our Rails app didn’t have any <code>require</code> statements. You mention a module’s name, and it’s automatically included, using <a href="https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk">Zeitwork</a>, a tool that comes standard with Rails.</p><p>This kind of system was terrifying to me before. What if you accidentally import something just by mentioning it? What if two things have the same name and you import the wrong one? How do you really know what’s happening? Sure, you’re happy now, with all of that annoying importing and exporting taken care of, but the sky might fall.</p><p>Or maybe it just… doesn’t. Maybe impure, vaguely risky techniques are just a net positive over time, and making everything fully explicit isn’t really necessary? Now when I’m using other systems, I wonder - what if I could just mention one of my React components and it would just… be there? Sure, the system would have to complain if there were two components with the same name, and it would have to make assumptions about directory structure, but overall, wouldn’t this be nice?</p><p>This applies to a lot of other parts of the system too. Rails is famous for doing pluralization - you name a model <code>Post</code> and you automatically get an interface called <code>posts</code>. But what, you ask, of words with uneven pluralization rules? Rails actually&nbsp;<a href="https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2005/8/25/10-reasons-rails-does-pluralization/">does the right thing</a>, almost always. And when it fails, you can override it. It actually just saves time, reliably.</p><h3 id="testing-works">Testing works</h3><p>I’ve tried to test front-end applications. I’ve set up <a href="https://nightwatchjs.org/">nightwatch</a>, <a href="https://jestjs.io/">jest</a>, <a href="https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/">enzyme</a>, <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">cypress</a>, and probably 5-10 other frameworks. <em>Front-end testing is universally terrible.</em> Projects like Cypress are throwing untold hours into making it less terrible, taking on massive amounts of complexity to abstract away from fickle browser behavior and complex interactions.</p><p>But it still sucks. Frontend testing has no good attributes: it’s unreliable, hard to automate, hard to debug when it fails, and often doesn’t even assert for important behaviors, so it doesn’t actually identify regressions. Running frontend tests in CI is resource-heavy, requiring you to set up headless X windows environments on servers or use specialized CI services that produce screencasts of test runs.</p><p>Testing fully-server-rendered applications, on the other hand, is <em>amazing</em>. A vanilla testing setup with Rails &amp; <a href="https://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> can give you fast, stable, concise, and actually-useful test coverage. You can actually assert for behavior and navigate through an application like a user would. These tests are solving a simpler problem - making requests and parsing responses, without the need for a full browser or headless browser, without multiple kinds of state to track.</p><p>Not only do the tests work better, the testing culture is a completely different universe. There are entire books written about how to write RSpec tests that catch bugs, allow software evolution, and aren’t filled with boilerplate.</p><h3 id="gems-are-so-powerful">Gems are so powerful</h3><p>Powerful and dangerous.</p><p>I’m used to modules as they work in other systems - Python, Node, Elm, and so on. They provide objects, functions, and variables that you can import and combine into your code explicitly. Usually they sit on some specific level of abstraction - it’s a utility for connecting to servers or a React component you can use.</p><p>Gems can do so much more. You install something like <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise</a> into your system and it adds views, routes, methods, utilities, you name it. It’s not like “loading some functions”, it’s more like composing a whole different app <em>into</em> your app, implicitly.</p><p>This is obviously terrifying. It means that you can’t look at your directories of views and your file of <code>routes.rb</code> and know what exists at a glance. There are other layers, lurking in the ephemeral space of third-party code. They interact in serious but uncertain ways.</p><p>But it’s also pretty incredible - the idea that something like <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">passport</a>, Node’s middleware, could instead be a full-fledged authentication system. It means that you have to write a lot less code, and it also means that the people who <em>use</em> that code have a lot more code in common. That gems can work on a higher level of abstraction, making it possible to cobble together software faster, to write less ‘glue code.’</p><h3 id="theres-so-much-good-writing-about-rails">There’s so much good writing about Rails</h3><p>Even if you don’t write Ruby, you should pay attention to <a href="https://sandimetz.com/">Sandi Metz</a>. She’s incredibly wise and has so many incredible ideas to share.</p><p>And then there’s <a href="https://blog.arkency.com/">arkency</a>, <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/">ThoughtBot</a>, and so many other thoughtful writers with years of experience in Rails. Sometimes it’s a little shocking to google for some obscure problem and see a decade of discussion about it.</p><p>The best practices are also formalized into tools like <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">Code Climate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/troessner/reek">reek</a>. I’ve never seen so many actually-useful suggestions come out of automated systems as I did in the world of Ruby and Rails.</p><h3 id="ruby">Ruby</h3><p>Ruby is a pretty pleasant language to work in. Sure, it has a lot of syntax and a sprawling standard library, but you don’t have to use all of that if you don’t want to. It took me a while to adjust to the object-oriented way of doing things - in particular, the idea that you can’t just have a free-range function floating out there, unassociated with a class or module, like you can in JavaScript. And you can’t just create an arbitrary one-off object - you either need to define a class to create an object, or use a Hash to store data.</p><p>But Ruby’s standard library isn’t that huge. I’ve seen JavaScript’s ‘standard library’ grow a lot too, and frankly it’s nice to have methods like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padStart"><code>String.prototype.padStart</code></a> instead of having every little thing in userspace. The only part that felt actively weird was <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/activesupport/versions/6.1.1">activesupport</a> - a gem that extends Ruby’s core objects, but is part of Rails. It felt weird to have <em>string</em> methods that would only work if your environment was Rails.</p><p>The <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> app for documentation rocketed from my pile of unused tools to an absolute must-have. In the world of Ruby and Rails, with <em>most</em> gems having pretty good, semi-standard documentation, you can search for, and get answers, super fast. The Ruby language documentation and the Rails documentation is absolutely great. The JavaScript equivalent - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> - pales in comparison.</p><h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2><h3 id="the-asset-pipeline">The asset pipeline</h3><p>Remember SASS and the YUI Compressor? These are, unfortunately, defaults in the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">asset pipeline</a>. There’s <a href="https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/webpacker.html">Webpacker</a> too, which has a parallel approach to CSS and images as the asset pipeline. It has <a href="https://github.com/rails/webpacker#integrations">opinionated integrations</a> with stuff like React. Ah, and I should mention that Rails’s <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/actionview/app/assets/javascripts">JavaScript utilities are written in… CoffeeScript</a>.</p><p>I get it - it’s hard to keep up with the latest trends in frontend. But this is one …</p></div></div>

Sean Moriarity and I are glad to announce that the project we have been working on for the last 3 months, Nx, is finally <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx">publicly available on GitHub</a>. Our goal with Nx is to provide the foundation for Numerical Elixir.</p>
<p>
In this blog post, I am going to outline the work we have done so far, some of the design decisions, and what we are planning to explore next. If you are looking for other resources to learn about Nx, you can <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/podcast-episodes/034-jose-valim-reveals-project-nx/">hear me unveiling Nx on the ThinkingElixir podcast</a>.</p>

Nx is a multi-dimensional tensors library for Elixir with multi-staged compilation to the CPU/GPU. Let’s see an example:</p>

The high-level features in Nx are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
Typed multi-dimensional tensors, where the tensors can be unsigned integers (<code>u8</code>, <code>u16</code>, <code>u32</code>, <code>u64</code>), signed integers (<code>s8</code>, <code>s16</code>, <code>s32</code>, <code>s64</code>), floats (<code>f32</code>, <code>f64</code>) and brain floats (<code>bf16</code>);    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/NamedTensor">Named tensors</a>, allowing developers to give names to each dimension, leading to more readable and less error prone codebases;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Automatic differentiation, also known as autograd. The <code>grad</code> function provides reverse-mode differentiation, useful for simulations, training probabilistic models, etc;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Tensors backends, which enables the main <code>Nx</code> API to be used to manipulate binary tensors, GPU-backed tensors, sparse matrices, and more;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Numerical definitions, known as <code>defn</code>, provide multi-stage compilation of tensor operations to multiple targets, such as highly specialized CPU code or the GPU. The compilation can happen either ahead-of-time (AOT) or just-in-time (JIT) with a compiler of your choice;    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For Python developers, <code>Nx</code> currently takes its main inspirations from <a href="https://numpy.org/"><code>Numpy</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/jax"><code>JAX</code></a> but packaged into a single unified library.</p>
<p>
Our initial efforts have focused on the underlying abstractions. For example, while Nx implements dense tensors out-of-the-box, we also want the same high-level API to be valid for sparse tensors. You should also be able to use all functions in the <code>Nx</code> module with tensors that are backed by Elixir binaries and with tensors that are stored directly in the GPU.</p>
<p>
By ensuring the underlying tensor backend is ultimately replaceable, we can build an ecosystem of libraries on top of Nx, and allow end-users to experiment with different backends, hardware, and approaches to run their software on.</p>
<p>
<em>Nx’s mascot is the Numbat, a marsupial native to southern Australia. Unfortunately the Numbat are endangered and it is estimated to be fewer than 1000 left. If you are excited about Nx, consider donating to Numbat conservation efforts, such as <a href="https://www.numbat.org.au/">Project Numbat</a> and <a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/">Australian Wildlife Conservancy</a>.</em></p>
<h2>
Numerical definitions</h2>
<p>
One of the most important features in <code>Nx</code> is the numerical definition, called <code>defn</code>. Numerical definitions are a subset of Elixir tailored for numerical computing. Here is the <code>softmax</code> formula above, now written with <code>defn</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Formula</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="4374234550-1">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="4374234550-3">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="4374234550-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The first difference we see with <code>defn</code> is that Elixir’s built-in operators have been augmented to also work with tensors. Effectively, <code>defn</code> replaces Elixir’s <code>Kernel</code> with <code>Nx.Defn.Kernel</code>.</p>
<p>
However, <code>defn</code> goes even further. When using <code>defn</code>, <code>Nx</code> builds a computation with all of your tensor operations. Let’s inspect it:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0485630283-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0485630283-2">do</span><span>

This computation graph can also be transformed programatically. The transformation is precisely how we implement automatic differentiation, also known as <code>autograd</code>, by traversing each node and computing their derivative:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>grad_softmax</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6961223907-2">do</span><span>

</span><span data-group-id="6961223907-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Finally, this computation graph can also be handed out to different compilers. As an example, we have implemented bindings for <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/">Google’s XLA</a> compiler, called EXLA. We can ask the <code>softmax</code> function to use this new compiler with a module attribute:</p>
<pre><code><span>@defn_compiler</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="9487003846-1">{</span><span>EXLA</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>client</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:host</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-1">}</span><span>

  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-4">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-4">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-5">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-6">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-6">)</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-5">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="9487003846-3">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Once <code>softmax</code> is called, <code>Nx.Defn</code> will invoke <code>EXLA</code> to emit a just-in-time and highly-specialized compiled version of the code, tailored to the tensor type and shape. By passing <code>client: :cuda</code> or <code>client: :rocm</code>, the code can be compiled for the GPU. For reference, here are some benchmarks of the function above when called with a tensor of one million random float values on different clients:</p>

Where <code>keep</code> indicates the tensor was kept on the device instead of being transferred back to Elixir.

<h3>
Compiling numerical definitions</h3>
<p>
Before moving forward, it is important for us to take a look at how numerical definitions are compiled. For example, take the <code>softmax</code> function:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0256028582-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-3">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-4">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-5">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-5">)</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-4">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="0256028582-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
One might think that Elixir takes the AST of the softmax function above and compiles it directly to the GPU. However, that’s not the case! Numerical definitions are first compiled to Elixir code that will emit the computation graph and this computation graph is then compiled to the GPU. The multiple stages go like this:</p>
<pre><code>Elixir AST
-&gt; compiles to .beam (Erlang VM bytecode)
   -&gt; executes into defn AST
      -&gt; compiles to GPU</code></pre>
<p>
This multi-stage programming is made possible thanks to Elixir macros. For example, when you see a conditional inside <code>defn</code>, that conditional looks exactly like Elixir conditionals, but it will be compiled to an accelerator:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>any?</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-3">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">do</span><span>
    </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">else</span><span>
    </span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3414005179-4">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="3414005179-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In a nutshell, <code>defn</code> provides us with a subset of Elixir for numerical computations that can be compiled to specific hardware, such as CPU, GPU, and other accelerators. All of this was possible without making changes or forking the language.</p>
<p>
And while <code>defn</code> is a subset of the language, it is a considerable one. You will find support for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Mathematical operators  </li>
  <li>
Pipes (<code>|&gt;</code>), module attributes, the access syntax (i.e. <code>tensor[1][1..-1]</code>), etc  </li>
  <li>
Elixir macros constructs (imports, aliases, etc)  </li>
  <li>
Control-flow with conditionals (both <code>if</code> and <code>cond</code>), loops (coming soon), etc  </li>
  <li>
Transformations, an explicit mechanism to invoke Elixir code from a <code>defn</code> (which enables constructs such as <code>grad</code>)  </li>
</ul>
<p>
And more coming down the road.</p>
<h2>
Why functional programming?</h2>
<p>
At this point, you may be wondering: is functional programming a good fit for numerical computing? One of the main concerns is that immutability can be expensive when working with large blobs of memory. And that’s a valid concern! In fact, when using the default tensor backend, tensors will be backed by Elixir binaries which are copied on every operation. That’s why it was critical for us to design <code>Nx</code> with pluggable backends from day one.</p>
<p>
However, as we move to higher-level abstractions, such as numerical definitions, we will start to reap the benefits of functional programming.</p>
<p>
For example, in order to build computation graphs, immutability becomes an indispensable tool both in terms of implementation and reasoning. The JAX library for Python, which has been one of the guiding lights for Nx design, also promotes functional and immutable principles:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>JAX is intended to be used with a functional style of programming</em>  </p>
  <p>
— <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.ops.html?highlight=functional#indexed-update-operators">JAX Docs</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>

series, I give an accelerated introduction to game development in Unity.
<a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">Subscribers</a> have been following this series over the
past few months, often suggesting areas to cover or elaborate on. A few months
ago, a reader<!-- -->—<!-- -->also a software engineer<!-- -->—<!-- -->reached out to me (lightly
edited, emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p><strong>The biggest unknown for me is: How do I start?</strong> What does the process of
creating a game look like? Should I build the scenes first? Should I design
the gameplay mechanics first? With business software, it’s much more familiar.
It’s easy to think, “Well, okay, I need to write the DAO or controller, etc.”
But with games, I’m lost.</p></blockquote><p>While there is no single correct answer, we can still make some distinctions
that can help get us oriented. The answer will also undoubtedly depend on <em>who</em>
is doing the development: an individual, small indie team, or larger studio? If
an individual, the answer will also depend on their primary skillset: a
developer, artist, or designer?</p><p>Here, I’ll give heuristics especially helpful for individual Software Engineers
building a game on their own as a side project, hobby, or proof-of-concept.</p><figure><p><span>

Do you have a sense of what game mechanics
your game will have? Do you know what genre, controls, and themes this game will
have?</p><p>If <em>yes</em>, you’re ready to decide <strong><a href="#start-coding">where to start coding</a></strong>.
Otherwise, you have a few more questions to ask yourself.</p><h3>Do you <em>want</em> to know what you’re building?</h3><p>It’s totally fine not to have a project in mind! Maybe you’re prototyping.
Perhaps you’re throwing a bunch of mini-games on the wall and seeing what
sticks. Or you’re looking for inspiration and trying to implement random
mechanics to see what feels fun.</p><p><strong>If you’re hoping to begin working on a specific, cohesive game</strong>, you will
likely want to know what you’re building. Consider brainstorming and sketching
out an informal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document">game design document</a>.
There are
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=game+design+document+template">plenty of templates</a>
of various levels of detail you could decide to use. Especially as a software
engineer toying with abstract ideas in my brain, I’ll start with a super
high-level GDD, covering the feel, themes, genre, and mechanics of the game I
have in mind. Maybe a few pictures or sketches for inspiration, and that’s it.
The key part of this exercise will be the list of mechanics I’m working on.</p><p><strong>If you want to prototype and experiment</strong>, you should already have a vague
sense of 1-2 mechanics that could be fun: Maybe unusual movement or a different
control scheme. It could be a traditional mechanic that you’re wondering how to
implement. For instance, I might decide to build a 3rd Person character and
camera controller to see the “feel” of it, experiment with it a tiny bit, and do
something smooth and polish that I feel good about. I might end up keeping that
code in my back pocket for later, or I might use play-through sessions with that
controller to move around a scene, add a few assets, and use that as a starting
place to see the “feel” various mechanics and designs.</p><h2 id="start-coding">I know the mechanics I care about. Now what?</h2><figure><p><span>

development. You do that by failing fast and getting feedback early. In game
development, the primary metric for success is a feeling: the game should be
fun. So, when deciding what to start with when working on a game, one good
question to ask is: <em>“How can I see if this game is fun as soon as possible?”</em>
or <em>“How can I implement the ‘fun’ part of the game ASAP?”</em></p><p>One way to do that is to look at a game’s mechanics and implement them in some
order. The advice that resonates with me is implementing game mechanics in order
of what the most <em>“core”</em> mechanic first.</p><figure><p><span>

plane shooting game—as an example. Here’s my attempt at writing its main
mechanics in descending order of importance:</p><ol><li>Movement: Navigate a vertically scrolling world</li><li>Obstacles &amp; Dodging: Player can collide with stationary obstacles and debris</li><li>Shooting: Player can shoot straight ahead to defeat obstacles</li><li>Enemies: Enemies are moving obstacles that can shoot back</li><li>Player Health: A player can take a finite number of hits before losing the
game</li><li>Enemy Health: Some enemies take multiple shots to destroy</li><li>Boosts: The player can pick up boosts that improve health, shooting, etc.</li></ol><p>… and so on.</p><p>If I’m trying to develop <em>1945</em> from scratch, I will implement that list in that
order. The game’s mechanics build on each other, so I can only tell if shooting
is “fun” is if I can move around the screen and if there are obstacles I’m
trying to clear (otherwise, there’s no urgency to just pressing <em>Space</em> and
seeing projectiles coming out of a plane).</p><p>In simpler games, we might order our mechanics so that every new feature adds to
a game’s feel. So, with every new mechanic you add, you can play the game and
tell if it’s adding what you hope for it to add.</p><p>In more complex games, some of the “core” mechanics might be too ‘standard’ to
be “risky” <em>per se</em>, but you’ll still need the core mechanics implemented to
assess how fun the other mechanics are. You might choose to use a simpler
throwaway implementation, like a few lines of input-handling code and Unity’s
<code>CharacterController</code> component. You’ll want your core mechanics just smooth
enough that they don’t ruin the fun of the things you’ll layer on top of it.
Another approach here is to use the asset store. I’ve previously mentioned the
<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/ufps-ultimate-fps-106748?aid=1011leWs6">Ultimate FPS (UFPS)</a>
asset, which you might choose to use when building an FPS game, and move on to
implementing the combat or some more unique (but still “core” feature of the
gameplay first).</p><h2>So I picked a mechanic, but where do I start programming <em>within</em> this mechanic?</h2><p><em>Within</em> a mechanic, your traditional software engineering intuition becomes
helpful. I hope to spend subsequent articles discussing patterns that are
especially helpful in Unity, but here are a few to consider:</p><ul><li>Work within Unity’s Object-Component paradigm. If you’re adding a new
<em>capability</em> to your player, write it as its own component.</li><li><em>Tuning</em> is especially important in game development; representing a
mechanic’s interesting pieces as <em>configurable</em>, <em>serializable</em> data that
can be input to a component will help you playtest and iterate.</li><li>Don’t shy away from using plain-old data objects to represent core concepts
you’re working with. E.g., health, ammo information, or powerups. Make it
serializable if you want it passed around in the editor (or saved to disk
across sessions).</li><li>Where pieces of a concept don’t correspond to a single object in a scene,
consider using Scriptable Objects to do the jobs. Scriptable Objects

data and abstractions, the reader’s initial comment also becomes the answer:</p><blockquote><p>It’s easy to think, “Well, okay, I need to write the DAO or controller, etc.”
But with games, I’m lost.</p></blockquote><p>Beyond learning about useful patterns and abstractions in game development to
make development clearer and cleaner, the real takeaway is to decide <em>what</em> to
work on at a macro-level.</p><h2>How much time should I spend on one mechanic?</h2><p>As you’re developing a mechanic, what’s a good signal you should move on to the
next on your list? Generally, that would be when you’re convinced:</p><ul><li>This mechanic <em>feels fun</em> and <em>adds to the game</em>,</li><li>Your implementation adds <em>just the

of technical debt.</li></ul><p>Traditionally, folks will often say to worry about polish at the later stages of
your development. In his GDC 2016 micro-talk <em>“Pizzazz First, Polish Later”</em>,
Lee Perry makes a distinction in this traditional wisdom.</p><div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8QAVGeEj-U?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div><p>Certain levels of pizzazz might give you a better sense of your mechanic and how
fun it feels. A certain amount of polish or pizzazz can also help you see your
game in a new light and motivate you to keep going.
<a href="https://gameanalytics.com/blog/squeezing-more-juice-out-of-your-game-design/">Juice</a>
is another form of pizzazz; in certain dull moments of your game design, adding
juice might be a low-cost way to get back into the groove of things.</p><p>I hope the conflicting advice shows there isn’t a silver bullet on what to add
when. Rather—as in traditional software development—this choice is about a
series of trade-offs that depend on the developer, the project, and lots more.</p><h2>Are you developing a game or architecting systems?</h2><p>For some software engineers, we’re often drawn to writing code for systems that
seem <em>interesting</em>. Sometimes, I have a game in mind, but <em>really</em>, I’m
interested in implementing a cool inventory system where <em>everything</em> in the
game is an item. It might not be the core mechanic, but it might be the thing I
want to build.</p><p>It’s important to recognize when you’re not building a game but building a
system. If you just quit your job to be a full-time indie gamedev and have a
year of runway before your run out of cash, it is probably a bad idea to start
building a complex inventory system that you don’t even know you’ll need<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.
But if you’re programming on the side to flex your game development muscle, then
go right at it.</p><hr><p>I don’t think I’m qualified <em>per se</em> to answer the …</p></div></div>

  <p><a href="https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/node/websockets">WebSockets</a> are a great tool for when you want to show real time changes in data.
For example, a server can push stock market price changes to the client rather than the client needing to ask for the changes via a HTTP request.
With this being said, below you will find an example of a simple Vue application that shows the current time to the user and where
the user can send a simple message to the websocket.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>const</span> app = <span>new</span> Vue({
    <span>data</span>: <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> ({ <span>time</span>: <span>null</span> }),
    <span>template</span>: <span>`
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;{{time}}&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    `</span>,
    <span>mounted</span>: <span><span>function</span>(<span></span>)</span>{
      <span>let</span> connection = <span>new</span> WebSocket(<span>'ws://localhost:3000/'</span>);
      connection.onmessage = <span>(<span>event</span>) =&gt;</span> {
        
        
        
        <span>this</span>.time = event.data;
      }
    }
  });
  app.$mount(<span>"#content"</span>);</code></pre>
<p>Below is an example websocket server that you can use with the above Vue code.</p>
<pre><code><span>"use strict"</span>;

<span>const</span> serverPort = <span>3000</span>;
<span>const</span> express = <span>require</span>(<span>"express"</span>);
<span>const</span> http = <span>require</span>(<span>"http"</span>);
<span>const</span> WebSocket = <span>require</span>(<span>"ws"</span>);

<span>const</span> app = express();
<span>const</span> server = http.createServer(app);
<span>const</span> websocketServer = <span>new</span> WebSocket.Server({ server });


websocketServer.on(<span>"connection"</span>, (webSocketClient) =&gt; {
  
  webSocketClient.send(<span>"The time is: "</span>);
  setInterval(<span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span>let</span> time = <span>new</span> <span>Date</span>();
    webSocketClient.send(<span>"The time is: "</span> + time.toTimeString());
  }, <span>1000</span>);
});


server.listen(<span>3000</span>, () =&gt; {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>"Websocket server started on port 3000"</span>);
});</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-10783" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"> <div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://opium.finance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Opium Finance</a> has released collateralized debt obligation products (CDOs) for Compound Finance’s automated lending markets, Opium Protocol founder Andrey Belyakov told CoinDesk in a phone interview Friday.</p><div id="node-1"><p>Investors can put up the Compound debt token cDai – and soon Uniswap LP tokens – to diversify exposure to DeFi lending markets. Opium’s product pays out structured returns to both a senior and junior risk tranche in exchange. The former tranche offers a 7% fixed return on <a target="_blank" data-for="autolink" data-tip="DAI" href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/dai">dai</a> (a collateral-backed stablecoin) at maturity, while the latter pool offers a variable rate paid out after filling up the senior tranche’s return, a <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@andreybelyakov/50028fde8811" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> shared with CoinDesk states.</p><p><a href="https://businessblockchainhq.com/blockchain-e-books/blockchain-ebook-finance/"><img src="https://businessblockchainhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/finance-ebook-banner.jpg?ad1fd1&amp;ad1fd1" alt="" width="728" height="96"></a></p></div><p>As depicted in Michael Lewis’ “The Big Short,”<em> </em>CDOs are infamous for their role in monetizing the subprime mortgage crisis that spurred the 2008 financial crisis. Warren Buffet even went as far to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fintools.com/docs/Warren%20Buffet%20on%20Derivatives.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">call</a> CDOs and other derivatives “financial weapons of mass destruction” years before the financial downturn. CDO holders lost out on expected payments when mortgage holders defaulted en masse. Banks that were over leveraged on the then-worthless debt obligations began to default themselves, such as failed financial giant <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bear Stearns</a>.</p><p>It’s thought the transparent nature of blockchain-based financial applications could limit the downside of using these complex derivatives. Moreover, the risk profile of the average DeFi lending app is vastly different than the reasons CDOs became a household name over a decade ago. DeFi apps have little chance of becoming insolvent due to programmatic liquidation settings. Rather, the risk mostly comes down to software exploits which many poorly put-together DeFi apps experienced this past year.&nbsp;</p><p>Belyakov said risk tranching increases the efficiency of capital on lending markets – a poorly understood problem in young DeFi markets he thinks derivatives can help address.</p><p>It works as follows: A protocol issues a debt token representing a claim to funds deposited or “locked” on a DeFi app, such as cDai. These debt tokens allow those same deposits to gain exposure again on other markets. However, most DeFi investors let these debt tokens sit idle in wallets, re-invest them as collateral for other loans or put them up for yield farming. The problem is these bets often move in the same direction. Placing debt tokens into Opium’s CDO, on the other hand, acts as a categorical alternative to other forms of capital exposure, Belyakov said.</p><p>“What we did was look at the lowest-hanging fruit,” Belyakov said. “And we found that Uniswap LP tokens, Compound cDai and some others are just stored on a wallet; they are not being used as collateral or farming – you don’t utilize this capital.”</p><div id="node-12"><p>The derivative joins other early attempts to protect lenders from the software risks associated with decentralized finance (DeFi). For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://app.saffron.finance/#home" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saffron Finance</a> launched its unaudited protocol in November while little-known protocol <a target="_blank" href="https://barnbridge.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barn Bridge</a> continues to build out an offering similar to Opium’s. The protocol also <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.coindesk.com/credit-default-swaps-tether-opium">released</a> a credit default swap (CDS) product for the <a target="_blank" data-for="autolink" data-tip="USDT" href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/tether">tether</a> stablecoin in September.</p><p><a href="https://businessblockchainhq.com/blockchain-e-books/blockchain-e-book-supply-chain/"><img src="https://businessblockchainhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/supplychain-ebook.jpg?ad1fd1&amp;ad1fd1" alt="" width="728" height="96"></a></p></div><p>Opium is also jumping on the governance token bandwagon. The protocol released its opium (OPIUM) token Monday for decentralizing the protocol’s governance structure. The launch was preceded by a premine and a $3.5 million private sale including participation from venture capitalist Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Digital, QCP Soteria, HashKey and Alameda Research, among others.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/collateralized-debt-obligations-cdos-defi-lending" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div></div> </article></div>]]>

    <div>
      <p>(<em>original title</em>: "Curry Howard is a scam". See below.)</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence">Curry-Howard correspondence</a>
has been talked about a lot recently, not only in Haskell circles, but also
among CiC-based proof assistant practitioners (Coq, Lean, etc.).
In a nutshell, it makes a deep parallel between "programs" (terms of some flavor
of lambda calculus, typically), and "proofs" (these programs are a proof of their type,
or more precisely they are witnesses that their types are inhabited).
The most basic example is <code>id x = x</code> which, in Haskell, would be a proof of
$ \forall a. a \rightarrow a $, a trivial theorem of propositional logic.</p>
<p>That's all good and well, but my point here is that <em>in practice</em>, the equivalence is
not as interesting as it first looks.</p>
<h2 id="programs-are-not-really-proofs">Programs are not really proofs</h2>
<p>A real program (i.e. one that is written to be executed and do something useful)
is not really a proof of anything interesting.
Pedantically, a haskell program has type <code>IO ()</code>, which is not really a valid
proposition. But even beyond that, if we look just below the surface of <code>main</code>,
nothing has that interesting a type:</p>
<p>A classic Haskell program that is used by people is <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>.
Most of what it does could be described as <code>Doc Markdown -&gt; Doc Html</code> (or
a similar pair of document formats). So you have a "proof" that these two trees
can be somehow mapped onto one another. No mathematician will fawn over that.</p>
<p>Servers written in Haskell, like webservers, would have the type <code>request -&gt; IO response</code>
(or something close to that, maybe <code>request -&gt; M response</code> for some custom monad <code>M</code>)
if you look inside the server loop. Again that's not really mathematically interesting.</p>
<p>It's only if you look in combinator libraries (like Parsec, say) that types get more generic,
and start looking more like formulas. Things like <code>flip : (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; c</code>
are as generic as it gets… and are proofs of super trivial propositional logic theorems.
In fact you can't even state much in Haskell, any real mathematical statement will at least
require first-order logic (which corresponds to dependent types — no mainstream
language features these beyond, er, C++). Idris could <em>possibly</em>
have some interesting proofs that are also real programs… if it were designed to
be a proof assistant and not a beefed-up programming language.</p>
<p>If anyone has a useful program that is also actually a proof of something non
trivial, I'd be happy to be proven wrong.</p>
<h2 id="proofs-are-not-really-programs">Proofs are not really programs</h2>
<p>What is the program corresponding to a proof of
"there exists an infinite number of primes"?
If I run this program, what input does it takes, and what do I get as an
output?</p>
<p>I don't have a direct answer to that question. If you develop this proof in Coq,
using a <code>Prop</code> typed statement, I don't even think it could be extracted to OCaml
and compiled.</p>
<p>For most of mathematics, I have no idea what the "programs" corresponding to proofs
found in textbooks would look like, nor what they would compute. There are
very complicated lambda terms for these proofs, but what they compute is
unclear.</p>
<h3 id="a-concession">A concession</h3>
<p>A domain where CH <strong>does</strong> make sense to me, is algorithms (written in a functional
style) that are used as <em>existential witnesses</em> of some property.
For example, the Euclid GCD algorithm is, in a very real sense, a proof that
two natural numbers have a GCD. You can write some Coq or Lean code that
computes the GCD of two numbers and proves that it's indeed their greatest divisor.</p>
<p>That said, I don't know of any large program written this way. It's a labor intensive
way of writing programs, even compared to alternatives like <a href="https://why3.lri.fr/">why3</a>
where you can cleanly separate the code and the specification, and ask automatic provers
to do as much proving as possible for you.</p>
<h2 id="but-what-about-compcert-sel4">But what about Compcert/SEL4/… ?</h2>
<p>Let's look at <a href="https://compcert.inria.fr/">Compcert</a>, famously one of the largest
programs written in Coq.
I suppose the main type is <code>compile : C_program -&gt; Option Asm_program</code>
or something like that (I'm no expert on Compcert so I could be very wrong).
However, as far as I know, it's not written in a purely dependent style: proofs are
separated from the "real code" part of the development. This means
we don't get $\forall x: \text{C_program} \rightarrow Option \set{y : \text{ASM_program} | R(x,y) }$
where $R(x,y)$ would mean that $x$ and $y$ have the same semantics; rather you
have <code>C_program -&gt; ASM_program</code> and proofs on the side that the function preserves
its input's semantic.</p>
<p>For SEL4 it's developed with Isabelle/HOL, which isn't dependently typed
and is classical logic.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The title was click-baity, of course 🙂. But I do think that CH is over-hyped,
because the correspondence is <del>only</del> mostly interesting abstractly; in practice things
are either a (interesting) program, or a (interesting) proof, but not both
at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> (2021-02-24):  I regret the over-aggressive title now. Changing it to the
more appropriate "CH is overrated"; it's obviously still a useful mathematical statement
and a valid way of building proofs.</p>

deal in urban transport," as people grappled with "the last mile problem," Wilson said.</p>  <p>"What I think Dean Kamen saw early on was cities were only getting bigger, they were only getting more congested, and we really needed some sort of device for that last mile — to get to work, maybe even to get from the subway to work," he said.</p>  <p>"Right now, you look at bike shares, you look at

Vancouver, thinks "the pandemic has given us opportunities to rethink how we get around safely in a lot of ways," as people try to find alternatives to sharing confined space on public transport.</p>  <p>"It's been particularly good for walking and simple biking, and e-biking is just an extension of human-powered biking, as are scooters," he told <em>The Current</em>.</p>    <p>That's leading to a boom in micro mobility, which Toderian defined as moving away from relying on cars and finding "more ways to get around that are small that we can carry with us, like foldable bikes."</p>

viewing micro mobility as the only solution to building healthier urban spaces.</p>  <p>"The concept of a more multimodal city&nbsp;—&nbsp;a city that has many more enjoyable, healthy, sustainable, economical, equitable ways of getting around&nbsp;— is going to be a lot of solutions," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Micro mobility … is part of a larger conversation about more and better ways to get around that aren't as space intensive, pollution intensive, etc., as cars are."</p>  <p>He said it's important to note what micro mobility trips replace.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"If they replace car trips, that's a good thing.

		<section itemprop="articlebody">
			<p>This article is the second entry of series of posts exploring situations in which <abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr> alone isn’t enough to secure user freedom.</p>
<p>My previous article, <a href="https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html">Whatsapp and the domestication of users</a>, got more attention than I was expecting. Some responses gave me a lot to think about,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> especially regarding <em>actions</em> we can take. I suggest reading that article first; it explained what “user domestication” is and why it’s a problem. It enumerated three countermeasures: FOSS, simplicity, and open platforms.</p>
<p>Hard problems, by definition, lack easy solutions. Simply choosing (or creating) a platform that avoids user domestication isn’t enough if that platform can change. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance; in addition to settling on the right platform, we must ensure that it honors its users in both the present <em>and the future</em>. Keeping a platform FOSS and simple is more straightforward<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> than keeping a platform “open”.</p>
<p>How do we keep an open platform from becoming a closed platform in the future?</p>
<h2 id="how-open-platforms-become-closed">How open platforms become closed</h2>
<p>There are three ways to close an open platform:</p>
<ol>
<li>A forced migration onto a different platform.</li>
<li>A single implementation growing dominant, blurring the line between specification and implementation.</li>
<li>Dominant implementations adopting too many unstandardized features and behaviors.</li>
</ol>
<p>These three approaches overlap: they frequently feature platform monoculture and a single vendor controlling both clients and servers.</p>
<h3 id="forced-migration">Forced migration</h3>
<p>When one vendor controls all parts of a service (e.g., both a client and server), it has the means to create what I call a <strong><dfn>boxed platform</dfn>:</strong> a subset of a larger open platform that can evolve at its own pace, without concern for compatibility or interoperability.</p>
<p>Controlling both the server and client allows a vendor to update the client and server without worrying about breaking compatibility with other clients/servers in the larger network. It could update the client to point users to a server that uses a completely different, closed protocol. This is what happened to many XMPP users in the early 2000s.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-the-boxing-of-xmpp">Case study: the boxing of XMPP</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP">XMPP</a> (formerly known as Jabber) is an open and federated instant-messaging protocol; anybody can set up their own XMPP server and talk to users on different XMPP servers, preventing one organization from owning the platform. Between 2005 and 2014, many proprietary chat platforms supported it: Google Talk, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Facebook Chat (later known as Facebook Messenger), and Skype were some well-known examples. Some of these platforms even enabled server-to-server federation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, users of these proprietary services were boxed. Not many Google Talk users talked to Skype users, and Skype users didn’t typically talk to AIM users. Users stayed in their own sub-platforms. The result was that all users limited themselves to talking exclusively using their provider’s software: one provider controlled the entire messaging flow, from a sender’s client to the server to a recipient’s client. <strong>Users were only ever exposed to a single XMPP implementation offered by a single provider.</strong></p>
<p>Each of the listed platforms eventually locked in their users by migrating away from XMPP. This wouldn’t have been possible if multiple implementations and providers interacted with each other. Imagine Bob uses BobClient and BobServer to talk to Alice, and Alice uses AliceClient and AliceServer. BobClient, BobServer, AliceClient, and AliceServer would all have to remain compatible and use the same protocol; a forced migration would be unlikely to occur since it would break compatibility.</p>
<p>Compare the situation with email: despite Gmail’s dominance, other email providers remain popular. Gmail users need to be able to communicate with non-Gmail users, and vice versa. Email is far less “boxed” than the aforementioned proprietary XMPP platforms. As a result, Google hasn’t been able to control the email platform as easily; Google can’t simply migrate Gmail users to a non-email platform that’s incompatible with the rest of the email landscape to further domesticate its users.</p>
<p>XMPP is still alive and well, but its current popularity is a fraction of what it once was.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-clout">Implementation clout</h3>
<p>Standards are a form of agreements made to ensure compatibility between implementations. Such agreements need to be agreed upon by the implementations themselves. When one implementation grows dominant, so too does its leverage in the decision-making process over shared standards. Too much dominance can create a monoculture in which the dominant implementation is the only implementation that conforms to the spec.</p>
<p>With enough leverage, a dominant implementation can serve as a reference implementation. Reference implementations are typically quite helpful, serving as a source of truth to test other implementations against. Problems may arise when development of the spec and production-grade reference implementation grow tightly coupled, leaving third-party implementation feasibility out of the decision-making process.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-matrix-and-element">Case study: Matrix and Element</h4>
<p>One example of this phenomenon is <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>. Matrix is an open and federated instant-messaging platform similar to XMPP, with a very large spec boasting many features: server-side history, replies, rich text, reactions, room versions, <abbr title="end-to-end encryption">E2EE</abbr>, avatars, display names, typing indicators, read receipts, device verification…the list goes on and grows every month.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The only client that implements all the necessary features is Element. In addition to being the most popular client, Element practically serves as the reference client implementation: it’s developed by the same company that builds the dominant servers and most of the spec. The tight coupling between Element and the Matrix spec allow it to add features at a rate too fast for other clients too keep up; pretty much every Matrix user has to open up Element at some point to perform an action that isn’t supported in any other client. On the server side, Synapse is the only server that implements enough of the spec to be usable, with Dendrite coming in second. Both are made by the same company that develops Element.</p>
<p>Since there aren’t any third-party clients and servers that can replace the official ones, one vendor is close to controlling all parts of the platform. The growing complexity required of clients and servers can also further entrench these dominant implementations, as I <a href="https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html#simplicity">previously explained</a>. Matrix is close to being a boxed platform because the official client and server can iterate independently of the greater ecosystem.</p>
<p>I don’t think that Matrix is going to become a fully closed platform anytime soon; the blog post <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom/">“On Privacy versus Freedom”</a> seems to put it on the right side of the closed/open spectrum. Clients like <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a> and <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">FluffyChat</a> seem to keep up with Element well enough to serve as partial replacements. I do, however, find its current state problematic and much closer to “closed” on the closed/open spectrum than XMPP, IRC, and email.</p>
<h3 id="unstandardized-feature-creep">Unstandardized feature creep</h3>
<p>Platforms are more than their protocols. Different implementations have unique behavior to distinguish themselves. Problems arise when dominant implementations' unique unstandardized features grow past a certain point to make a closed superset of an open platform.</p>
<h4 id="case-studies-email-providers">Case studies: email providers</h4>
<p>After reading my previous article, a few people contacted me to ask for my thoughts regarding certain email providers. There’s not much that can set a standard email provider apart if it just hosts a simple email server. To distinguish themselves, email providers often implement many features beyond email standards compliance.</p>
<p>The vast majority of email accounts come from a small handful of dominant providers backed by large companies (Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Yandex Mail, Mail.ru, iCloud, and others). Providers such as Gmail are notorious for implementing advanced spam filters prejudiced against non-mainstream email providers. Users who self-host email servers or use small providers frequently trigger false positives and end up having their messages incorrectly labeled as spam until they can build up a “reputation”.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The addition of such a complex spam-prevention filter strengthens the email oligopoly by creating a barrier to entry for newcomers. Low-volume senders are discriminated against, as Migadu <a href="https://archive.is/rJnSs#deliverability">found out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve already seen our share of bad spam filters and misconfigured servers. In some cases recipient servers intentionally rejected correct emails just because we are a low volume sender. Ironically that is how an ideal sender should be. To improve the “receiveability” they of course offer their own hosted email service at a hefty price.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example: email providers such as Hey.com, Protonmail, and Tutanota offer many features that are incompatible with IMAP/POP3. Protonmail and Tutanota use their own non-standard E2EE implementation (rather than focusing on improving the UX for vanilla PGP), and Hey.com offers server-side mail organization. Users of these services must use official Web, desktop, and mobile clients.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> These three providers control both the client and the server, giving them the means for vendor lock-in. Of course, there’s a limit to the amount of lock-in these providers can achieve: as I explained in the <a href="#case-study-the-boxing-of-xmpp">XMPP case study</a>, these providers still need to support SMTP to stay compatible with the wider email landscape.</p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
<p>That’s enough doom-and-gloom. Let’s focus on actions that users and vendors can take to keep platforms open.</p>
<h3 id="what-users-can-do">What users can do</h3>
<p>As a user, consider using clients and servers made by different groups of people to make platform boxing more difficult. Pick implementations that suffer from less <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">feature creep</a> beyond spec compliance. What distinguishes a client shouldn’t be <em>what</em> features it has, but <em>how</em> it implements its features. Obviously, having some unique features is great; problems arise when the number of unique features crosses a certain threshold. Following both …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>I’ve gone through <a href="http://coinlib.io/" data-type="URL" data-id="coinlib.io">coinlib.io</a>‘s data regarding crypto’s money flows. Meaning, the trading volume between many pairs on may exchanges.</p>



<p>In this case, i’ve gone out of my way to highlight Dollar flows. Specifically, Dollar flows into and out of Tether and other stablecoin, notably BUSD and USDC – supposedly audited.</p>



<p>Tracking the trading between crypto and fiat, this turns out to be patently false. If there <em>was</em> organic trading between dollars and stablecoin, there ought to be alot of outflows, considering Tether is the gateway to pretty much every crypto at this point. With a $928 billion marketcap across the crypto space, there should be atleast billions of flow in dollars, especially with a circulationg supply of 24,7+ Billion USDT.</p>



<p>We find that there is almost none. The entire trading volume between USD and USDT is no more then $20 million. EVERYTHING ELSE is Tether, perceived to have the same value as a dollar.</p>



<p>This includes all other stablecoins. The same applies: If there was organic trading, there ought to be <em>Dollar</em> inflows. But that isn’t the case: Even in the supposedly audited USDC’s case, the Majority of inflows into the currency are Tethers.</p>



<p>I made this collage as an answer to a question i have had myself for a long time:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="445" height="501" src="https://www.desogames.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tetherunbackedclean.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.desogames.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tetherunbackedclean.png 445w, https://www.desogames.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tetherunbackedclean-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px"></figure>



<p>So far we’ve all been focusing on the change that involves the loan to Bitfinex. But… My question has been for a long time:</p>



<p><em>“What do they mean by Cash “Equivalents”?</em></p>



<p>I mean. Wording means alot. “Which include <span>traditional</span> currency <strong><em><span>AND</span></em></strong> cash equivalents”.</p>



<p>Why not “Which includes cash, cash equivalents and, from time to time….”?</p>



<p><em>Could it be that they count OTHER stablecoin as “Cash Equivalents”?</em></p>



<p>This gave me the thought that Tether might’ve been backed by Tether – but i don’t think they’ve gone that far. Instead, i think it’s a conspiracy. Not a theory, a legitimate conspiracy. Cartels in business exist too, just check the EU’s anti-trust fine history if you want to find them, in all locales.</p>



<p>Coinbase is the entrypoint. Because they only deal in dollars, they deal in <em>trust</em>. Their stablecoin is audited by a supposed reputable Top 5 acocunting agency (Google “Granton &amp; Thornton scandals”). Because people trust coinbase, they’ll put their money into bitcoin on coinbase.</p>



<p>Their latest transparency report still hasn’t been posted as of the 23rd of January, while all other reports are signed between the 12th and 16th, with 17th and 18th days being outlyers – except for November 23rd 2020 for the October report: <a href="https://www.centre.io/usdc-transparency">https://www.centre.io/usdc-transparency</a></p>



<p>Their last report from November says: “US Dollars held in custody accounts = $3,004,921,958” – and i find it notable this is pretty close to the reserves Tether claimed to have audited a few years ago. Also those where the USDC reserves as of November 30th. Their October 31st holdings: $2,973,954,847.</p>



<p>I wonder why their report of December is late?</p>

<p>Oh wait no i don’t. They don’t have that much. All those inflows are Tether:</p>

It’s quite large due to the amount of data contained. Unavoidable i’m afraid, because separation of data, and people unable to connect it in their head, is the reason this has been able to go on for so long. Complexity offers secrecy. So an overview in one picture that tracks and highlights USD flows (into Tether mainly) offers clarity.</figcaption></figure>



<p>BUSD same thing. HUSD same thing. </p>



<p><em>THEY’RE ALL IN ON IT!</em></p>



<p>Coinbase is the entry gate. Kraken is the side-door to make sure people can still “travel” in and out of the crypto space; The main objective is to keep the majority of the people inside of the Hotel California. Only when they go for the exits in large enough numbers does the scam collapse.</p>



<p>Huobi handles the Asian market. Binance increases demand for Tether and other stablecoin by offering *insane* gains…. Which always materialize because Bitfinex can just print Tethers and hand them over to Binance. There have been many Whale Alerts on Twitter that show as much.</p>



<p>The final piece of evidence for this is the fact that Coinlib shows USD flows between Tether and USD: https://coinlib.io/exchange/kraken</p>



<p>But Tether shows NO flows between It and USD: https://coinlib.io/coin/USDT/Tether</p>



<p>Once you’ve eliminated the impossible, whatever’s left, however improbable must be the truth:</p>



<p><em>There is no USD-USDT trading on Kraken going on. There is no link. People trading USDT-USD on Kraken are trading against Kraken’s personal account filled with Tether or USD. Like Bernie Madoff, who never made a single trade in his trading account during the entire scheme; It could very well be that Kraken has never made a single Tether-USD transaction in their entire existence.</em></p>



<p>While i can’t say anything about Bittrex or smaller exchanges… The big ones: Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, Huobi and Coinbase are <strong><em><span>ALL</span></em></strong> guilty of <em>both</em> the largest Ponzi scheme, and the largest Dollar Counterfeiting scheme in history.</p>



<p><span>ALL THEIR OFFICES SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE RAIDED, THEIR TRADING CEASED, AND THE MONEY RECOVERED AS BEST IT CAN BEFORE THEY, AND IT, <strong>COMPLETELY </strong>DISAPPEARS!</span><span></span></p>



<p><strong><span>THIS HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH!</span></strong></p>

While this was Sega’s last attempt to conquer the console market, some of the technologies which were pioneered in the Dreamcast carried on and into future mainstream devices.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, Sega chose Hitachi again to develop their CPU. If you’ve been reading the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/sega-saturn/">previous article about the Sega Saturn</a> then, lo and behold, I present you the next generation of SH processor: the <strong>SH-4</strong> running at a whopping <strong>200 MHz</strong>. So, what’s interesting about this CPU?</p><ul><li><strong>5-stage pipeline</strong>: Up to five instructions can be in flight simultaneously (a detailed explanation can be found in a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/sega-saturn/#cpu">previous article</a>).<ul><li>Instruction pipelining is now found everywhere in this generation of consoles and will be standard from now on.</li></ul></li><li><strong>2-way superscalar</strong>: A new type of parallelism where the CPU can process more than one instruction (two in this case) in each stage of the pipeline resulting in more instructions executed per second.</li><li>A dedicated <strong>Floating-Point Unit</strong> or ‘FPU’: Computes 32-bit decimal numbers (the <em>floats</em>) and 64-bit ones (the <em>doubles</em>).</li><li>8 KB <strong>instruction cache</strong> and 16 KB <strong>data cache</strong>: This ratio is rather curious since consoles tend to include more instruction cache than data cache. However, the SH-4 allows the data cache to be split into two sections: 8 KB of <em>Scratchpad</em> (fast RAM) and 8 KB of data cache.</li><li><strong>32-bit internal architecture</strong> while keeping a <strong>16-bit instruction set</strong> (the SuperH ISA): Just like the SH-2, this increases code density and decreases bus overheads while still enjoying the advantages of a 32-bit architecture.</li><li><strong>External 64-bit bus</strong>: Critical for manipulating 64-bit values (e.g. doubles and longs) without wasting extra cycles.</li></ul><p>The common chores of a game console CPU include handling a game’s logic, running the enemy AI and keeping the GPU fed with instructions. In the Dreamcast the SH-4 is also involved in the majority of the graphics pipeline, processing geometry data such as computing perspective transformations. As a result, it includes a <strong>128-bit SIMD</strong> unit that can accelerate vector operations.</p><h4 id="improving-memory-access">Improving memory access</h4><p>The CPU includes a dedicated <strong>Memory Management Unit</strong> or ‘MMU’ for virtual addressing, this is helpful since the physical memory address space of this CPU happens to be <strong>29 bits wide</strong>. So with the help of four TLBs, programmers can use 32-bit addresses without hitting performance penalties.</p><p>Since only 29 bits are needed for addressing, the extra three bits control memory protection, alternating the memory map and circumventing the cache, respectively.</p><p>The programmer decides whether to use these features or not. Games for this system certainly don’t necessarily <em>need</em> memory protection and the MMU has to be manually enabled at boot.</p><h4 id="no-uma-but">No UMA but…</h4><p>While this system is not designed around the strict Unified Memory Architecture like a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#simplified-memory-access">well-known competitor</a>, it does delegate I/O access to the GPU. That means that if the CPU has to fetch anything that’s beyond its own dedicated RAM or a serial interface which is also connected too, it will have to request the GPU (and wait if necessary).</p><h4 id="special-queries">Special queries</h4><p>This CPU also features a unique functionality called <strong>Parallel I/O</strong> or ‘PIO’ that is used to manipulate multiple I/O locations at the same time. Sega wired up these pins so the CPU can manipulate the GPU’s <strong>video mode</strong> (more details about this later).</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>The GPU package is a custom-made chip called <strong>Holly</strong> running at 100 MHz, it’s designed by VideoLogic (now known as Imagination Technologies) and manufactured by NEC.

The process is as follows:</p><ol><li>The <strong>Image Synthesis Processor</strong> or ‘ISP’ fetches the primitives (either triangles or quads) and performs <strong>Hidden-Surface Removal</strong> to remove unseen polygons. Then, after calculating its Z-buffers and stencil buffers, the data goes through <strong>Depth Testing</strong> to avoid rendering polygons that would appear behind others and <strong>Stencil Tests</strong> to cull geometry that won’t be visible if they are located behind a 2D polygon (also called <strong>Mask</strong>).<ul><li>Notice how these tests are effectively carried out at the start of the pipeline. In contrast previous consoles <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#modern-visible-surface-determination">using z-buffers</a> discard the geometry at the end of the pipeline.

<h2 id="ssh-access-hardening">SSH Access Hardening</h2>

<p>SSH certificates, when deployed properly, improve security.
A half-baked access system using certs is more vulnerable than a public-key-based one if a user or host gets hacked.</p>

<p>SSH is hard. Our team learned this at Rackspace, a large managed hosting and cloud provider.
We started with deploying public keys to every server. We added a jump server with a second factor login to prevent
hacks using stolen keys. Soon, infosec team asked us to log into a web portal to match SSH logins with emails.
Evolution does not produce the most efficient result, and our system did not turn out great either.
We were missing keys on some servers and found stale keys on others.
No one liked login screens popping up multiple times a day.
We received only one one-time password token, and some folks pointed their home webcam to it.</p>

<p>In 2015 we left Rackspace to build <a href="https://github.com/gravitational/teleport" data-size="large" aria-label="Star gravitational/teleport on GitHub">Teleport</a> — a unified access plane
for infrastructure, and we started with SSH. We chose SSH certificates as the main cryptography engineering primitive. Since then our customers and open source users have deployed Teleport at most impressive systems, and Teleport went through
several security audits.</p>

<p>I would like to share some of the lessons we learned with you.
We will start with the SSH authentication basics, dig into SSH certificates
and learn what it takes to build a secure SSH certificate-based authentication.</p>

<h3 id="ssh-public-key-authentication">SSH Public Key Authentication</h3>

<p>An SSH public key is distributed openly, and anyone holding it can verify messages
signed using its private key counterpart.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-public-key-auth.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Public Key Authentication"></p>

<p>An SSH server generates a random string — a challenge — and asks a client to sign it.
The server verifies clients’ signature to prove that the client has the private key associated with
the trusted public key. Here is how it looks on the wire:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-public-key-protocol.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Public Key Challenge"></p>

<p>Public keys constitute a solid way to authenticate and are used to secure both Web and SSH.</p>

<p>The problems with public key authentication are caused by key management: trust on first use (a.k.a. TOFU)
and rotating and revoking trusted public keys.</p>

<h3 id="trust-on-first-use">Trust On First Use</h3>

<p>When an SSH connection is first established, an SSH server sends its public key to identify
itself to a user.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-host-auth.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Host Authentication"></p>

<p>The user can accept the public key offered by the SSH server and assume that the host is trusted
if the user connects to it first time. This authentication scheme is called “trust on first use” or TOFU.</p>

<p>If the host’s IP, name or public key change, the user can no longer trust this combination
of the hostname, the IP and the public key.</p>

<p>The user sees a scary warning.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-tofu.png" width="100%" alt="SSH TOFU"></p>

<p>The user can alert security folks or ignore the warning by removing the old key.
For cloud environments, however, an IP address and a hostname can be
reused many times. Users learn to ignore those warnings, because there is no way to learn whether it’s an attack or an IP or a hostname change. Let’s call it TOFU fatigue.</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-public-keys">Problems With Public Keys</h3>

<p>A second problem of public keys for security is caused by complexities of public key distribution.
Imagine a deployment with 100 servers and 10 users, where every user has 2 public keys.
You have to build a system that distributes 20 user’s public keys on each server and
100 public keys to every user’s computer, and keep those up to date.</p>

<p>Directory services like LDAP are used to store user’s and host’s public keys.
Every host runs an agent that connects to an LDAP server and updates public keys.
Sysadmin folks have been deploying this Keycloak and FreeIPA pair for years.</p>

<p>This system breaks down at a small and a large scale. Sysadmins of small systems
rarely deploy key management software. It’s not worth setting up FreeIPA and Keycloak for 3 nodes.
They use tools like Ansible and end up with keys going out of sync when someone loses their key, computer, or leaves the company. Sometimes, let’s face it, there is no Ansible and everyone uses the same shared key.</p>

<p>Admins of large clusters learn that the system of moving the key around stops working beyond the 1K nodes or 100 users mark —
there are just too many keys to keep track of.</p>

<h2 id="ssh-certificates">SSH Certificates</h2>

<p>SSH certificates are built using public keys and don’t offer anything extra from a cryptography engineering standpoint.</p>

<p>A certificate authority (CA) is a trusted party that holds its own public and private key pair.
SSH CA keys are used to sign user and host SSH certificates.
An SSH certificate consists of fields signed by the certificate authority.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-certificate.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Certificate"></p>

<p>Clients cannot modify these fields without breaking the signature.</p>

<p>SSH certificate authentication extends public-key-based auth and uses the same protocol messages.
In addition to verifying the public key signature, SSH server will check whether
the certificate is signed by the trusted certificate authority.</p>

<h3 id="solving-the-tofu-problem">Solving the TOFU Problem</h3>

<p>Clients use metadata in SSH certificates to verify host identities too.
When an SSH connection is established, a host sends a signed SSH certificate to a client to verify
the host’s identity. The host’s certificate is signed by a trusted CA.
It includes information about the hostname, and has an expiration date.
Here Alice checks if she can trust the host’s cert:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-host-certs.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Host Certificates"></p>

<p>As an extra precaution, SSH clients check if the hostname or the IP matches the certificate.
It makes it harder for a malicious host to impersonate another host.
If the signature check has failed or the CA is not trusted, either a serious misconfiguration
has happened or someone is attempting a man-in-the-middle attack.</p>

<p>Even if the public key of the host has been changed because the hostname has been reused in a cloud environment
during instance re-provisioning, the certificate will still match; there will be no conflict between different
public keys.</p>

<p>Sysadmins can replace the complex system of moving hundreds of public keys around
with two files — a host and a user SSH certificates’ authority public keys.
But in practice if we had stopped at this point, we would have made SSH security much, much worse.</p>

<h3 id="compromised-users-and-hosts">Compromised Users and Hosts</h3>

<p>If a user or a host gets compromised, we have to revoke their certs.
We are back to building a system of keeping track and distributing revocation lists to users and hosts.
Even worse, if a private key of a SSH user or a host certificate authority gets compromised,
all users and hosts certificates have to be invalidated and reissued.</p>

<p>This realization hits at the worst possible moment — when someone is hacked, there is no time to waste.
Time works against us because with every issued cert, the potential for compromise
increases. At least with public keys, we test the rotation on a regular basis. Revocation is so rare,
that it could be broken for all this time and no one would notice. This problem reminds me of backup restore —
you either test backup and restore regularly, or all bets are off.</p>

<h2 id="making-time-work-for-you">Making Time Work for You</h2>

<p>There is one trick that makes time work in favor of security.
SSH certificates include an optional expiry date that can be verified
by a server in addition to a signature.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-short-lived.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Short Lived Certs"></p>

<p>Organizations ca issue certificates that are good for a few hours before they auto-expire
without any action. The shorter the duration for these certificates, the better.
Ideally, certs should be issued only for the duration of a session.
In practice, several hours or the duration of the workday are OK too.</p>

<p>Instead of distributing revocation lists, we can rely on time to do the job for us.</p>

<h3 id="user-certificates-and-sso">User Certificates and SSO</h3>

<p>How would users get a short-lived certificate? The best way is to use SSO
with GitHub, Okta or any other identity provider and get a cert.
Teleport opens login screen, issues a cert and delivers it back to a user’s computer:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-sso.png" width="100%" alt="SSH certs SSO"></p>

<p>Here is an example of Teleport’s CLI tool <code>tsh</code> issuing a certificate
based on my GitHub credentials.</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-github.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-github.webm" type="video/webm">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>The cert is valid for 12 hours and has my GitHub identity encoded in it.</p>

<h2 id="rotate-ca-keys">Rotate CA Keys</h2>

<p>An attacker getting access to a private key of a certificate authority can impersonate
any user or host. That’s why admins store CA private keys in the most secure place possible.
What happens if a user, a host, or a CA gets compromised? You’d need to replace certificate authority
and reissue all certs for hosts and users. Any system dealing with certs should support this out of the box.</p>

<p>Take a look at how I rotate a user CA in less than a minute with Teleport:</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-rotation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-rotation.webm" type="video/webm">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>With user certificate authority updated, all certificates issued by the old CA become invalid.
It’s not a problem if you use SSO; users have to re-login to get new certs.
The same command rotates hosts CA as well. Instead of waiting for the compromise
to happen, we should be rotating certificate authorities every day turning
them from a precious secret to a replaceable commodity. Here again, time
will work in our favor, not against us.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Use certs with caution, and beware of long-lived certificates. Rotate your CA regularly
and use SSO to get user certs. And maybe, give <a href="https://github.com/gravitational/teleport" data-size="large" aria-label="Star gravitational/teleport on GitHub">Teleport</a> a try.</p>

This chipset contains multiple components, one of them being the main CPU. The rest are at the CPU disposal to speed up certain tasks.</p><h4 id="the-leader">The leader</h4><p>The main core is a <strong>MIPS R5900-compatible</strong> CPU with lots of enhancements. This is the first chip that starts executing instructions after the console is turned on. The processor provides the following features:</p><ul><li><strong>MIPS III ISA</strong>: A 64-bit RISC instruction set. <em>Wait, is it me or this is the same ISA found on a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#cpu">competitor’s console</a>?</em>. Not quite, Sony enhanced the ISA by adding some instructions from <strong>MIPS IV</strong> (prefetch and conditional move) along with their own SIMD extension called <strong>multimedia instructions</strong>.</li><li><strong>32 128-bit extra registers</strong>: Another enhancement. They are better managed using multimedia instructions and are very useful for vector processing.<ul><li>These registers are accessed through a 128-bit bus, while the rest of the CPU uses an internal 64-bit bus.</li></ul></li><li><strong>2-way superscalar</strong>: Up to two instructions are executed in parallel.</li><li><strong>24 KB L1 cache</strong>: Divided into 16 KB for instructions and 8 KB for data.<ul><li>It also implements a <strong>prefetch function</strong> to cache instructions and data before they are requested. This is done by including extra circuitry that can identify which places in memory are more often requested.</li></ul></li><li><strong>16 KB of Scratchpad RAM</strong>: Also known as ‘Fast RAM’.</li><li><strong>Memory management unit</strong>: Interfaces memory access with the rest of the system.</li></ul><p>The core is complemented with a <strong>dedicated floating point unit</strong> (identified as ‘COP1’) that accelerates operations with 32-bit floating point numbers (also known as <code>floats</code> in C).</p><h4 id="a-recognisable-memory-choice">A recognisable memory choice</h4><p>Next to the Emotion Engine are two blocks of 16 MB of RAM, giving a total of <strong>32 MB</strong> of main memory. The type of memory used is <strong>RDRAM</strong> (<a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#ram-available"><em>déjà vu!</em></a>) which is accessed through a 16-bit bus.</p><div><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/MemoryArch.b34c74b38be1ed34237a641ee12d48fafbb98ad28688c4ebb79fc723d8e0ab24.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="605" height="269" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/MemoryArch.b34c74b38be1ed34237a641ee12d48fafbb98ad28688c4ebb79fc723d8e0ab24.png" loading="auto"></picture></a><figcaption>Memory design of the Emotion Engine<br>You can guess where the congestion is gonna appear</figcaption></div><p>At first, this can be a little disappointing to hear, considering the internal bus of the Emotion engine is as wide as 128 bits. However, the RAM chips are strategically placed by following the <strong>dual-channel architecture</strong>, which consists in connecting both chips using two independent 16-bit buses (one bus per chip) to improve data throughput. The resulting setup provides a theoretical 3.2 GB/sec, so rest assured that memory latency is not an issue in this console!</p></div><p>At one corner of the Emotion engine there is a powerful <strong>DMA Controller</strong> or ‘DMAC’ that transfers data between main memory and Scratchpad; or between main memory and any component inside the EE.</p><p>Data transfers are done in batches of 128-bits, but here is the interesting part: Every eight batches, the main bus is temporarily unlocked. This leaves a small window to perform other DMA transfers in parallel (up to ten) or let the CPU use the main bus. This <em>modus operandi</em> is called <strong>slice mode</strong> and is one of the many modes available on this DMA unit. Bear in mind that while slice mode reduces stalls on the main bus, it does so at the cost of slowing down the overall DMA transfer.</p><h4 id="preventing-past-mishaps">Preventing past mishaps</h4><p>Whether we want it or not, with the amount of traffic happening inside the Emotion Engine, this design will eventually suffer the consequences of the <strong>Unified memory architecture</strong> or ‘UMA’. That is… multiple independent components trying to access main memory at the same time, causing congestion. Well, to correct these issues, Sony alleviated the constant need for memory by:</p><ul><li>Wrapping their processors with <strong>lots of cache</strong>. Thus, only requiring access to main memory if absolutely necessary.<ul><li>99% of cache/scratchpad mentions in this article will be for this reason.</li></ul></li><li>Adding a 128-byte <strong>Write Back Buffer</strong>: Very similar to the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#ibms-enhancements">Write Gather Pipe</a>, but instead of waiting until it’s 25% full, it will check the state of the bus (i.e congested or free) first.</li></ul><p>This sounds very convenient for applications that can benefit from cache, but what about those tasks, such as manipulating Display Lists, which shouldn’t use cache at all? Luckily, the CPU provides a different memory access mode called <strong>UnCached</strong>, which <strong>only</strong> uses the Write Back Buffer. Thus, it will not waste cycles correcting the cache (product of <em>cache misses</em>).</p><p>Furthermore, the <strong>UnCached accelerated mode</strong> is also available. This one adds a buffer for speeding up read of continuous addresses in memory.</p><h4 id="other-interesting-bits">Other interesting bits</h4><p>Inside the same Emotion Engine package, there is yet-another processor called <strong>Image Processing Unit</strong> or ‘IPU’, this time designed for <strong>image decompression</strong>. The IPU can be useful when a game needs to decode an MPEG2 movie without jamming the main CPU.</p><p>Long story short, the game sends compressed image streams to the IPU (hopefully using DMA) which is then decoded in a format that the GPU can display. The PS2’s operating system also relies in the IPU to provide DVD playback.</p><p>Finally, the IPU also operates compressed <strong>High-resolution textures</strong>, which saves CPU usage and reduces large transfers.</p><hr><h2 id="co-cpus">Co CPUs</h2><p>It’s been two years since the rivals presented their <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/dreamcast/">latest offering</a>. If you read the former article and just started reading this one, I presume you are <em>still</em> waiting for ‘the thing’ that makes the PS2 as powerful as it seemed back then. Now, let me introduce a <em>very</em> important set of components Sony fitted in the Emotion Engine, the <strong>Vector Processing Units</strong> or ‘VPU’.</p><p>A Vector Processing Unit is a small independent processor designed to operate vectors. In particular, vectors made of four <code>floats</code>. These processors are so fast that they only spend <strong>one cycle per operation</strong>, which can be extremely convenient for geometry processing.</p><p>VPUs are made of the following components:</p><ul><li>Some <strong>Vector Unit Memory</strong> or ‘VU Mem’: Used as a working space for the Vector unit. It stores values needed to be operated and/or the results of previous operations.</li><li>A <strong>Vector Unit</strong>: The core of the processor. It contains some memory (called <strong>Micro Memory</strong>) to store a program (called <strong>Microprogram</strong>) which instructs the unit on how to operate the data found in ‘VU Mem’.<ul><li>It implements a <strong>64-bit ISA</strong> and the execution unit is <strong>split into two parallel sub-units</strong>. The first one multiplies or adds floats, while the other one divides floats or operates integers. This enables to operate both floats and integers <strong>concurrently</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>A <strong>Vector Interface</strong>: Automatically decompresses vertex data coming from main memory in a format the Vector unit can understand. This unit can also transfer microprograms to Micro Memory.</li></ul><p>To start working, the vector unit needs to be ‘kickstarted’. For this, the main CPU is in charge of supplying the microcode.
There are <strong>two VPUs</strong> fitted in the Emotion engine, but they are arranged differently, giving way to different uses and optimisations.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-vector-processing-unit-0-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-vector-processing-unit-0">Vector Processing Unit 0</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-vector-processing-unit-1-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-vector-processing-unit-1">Vector Processing Unit 1</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-vector-processing-unit-0"><h4>Vector Processing Unit 0</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/VU0.300aa8f5034941872e5a56f84ab61dfa3f3b2c71ede208b85d7edc99e6dd38a5.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="881" height="429" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/VU0.300aa8f5034941872e5a56f84ab61dfa3f3b2c71ede208b85d7edc99e6dd38a5.png" loading="auto"></picture></a><figcaption>Architecture of VPU0</figcaption></div><p>The first VPU, the <strong>VPU0</strong>, is positioned between the CPU and the other vector unit (VPU1). It provides an ‘assisting’ role to the main CPU.</p><p>The VPU0 has two modes of operation:</p><ul><li><strong>Micromode</strong>: This is the ‘traditional mode’. The VPU will independently execute ‘microinstructions’ from a microprogram stored in Micro memory.</li><li><strong>Macromode</strong>: The VPU0 becomes the ‘COP2’ of the main CPU and executes ‘macro-instructions’, received from the main CPU through a dedicated 128-bit bus.<ul><li>Macro-instruction have the same functionality of microinstructions but use different opcodes. Nonetheless, the VPU execution unit is no longer split (meaning it can only execute one instruction at a time).</li><li>While this mode doesn’t make full utilisation of all the components of the VPU0, it still speeds up the CPU’s vector operations. Moreover, in terms of simplicity, a co-processor is easier to program than an independent unit (something PC programmers will find helpful).</li></ul></li></ul><p>The memory map of the VPU0 also has access to some of the other VPU’s registers and flags, presumably to check its state or quickly read the results of some operations done by the other VPU.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-vector-processing-unit-1"><h4>Vector Processing Unit 1</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/VUP1.a655cb236515c27f56d7d883e367c54381a35a4a08cd177165d92e443454087e.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="822" height="431" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/VUP1.a655cb236515c27f56d7d883e367c54381a35a4a08cd177165d92e443454087e.png" loading="auto"></picture></a><figcaption>Architecture of VPU1</figcaption></div><p>The second VPU found, the <strong>VPU1</strong>, is an enhanced version of the VPU0 with double the amount of micro memory and VU memory. Moreover, this unit includes an additional component called <strong>Elementary function unit</strong> or ‘EFU’ which speeds up the execution of exponential and trigonometric functions.</p><p>The VPU1 is located between the VPU0 and the Graphics Interface (the ‘gate’ to the GPU), so it includes additional buses to feed the geometry to the GPU as quickly as possible and without using the main bus.</p><p>On the other side and due to its location, the VPU1 <strong>only operates in micromode</strong>.</p><p>It’s obvious that this VPU was designed for trigonometric operations, and may serve as a pre-processor for the GPU. Hence, it’s often put in charge of delivering the famous Display Lists.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="infinite-worlds">Infinite worlds</h4><p>A useful approach that can be exploited with these units is <strong>procedural generation</strong>. In other words, instead of building the scene using hard-coded geometry, let the VPUs generate it using algorithms. In this case, the VPU computes <strong>mathematical functions to produce the geometry</strong> which is then interpreted by the GPU (i.e. triangles, lines, quadrangles, etc) and ultimately used to draw the scene.</p><p>Compared to using explicit data, procedural content is ideal for parallelised tasks, it frees up bandwidth, requires very little storage and it’s dynamic (programmers can set parameters to achieve different results). There are certain areas that can highly benefit from this technique:</p><ul><li><strong>Complex surfaces</strong> (e.g. spheres and wheels).</li><li><strong>World rendering</strong> (e.g terrains, particles, trees).</li><li><strong>Bezier curves</strong> (a very popular equation in computer graphics which is used to draw curves), these are …</li></ul></div></div></div>

I'd like to reflect a bit on that journey and some decisions made.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-d80e093b0fca4b29b133fbe410506ef0"><span id="d80e093b0fca4b29b133fbe410506ef0"></span><span><span>Founding Engineer</span></span></h2><p><span><span>I am the founding engineer at Reforge. "Founding engineer" just means that I take a lower salary than I would make in Facebook or Google in exchange for a large equity stake that vests over the period of generally 4 years. Sometimes this pays off, and "founding engineers" make millions or tens of millions of dollars in a short period of time. Most often, it doesn't.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I've been a founding or early engineer a few times. At </span><span><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eventbrite</a></span><span>, I was engineer #3, going from $4M to $700M in valuation. That turned out well.</span></span></p><p><span><span>
Additionally, I've started two companies, one of which was a 100% total loss, and a waste of 18 months of my life. I'll never get that time back, but I gained some perspective on identifying good opportunity. The other is doing okay at 500k users, but still too early to tell.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Which is a good segue for shit.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-89b8099e4a4743878b0cb9f2a93747be"><span id="89b8099e4a4743878b0cb9f2a93747be"></span><span><span>Why Join Reforge</span></span></h2><p><span><span>When I was considering joining Reforge, I had just started </span><span><a href="https://www.castingcall.club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casting Call Club</a></span><span>, and built it up to about 35k users. But, Reforge had a lot going for it on paper.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Brian Balfour, ex-VP at Hubspot and 3 time startup founder, was at the helm.</strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>When I met Brian, I got the same butterflies in my stomach that I got when I met </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hartz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Hartz</a></span><span>, the founder at Eventbrite. Brian is a guy who simply knows his shit. The biggest successes I got in life was aligning my career journey temporarily to someone who knows their shit. You can't latch on forever because you'll never grow out of their shadow, but you can suck the experience out of them by getting as much 1-on-1 time with them as possible during the early days.</span></span></p><p><span><span>How do you know if someone knows their shit? First you have to know your own shit, and know where the gaps in your shit are. Fill the gaps in your shit with their shit. #RealTalk</span></span></p><p><span><span>For 2.5 years at Reforge, there would only be 5 people at the company (all of whom are incredible in their own right), and my opportunity to siphon off as much knowledge from Brian as I could would be abundant.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>The Reforge content was really fucking good.</strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>Brian had started the Silicon Valley Business Review with Andrew Chen (ex-VP Uber, now A16Z). They did a couple summer cohorts where they ran a program that taught the basics of what Growth is. Not Growth Hacking, or the disparate learnings of greasy bloggers looking to sell their guru courses. Brian and Andrew were offering a deep, comprehensive, foundational walkthrough of Growth, and they called it the Growth Series. This gave birth to Reforge.</span></span></p><p><span><span>When I caught whiff of what they were up to -- and realized how it was different, and far better, than the static and shallow MOOCs you'd find on Coursera and Udemy or the massive time-dump a 2-year degree was -- I knew there was real potential. Nothing out there could compare.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>The network is the moat.</strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>I was thinking about Harvard a lot when I was deciding to join Reforge. No one spends a quarter million dollars to go to Harvard just for the content they could get for free on the internet. They join Harvard for the network.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Reforge was already attracting leaders I looked up to, like Casey Winters, Fareed Mosavat, Elena Verna. They were the real market makers in tech, driving hundreds of millions in growth in companies like Instacart, Slack, Eventbrite, Miro, Survey Monkey, Mulesoft. A network like this would be hard to beat.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Cohort-based learning in a huge TAM</strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>From my Techstars days, I knew that learning in cohorts was magic compared to learning things on your own. It feels like you're part of a band of individuals trying to overcome a challenge together, and it builds camaraderie. When my lizard brain finally made the connection that companies would pay for their employees to take Reforge as part of a group, the opportunity clicked.</span></span></p><p><span><span>For example, let's say Shopify has 50 product managers all speaking slightly different product management vernacular. Shopify sends them all to Reforge to build a common vocabulary and best base practices. That's step 1. Step 2: Shopify hires 5 more product managers per quarter. Guess what becomes a part of their onboarding?</span></span></p><p><span><span>Now multiply this by every tech company there is.</span></span></p><p><span><span><em>Okay, I'm convinced. I'll put Casting Call Club to the side and I'll join Reforge.</em></span></span></p><h2 id="block-8e34356f6940451bbed05f6442962ed8"><span id="8e34356f6940451bbed05f6442962ed8"></span><span><span>Early Problems</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Three problems nearly killed the business.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>How do you productize networking?</strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>There are lots of tools out there that help build communities, but nothing really felt right for us. </span></span></p><p><span><span>First, no one was talking. Either they were wary of competitors listening, or too busy with work itself, or simply afraid of looking stupid in front of a group of intellectual peers.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Second, we wanted to facilitate both surface and deep conversations at the same time while bubbling up valuable insights to relevant people in a relevant time. From there, we wanted to match people based on interests and relevancy.</span></span></p><p><span><span>After solving these by [redacted], the seasonal data was too few to have confidence in our findings, and so began our efforts to make learning always-on.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Seasonality</strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>Seasonality was a challenge, because user engagement waned during the off-season, and our ability to experiment with new features was limited. But seasonality also gave us plenty of time to be pensive. We weren't going to be the kind of company that threw ourselves against the wall until we broke through. Early Reforge was all about careful cuts. We measured everything well, and it led to results that would've been hard-pressed if we were a venture capital backed startup then.</span></span></p><p><span><span>But our purely pensive days were numbered.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Imagine if your company makes millions of dollars in one week, twice per year, and you earn no other income. That was our lives for nearly 4 years at Reforge. Our program cohorts were doing so well that we didn't want to change it too much. We worried over price points, positioning, cannibalization, and we hesitated.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Another question started to rise: Did we need to scale? Is there happiness is building a small company that we don't have to turn into a billion dollar company? We spent a long time questioning this. We stayed heads down and optimized all we could.</span></span></p><blockquote id="block-2a8c25fa850047faac9ff35386165e75"><span><span>By 2019, there was only 5 people in the company and we were making mid 7 figures per year.</span></span></blockquote><p><span><span>Covid went </span><span><em>viral</em></span><span> (get it!?!) in the middle of one of our twice per year cash injections, and we survived the shrinking education budgets of our user's companies, but we were jolted. This was the main catalyst we needed to push Reforge into an always-on model and urge us to build our defenses. Furthermore, the clock was ticking on the Growth Series itself, as it would become a commodity eventually. Other edu-tech companies were sprouting up like mushrooms. It seemed like the time to switch to scale-mode was here at last. </span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>How to scale content creation?</strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>I'd describe Reforge content as encyclopedic; it's a deep collection of theory and application. Every new program took on average 6 months to create in the early days, but worse is that they were made almost entirely by Brian himself. If we were to scale Reforge, we would need to either build a machine that pumps out high quality content or clone Brian. My money was on cloning tech.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The subject matter experts tended to be busy, or poor teachers, or lack the audience to build clout for themselves. We couldn't depend on subject matter experts writing their own content.</span></span></p><p><span><span>We experimented with many things around this time to mitigate the content crunch -- microblogs, connection tools, interactive learnings. Nothing was as powerful as having quality content speak for itself.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Let's go back to shit. Remember above, about knowing shit?</span></span></p><p><span><span>Enter the researchers, whose job it was to interface with the subject matter experts and slowly separate shit from the shit. I'll spare you the tedious details since you're not interested in industry secrets.</span></span></p><p><span><span>After a few arduous cycles of having research-led program creation, the content wheel was spinning and we were ready to scale.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-6fd62f6a40484654b34cc0ff1098e56b"><span id="6fd62f6a40484654b34cc0ff1098e56b"></span><span><span>Scaling Eventbrite</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Being early at Eventbrite showed me the dopamine rush raising millions of dollars was. Teams would double overnight. Budgets would go from 0 to 7 figures. We'd get a dedicated ping-pong room.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Scaling fast also brought a lot of dangers. Communication is the first to go, and unless the pods have strong directional glue, there will be real pain to feel. Next, employee engagement would start to sway. Managers would hire people who spend more time figuring out how to hide than do actual work, and what's worse is that the managers don't give strong reprimand or simply fire the bad actors because the managers themselves would either hide or be too busy to spare the willpower to care. Lastly, HR will replace the ping-pong table with an Eventbrite University classroom, which is the greatest atrocity of them all.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Personally, I struggled scaling Eventbrite. I always volunteered to be on the frontier teams. We had no data team, so I raised my hand. We had no mobile apps, so I started the mobile team (while also learning how to build mobile apps). We couldn't support internationalization, so I co-led those efforts with the CTO as a skunkworks project. I tried my best to stay out of the politics, and into creating utility.</span></span></p><p><span><span>There's a famous saying though. If you want to lead, you must first learn how to follow. If you want to be a good writer, you must first be a good reader. If you want to scale a company, you need to have already done it before.</span></span></p><p><span><span>I think that's how it goes.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-1e54734985e54d1a9a7d0c935b125ac9"><span id="1e54734985e54d1a9a7d0c935b125ac9"></span><span><span>Scaling Reforge</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Reforge feels much different than Eventbrite. For starters, every person in a leadership position here has scaled a company in the past - Hubspot, Eventbrite, Airbnb, Credit Karma, Slack, Instacart - and that led us to create stronger foundations than Eventbrite had. Our strong directional glue on the leadership team alone is healthy, and it's fulfilling to see everyone align so well.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Looking at the engineering/product side of things, we've established a playbook for many of the challenges that we've seen in the past, like where the …</span></span></p></article></div></div></div>

February 23, 2021 | https://tailscale.com/blog/modules-monoliths-and-microservices/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/modules-monoliths-and-microservices/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Lately, I get people asking me when microservices are a good idea. In <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227">systems design explains the world</a>, I talked about big-picture issues like second system effect, innovator’s dilemmas, and more. Can systems design answer the microservices question?</p>
<p>Yes, but you might not like the answers. First, we'll need some history.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-microservice">What is a microservice?</h4>
<p>You can find various definitions on the Internet. Here's mine: microservices are the most extreme possible backlash against <em>monoliths</em>.</p>
<p>Monoliths are what happen when you link everything your entire app needs into one giant program and deploy it as one big blob. Monoliths have a long history, going back to frameworks like CGI, Django, Rails, and PHP.</p>
<p>Right away, let's abandon the assumption that a monolith and a fleet of microservices are the only two options. There's a wide and nuanced continuum from "one giant service that does everything" to "infinite tiny services that each do nearly nothing."</p>
<p>If you follow fads, you'll have built a monolith at least once (whether on purpose or because that's what traditional frameworks encouraged you to do), then discovered some problems with monoliths, then heard that microservices are the answer, then started rearchitecting everything as microservices.</p>
<p>But don't follow fads. There are many points in between those extremes. One of them is probably right for you. A better approach starts with where you want to put your <em>interfaces</em>.</p>
<h4 id="boxes-and-arrows">Boxes and arrows</h4>
<p>An interface is the connection between <em>modules.</em> A module is a collection of related code. In systems design, we talk about "boxes and arrows" engineering: modules are the boxes, and interfaces are the arrows.</p>
<p>The deeper question then is: how big are the boxes? How much goes in each box? How do we decide when to split one big box into two smaller ones? What's the best way to connect the boxes? There are many approaches to all this. Nobody quite knows what's best. It's one of the hardest problems in software architecture.</p>
<p>Over the decades, we've evolved through many kinds of "boxes." <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf">Goto statements were "considered harmful"</a> largely because they prevented any hierarchy at all. Then we added functions or procedures; those are very simple boxes, with interfaces (parameters and return codes) between them.</p>
<p>Depending which branch of programming you go down, you then discover recursive functions, combinators, static function prototypes, libraries (statically or runtime-linked), objects (OOP), coroutines, protected virtual memory, processes, threads, JITs, namespaces, sandboxes, chroots, jails, containers, virtual machines, supervisors, hypervisors, microkernels, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel">unikernels</a>.</p>
<p>And that's just the boxes! Once you have boxes isolated from each other, then you need to connect them with arrows. For that, we have ABIs, APIs, syscalls, sockets, RPCs, filesystems, databases, message passing systems, and "virtualized hardware."</p>
<p>If you tried to draw a complete boxes-and-arrows diagram of a modern Unix system (which I won't), it would be wild: functions inside threads inside processes inside containers inside userspace, layered under a kernel, inside a VM, running on hardware in a rack in a datacenter in a cloud provider tied together by an orchestration system, and so on.</p>
<p>Each of those boxes at each of the abstraction layers is somehow isolated from and then connected to some of the others, at the same or other layers. Some are inside others. You couldn't draw an honest version of this picture in a mere two dimensions without lines criss-crossing hopelessly.</p>
<p>This all evolved over decades. Fancy people call it "path dependence." I call it a mess. And let's be clear: most of the mess no longer provides much value.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on what became very ugly evolutionary results, let's talk about what people were <em>trying</em> to do while they invented all that stuff.</p>
<h4 id="the-quest-for-modularity">The quest for modularity</h4>
<p>The top-line goals of module systems are always the same:</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolate each bit of code from the other bits.</li>
<li>Re-connect those bits only where explicitly intended (through a well-defined interface).</li>
<li>Guarantee that bits you change will still be compatible with the right other bits.</li>
<li>Upgrade, downgrade, and scale some bits without having to upgrade all the other bits simultaneously.</li>
</ol>
<p>The computer industry spends an absolutely immense amount of time messing around, trying to find the perfect balance of all these modularity issues, while still trying to keep development as painless and easy as possible.</p>
<p>We are, in short, not succeeding.</p>
<p>By far the part we're worst at is #1, isolation. If we could truly and efficiently isolate one bit of code from another, the other goals would mostly fall into place. But we simply do not know how.</p>
<p>Isolation is a super hard problem. Goodness knows people have tried. Yet browser sandbox escapes still happen regularly, undetected privilege escalation attacks are simply assumed to exist on every OS, iOS still gets jailbroken periodically, DRM never works (for better or worse), virtual machines and containers regularly have vulnerabilities discovered, and systems like <a href="https://blog.alcide.io/insecure-by-default-kubernetes-networking">k8s have their containers configured insecurely by default</a>.</p>
<p>People have even been known to <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/02/04/attack-of-week-tls-timing-oracles/">figure out encryption keys on remote servers by sending well-timed packets</a> to them over the Internet. Meanwhile, the most spectacular isolation failures in recent memory were the <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and Spectre attacks</a>, which allowed any program on a computer, even a javascript app in a web browser, to read the memory of other programs on the same computer, even across sandboxes or virtual machines.</p>
<p>Every new isolation technology goes through a cycle like the following, from optimism to despair:</p>
<ul>
<li>New idea: we'll finally get it right this time, once and for all!</li>
<li>Initial experiments seem to work.</li>
<li>(Users complain that it's even slower and more tedious than the last thing we tried.)</li>
<li>Early fatal flaws are discovered and fixed.</li>
<li>Widespread deployment.</li>
<li>Ever-more-subtle flaws are successively discovered and fixed.</li>
<li>Eventually, we find flaws that we simply don't know how to patch.</li>
<li>Lose hope that efficient isolation is even possible with this method.</li>
<li>But also we can never retire this isolation method because now too many people are depending on it.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, at this point security people simply don't believe that any of the following (each one the very best technology available at the time) is totally safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process isolation and memory protection on a Unix system.</li>
<li>Privilege separation between OS processes when remote code execution ("RCE" for security people) is allowed.</li>
<li>Filtering syscalls to isolate a process.</li>
<li>Mutually untrusted processes sharing a CPU hyperthread.</li>
<li>Memory isolation between virtual machines on a CPU core.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I know, the state of the art, the very best isolation, is something like the Chrome sandbox or <a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor">gVisor</a>. The big browser vendors and cloud providers all use tools like these. The tools remain imperfect, but providers do chase down every new breach as fast as they can, and the rate of new flaws is fairly slow.</p>
<p>Isolation is better than it's ever been before… if you put all your isolation at the virtual machine (VM) level so that your cloud provider can do it for you because nobody else knows how, or updates often enough.</p>
<p>If you trust your cloud provider's VM isolation, you can have hope that all known problems are mitigated; but we have every reason to think more problems will be found.</p>
<p>That's… actually pretty good, all things considered. At least we have <em>something</em> that works.</p>
<h4 id="great-vms-for-everything">Great! VMs for everything!</h4>
<p>Well, hold on. Spinning up an isolated VM for every little module is a pain. And how big is a module?</p>
<p>Long ago, when Java first came out, the dream was that every line of every function in every object could have permissions enforced, even between objects in the same application binary, so that CPU-enforced memory protection wouldn't be needed. Nobody believes anymore that they can make that work. And marketing claims like "cloud functions" aside, nobody really thinks you should try.</p>
<p>None of the currently-known isolation methods work <em>perfectly</em>, but each of them works to <em>some approximation</em>. Increasingly skilled attackers, or increasingly valuable targets, require better and more annoying isolation. The best isolation we know right now is inter-VM sandboxing provided by tier-1 cloud providers. The worst, well, it goes down to zero.</p>
<p>Let's also assume, skipping over the evidence, that most systems are so tightly coupled that <strong>a reasonably skilled attacker can break through laterally between modules.</strong> So, for example, if someone can link a malicious library into your Go or C++ program, they can probably take control of that entire program.</p>
<p>Similarly, if your program has write access to a database, attackers can probably make it write <em>anywhere</em> in the database. If it can contact the network, they can probably contact <em>anywhere</em> in the network. If it can execute arbitrary Unix commands or system calls, they can probably get Unix root access. If it's in a container, they can probably break out of the container and into other containers. If malicious data can <a href="https://imagetragick.com/">crash the png decoder</a>, they can probably make it do anything else the decoder program is allowed to do. And so on.</p>
<p>An especially powerful form of attack is getting the ability to commit code, because that code will eventually be run on developer machines, and some developer or production machine somewhere probably has access to do what you want to do.</p>
<p>The above is maybe a little too pessimistic, but making those assumptions can help avoid overcomplicating your systems without improving actual security. In <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf">Some thoughts on security after ten years of qmail 1.0</a>, Daniel J. Bernstein points out (if I may heavily paraphrase) that many of the defenses he added in qmail, particularly isolating the different components from each other using chroot and different Unix uids, were not worthwhile and have never paid off.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's take it for granted that attackers with the ability to execute code can "usually" jump …</p></div></div>

              <p>As more of our lives move online, multi-factor authentication (MFA) becomes increasingly important as a way of keeping our accounts secure. As a user, you know you should enable MFA on any accounts containing valuable data or which you want to keep safe.</p>

<p>As a developer or software engineer, MFA may seem a bit mysterious. This article will cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What MFA is</li>
  <li>Why it is important</li>
  <li>What factors are available</li>
  <li>When you might consider requiring MFA</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end, you should have a good understanding of options for integrating MFA into your applications, and how to start doing so.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-multi-factor-authentication-mfa">What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?</h2>

<p>When a user is authenticating, they are providing proof of who they are. There are four broad categories of proof:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What the user knows. A password is an example.</li>
  <li>What the user has, such as a device.</li>
  <li>What the user is; one example would be a fingerprint.</li>
  <li>Where the user is, possibly ascertained by using GPS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these methods of proof is called a ‘factor’. Factors must be kept secure. They should not be shared, in order to ensure that the authenticating user is associated with the correct account.</p>

<p>Multi-factor authentication is best understood as requiring two or more factors in order to authenticate a user. MFA is a superset of two factor authentication (2FA). With MFA an arbitrary number of factors of proof can be required. With 2FA, the number of factors is limited to two.</p>

<p>Multi-factor authentication isn’t just for online user accounts, though. If you are accessing a safe deposit box in a bank, you need a key (something you have) and a signature (something you are) or an id (another thing you have). However, this article will focus on online MFA.</p>

<p>The majority of user accounts have a password as a factor. You might be working in such a system right now. As engineering teams become more aware of the problem of user account hijacking and its real world consequences, more are allowing or requiring additional factors of authentication.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Why use multi-factor authentication (MFA)?</h2>

<p>Building a secure, available system requires ensuring only authorized people and software agents have access to it. This is a foundational concern.</p>

<p>Authentication, which ensures that a system knows who the user is, and authorization, which controls what a given user can access, both play a role in building such a system. While you can control what an actor is doing without knowing who they are, it’s far more common to tie authentication and authorization together.</p>

<p>If your users have only one factor of authentication, it can be stolen, especially if it is a password. At that point, you as a developer will have limited ability to stop the thief. Your system will have to notice suspicious behavior to determine who is legitimate and who is not. This can be done, but is complex to do at scale. If you can’t determine illicit access, the thief will have the same privileges as the user whose stolen credentials are being used; they will be indistinguishable from that user.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, passwords are being stolen regularly. While systems can help prevent unauthorized access by <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/security/breached-password-detection/">detecting stolen passwords</a> and users can protect themselves by practicing good password hygiene, requiring another factor increases the obstacles to a bad actor.</p>

<p>In particular, if another factor is required as part of the login process, account security can increase dramatically. Microsoft researchers found that accounts are <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/your-pa-word-doesn-t-matter/ba-p/731984">“99.9% less likely to be compromised”</a> if MFA is used.</p>

<p>Implementing MFA is a partnership with your users, however. Some factors are easier for system developers to support. Others require more effort and care from users.</p>

<h3 id="the-balance-between-user-experience-and-security-risk">The balance between user experience and security risk</h3>

<p>However, though MFA is more secure, you shouldn’t require it everywhere. It’s a balance, like many parts of software engineering; you want to make the user login experience as smooth as possible while minimizing chances of account takeover. Users don’t love an application for the login experience. They want to solve their problems. Friction in the authentication process will annoy some percentage of your users and negatively affect your application’s success.</p>

<p>User experience isn’t only about how easy the factor is to use. It’s also about how widely deployed a solution is. If, say, retinal scanning is trivial to use, but users don’t have or can’t find the hardware, then it isn’t really that easy after all.</p>

<p>Listen to your users when considering factors. You don’t want them to circumvent MFA in ways that will damage system security. At the same time they may need to be educated. Do you know people who still write down passwords on sticky notes? I do.</p>

<p>As a developer, you need to balance between the user experience and the risk of account takeover. In some situations the call is easy. If your site lets users vote on cat pictures, MFA isn’t really required. If your site transfers money to arbitrary people, on the other hand, it should require MFA. These scenarios are at opposite ends of the security and user experience spectrum:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/advice/mfa/security-ux-spectrum.svg" alt="More secure or easier to use?"></p>

<p>The hard part is the situations where the answer isn’t obvious. What are some situations where you should consider requiring multi-factor authentication?</p>

<h2 id="when-to-require-multiple-factors-of-authentication">When to require multiple factors of authentication</h2>

<p>There are many situations where you need a higher level of assurance about the actor behind the credentials. Sometimes the type of the user account is the deciding factor. Other times it is the access requested. Depending on your application and organization, legal requirements or corporate policies may control.</p>

<h3 id="administrative-accounts">Administrative accounts</h3>

<p>Privileged accounts with higher levels of access need to use MFA.</p>

<p>These administrator or operator accounts can wreak havoc if misused or compromised. Therefore you should require MFA on all admin accounts. In extremely sensitive systems, all changes could require providing additional factors.</p>

<h3 id="high-value-accounts">High value accounts</h3>

<p>There are also plenty of high value user accounts where MFA can help prevent unwanted account compromises. These accounts don’t necessarily possess elevated privileges, but allow data access or actions with real world consequences. Compromise of these accounts can have negative repercussions.</p>

<p>An example of such an account is an online bank account. You don’t want users to learn that someone drained their savings because of a stolen password.</p>

<p>Another example is an email account. Beyond the private information often present in email accounts, they represent a risk to accounts in other systems. Many password reset flows send an email to a known address and allow the recipient of that email to modify the password. Compromise of an email account means that any other accounts associated with this user are at risk.</p>

<h3 id="risky-actions">Risky actions</h3>

<p>When a user has already authenticated but is performing a dangerous action, MFA again provides extra security. This is also known as “step up auth”, because the additional factor is required at the moment a more privileged action is undertaken. Examples of such actions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Changing a password or username</li>
  <li>Modifying setting which impact other factors, such as an email or phone number</li>
  <li>Creating a new user with elevated privileges</li>
  <li>Changing system settings</li>
</ul>

<p>These types of actions can be legitimate, but could also be used by someone who has compromised a user account. You can partially mitigate the damage of a compromised account by implementing step up auth. An attacker may be able to access account data, but won’t be able to take damaging action.</p>

<h3 id="laws-or-organizational-policies">Laws or organizational policies</h3>

<p>If your application is used by certain organizations or stores personally identifiable information, you may need to require multi-factor authentication for users. As part of the NIST risk management framework, for example, Authenticator Assurance Level 2 requires: <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-3.pdf">“proof of possession and control of two different authentication factors…”</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes an MFA requirement is not explicit, however. If you are looking to be SOC2 certified, MFA may be required, even though the term is never mentioned in the <a href="https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/downloadabledocuments/trust-services-criteria.pdf">SOC “Trust Services Criteria”</a>. Section CC6.1 of the SOC document specifies “Persons, infrastructure, and software are identified and authenticated prior to accessing information assets, whether locally or remotely” without outlining implementation details. In this case, talk to your auditor about MFA requirements as well as other required controls.</p>

<p>When planning MFA, make sure you review any relevant laws, standards or corporate policies.</p>

<h3 id="when-the-users-actions-look-suspicious">When the user’s actions look suspicious</h3>

<p>An auth system has a unique viewpoint into who is signing in. Information is supplied and reviewed; it results in an answer to the question: “is the person providing this information the user who they are claiming to be?” Some data is provided by the user explicitly, such as the username and password. But every auth system has access to implicit data such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The date and time of access</li>
  <li>Connection information like the IP address, location, and user agent</li>
  <li>Whether this device has been used to access this service before</li>
  <li>How many times the user has logged in recently</li>
</ul>

<p>Such data can help determine if the person behind the authentication request is legitimate. For instance, if a user accesses a system from the USA but one day later there is a request from Germany with the same credentials, the request deserves scrutiny. It’s possible it is legitimate; after all, airplanes exist. But also possible that there is something nefarious going on in Germany.</p>

<p>Requiring MFA before access is allowed when suspicious activity occurs provides another check against stolen credentials. That German hacker could have acquired a user’s password, but it’s harder to steal a one time passcode sent to the user’s phone as well.</p>

<h2 id="commonly-used-factors-for-mfa">Commonly used factors for MFA</h2>

<p>Beyond a password, what are other ways a user can prove who they are? As mentioned above, there are four main categories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What they know.</li>
  <li>What they have.</li>
  <li>Who they are.</li>
  <li>W…</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Covid-19 forced everyone to start thinking remote first. Companies started to replace meetings with video calls and eventually questioning if the meeting was necessary. Work went from 'why is everything a meeting?' to "just send me an email/slack message'. Over the past few months we spoke to dozens of remote companies, and we learned that while many have reduced the number of meetings, some actually changed certain meetings to adopt to new technology and ways of working. One of the changes we saw most consistency was the standup - their most frequent and hated meeting.</p><p>In this post, we will talk about:</p><ul role="list"><li>Why do synchronous and asynchronous stand ups suck.</li><li>How the purpose of the stand up will change with the predominance of remote work.</li><li>The end of the traditional standup, and the beginning of a better alternative - a Rally.</li><li>How you can make your standup more like a Rally.</li></ul><h2>Why do synchronous and asynchronous stand ups suck?</h2><p>Standups were originally designed for agile engineering teams. With the world going remote, many companies outside engineering have adopted this practice as a way to update each other on daily progress. They may not call it standups, but the essence is the same.</p><p>The problem with standups is that they are a distraction, and it feels more beneficial to management than to the team. For people working together, standups often don't deliver any new information, and for those working apart, the information is seemingly useless. Standups are also set at weird times to accommodate for everyone across all timezones. That sucks because it takes you away from your work state for a meeting that feels pointless. Finally standups are used as a way for managers to keep track of their teams. Sometimes this is effective, other times it feels intrusive.</p><p>How about asynchronous standups? Surely this is a better solution as it gives everyone flexibility and it feels less likely like management is breathing down your neck. A quick google search on asynchronous standups also reveals similar problems to the standups. People don't care about the update, the context is usually missing, and there is no conversation around blockers. Ultimately asynchronous standups don't provide much value either.</p><p>As one user on Hacker News puts it "Going async sends a message that people don't need to care about what their team members are working on. That's a dream come true for the people who just want to pull Jira tickets out of the queue, finish them in isolation, and then collect a paycheque." And another chimes in "it doesn't make for great team cohesion and knowledge sharing. Teams end up compensating with extra meetings and coordination overhead, which starts to defeat the point of async standups."</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f345c1d925d4f6201e2c2a9/60314b54800c1961716bd82f_hn%20post.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23194569</figcaption></figure><p>Is the answer then to cancel standups? Or to do some form of a hybrid async standup? Call me crazy, but what about extending the standup virtually and inviting a few more teams. Let's go back to first principles so I can explain why.</p><h2>How the purpose of the stand up will change with the predominance of remote work</h2><p>The original purpose of a stand up was to answer three questions:</p><ul role="list"><li>What was I working on yesterday?</li><li>What will I work on today?</li><li>What is blocking me or stopping me from success?</li></ul><p>The idea is to physically get off your chair, discuss the above three questions, and finish the meeting in roughly 15 mins. It is a meeting for the team, not for management.</p><p><em>Source: </em><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups"><em>https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups</em></a></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f345c1d925d4f6201e2c2a9/60314ba6f1c0b469307efa91_1_5L-pHXCmAl0GcryXyREF6A.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/@hans.bruins/the-standup-that-disrupts-the-workflow-78cb5b916bcb">https://medium.com/@hans.bruins/the-standup-that-disrupts-the-workflow-78cb5b916bcb</a></figcaption></figure><p>Standups also have an unintended benefit that is not talked about - it brings the team together. In a remote world, isolation is the number one complaint many employees have. Isolation leads to a decline in mental health, productivity, and overall well being. Isolation can also impact teams, where they feel left out from the rest of the company and are forced to have more meetings to play catch up. This is why so many people crave going back to the office. It's not for the meetings, it's for the people. Even the most introverted people have found isolation daunting.</p><p>The problem is this crucial benefit is overlooked in standups, and people start to resent this meeting. The way to solve this problem is to reframe the purpose of the meeting entirely, so much so that it may even warrant a new name, which we call a Rally.</p><h2>What is a Rally? And how will it replace the standup?</h2><p>A Rally is not a formal standup, it is a collaborative get together. Our Rallys are daily and they are 30 minutes long. The original idea came from one of our first engineering hires: Nate Wildermuth, and it's stuck ever since. We spend the first 20-25 minutes chatting, playing a game, or running an activity (see below for examples). Occasionally this leads to a great idea (such as this blog post!) or a tonne of laughs that builds some terrific momentum for the rest of the day. We then take the last 5-10 minutes discussing what we worked on, what we will work on, and any blockers we have. Usually by the time we are discussing work, we feel much more energized and ready to take on the day.</p><h3>"Standups are an endless series of trivia nights where everyone loses." Nate</h3><p>Of course, we use our own video software for these standups. This is because we designed Rally to allow multiple groups to have conversations in the same space. We call these groups 'tables', and we call the space a 'room'. It is easy to hop around to different tables to chat, or sit at a table in case someone needs to chat with you. We also have a stage where you can present to everyone in the room. This way we can let everyone know what we are working on if we needed. Luckily we're not the only ones that do this. We have a number of customers who have been using Rally for similar collaborative meetings. After speaking with them we have come up with a framework for how we think about Rallys, followed be some examples.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f345c1d925d4f6201e2c2a9/60314aba2469e82b4aa034b1_Slide%204_3%20-%201.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>How Rally Works</figcaption></figure><p>A Rally consists of:</p><ul role="list"><li>A recurring event lasting between 30 and 60 mins, few times a week.</li><li>The team running the event will invite close stakeholders. If the team is less than 50 in size, the entire company will attend.</li><li>People notifying who they want to talk to in advance so they can be efficient with their time, while managers keep an open table to allow anyone to talk to them if needed.</li><li>CEO's and senior execs are also in attendance and can choose to hop around tables to stay put and wait for questions.</li><li>Starting and/or ending with an activity or a game to get people excited.</li></ul><p>While we use Rally every day, we have customers that use Rally multiple times a week for different types of get togethers. We consider all of these to be offshoots of the daily Rally:</p><p>1. <strong>Collaboration Rally</strong>: An hour long session where each team member discusses what they are working on in their team, then hops around to other teams to eliminate blockers. The benefit of this is having everyone in one place instead of setting up extra 30 minute meetings and one on ones. To this successfully, one of our customers runs this meeting every Monday and Friday morning. Each team member prepares what they want to discuss, and reaches out to anyone they need to speak to. On average there are 3-4 cross company conversations lasting 10-20 mins each.Since this is a dedicated hour for everyone, people use this time to catch up on work and remove any blockers they have across the company. It is also a great chance to have everyone in one place. Here is an example of what that looks like:</p><figure></figure><p>2. <strong>Sprint Demo Rally</strong>: An hour long meeting where members from the engineering team hop between tables to present their work. The tables are formed of teams outside engineering so any stakeholder can keep up with engineering work. The meeting usually starts with a presentation from one of the leads to the entire room, and finishes with an activity or hangout in case people have questions.</p><figure></figure><p>3. <strong>Virtual Cafeteria Rally</strong>: An hour long daily meeting for anyone in the company to attend. The meeting is at a set time where someone opens up a Rally lunch room. Teams will jump into tables and enjoy lunch together, as they would in real life, or find friends at other tables to talk to. Instead of having multiple video calls for smaller teams, all the teams are in one place. This way they can hop around tables as they overhear interesting conversations. HR managers have also shuffled people into random tables as a way for people to meet each other.</p><figure></figure><h2>How can you change your standup into a Rally?</h2><p>Start by calling it a Rally and not a standup.</p><p>Reframe the purpose of the standup so its not purely about work but about catching up and hanging out as well.</p><p>Start the Rally with a game, activity or fun fact. Here are some options you can try out:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.rally.video/games-and-resources">Rally's Games &amp; Activity page</a></li><li><a href="https://bored.social/">Bored Social</a></li><li><a href="https://meet.airconsole.com/">Air Console</a></li></ul><p>If you are hybrid, encourage people to sign in with their own devices for this meeting so it feels like everyone is remote (on their own computers).</p><p>Consider having this meeting few times a week instead of daily</p><p>Consider not limiting this Rally to just your team, but inviting teams you collaborate with to join</p><p>You can improve your standups on any video platform. We're obviously biased because we built our own and we think it is more fun, easier to use, and gives more autonomy to each user!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="w-node-_32987516-cd92-7936-c83c-b0d3724b1a2f-82f65440"><p>What does your team’s production readiness practice look like for deploying a new service? If you or a dedicated SRE team within your engineering organization has ever green-lit a new service, you probably have used some form of a <strong>production readiness checklist</strong> to ensure certain conditions are met and processes are followed. In this article, we’ll share some helpful approaches for creating a great production readiness checklist that will set your team up for a successful launch.</p><h2>What should be on your production readiness checklist</h2><p>The ideal production readiness checklist is comprehensive, but flexible — it can and should look different based on the type of service you’re deploying and the impact of the launch. That said, there are certain categories that are essential for any checklist.</p><h3>Logging and monitoring</h3><p>Production issues can be extremely costly, so it’s important to make sure you have the right logging and monitoring in place for any new service. By preparing now, you can make sure that you have the data you need to debug failures when they (inevitably) occur — otherwise, issues might go undetected or take too long to fix.<br></p><p>Make sure your team knows exactly what is being recorded across your application and access logs — and if there’s a piece of information you might need to debug a failure, start logging it from day one. Although it might seem obvious, it’s also important to document where to <em>find </em>the logs, since the people debugging your service later on might not be the same people who wrote your logging code. Also document key information about the service, like where the git-repo lives, what language is used, what version, and when the service was deployed.<br></p><p>Before launching, make sure you’ve implemented alerts that notify your team when certain SLA thresholds are exceeded. And ensure there is appropriate tracing across other services that might interact with this one.&nbsp;</p><h3>Automated tools and processes</h3><p>You can get some of the above for free by using automated tools. Your team most likely relies on third-party software to automate your monitoring, on-call rotations, incident management, and more (if you need any tips, check out <a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/post/a-guide-to-the-best-sre-tools" target="_blank">our guide to SRE tools</a>). If this is the case, getting ready for production means making sure that everyone has access to the right tools and dashboards and knows where to find them. You should make sure your on-call rotation is set up and your teammates know how to use your playbooks for incident management. And you’ll want to make sure that a team is responsible for regularly checking that your tools are still configured and working as expected throughout the lifetime of the service.&nbsp;</p><h3>Engineering best practices</h3><p>There are some aspects of your production readiness checklist that aren’t easily automated. For example, you should make sure that whoever wrote new APIs also wrote good documentation and made sure the APIs were well-versioned. Or you will want to ensure when your team is making a call, they’re logging the status codes. And have you done load testing and capacity planning?<br></p><p>For a lower-impact service, some of these questions might default to the honor system. But most of the time, you will need to have a conversation between the engineers who developed the service and a manager or SRE to verify that certain best practices were followed.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ownership / communication</h3><p>SRE teams are more successful when they reduce tribal knowledge, and it’s important that for every new service you push into production, you have great communication from the beginning. This means identifying a clear owner — a single team or engineer who will take accountability for the service. It’s also important to document the way your team will discuss issues, like a dedicated Slack channel and a direct escalation path.</p><h2>How to organize your production readiness checklist</h2><p>Defining a production readiness process is one of the most important things you can do for the health of your products, but getting it to stick as part of your team’s culture can be hard. No one wants to feel like a nag, and yet the honor system doesn’t always work in practice. At the same time, production readiness checklists are usually unwieldy and a hassle to manage. With all those questions and answers to document, teams typically end up using Excel or Google Sheets to store their lists. But it’s hard to standardize and communicate across many different spreadsheets that are floating around. And someone has to maintain those spreadsheets and keep them up to date.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5fff18095410c63a0f88f178/6035679677fa757db96cd542_DTwczVBYP9Pv5EOm0C46JG_j376zwDYzFu7LCGDnX5DM2zmN_YGG7he8MY5lFvj5pZIUUC3cI2iu_qK2KDbH_n7VzvVYQNAXK9PthvHRYpgmLav9IC_t6A1fj9iG3gwnl89u8Ew.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Here’s a screenshot of a typical production readiness checklist in a spreadsheet format. The question marks indicate places where the team was missing information or wasn’t even sure who the owner of a service was.</figcaption></figure><p>At Cortex, we developed <strong>Scorecards </strong>to replace the production readiness spreadsheet and help your team understand the health of your services at a glance. You can set standardized requirements for each service and adjust them as needed (for example, maybe for 10% of your services, you enforce extra security vulnerability scans). We integrate with your third-party automation tools so that you get most of your scorecard filled in automatically, and we let you create and answer custom questions for everything else. If something changes out from under you— like your on-call rotation disappearing from PagerDuty — you can see it right in the Scorecard.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5fff18095410c63a0f88f178/6035679602645372bcefbba8_ZZeVzk4va38bPFhWdzGvtzgXH-N3S2JyqWpl6FFteP-O1HD3J_6v3HXZVeBr8ECX63GD19gfin6SH4UOTa8gxcI75tUf48u6T7symncvOwNa8qfAA0R1xxjg1NJpo8Zyujy7fxc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Cortex’s dashboard showing the scorecards for your services.</figcaption></figure><p>We built Scorecards because we wanted to make production readiness more objective and clear, and as engineers ourselves who have worked with countless third party tools, we know how important it is to create a single source of truth that your whole team can refer to.&nbsp;Scorecards help create a culture of ownership and reliability among service owners within the team!<br></p><p>The details of your production readiness checklist are important, but the details don’t matter if the overall process is broken. We encourage you to take a step back and think about how you can bring a culture of blameless communication to your production readiness practice.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a theory about the <em>future of programming</em>. I doubt I’m the first to have it, but as far as I can tell this isn’t the mainstream thought in the area, and I want to see if this connects for other folks.</p><p>There’s this idea about having ‘one way to do things’, that I think is most famous in its phrasing from the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a></p><blockquote><p>There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.</p></blockquote><p>Perl has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">opposite motto: There’s more than one way to do it</a>. Whether it’s better to have “one way to do things”, as I’d guess is the dictum of Python and Go, or many ways, like Rust, JavaScript, Lisps, etc, it’s sort of undecided.</p><p>But let’s flip the telescope around and peer into the other end.</p><hr><p>Programming is about data structures and the ways you manipulate them. There are few languages that can claim to have <em>one way to store things</em>.</p><p>I claim that most <em>simple</em> programming environments are simple because their datatypes are simple, not because their control flow or statements or expressions are simple. Let’s take a look:</p><p>Excel spreadsheets support sheets, columns, rows, and cells. That’s it. Until very recently (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/10/29/connect-to-your-own-data-with-more-new-data-types-in-excel/">2020</a>), cells were extremely limited in what they could represent, and even with fancy new cells, those types are curated. Excel formulas work, and compose so well, because a column of numbers is generally the same in any kind of document.</p><p>Successful visual programming thrives in constrained environments in which data is mostly homogenous. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data#Language_features">Pure data</a> has four simple kinds of ‘atoms’. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_%28software%29">Max/MSP</a> has a few more, but still limited and non-extensible.</p><p>What has made R and Python such successful platforms for data science isn’t just TensorFlow and ggplot, but the thing that connects the parts of the data science toolkit together: dataframes. The Python ecosystem is far from perfect, but the fact that there are complex datatypes that can handle a wide variety of research data inputs &amp; outputs, and that can be used by multiple packages - that pandas can talk to <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/relational.html#relating-variables-with-scatter-plots">seaborn</a> to quickly generate a chart - is remarkable.</p><p>In comparison, there are lots of systems in which the common data types are so low-level and people are so hesitant to accept shared definitions that every “computation” problem meets an equal or greater “representation” problem.</p><ul><li>Going to parse a webpage? Is the webpage a DOM? A plain-old nested object? Somewhere in between, like a <a href="https://cheerio.js.org/">cheerio</a> or jQuery wrapper?</li><li>Going to manipulate a color? Is it a RGB triplet in an array, or an object? Or is it an instance of a <a href="https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/">class in a helper module</a>, or a hex string?</li></ul><p>There’s so much energy put into visual programming or functional programming so that we can “connect things,” but not nearly as much time spent on <em>what those things are</em>. So what you get is the ability to connect any “compatible” parts, but a poor definition of what compatibility is, what those types are.</p><p>What if a simpler programming language had first-class representations of a lot more than strings and arrays? Of course this would rankle seasoned developers who want ultimate power and prefer tiny extensible systems. When developers think of advanced type systems, they think of things like <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Type">Haskell’s scary-powerful</a> primitives for creating new types, not of ecosystem-supported common types.</p><p>But if the aim is ease of use and giving power to people who otherwise wouldn’t be doing programming, type-rich systems with lots of assumptions seem like a logical first step. And one that doesn’t need a visual editor or a new dialect of a rare programming language.</p></div></div>]]>

      <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Last weekend, as I was casually browsing the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive">CS:GO subreddit</a> for any news related to the game, I found myself in a staring contest with a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/lorda5/a_csgo_math_question_appear_in_a_practice_math/go7e3z3">math problem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question: A player is holding a Desert Eagle and facing an enemy. Each shot he fires has 50% chance of hitting the enemy. If the shot is accurate, there’s also a 20% chance of headshot which will kill the target immediately, otherwise, it requires 3 shots to take down the enemy. What’s the probability of the player to take down the enemy in 7 shots?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Interesting,” I thought to myself, trying to jog my memory of probability theory. But soon, it dawned on me that perhaps the mathematical solution won’t come very easily. And soon after that, it became a matter of pride to be able to solve the problem through some means. So I turned to what I’m more familiar with these days: coding.</p>

<h2 id="monte-carlo-method">Monte Carlo method</h2>
<p>One nice thing about probability problems is that even if you don’t know the exact answer, you can always approximate it by running experiments. This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo method</a>.</p>

<p>I opened up a text editor, and quickly translated the problem to JavaScript (mostly because it is the easiest to work with, as I can run JavaScript directly in my browser’s developer console):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// runs one round of simulation: true if dead in 7 shots</span>
<span>function</span> <span>sim</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>body</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>7</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>0.2</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
      <span>else</span> <span>body</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>body</span> <span>==</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// runs many simulations and keeps tally</span>
<span>function</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>total</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>dead</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>total</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>sim</span><span>())</span> <span>dead</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>dead</span> <span>*</span> <span>1.0</span> <span>/</span> <span>total</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>run</span><span>(</span><span>10000000</span><span>);</span> <span>// returns 0.8434493</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not bad for a few minutes of coding. Elated, I went to look for an answer that’s close to 84.34% and found… none?</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://i.redd.it/40vudn7h4si61.jpg">
<figcaption>The original question (in Vietnamese) did not have the correct answer</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But false alarm. Based on the comments in the Reddit post, the consensus is that the provided answer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/lorda5/a_csgo_math_question_appear_in_a_practice_math/go8a3ok/">missed a case</a>, and that 84.34% is the right answer. Phew.</p>

<h2 id="exact-solution">Exact solution</h2>
<p>Several other people also coded Monte Carlo simulations, and it was interesting to compare our algorithms. What really caught my eyes though, was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/lorda5/a_csgo_math_question_appear_in_a_practice_math/go7rlr2">this solution</a>, which instead uses recursion to find the exact probability (slightly edited for readability):</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>shots</span><span>,</span> <span>hp</span><span>):</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>hp</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>elif</span> <span>shots</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>
  <span># 10% headshot, 40% body shot, 50% miss
</span>  <span>return</span> <span>0.1</span> <span>*</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>shots</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> \
         <span>0.4</span> <span>*</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>shots</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>hp</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> \
         <span>0.5</span> <span>*</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>shots</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>hp</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>(</span><span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span> <span># returns 0.8434375
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s quite brilliant. The base cases are when <code>hp</code> or <code>shots</code> is 0; otherwise, the logic recursively progresses toward one of the base cases.</p>

<p>The mathematical solution turns out to be simple too. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/lorda5/a_csgo_math_question_appear_in_a_practice_math/go8uvk2">Here’s one approach</a> that calculates the probability of surviving, then subtracts it from 1 to arrive at the answer:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>P(dies) = 1 - P(survives)
P(survives) = P(no hits) + P(1 hit, no headshots) + P(2 hits, no headshots)
P(no hits) = 0.5^7 ~ 0.78%
P(1 hit, no headshots) = 7C1 * 0.5^7 * 0.8 ~ 4.38%
P(2 hits, no headshots) = 7C2 * 0.5^7 * 0.8^2 ~ 10.5%
So P(dies) ~ 84.34%
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Learning fundamental concepts such as math and probability theory is obvious important. However, using code, sometimes it’s good enough to let computer do most of the hard work.</p>

<p>This blog post represents months of work and over 400+ hours of actual
benchmarking where we compared
<a href="https://vectorized.io/redpanda">Redpanda</a>
and the latest 2.7 Kafka Release. We used the recommended production
setup and environment from Confluent’s
<a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/openmessaging-benchmark" target="_self" rel="nofollow">fork</a>
of the CNCF open messaging benchmark.</p>
<p>Before we get started, the entirety of the actual results with the full
workload distribution, saturation, latency and throughput are at the bottom
of this interactive <a href="https://vectorized.io/blog/fast-and-safe/#The-full-test-suite-below">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://vectorized.io/blog/intelligent-data-api/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Kafka API</a>
has emerged as the lingua franca for streaming workloads. Developers
love the ecosystem and being able to turn sophisticated products
overnight. Just like Apache and Nginx have their own HTTP
implementations, gccgo and the Go compiler specify parsers for the
language, MySQL and Postgres implement SQL, Redpanda and Kafka implement
the Kafka API. Redpanda aims to bring operational simplicity to the
existing overwhelming complexity of standing up state-of-the-art
streaming systems. This manifests at its lowest level in no longer
having to choose between data safety and performance.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear, the reason tail latency matters in the world of big data
is because Redpanda does not exist in isolation. It often sits between
your web servers, databases, internal microservices, data lakes, etc.
Redpanda controls the information flow of how, when and where things are
stored, transferred, accessed, mutated and eventually delivered. The
reason we obsess over tail latency is because the p99.99 in a messaging
system happens often - it’s a simple function of the messages exchanged.
As the volume of interactions and messages between systems using the
Kafka API increases, so does the probability that a single user
operation or API call is affected by latencies <strong>above</strong> the 99.99th
percentile.</p>
<p>The Kafka API is good, below, we showcase how we made it fast.</p>

<p>We present 18 workloads below. All workloads for both systems replicate
the data to 3 nodes in total with no lag (manually verified in the
quorum system). The only difference is that Apache Kafka was run with
in-memory replication (using the page-cache) and flushing after every
message. Redpanda can only be operated in safe mode (flushing after
every batch) with acks=all. The benchmarks below are the same benchmarks
<a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-fastest-messaging-system/" target="_self" rel="nofollow"><u>Alok Nikhil &amp; Vinoth Chandar from
Confluent</u></a>
performed while comparing Pulsar and Kafka with a 1.2GB/s extension,
using the same CNCF Open Messaging Benchmark suite.</p>
<p>First, we note that we were only able to reproduce Confluent’s first 6
results. For the other three workloads, the data shows that it is in
fact impossible to achieve sustained network throughput above 300MB/s on
AWS on i3en.2xlarge instances. Please see our Benchmark Appendix section
at the end for a detailed explanation. We also change the default 1
minute warmup time to 30 minutes to account for <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2016-09-28/java-warmup.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow"><u>common
pitfalls</u></a>
in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00602" target="_self" rel="nofollow"><u>Virtual Machine</u></a>
benchmarking practices and focus entirely on steady state performance.
We then ran each workload for 60 additional minutes, recorded the
results and repeated the steps, taking the best run of each system. That
is, each time we ran the benchmarks it took over 54 hours to finish.</p>
<p>For all workloads, we used two m5n.8xlarge for the clients, with
32-cores and with 25Gbps of guaranteed networking throughput
and 128GB of memory to ensure the bottleneck would be on the server
side. The benchmark used three i3en.6xlarge 24-core instances with
192GB of memory, 25Gbps guaranteed networking and two NVMe SSD devices.</p>
<p>We note that after spending several hundreds of hours benchmarks, we had
to scale up Confluent’s Kafka settings to keep up with larger instances
to num.replica.fetchers=16, message.max.bytes=10485760,
replica.fetch.max.bytes=10485760, num.network.threads=16,
num.io.threads=16, log.flush.interval.messages=1. Otherwise, the gap
between Redpanda and Kafka would be much larger. This had the
unfortunate effect that for lower percentiles, Kafka’s latency was a
little higher than using half as many threads as specified by
Confluent’s Github repo.</p>
<p>All the latencies below are the end-to-end p99.999 latency with 16
producers and 16 consumers with 100 partitions on a single topic. Every
message represents 1KB of data. We note that by and large Kafka is able
to keep up on throughput except for a couple of workloads with acks=all
where Redpanda is better. The meaningful differences are in latency: how
fast can each system go.</p>

<p><small> Workload (5) is a bug on our write-behind strategy: <a href="https://github.com/vectorizedio/redpanda/issues/542" target="_self" rel="nofollow">issue #542</a> </small></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>We’ve said this ad nauseam: <a href="https://vectorized.io/blog/redpanda-raison-detre/" target="_self" rel="nofollow"><u>hardware is the
platform</u></a></strong>.
Modern hardware is capable of giving you both low latency and no data
loss (fsync). Let’s talk about most of the meaningful low-level
architectural differences that get us there</p>

<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/171856194738a05a78e745396ee0c493/1250k-rate-100-partitions-1kb-4-producers-e2e-latency-quantile.svg" alt="1.2GB/s">
Before we dive deep into details, we encourage you to sign up for our
live Twitch Stream where we’ll be going through every single claim made
in this article, and are happy to answer your questions live. It will be
me, emacs, you and questions. Perfect.</p>
<p>When we started building Redpanda, the main driving factor was
<strong>understandability</strong>. Above performance, we wanted a simple mental
model of what it meant to have 2 out of 3 replicas up and running, which
is how we ended with Raft - a protocol with a mathematical proof of
correctness &amp; log completeness and a focus on usability as part of its
design goals.</p>
<p>However, once you get your replication model set, the rest of the life
of the product is spent on predictability, and for big-data &amp; real time
systems, that means understandable, flat tail latencies. It is not
enough to be fast. It is not enough to be safe. When trying to handle
hundreds of terabytes per day of streaming you need to be predictable
not only in the way the product breaks in case of network partitions,
bad disks, etc, but also in how performance degrades as a function of
hardware saturation. This is at the core of operational simplicity for
streaming systems.</p>
<p>Modern hardware allows us to finally have nice things. It is not the
case anymore that you have to choose between safety (no data loss) and
speed (low latency). Furthermore, this predictability affords you
accurate planning for product launches. As a user, I understand how to
buy hardware. I will perform an `fio` test and have a decent
understanding of what that specific hardware can do. Redpanda lets you
take these hardware saturation numbers and gives you a reasonable chance
of predicting how costly it is to develop a new product.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let me count the ways:</p>
<h2 id="0-No-page-cache">0) No page cache<a href="#0-No-page-cache" aria-label="0 No page cache permalink"></a></h2>
<p>The page cache is an object in the Linux Kernel. It is maintained per
file with global locking semantics. It is a tried and true, generic
scheduling mechanism with heuristics from a variety of production use
cases that push and pull the design to a really good middle ground. It
aims to never be a bad choice if you need to do IO. However, for our
specific use case - a log - we can do much better. We understand
exactly, all the way to the user application, how much data is going to
be needed next, the access patterns which mostly move forward, update
frequency, background operations and cache prioritization.</p>
<p>For us, the page cache introduces latency and nondeterministic IO
behavior. For example, when loading data for a Kafka fetch request the
Linux Kernel will trigger general-purpose read-ahead heuristics, and
cache the bytes it read, take a global lock, and update indexes.
Redpanda does not do general IO. It is a log, append only, with well
understood access patterns. We add data to the end file and have
aggressive write-behind strategies. When we read data, Redpanda reads in
order, which means we can in theory have perfect read-ahead and object
materialization that sits above the byte array style API of the page
cache, etc.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, bypassing the Kernel’s page cache allows us to be
predictable, with respect to both failure semantics and tail latency. We
can detect and measure the rate and latency of IO and adjust our buffer
pools accordingly. We can react to low memory pressure situations and
have a holistic view of our memory footprint. We have predictability
over each filesystem operation that can actually affect correctness - as
recently evidenced by the PostgreSQL team with an fsync() bug that was
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VWIGBQLtxo" target="_self" rel="nofollow">undetected for 20 years</a>.</p>

        <p>With the emergence of Bitcoin and recently proposed stablecoins from BigTechs, such as Diem (formerly Libra), central banks face growing competition from private actors offering their own digital alternative to physical cash. We do not address the normative question whether a central bank should issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not. Instead, we contribute to the current research debate by showing how a central bank could do so, if desired. We propose a token-based system without distributed ledger technology and show how earlier-deployed, software-only electronic cash can be improved upon to preserve transaction privacy, meet regulatory requirements in a compelling way, and offer a level of quantum-resistant protection against systemic privacy risk. Neither monetary policy nor financial stability would be materially affected because a CBDC with this design would replicate physical cash rather than bank deposits.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h3>"Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it."</h3></p><div><section>    
<p>
      Planning for retirement often feels pointless. You’re young and your startup is taking off — why should you worry about retirement now?
    </p>
    <p>There are two concepts that make this planning a no-brainer:</p>
    <p><b>1. Compounding</b></p>
    <p>Interest on interest unlocks exponential growth. If you earn 5% annual interest on a $10,000 deposit, you’ll have $10,500 after the first year. In the second year, you’ll earn interest on the initial deposit plus interest on the interest you earned. And so on. Over 50 years, a 5% compounded interest rate will grow your $10,000 deposit to over $110,000. The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow.</p>
 <p><b>2. Tax-advantaged accounts</b></p>
    <p>The government provides opportunities to invest tax-free in the stock market through retirement accounts. While beating the stock market is hard, maximizing your contribution to tax-advantaged investment accounts provides an instant increase to your future returns.</p>
    <p>Compounding, tax-free returns generate long-term wealth. Combining these tools with a broader asset allocation strategy will help you manage uncertainty (e.g., handling a global pandemic) and achieve your financial goals. This guide explains how to make the most of these tools. We’ll cover the different types of retirement accounts and how to strategically optimize your contributions.</p>

   
</section></div></div><div><h3>Retirement Account Types<br></h3><div><section>
    <p>
		All retirement accounts — 401(k)s and IRAs — share some basic characteristics:
    </p>
    <p><b>1. Tax advantages</b></p>
  	<p>Both you and your employer can save on taxes with these accounts.</p>
    <p><b>2. Contribution limits</b></p>
    <p>Without contribution limits, these retirement accounts could easily be repurposed as huge tax shelters for the ultra-wealthy.</p>
    <p><b>3. Restrictions on withdrawals before age 59 ½</b></p>
    <p>Without an age restriction, these accounts would be no different from normal taxable accounts apart from their tax advantages, and they wouldn't encourage long-term saving.</p>
    <p>We'll go over the specific details of each of these characteristics as they relate to each account type below.</p>

</section></div><h4>401(k) Plans</h4><div><section>
  <p>401(k) plans are the most common type of retirement plan offered by employers. Under a 401(k), you tell your employer to redirect a certain amount from your paycheck to your 401(k) account instead.</p>
	<p>There are two types of 401(k)s, Roth and Traditional:</p>
</section></div><div><section>

    <p>
Your company may offer 401(k) matching. For instance, if you elect to contribute $2,000 from your paycheck to your 401(k), your employer might put $2,000 in too so the ending balance on your account after the pay period would be 
 <span>$4,000 higher<label for="sn-4khr"></label></span>
        
        <span>Usually, your employer will say something like "we'll match 6% of your paycheck." If you make $100,000 a year, that means if you contribute $6,000, your employer will also contribute $6,000. Your employer won't contribute any more than that, but you're free to contribute more from your own paycheck for greater personal tax savings.</span>
. You should always take advantage of the full match — it's free money!
</p>
<p>
You can invest the money in your 401(k) account from the selection of products (e.g., mutual funds) offered by your company's 401(k) plan administrator, typically a firm such as Fidelity or Vanguard. These products might be less appealing than what you'd get elsewhere, but it's all up to the plan administrator and generally not something you can control. It's also important to keep in mind that returns might be lower on these products due to administrative fees — which is one benefit of a separate individual retirement account (IRA).
</p>
<p>
When you leave your job, you can take your 401(k) with you. You can either move the funds into your new employer's 401(k), or move the funds into an individual retirement account (IRA). Generally, moving the funds into an IRA is a better decision (explained below).</p>   
</section></div><h4>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)</h4><div><section>

    <p>
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) offer tax advantages like a 401(k), but don't need to be sponsored by an employer. Like a 401(k), they can be classified as either
<span>Roth<label for="sn-rothn"></label></span>
        
        <span>So-named because they were established by legislation championed by former Senator William Roth of Delaware.</span>
 or traditional.</p>
</section></div><div><section>
        <p>
        Note that unlike a 401(k), whose contribution limits reset every calendar year, the length of a "year" for contribution limit purposes for IRAs is actually fifteen months. You can make IRA contributions for a given tax year until the tax filing deadline for the year. That means that between January 1 and April 15 of the following year (tax day), you can contribute to your IRA for either the current year or the previous year.
        </p>
        <p>
        Also, you can only contribute to an IRA if you have employment income. If your total income this year was $1,000 from freelancing and $100,000 from investments, you'd only be able to contribute $1,000 to your IRAs.
        </p>
				<p>
You can invest the money in your IRA account in the investment options (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) offered by the provider of your IRA. This will often be a better selection of options than what you'd get through your 401(k).        </p>
</section></div><h4>Self-Directed IRAs (SDIRAs)</h4><div><section>
        <p>
A self-directed IRA (SDIRA) is not a separate IRA type per se, since an SDIRA can be either Roth or traditional.        </p>
        <p>
SDIRAs are offered by specialized firms. You would open one if you wanted to invest in assets other than the basic stock and bond products offered by a regular IRA provider like Fidelity or Vanguard. Depending on which firm you work with, they might support alternative investments like real estate, cryptocurrency, and startup equity. An SDIRA allows you to hold these assets in a tax-advantaged way, in the same way a regular IRA allows you to hold stocks and bonds in a tax-advantaged way.        </p>
				<p>
For example, let's say you open a self-directed Roth IRA and fund it with $6,000. Then, you invest that money in a real estate partnership. Next, the partnership buys a fourplex in Los Angeles and rents it out to four tenants. Any rental income you receive from that property will accrue in the account and you won't have to pay taxes on it, and if the property appreciates and you sell it, you won't have to pay capital gains taxes either — since growth in a Roth IRA is tax-free.
</p>
<p>
On the equity side, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin allegedly has almost $100 million of tax-free gains in his self-directed Roth IRA from the appreciation of his startup stock.
</p>
<p>
SDIRAs are less common than their regular IRA counterparts at Vanguard or Fidelity, but for people with long time horizons to retirement, the alternative investments they allow can help provide better returns (alpha). We'll talk more about this below under "Diversification".</p>
</section></div><h3>Playbook</h3><div><section>
<p>
Despite the complexity of all these different plan and account types, for most people, planning for retirement is pretty simple.
</p>

<p>
To start, you'll need to decide how to allocate your savings between the different plans — how much to contribute to your 401(k), and if you are able to or should contribute to your IRAs. Then — depending on your plan's offerings and what your income allows — you'll need to decide the type of account: 
				<span>Roth<label for="sn-rothp"></label></span>
        
        <span>
        The Roth 401(k) is a relatively new invention, so your employer's 401(k) administrator may not offer it. If that's the case, you're stuck with the traditional option. Also, unlike a Roth IRA, a Roth 401(k) has no income limits — you can contribute to a Roth 401(k) no matter how much money you make.
        </span>
 or traditional. Consider:</p>
 <ol type="1">
      
      <li>
      <b>401(k) matching: </b>
      Does your company offer a 401(k) plan and do they match your contributions? If yes, take advantage of the full match first. The immediate 100% return you get on the matched funds is better than almost anything else you'd get in the markets.
      </li>
      
      <li>
      <b>Tax bracket: </b>
			Do you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket now or when you retire? If you think you're going to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, deferring taxes now through a traditional 401(k) or IRA makes more sense so you pay taxes in that lower retirement bracket when you withdraw. If you're very early in your career and think you're going to be in a higher tax bracket by the time you retire, Roth versions of those accounts make more sense, so you avoid taxes in that higher retirement bracket when you withdraw.      </li>
</ol>
<p>
Most people in tech are highly compensated (i.e. their retirement tax bracket will likely be lower than their current tax bracket — a good rule of thumb is whether you make 
<span>over ~$160,000<label for="sn-160k"></label></span>
        
        <span>
Here's an example. Let's say you plan to live on $100,000 a year in retirement (a relatively cushy amount). In 2021, that would put you in the 24% bracket. If you make over $164,926 (the cutoff for the next bracket, 32%), you should defer your taxes to retirement.        </span>

) and work for companies with generous 401(k) matching. If that sounds like you, your playbook looks something like this (the order is important for maximum tax savings):
</p>
 <ol type="1">
      
      <li>
      <b>Opt for a traditional 401(k): </b>
			Deferring taxes until retirement makes sense since you're currently in a high tax bracket.
      </li>
      
      <li>
      <b>Maximize your match: </b>
			Contribute as much as you can to your 401(k) to take full advantage of your employer match. Ideally, the maximum of your employer match should be the minimum that you set aside for retirement — otherwise, you're leaving money on the table.
			</li>
      <li>
      <b>Continue contributing to your 401(k): </b>
If you can afford to save even more for retirement, keep contributing to your 401(k) until you hit the $19,500 limit to get the maximum tax deduction.
</li>

<li>
      <b>Contribute to a backdoor Roth (advanced): </b>
Contributing to a traditional IRA doesn't make sense if you've already contributed to a 401(k) since there's no extra tax deduction, so if you can afford to save more than $19,500, contribute up to …</li></ol></section></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There are two worlds - the one in our head and the one that is real. It’s easy to conflate the two; perception is reality, the saying goes. But they are separate. Perception is just a representation of reality and as we know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation">the map is not the territory</a>.</p>

<p>We use thought space to model reality. It serves us well for simple activities, enabling us to successfully predict the consequences of our actions (e.g driving through a yellow light). For more involved tasks, however, we overestimate the fidelity of our model. As a result, operating excessively in thought space impedes us from creating the desired outcomes in the real world.</p>

<p>Here’s a recent example. When I reviewed the draft of my <a href="https://suketk.com/feeds-considered-harmful">first essay</a>, I was preoccupied with this question: will anyone find this useful? I pored over it, top to bottom. On the first pass, it was elementary. On the next, it was profound. On another, it was too abstract. As I dizzily vacillated between opinions, a realization struck - the essay itself hadn’t changed. Only my impression did. In fact, the quality of the essay was impervious to my perception. It would remain as good (or bad) as it was, regardless of my impression. I was pursuing the wrong goal. An “accurate” opinion was just a means to an end - to determine whether others would find it useful. So, rather than continue theorizing, I decided to publish it to uncover the answer directly.</p>

<p>Prolonged time in thought space doesn’t just slow us down. It leads us astray and delays course correction, through misplaced confidence in our judgement. Ever dreaded a conversation, building it up in your head, only to realize it was nothing to worry about? Left unchecked, our perception steadily drifts away from reality. To keep them in sync, we must regularly validate our hypothesis in the real world. If we don’t, our future actions are built on a shaky foundation of invalid assumptions. Consequently, we waste valuable energy on outcomes that don’t manifest in the way we intend. Consider how many successful founders had to pivot from their first idea. Would their companies be alive if they spent years perfecting the original idea in isolation? No. This is the exact danger of perfectionism (perfectionitis?) - the misallocation of resources towards success defined by a model that isn’t representative of reality.</p>

<p>Thought space alone does not move us forward. Reading a book on productivity doesn’t make you more effective. Listening to a startup podcast doesn’t make you a better entrepreneur. Watching a cooking video doesn’t make you a better chef. Action is the interface between thought space and the real world - we actualize our ideas by doing. Knowledge is merely potential energy. Only when applied, does it translate to growth. If not, it just creates an illusion of progress. (This exemplifies the explore/exploit framework discussed in this <a href="https://suketk.com/feeds-considered-harmful">previous essay</a>.)</p>

<p>Next time you’re doing anything, ask yourself this question: am I operating in thought space or reality? This awareness helps you identify your untested assumptions and induces a general bias towards action. By tightening the feedback loop, you empower yourself to simultaneously build a better map and conquer the territory.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The ‘national debt’ has been a fixture of news and politics, probably since the founding of America. Although the national debt continues to swell–at $27 trillion or so as of writing this–my opinion has not changed, that being the national debt is a meaningless number, much like a mathematical abstraction, that has no  bearing on one’s life or investment strategies.  Articles about the <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2019/11/02/us-national-debt-passed-23-trillion-jumped-1-3-trillion-in-12-months/">size</a> of the national debt have gone viral on Hacker News and Reddit , as well as headlines about how approximately <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/mishtalk/economics/23-6-of-all-us-dollars-were-created-in-the-last-year">“a quarter all US Dollars were created in past year”</a>. This surge in spending is in large part due to due to Covid stimulus and relief, as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/US-Gross-National-Debt-2011-2019-11-02.png"></p>
<p>Why am I not concerned? For one, deficit hawks have a terrible track record. Doomsayers like Peter Schiff and Karl Denninger have been predicting hyperinflation, dollar collapse, recession, crisis, etc. for decades, to no avail. This does not mean that they cannot, in theory, one day be right, but I think the odds of that happening are sufficiently low to not pay them any mind. </p>
<p>So why is the debt an abstraction, as opposed to a tangible, real concern. Aren’t these big numbers? Yes, they are big, but what must be taken into account are a couple factors: about 40% of the national debt is owed to itself, either held by the fed or government institutions (such as for Social Security and Medicare), whereas the other 60% are held by foreign governments and private individuals and firms. So this effectively reduces the burden by almost half.</p>
<p><img src="https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2018/08/21/Photos/ZQ/MW-GO672_nation_20180821130954_ZQ.jpg?uuid=05b585b6-a565-11e8-b6ab-ac162d7bc1f7"></p>
<p>Second, what matters is not so much the absolute size of the debt but rather the interest paid on the debt relative to GDP, which is very low. The US economy is growing fast enough that the deficit , even if it keeps growing, the interest paid keeps shrinking relative to the size of the economy. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/debt-interest-payments-percent-gdp-600x434.png"></p>
<p>The US economy is growing at 3+%/year (which may not seem like much but it beats Europe, Japan, South America and much of the developed and developing  world on a real basis), but the US government can borrow at close to nothing, so this is effectively free growth.</p>
<p>Second, the properties or characteristics of the national debt are so distinct from a personal, household, or business debt that there is practically no comparison between the two, further making it an abstraction and divorcing it from any reality that we are familiar with. Imagine being able to borrow at close to nothing, and then being able to print money to pay the interest on the debt if necessary, and such printing does not cause wealth destruction or much inflation in the process, as the US dollar is the official ‘global unit’ of wealth (the Forbes 400 list, for example, is denominated in dollars, not Pounds, Yen, or Euro). So even if the treasury were to print enough dollars to cause price levels to rise meaningfully, because everything is still indexed in dollars, Americans do not lose wealth in the process unless the US dollar falls relative to foreign currencies and there is not a sufficiently high corresponding increase of wealth from wages, stocks, real estate, etc. to offset this, but it is not like Americans particularly care how their wealth is growing or shrinking relative to the Brits, the Germans, or the Japanese. </p>
<p>However, when emerging markets governments print money, it causes their currencies to fall relative to benchmarks like the US dollar, which cases wealth destruction and makes the debt harder to service. By compassion, households and individuals pay vastly higher interest rates and cannot issue their own currency. This is obvious, but is a key distinction and why the US national debt should not be thought of in the same way as a regular debt. It really is something else entirely and more of a function or benchmark of the strength and might of the US global economic and cultural hegemony, than a ‘ticking time bomb’ as many in the media falsely liken it to.</p>
<p>But what about all the Covid spending, in particular, the increase of the M1 money supply? Won’t this cause inflation and other problems? But the spending already happened, and the bond market is unfazed. In fact, the bond market has held up in spite of trillions of dollars of Covid spending (and much more to come), showing that bond vigilantes are not concerned. Why is this? Because this money is not really doing anything. It is not inducing meaningful economic activity and business investment, but rather a large chunk of Covid aid is being saved or used to pay down existing debts. Only <a href="https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2020/article/covid-19-stimulus-checks-spurred-saving-and-debt-payment-more-spending">40%</a> of Covid stimulus was spent on consumer goods, which was the intent. Hence it’s actually deflationary, because the US govt. is borrowing at near 0% so consumers can pay down their own double-digit debts, so the end result is much less indebtedness. Second, the amount of additional consumer spending and activity attributable to the stimulus checks is small relative to the size of overall US consumer spending. US consumers spent $15 trillion in 2020 but Covid stimulus adds just $1 trillion to that, assuming all the money is spent, which it is not.  </p>
<p><img src="https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/0100B2LV20C/personal-consumption.png"></p>
<p>Overall, I am not concerned about the national debt. [Emerging market debt, however, is a different beast altogether, and is a much bigger concern for those economics, than the national debt is a concern for the US economy] The national debt should not factor into the decision making processes of investors. Even bond holders should not be concerned.  In spite of the national debt surging over the past quarter-century, US stocks have posted strong inflation-adjusted returns, especially  since 2010. Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds have done well too. Anyone who sold their stocks over fears of the national debt, missed out on what has possibly been the biggest bull market in stocks on an inflation-adjusted basis, ever. The debt will never ‘come due’ in the way that rent or credit card bills have a strict deadlines; but will keep being rolled over forever. The media, pundits, talking heads, etc.  will continue to sound the alarm over the debt, but investors, hedge funds, pensions, institutions–people who actually matter and who have skin in the game–will continue to pay no mind to these warnings. </p>

                    <p>Most technology is designed to make your life, or your work, easier. If your work involves building computer vision into your applications, using the <a href="https://roboflow.com/">Roboflow</a> platform gives you everything you need.</p><p><a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> is an open-source platform that enables you to convert your Python scripts to apps and deploy them instantly. Streamlit and Roboflow can work hand-in-hand, allowing you to tackle computer vision problems and visualizing your output so you can make better decisions faster.</p><p>In this post, we’ll walk you through using Roboflow and Streamlit together by showing you how to:</p><ol><li>Fit an object detection model in Roboflow</li><li>Use an API to access the model and its predictions</li><li>Create and deploy a Streamlit app</li></ol><p>Specifically, we’ll be working with a common <a href="https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/bccd">blood cell count and detection dataset</a>. If you want to skip right to playing with it, <a href="https://roboflow.com/streamlit-bccd">here's an interactive app</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matthewbrems/streamlit-bccd">this is the code</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/1-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/1-1.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/1-1.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/1-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.</figcaption></figure><p>We’ll build an object detection model that detects platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells. Then, the app we develop together will allow you to make predictions with your object detection model, visualize those predictions at a given confidence level, and edit those predictions based on your preferred confidence level with immediate visual feedback.</p><h3 id="how-to-fit-an-object-detection-model-in-roboflow">How to fit an object detection model in Roboflow</h3><p>Have you fit an object detection model before?</p><p>Even if you haven't, Roboflow helps you work through all aspects of computer vision, from uploading, annotating, and organizing your images to training and deploying a computer vision model.</p><p>We believe you shouldn’t have to be a data scientist or need an extensive coding background to be able to use computer vision. You have everything you need right now.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Di4bkgiihzqyb4k47H3Ku0GX_amNEgd03y3QFqOzSzLp-Y08ONhYHOKH6a8C_GSEtmUPboTbIWO58gYZ0fW_ceDetVlTinWmh4UC9C3E2PAggPnh3PDW9lrWwLlzyfeXvYN63c1L" alt=""><figcaption>The computer vision workflow.</figcaption></figure><p><br>If you don’t already have a Roboflow account, you’ll need to <a href="https://app.roboflow.com/">head over to Roboflow and create one</a>. If you’d like to start training your model from a public dataset, Roboflow has a <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/using-public-datasets/">great tutorial that describes</a> how to improve your model more quickly. (Or, you can <a href="https://docs.roboflow.com/adding-data/upload-api">upload your own dataset</a>!)</p><p>Once you have an account, go to our <a href="https://public.roboflow.com/">computer vision datasets</a> page. We’ve made over 30 datasets of different types public and keep adding more.</p><p>The one we’ll walk through today is a blood cell count and detection dataset.</p><p>After you’ve decided which dataset to use, go ahead and fork it. That will create a copy of the dataset that you can now use.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/streamlit_fork_dataset_recording--2-.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Forking a <a href="http://public.roboflow.com/">public dataset</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, you can directly fit a model. However, we recommend that you preprocess and augment your images.</p><ul><li><strong>Image preprocessing.</strong> Deterministic steps performed to all images prior to feeding them into the model. For example, you might <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/you-might-be-resizing-your-images-incorrectly/">resize your images</a> so they are all the same size, or <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/when-to-use-grayscale-as-a-preprocessing-step/">convert your images to grayscale</a>.</li><li><strong>Image augmentation.</strong> Creating more training examples by distorting your input images so your model doesn't overfit on specific training examples. For example, you may <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/how-flip-augmentation-improves-model-performance/">flip</a>, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/why-and-how-to-implement-random-rotate-data-augmentation/">rotate</a>, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/using-blur-in-computer-vision-preprocessing/">blur</a>, or <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/why-to-add-noise-to-images-for-machine-learning/">add noise to your images</a>. The goal is to get your model to generalize better to “the real world” when you deploy your model.</li></ul><p>With the blood cell count dataset I’m using, I chose the following preprocessing and augmentation options:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/2-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/2-1.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/2-1.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/2-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://docs.roboflow.com/image-transformations/image-preprocessing">Image preprocessing</a> and <a href="https://docs.roboflow.com/image-transformations/image-augmentation">image augmentation</a> techniques.</figcaption></figure><p>When deciding whether to use a specific augmentation option, I asked myself the question “Is the augmented image a reasonable image for my model to see?” In this case, I added 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations to my image because the slide of cells could reasonably be rotated 90 degrees and still make sense.</p><p>It wouldn't make sense for all applications. For instance, I might not include that kind of rotation for a self-driving car, because stop signs should be seen with the pole jutting into the ground. To rotate the image 180 degrees would make the stop sign upside down and the ground where the sky should be -- that probably isn’t a very useful thing for my model to learn.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/3-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/3-1.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/3-1.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/3-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/train-test-split/">Training, validation, and testing splits</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>I have my data split up so that 70% of my data is in the training set, 20% is in the validation set, and 10% is in the test set. As you may know, splitting your data into <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/train-test-split/">training, validation, and testing sets</a> can really help avoid overfitting.</p><p>I’ve decided to create three augmentations. This means that, for each <em>training</em> image, we’ll create three copies of that image, each with random augmentation techniques applied to it. This will give me a total of 874 images that are generated:</p><ul><li>765 augmented training images (765 = 255 * 3) </li><li>plus 73 validation images </li><li>plus 36 testing images.</li></ul><p>Once you’re done with your preprocessing and augmentation, click “Generate” in the top-right corner. <em>Helpful hint:</em> make sure to name your dataset something memorable!</p><h3 id="now-you-re-ready-to-build-a-model">Now you’re ready to build a model</h3><p>To build a model, it’s as easy as clicking “Use Roboflow Train.”</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/4-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/4-2.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/4-2.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/4-2.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Generally, you need a Roboflow Train credit to do this. <a href="https://roboflow.com/contact?utm_source=streamlit&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=train">Reach out to us and we’ll get you set up</a>!</p><p>You’ll have the option either to train from scratch or to start from a checkpoint.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/5-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/5-1.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/5-1.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/5-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li><strong>Train from Scratch.</strong> This is the easier option. Just click and go! Your model will be built from scratch, using only the data you’ve provided to it.</li><li><strong>Start from a Checkpoint.</strong> This option is a little more sophisticated and requires a related existing model. If you’ve already built a model (or if there’s a public model) that has been fit on related data, then starting from a checkpoint allows you to use the existing model as your starting point. The model is additionally trained on your images. Two advantages to this are that your model will train more quickly, and you'll frequently see improved performance! This is known as <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/a-primer-on-transfer-learning/">transfer learning</a>. However, this does require a related existing model, and we don't always have that.</li></ul><p>In my case, I built my model from scratch, because I didn’t already have a related model.</p><p>That’s all it takes to fit a model in Roboflow. When all is said and done, if your data is already annotated and you don’t make many changes to the augmentations, it’s only a handful of clicks to go from your images to a trained computer vision model. We've also turned <a href="https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate">annotating images into a pretty fast process</a> – especially with <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/announcing-label-assist/">model-assisted labeling</a>.</p><h3 id="how-to-use-an-api-to-access-the-model-and-predictions">How to use an API to access the model and predictions<br></h3><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/6-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/6-1.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/6-1.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/6-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You’ll want to make sure your model performs well before getting too far into this. </p><p>Our model seems to perform pretty well. Usually, we use <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/mean-average-precision/">mean average precision</a> (mAP) to evaluate object detection models. The closer your mAP is to 100%, the better! It’s also helpful to look at your <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/mean-average-precision-per-class/">model’s performance by class</a> to make sure your object detection model isn’t performing significantly worse for one subset of objects.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/7-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/7-2.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/7-2.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/7-2.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If your model isn’t performing the way you want, you may want to work on improving that before you proceed. We usually see dramatic improvements in models when people take one (or both) of the following two actions:</p><ol><li><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/tips-for-how-to-label-images/"><strong>Improve their labeling</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Placing bounding boxes around the entire object, but as close to the edges of the object as possible, can improve your model’s performance.</li><li><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/handling-unbalanced-classes/"><strong>Correcting for unbalanced classes</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Having one or more classes that are severely underrepresented can make it harder for your model to properly identify those underrepresented classes. A basic example is if you show a child 5 pictures of a dog and 100 pictures of a cat, the child may not do a very good job of identifying a dog.</li></ol><p>Now that we’ve fit a model, we can use that model to generate predictions on new images. The <a href="https://docs.roboflow.com/inference">Roboflow Infer API</a> is one of a few ways to conduct inference and that's what we’ll use.</p><p>In order to use the API, we’ll need a couple of pieces of information from Roboflow. <strong>Make sure you keep these both private. </strong>These are specific to you!</p><ul><li>The model name: this should begin with <code>rf</code>.</li><li>The access token/API key: this should be a 12+ letter code.</li></ul><p>This information can be found in multiple places. I like retrieving these from the Example Web App, because I’ll also easily upload an image and test out my model from there. Once you have these pieces of information, you’ll want to store them – you’ll need them momentarily.</p><h3 id="how-to-create-and-deploy-a-streamlit-app">How to create and deploy a Streamlit app</h3><p>Deploying a Streamlit app is easy. Even if you haven’t spent a lot of time focused on deploying apps before. (Here is the <a href="https://github.com/matthewbrems/streamlit-bccd/blob/master/streamlit_app.py">code I wrote to build the app</a>.)</p><p>Following <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html">Streamlit’s API documentation</a> closely, I was able to build an app that:</p><ul><li>Imported an image file from my computer</li><li>Allowed the user to tweak parameters of our computer vision model</li><li>Showed my imported image overlaid with the model’s predicted annotations</li><li>Calculated and displayed summary statistics about the image and predictions</li><li>Generated a histogram of confidence levels for bounding boxes</li></ul><p>I chose to structure this in two physical components: a sidebar and the main area.</p><ul><li><strong>Sidebar.</strong> In the sidebar, the user gets to select a file to import from their local computer. This is where the user can select an image to pull into the app and edit the confidence and overlap thresholds used when generating predicted bounding boxes for the image.<br></li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/8-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/8-1.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/8-1.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2021/02/8-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>Main Area.</strong> In the main area, we have everything else I mentioned.

February 23, 2021 | https://gregraiz.com/css-still-sucks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gregraiz.com/css-still-sucks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content" role="main"><article id="post-875"><div><div><p>In 2006 I wrote a blog post about how CSS sucks. The post was popular and somewhat controversial. It’s been 15 years and the core of the problem remains. CSS has certainly improved but it’s still holding back designers and engineers.</p><p>I’ve reposted the blog post with the original comments from blogger as the original site was taken down.</p><hr><p><em>Sept 25th, 2006</em> – CSS Sucks</p><p>CSS is certainly an improvement on plain old HTML but its limitations are staggering and the lack of industry support will continue to hold back designers for many years to come unless we begin to build and design something better.</p><ol><li>For all that CSS has been able to do it’s a technological failure. CSS just doesn’t work as expected. How can I say it’s a failure when millions of sites use it? CSS can be used to style basic text attributes but browsers aren’t consistent in how they use this technology. Even though there is a “standard” and some browsers partially adhere to the standard to truly be a useful standard you need two things: Predictability and Consistency. CSS has neither. Any designer who has tried to create a large and complex site using CSS will tell you that all popular browsers interpret the standard differently.</li><li>CSS is ‘markup centric’ not ‘design centric.’ I have this idea that designers should spend more time designing great looking sites and less time fiddling around with markup tags and browser compatibility. When I say ‘markup centric’ I mean that every CSS design tool forces users to go into source code mode to create an attractive modern site. Many designers take pride in hand coding CSS. Tools for designers should be design centric. PDF/postscript is a good example of a design centric markup , (unfortunately not very suitable for the web.) Designers don’t argue about how to create semantically correct postscript tags they just create great designs using great design tools. CSS sucks because it forces designers to think about how to make it work technically rather than how to make it work from a design perspective.</li><li>Why on earth do we think that cascading is a useful feature? The way that styles cascade from one level of layout to a deeper layout makes it difficult to figure out why a particular item is styled in a certain way. By contrast non-cascading style sheets would be equally powerful and more predictable. The cascading makes it harder to interpret the page for both the designer as well as the web-browser. In fact the complexities in cascading is one of the reasons why so many browsers screw up the standard. In theory cascading could save bandwidth but in practice it creates bloated documents to get around the cascading issues.</li><li>The box-model is too simplistic. The high level idea of CSS is that you can create attractive pages using margin, border, padding and content attributes. While this is a nice theory, it’s primitive in its understanding of both layout problems and design. Highly developed design tools have layout engines that offer multiple layouts, non-rectangular margins, proportional layouts, dock-able layouts, table layouts, column layouts, etc. etc. It’ll be years before these features make it to CSS and many more before browsers implement them with any consistency. If browsers keep spending so much time on CSS they’ll have a well polished turd. Tools like Aldus Page Maker had better design tools, font tools and layout capabilities 10 years ago. This is because good design tools start with the design, not the markup.</li><li>When writing software you learn what works and what doesn’t. You get new and better ideas and you throw away the old ones. This process of starting fresh is absent from the current CSS way of thinking. Each version of CSS builds on the previous one without acknowledging any fundamental flaws. CSS and its HTML sibling are the ultimate designs by committee. Any enhancements to CSS/HTML are piled on top of the old standards. This makes it progressively harder to create powerful, compatible and consistent browsers. This also makes it harder for designers to create sites that target the new platform because they are constantly trying to satisfy the compatibility with older browsers. Version compatibility has to be all or nothing. If you support V3 it has to be 100% supported and tested. Supporting some of the features actually makes things worse.</li><li>There shouldn’t be multiple right answers for a visual design. The way CSS works there can be many ways to do the same thing. In fact there seem to be endless debates about the proper way to hack together trivial things like rounded corners. Rounded Corners? I mean really! Again I refer you to Aldus and even MS Word circa 1997. These features are not that hard to develop but getting them to work in a “standard way” seems to be all but impossible.</li><li>CSS captures styles not semantics or design intention. A design intention would be something like: “I want to balance these two columns” or perhaps “This text should line up with the logo image in the first column.” When designers do things like this:<pre>  #content{position:relative;top:32px;left:20%;width:40%;}</pre><p>They are capturing the style specifics not the design intention. Why 32 pixels? Why 40%? Perhaps the logo is 32px tall? Perhaps the other column is 60% wide? When the logo changes size or placement how will you know what styles to touch? There is a basic concept called parametric design that can be used to specify the parameters of the design. This concept helps embody the design intention as a set of rules that can then be preserved as the design changes. Even a very simple parametric design allows you to preserve design intention rather then hard coding sizes and dimensions.</p></li><li>Design should be declarative not interpreted. Again CSS has to process a large number of rules before it can figure out where things are supposed to go. After these rules are interpreted this data is thrown out and each and every browser that opens up the web-page has to re-interpret the data. This is incredibly inefficient. First of it makes web-pages load very slowly. Even when you’re on a fast connection the browser can’t figure out where to place objects until the entire web-page has finished loading. Secondly this interpretation is very prone to errors. A declarative design isn’t open to as much interpretation allowing it both render quickly and consistently.</li><li>CSS is a pain to work with. Take a look at some of the designs over at CSSZenGarden. The designs are both attractive and sophisticated. A good designer could take these designs and mock up similar designs in PhotoShop or Illustrator in a matter of hours but take the same designs and ask for it in CSS and it may take a couple days. Each time you make an edit to your CSS you have to refresh your browser to see what it’s actually going to look like. Then after you get one browser working you need to double back and get the other browsers working.</li><li>If you can’t get consistency across browsers then you can’t rely on CSS to accurately and properly design your site. If you can’t get the site to look <span>exactly </span>the way you want on every single browser then how can you claim that CSS is a good design tool or even a success? The fact that there is no alternative to create attractive websites doesn’t make CSS a good tool. There are two ways to solve the problem. The first is to continue to hammer on standards and CSS asking for a better solution. This has been happening for the last 10 years and it just doesn’t work. The alternative is to realize that CSS is flawed in it’s intrinsic design and begin to ask the questions of how could you do it better?</li></ol><p>——–</p><p><strong>Archived comments from the original posting </strong></p><h4>39 Archived Comments:</h4></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>They started out as</strong> apprentices looking for masters, students looking for teachers, or soldiers looking for wars, but they ended up as travelling tinkers, peddlers, beggars and thieves, members of the itinerant underground of central Europe. Carrying forged papers and false names, they were feared by peasants, shunned by burghers and hunted by the police. Catholics and Protestants, Jews, Sinti and Roma â€“ they had little in common, neither bonds of religion nor ethnicity, except for the life into which they had drifted, the life of the road.</p>
<p>The underground of central Europe, from the Middle Ages to the modern era, is all but inaccessible to us today. Those wandering its roads left few traces of themselves, except for the secret signs they carved on trees to warn each other of aggressive policemen and rabid dogs, or to recommend kindhearted householders willing to provide bread and water. These markings faded but there remains a way to catch glimpses of this lost world: its language. Over the course of hundreds of years, the people of the road evolved a distinct way of talking that strengthened their resilience, fostered solidarity and helped them survive. As it was purely spoken, this language, too, almost disappeared â€“ had it not been for police forces across central Europe that decoded it like the cipher used by enemy powers. Collaborating across jurisdictions from the Middle Ages to the 20th century, the police recorded this language by arresting its speakers and forcing them to divulge their words and phrases. The police also named it: Rotwelsch.</p>
<p><em>Rot</em> was a word for beggar (in Rotwelsch), and <em>welsch</em> could mean Italian but mostly it meant foreign and incomprehensible. There was some truth in the name, because Rotwelsch speakers freely mixed German, Yiddish, Hebrew, Czech and Romani, the language of the Sinti and Roma (who used to be called Gypsies because they were falsely believed to have originated in Egypt) in ways that were incomprehensible to outsiders. To German or Yiddish speakers, it sounded as if Rotwelsch speakers had stolen words and twisted their meaning.</p>
<p>Rotwelsch was a name for the language used not by the speakers themselves but by those who regarded vagrants as untrustworthy foreigners. While the police continued to believe that vagrants obscured their words deliberately to make it <em>welsch</em> to outsiders, in reality these vagrantsâ€™ words were only as incomprehensible as any language is to those who donâ€™t speak it. The true purpose of Rotwelsch was not to keep things secret but to help these outcasts navigate their daily lives and to create community among them. A second name captured this reality, <em>kochemer loshn</em>, which, like many words in this language, came from Hebrew: <em>chokmah</em>, for wisdom; and <em>loshn</em>, for tongue or language. This name didnâ€™t denounce the language as a beggarâ€™s cant but celebrated it as a way of talking for those in the know, as the lingo of the wise guys.</p>
<p>For Rotwelsch (or <em>kochemer loshn</em>) speakers, who were in permanent flight from the law, there was little difference between trading and stealing, which is why they had a single word for both, as for traded and stolen goods: the Yiddish word <em>sore</em>, meaning trouble, problem, calamity. Words for food, sex, and lice â€“ an affliction of itinerants everywhere â€“ abounded in their language, as did words for police and for getting arrested.</p>
<p>The police realised that he had an unusual skill: he was a good scribe, thanks to years of forging papers</p>
<p>The worst that could happen was being sent to <em>school</em>, which meant going to prison, a phrase adapted from the German <em>Schule</em> (school), which had been transformed into the Yiddish word for synagogue. (Calling prison â€˜schoolâ€™ later became common in the American underground and was used, most recently, in Martin Scorseseâ€™s film <em>The Irishman</em>). The 19th-century policeman Friedrich AvÃ©-Lallemant, the first true scholar of Rotwelsch, would have much to say about this equation of school and prison. He studied Rotwelsch and its speakers, and drew a single lesson from the experience: the necessity for police reform.</p>
<p>To avoid being sent to school, Rotwelsch speakers had to cultivate the art of <em>making a rabbit</em>, by which they meant how best to make like a rabbit and dash off.</p>
<p>This witty and wise language, which mistrusted big words and official institutions, expressed with poetic precision what it was like to live in difficult circumstances, of <em>being in a pickle</em>. But why a pickle? Actually, the whole phrase was a misunderstanding, a false translation from Rotwelsch. The original Yiddish phrase (<em>Zores und Jokreszeit</em>) had nothing to do with pickles, only sounded like them (to German ears, like <em>Saure Gurkenzeit</em>, or â€˜pickled cucumber timeâ€™), so that German speakers mistakenly started talking of pickles when they were in trouble. Before long, the phrase entered English, which means that you, too, dear reader, have been speaking Rotwelsch without realising it.</p>
<p><strong>Ferdinand Baumhauer was one</strong> of the Rotwelsch speakers whose life is reconstructed in my recent <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324005919" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">book</a>. Born in 1818 into a family of cotton weavers, Baumhauer had apprenticed himself to a cobbler at 13, and a few years later begun the customary stint as a journeyman, hoping to learn from other masters of the trade. But Baumhauer quarrelled with another apprentice and left his position. Seeking cheap accommodation for the night, he chanced upon a shelter favoured by tramps, his first contact with the secret world of the road. Something about them appealed to him. Perhaps he was tired of having to serve masters who were often strict and abusive. He decided to quit his life as a journeyman and begin the more precarious one as a vagrant.</p>
<p>When Baumhauer was arrested many years later, the police realised that he had an unusual skill for a vagrant: he was a good scribe, thanks to years of forging papers. The police asked him to write down scenes from life in the underground. Baumhauer complied, filling a book with scenes of vagrancy written in his underground language. Baumhauer was the perfect informant, a vagrant with good penmanship. He even provided the decryption key â€“ the meanings of secret words â€“ on the right-hand side of each page and added helpful information at the bottom in the form of footnotes, aware of how little the police would know about the life he was describing.</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1450/puchner-insert.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>Baumhauerâ€™s book. <em>Image supplied by the author</em></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>He wrote of a family led by Walter and his wife, known as Walteress, making a narrow escape. A mounted policeman stops Walter to check their papers (undoubtedly forged) while Walteress has gone to beg in a nearby village for some <em>sore</em>. Walter convinces the policeman that nothing untoward is happening, but then the policeman hears dogs barking in the village and senses that something isnâ€™t right. Walter has already left by this time, and Walteress, thinking quickly on her feet, realises what a pickle sheâ€™s in, avoids the policeman and meets up with Walter away from the village. The policeman realises that the two have <em>made a rabbit</em> and pursues them. Fortunately, the Walter wagon races ahead and crosses the border to the next jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Baumhauer knew all about escape. Once heâ€™d finished writing his stories, the police relaxed their vigilance and he fled. The Baumhauer case is an unusual example of how this secret language survived via police archives. These records of Rotwelsch came from the intent to police its speakers, but they allowed me to reverse-engineer the lives of the speakers who expressed their view of the world through its distinct idiom.</p>
<p>Rotwelsch vagrants were among the first to be sent to concentration camps</p>
<p>Early researchers of Rotwelsch, such as AvÃ©-Lallemant, spoke of Rotwelsch as a â€˜professional languageâ€™, the technical jargon of thieves comparable with that of doctors, lawyers, hunters (and professors). Today, linguists speak of it as a <em>sociolect</em>, the speech of any distinct sub-group. A sociolect doesnâ€™t quite rise to the level of a full language because it doesnâ€™t have its own grammar; in the case of Rotwelsch, it borrowed its grammar from German. But precisely because Rotwelsch wasnâ€™t a regular language and instead consisted of words useful only to a specific group â€“ words for police, for getting into pickles, for getting arrested, for different kinds of prisons, and for making a quick escape â€“ it now works so well as a record of a particular way of life.</p>
<p><strong>My uncle, a bohemian</strong> writer who had become obsessed with Rotwelsch, introduced me to it when I was a child. Over the course of many years, he had tracked down its remaining speakers and assembled a large archive on the language. When he died, I inherited his archive, a unique resource for studying the now-lost world of this itinerant underground.</p>
<p>My study of Rotwelsch has also revealed secrets from my own family history. My grandfather, I learned, had been obsessed with Rotwelsch as well, although for different reasons. An early member of the Nazi Party, he had attacked Rotwelsch as an uncouth mixture of German and Yiddish that proved, to his mind, that all Jews were criminals. He wanted the language eliminated. Soon, he would almost get his wish, when Rotwelsch vagrants were among the first to be sent to concentration camps. After the war, he managed to avoid prosecution and bury his past. After learning of my grandfatherâ€™s role, I better understood why my uncle had devoted so much time to preserving and reviving Rotwelsch, and why he had taught the language to me: in a form of linguistic rebellion, perhaps even atonement, he decided to undo some of his fatherâ€™s work.</p>
<p>Throughout my research, I wondered what Rotwelsch sounded like. There would have been significant variations, depending on the different German dialects spoken in various regions of central Europe, from the Rhine to Prague, and from Hamburg to Zurich and Vienna, as well as dialects marked by Yiddish, Czech, Dutch and other regional languages. I …</p></div></div></div>

<p><small>February 23, 2021 • Reading time: 12 minutes</small></p>

<p>At this point, most developers use Git as a tool for collaboration. We have our
rote-learned commands to pull, commit, and push. And of course, there's <a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">that
one coworker</a> who knows a bit more about Git than
everyone else, who helps get us back on track whenever our local repos end up in
a strange state.</p>
<p>But what if I told you that Git can be a valuable tool without ever setting up a
remote repository? I'm not just talking about having a working version of your
code base to roll back to if you mess something up, although there's that too.
Used correctly, Git can help to structure your work, identifying gaps in your
test coverage and minimizing dead code.</p>
<p>There are two subjects I'm going to avoid for the purposes of this blog post:
other developers, who are the most compelling but least interesting argument
for keeping your commit history clean, and <code>git bisect</code>, which does factor
heavily into my workflow but deserves its own blog post.</p>
<p>As with any ubiquitous developer tool, the Git user base has a lot of strong and
conflicting opinions about the one "correct" way to use it. My goal is simply to
introduce a workflow that I've been using and refining for much of my career;
take from it what you will. And, importantly, it's a workflow that has become a
vital part not just of my collaboration process, but of the way I write code.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these principles serve two purposes: they focus my work onto a
particular bugfix, feature, or goal, and they ensure that my Git history isn't
set in stone. With proper hygiene, commits can be dropped, rearranged, and split
off into other branches painlessly and without merge conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="principle-1-a-branch-must-do-one-useful-thing">Principle 1: A branch must do one useful thing</h2>
<p>When I'm managing my own projects, I have a lot of ideas that I want to see
happen. If I'm just throwing one commit after another into <code>main</code>, I'll get
halfway through implementing one feature and then jump off to hacking on
another. If any of the features get completed, it will be at the expense of a
wasteland of half-completed features that are now taking up space in my code
base.</p>
<p>In a brand-new project, sure, I'll throw a bunch of garbage commits into <code>main</code>.
My rule of thumb for when to stop this is when I can write my first effective
integration test. If there is <em>something</em> useful to test, there is now enough
substance to my project that I can have distinct tasks on the go. Trying to
break into branches too early just results in me throwing my garbage commits
into a branch instead of main.</p>
<p>In the early stages of a project, articulating the purpose of a branch can be as
simple as giving it a descriptive name. If a commit isn't moving the code base
in that direction, it can always get cherry-picked into a different branch.</p>
<p>As the project matures, I'll start using some sort of issue or bug tracking
software to flesh out what I'm trying to accomplish in more detail and
coordinate the branches for multiple related useful things.</p>
<p>I find that descriptive branch names also help to refocus my attention on what
I'm trying to accomplish. For instance, my command prompt currently looks like
this:</p>
<pre><span>10:02:19 </span><span>max</span> <span>~/Projects/mikkel.ca</span> <span>blog-post-git-as-a-solo-developer</span><span>|</span> <span>R</span><span>%</span></pre>
<h2 id="principle-2-every-commit-must-be-independent">Principle 2: Every commit must be independent</h2>
<p>So much for branches, let's zoom into a commit level. I've articulated what
concrete thing I want my branch to add, now how do I add it? Usually, there's
some poking around my code base involved in figuring that out. Sometimes I take
a wrong turn, sometimes I just get distracted. That's okay, it's part of the
process.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean that every commit I make right now is going to end up
getting merged in this branch. By keeping my commits independent from one
another, I ensure that I can rearrange or cherry-pick them into new branches
if I discover that they really don't have anything to do with what I'm working
on right now.</p>
<p>If my commits are not independent, I am essentially stuck with the exact history
as it was written. Trying to tease out a commit into a different branch or move
it to the beginning of my branch history will become fraught with merge
conflicts as later commits that modified code introduced in this commit fall
like dominoes.</p>
<p>Obviously, I'm still allowed to call code written in one commit from a later
commit. That's the reason I'm doing this particular work in this particular
branch, after all. But I never touch the same code multiple times. If I have to
go back and fix something, maybe add a validation check or field that I hadn't
thought of, I'll go back to the commit where it was created rather than amending
it in a later commit.</p>
<p>Obviously, this could go on forever, which is why the "one useful thing"
principle exists. Once I've settled on what I want the code to look like for the
purposes of this branch, I merge and then start a new commit in the next branch
for further changes to the same.</p>
<h3 id="principle-2a-every-commit-must-include-its-own-tests">Principle 2a: Every commit must include its own tests</h3>
<p>Here's where keeping commits small starts to pay dividends. If the code in each
commit is small enough for me to reason about, it's small enough for me to
visually ensure that its test coverage is good.</p>
<p>And of course, if I do end up rearranging this commit or splitting it off to a
different branch, I want its tests to come along with.</p>
<p>The exception to this is integration and functional/behavioural tests, which can
and should have their own commits. In that case, the tests are really tied to
the branch level rather than the commit level, since Principle 1 implies that
there should be exactly one new test to add as a result of this branch.</p>
<h2 id="principle-2b-every-commit-must-pass-all-tests">Principle 2b: Every commit must pass all tests</h2>
<p>Again, breaking something in a commit (even if I <em>really definitely</em> intend to
fix it in a later commit) locks me into the git history as written. And
introducing a breaking change with the intention of fixing things later always
carries the risk that I'll get distracted and end up merging the breaking
change.</p>
<p>If there's some prerequisite to get this change to pass tests - say, a
preexisting bug that snuck through a hole in my test coverage - that gets its
own commit.</p>
<p>Speaking of holes in test coverage, there's another (temporary) exception here.
I don't normally practice strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven
development</a>, but if I do
fix a long-standing bug, I normally temporarily put its test in a separate
commit. I'll then rebase so that the test appears before the fix, ensure that
the test fails <em>without</em> the fix, then complete the rebase and validate that the
test now passes. Once the due diligence to validate my test is done, I can go
ahead and squash the bugfix with its test.</p>
<h2 id="principle-3-draft-commits-are-fine">Principle 3: Draft commits are fine</h2>
<p>If I know that I'll be coming back to a change later, I'm much more comfortable
setting it down and moving on to roughing in the next part of the process,
rather than finishing, polishing, and unit testing code that might need to
change before my branch gets merged.</p>
<p>In fact, I find that I waste much less time on writing tests for things that
I'll later change when I'm following this workflow to the letter than I do when
I get "lazy" and start dumping everything into big catch-all commits.</p>
<p>Some people favour TODO comments in their code, occasionally supported by
automated checks that prevent code containing "TODO" from merging. I prefer to
annotate my commit messages and leave my code clean. Normally, this looks
something like "add controller class - TODO test me". (I always put my TODOs on
the first line of the commit message, so that they show up even in short log
views.)</p>
<h2 id="principle-4-it-s-okay-to-discard-commits-completely">Principle 4: It's okay to discard commits completely</h2>
<p>Often I start a task by tidying up the surrounding code, in the same way I might
organize my desk before starting work. (I don't, but I <em>might</em>.) Sometimes that
cleanup turns out to be a valuable part of the groundwork for this change, but
sometimes it's just dead weight. Keeping my commits independent makes it easy to
discard or cherry-pick out code that turned out to be unnecessary, along with
any unit tests that went along with.</p>
<p>(I do still consider the tidying to be a valuable part of the process. It clears
my mind and refreshes my knowledge of the problem space with some simple rote
tasks before I dive into something more complex. And occasionally it results in
cleaner code.)</p>

<p>I'm not perfect.<sup>[citation needed]</sup> Obviously, it's not practical to
maintain this level of commit hygiene by making each change sequentially.
Instead, I jump around <em>constantly</em>. Doing so requires me to be comfortable in
navigating my commit history. (Conversely, it's also a good way to <em>become</em>
comfortable with navigating history.)</p>
<p>In that vein, here are some tools beyond your standard
<code>checkout</code>/<code>branch</code>/<code>pull</code>/<code>commit</code>/<code>push</code> workflow that come in handy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit"><code>git commit --amend</code></a> – A quick and easy
way to update the most recent commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit"><code>git commit --fixup [hash]</code></a> – When
changing history, I used to find myself making a lot of commits with messages
like "merge me with xyz" if I need to revisit commits before the most recent
one. It turns out that <code>git commit</code> has flags to help with this: <code>--fixup</code> and
<code>--squash</code> will automatically suggest a fixup or squash with another commit
during rebase if the <code>--autosquash</code> flag is provided to that command. (To
enable this behaviour by default, run <code>git config --global rebase.autosquash true</code>. It won't behave any differently if there are no commit messages in the
history being edited that contain "squash!" or "fixup!".) A surprise bonus:
since the fixup operation inherits the message of the previous commit, you
won't be prompted to enter a new one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase"><code>git rebase --interactive main</code></a> – I can
also use <code>git rebase --interactive HEAD~5</code> to edit the last 5 commits, but I
find rebasing directly on <code>main</code> (or <code>master</code>, or whatever my upstream branch
is) kills two birds with one stone. It will show me all commits since I
branched off from <code>main</code>, and will simultaneously bring my branch up to date
with my latest local copy of main.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash"><code>git stash</code></a> – Sometimes I have unrelated</p></li></ul></div></div>

    <p>When I was explaining our interview process to my colleague, I realised that my approach is very different from what standard tech interviews are usually about. It is probably different from what interviews in general all about. But I am quite sure the usual way is broken and we need to work on a better framework. I am going to share my approach and hopefully, you can get some inspiration out of it.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a>, we have multiple rounds of interviews. It starts with a phone screening covering some general aspects, goes to the first round done by the hiring manager followed by a home task assignment. After a candidate sends us a home task, we review it and schedule the next round - pairing. If everything goes well, there is one more round with a hiring manager again covering more cultural aspects and work details in greater depth. I am usually involved in home task review and pairing sessions and I am going to focus on the second one here. Because I feel there is an improvement in the whole hiring process we can do.</p>
<h2 id="home-task-and-pairing">Home task and pairing</h2>
<p>Are a home task and the following pairing enough to assess candidate technical skills? Well, it goes to a fundamental question: “What do you want to know?” The biggest problem in interviewing is labelling candidates good or bad. If your framework can be described as “Is the candidate good enough to work here?”, you are limiting yourself and I would say you are limiting your potential growth and company culture as well. A better angle is: “Can we benefit from a candidate's current experience and focus?” Because there is no such thing as a failed interview. It is more about whether a company can see the use of a candidate's skills in the current time. And whether the candidate can see the potential for whatever they are interested in (learning, growth, responsibility, money, status). So what am I trying to address during my part of the interview? My question to ask is: “Would I like to sit next to this person for 4 hours and solve a problem together?”</p>
<h2 id="but-you-have-to-verify-their-skills">But you have to verify their skills</h2>
<p>You may be still wondering whether this can cover all the technical skills like algorithms knowledge, database modelling, testing… Well, it cannot. And I am 100% sure it’s not a problem. Because by asking coding puzzles questions (aka leetcoding), you are not addressing problem-solving capabilities. At best, you are addressing “solving coding puzzles” skills and how good they are in remembering chapters from the “How to crack a coding interview” book. The same goes for all other tech stuff - unless you are writing quick sort every day, don’t ask them to write it. Think about what you do in your day-to-day life. What are the challenges? How can you solve them on an acceptable, mediocre and exceptional level? And how do you want to feel when you are solving them with your colleagues?</p>
<h2 id="my-approach">My approach</h2>
<p>I have three main goals I have in mind while talking to a candidate:
Be respectful
Have fun
Learn something new
The main message here is to be on the same level as a candidate. I am not superior just because I am interviewing them. I bet we all have some terrible experiences from our past interviews where we felt pretty bad and useless. I don’t want to do this to anybody else. Therefore, I am not testing their knowledge. I am not asking them questions expecting one right answer. I am asking about their ideas and opinions. Nicely said, right? But how can you achieve that? One example from a recent interview. A candidate mentioned some changes they could do in their code and said they would need to make sure the performance is not impacted. I could ask questions like “What do you know about performance measuring?” or “What tools are we using to measure performance?”. But I said: “How would you measure whether it has a performance impact?”. By this, I allowed them to express both their opinions and experience. I can share some of mine as well asking them for feedback.</p>
<p>This setup greatly helps with the last learning part as well. I am not expecting any right answers, so we are rather talking and sharing our opinions. I can also learn a lot from theirs and I’m allowed to pass my experience to the candidate easily. It makes me happy when they mention they have learned something new during the discussion. </p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>This all sounds very nice, but all in all, it is still an interview and I should be able to articulate an answer and reasoning, whether I am for having this candidate in a team or not.</p>
<p>There are two main questions I am trying to answer are:
Are they able to understand and solve the problem using a programming language and other tools?
Do I enjoy working with them?</p>
<p>The first one is kind of straightforward. During pairing, you can usually very quickly spot if they need to check documentation every single time for writing even simple language constructs. If they can catch errors and extract functionality to better encapsulate units. And I pay special attention to debugging. I don’t need them to have a full-blown debugger, I just expect them to navigate their code effectively and have a good way of identifying where the problem can be.</p>
<p>Whether I am enjoying our discussion is more tricky. The most important part is not to be pulled into any kind of bias. I am keeping in mind I am representing a company culture and I need to understand if they would fit in. So I am trying to uncover how easy or hard it is for them to accept a different opinion or a suggestion. How can they clarify and support theirs? How verbose are they when thinking about the problem? As a company, we have a very open and sharing engineering structure. A quiet person, who needs to think for an hour by himself would be probably struggling heavily. The same goes for folks who need to solve everything on their own, without using libraries or asking for help or clarification. So this part is not about whether I would go for a beer with the candidate (although, if they join, it is likely to happen too). It is more about their fit for our standard way of working.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-improve-our-tech-interviews">Let's improve our tech interviews</h2>
<p>I am heavily convinced a lot of people are passing bad interview experience to others. Because “I had to deal with that, so they have to do it too” approach. Or because they simply don’t know how to do it differently. I am guilty of doing this too. But I have decided to stop. I am stepping down from a superior interviewer position and model the discussion as we would be colleagues already. Since I don't want to make my colleagues feel uncomfortable, there is no reason I should treat candidates differently. Because they can turn into colleagues easily.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Velocity is a measurement of how many story points a software development team can finish within a sprint (usually one or two weeks). These points are set by the software development team when they review a ticket and estimate how complex the ticket is. When a team measures this output over a period of time, generally they have a consistent amount of story points they can deliver in a sprint and their velocity is known.</p><p>Improving developer velocity is directly correlated with performance. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance" title="Link to mckinsey developer velocity study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">McKinsey published an article in April 2020</a>, where they cite that companies in the top 25% on their Developer Velocity Index grow up to twice as fast as companies in their same industries. Intuitively this makes sense since delivering more allows the development team to learn through iterating and improving. </p><p>One might argue that velocity alone doesn’t make for great software, but assuming a development team is aware that quality is important, one can see how velocity usually helps. The ability to deliver quickly also allows a development team to address quality issues quickly. It’s easy to argue that development teams with high velocity have the ability to deliver better quality software because they can address issues quickly.</p><p>In the same study, McKinsey highlighted several factors that allow a software development team to move quickly. Specifically they highlight that Technology Tools are an incredibly important dimension to velocity and business outcomes. And the most important tools are: Planning, Collaboration, Development and DevOps tools. </p><p>In this post I’m going to discuss the <strong>top 5 ways Ephemeral Environments can improve developer velocity</strong> by touching on how they are a <em>Collaboration</em>, <em>Development</em> and <em>DevOps</em> tool. As we’ve spoken about in our article <a href="https://releaseapp.io/ephemeral-environments" title="What is an Ephemeral Environment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“What is an Ephemeral Environment?”</a>, ephemeral environments are spun up on demand and contain the code and data that approximates production closely. These environments are used by development teams in the software development process to test, debug and ensure features are built correctly before code is pushed to production.</p><h2 id="here-are-the-top-5-ways-ephemeral-environments-can-be-used-to-improve-developer-velocity">Here are the top 5 ways ephemeral environments can be used to improve developer velocity</h2><h3 id="1-ephemeral-environments-are-a-devops-tool-designed-to-remove-the-staging-or-qa-environment-bottleneck"><strong>1. Ephemeral environments are a DevOps tool designed to remove the staging or QA environment bottleneck</strong></h3><p>Traditional pre-production ecosystems usually have a limited amount of environments for developers. The staging or QA environment is generally used as a step before production where all code is merged and tested. Most organizations have one or very few of these environments, so as the organization grows these environments become a bottleneck in the process as all code must be tested here before production. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/57RYmuBRfBBWCRUWglqBnZ/14bafeeb0a47fd566938d2ff052a01c6/Screen_Shot_2021-02-22_at_2.43.18_PM.png" alt="Example of ephemeral environments for each branch"></p><p>With ephemeral environments, the traditional idea of “staging” is gone. Every feature branch is contained in its own isolated environment and becomes its own integration environment. There is no longer a need to have a single testing and integration environment where all code must merge before going to production. With ephemeral environments you have a limitless supply of environments for any purpose.</p><h3 id="2-ephemeral-environments-are-a-collaboration-tool-designed-to-allow-for-early-and-often-feedback"><strong>2. Ephemeral environments are a collaboration tool designed to allow for “early and often” feedback</strong></h3><p>Feedback is the lifeblood of great products. If you’ve ever read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884/" title="High Output Management Book" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Andy Grove’s book on high output management</a>, you know he does an amazing job of discussing how rework is so costly. If you haven’t read this book, I highly recommend it, even if all you read are the first few chapters where he discusses trying to cook a high quality egg repeatedly, in under three minutes. In summary, Andy suggested through this analogy that finding issues/defects early in the egg cooking process is the most important part of consistently cooking a high quality egg in under three minutes.</p><p>Likewise in software development, getting feedback and finding quality issues early in the development cycle reduces costly rework and improves velocity. If a product is delivered to a customer that doesn’t work or has bugs, it has to be reworked and go through the entire process again. Or if a product manager or designer doesn’t have a way to see changes until an engineer is finished with development, there is a high likelihood they will spot something wrong and rework the solution. These are all examples of rotten eggs in the process that hamper developer velocity. </p><p>With ephemeral environments, rework can be minimized because stakeholders become a part of the development process. When an ephemeral environment is created, URLs to the environment are created so stakeholders can see progress while code is being developed. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/2dFjnsY2lBSSbkaOfqczSG/3b9ef1f1134d5cf21f464af8dbf8fa93/Screen_Shot_2021-02-22_at_2.40.44_PM.png" alt="Links in the PR"></p><p>At <a href="https://releaseapp.io/" title="Link to Release Home Page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Release</a>, we highly recommend to our customers that they create a PR as soon as a developer starts working on a feature so a Release Ephemeral Environment is automatically created. When the developer pushes code to their source control system, the environment is updated making it a live reflection of the feature during development. Product managers, designers and QA are automatically notified when changes are live and they can preview those changes and give feedback immediately. </p><p>At Release, we will also share our own ephemeral environments with our customers as we’re building a feature so we can get feedback directly from the people we’re making the software for before we release it to production.</p><h3 id="3-ephemeral-environments-can-limit-rework-and-thus-increase-developer-velocity"><strong>3. Ephemeral environments can limit rework and thus increase developer velocity.</strong></h3><p>Ephemeral environments are a developer tool that allows for full integration and smoke testing on isolated features</p><p>Traditional continuous integration (CI) is the idea that your developer process should constantly be testing as a developer pushes code. What this leaves out many times is that most CI systems only perform unit tests continuously. Unit tests are meant to test small units of code and not the entire system as a whole. Integration and Smoke tests are where full paths of user experience can be tested. Usually Integration and Smoke tests are left to be tested only when the code makes its way via a merge to the mainline code branch and a traditional staging environment.</p><p>Again, if we refer back to Andy Grove’s three minute egg analogy, this step of running Integration and Smoke tests only when the code branch is merged to the mainline is extremely late in the process. If issues are found during Integration and/or Smoke tests, the developer has to start the development cycle again from the beginning after finding this issue too late in the process.</p><p>To add to the issue, if a team only has a single staging environment, the bottleneck around this staging environment is exacerbated with developers waiting for Integration and Smoke tests to be run on this single environment. On top of this, many code changes/features/branches may have been a part of the mainline merge making finding the cause of failed Integration/Smoke tests difficult and time consuming.</p><p>With ephemeral environments, Integration and Smoke tests can be run when the ephemeral environment is created for a feature branch. This ensures that Integration and Smoke tests are run as frequently as unit tests so developers can find issues early in the process. Additionally, Integration and Smoke tests run against a single feature change/branch will isolate changes against the mainline and make finding the root cause much easier.</p><h3 id="4-ephemeral-environments-are-a-devops-tool-that-allow-for-experimentation-with-infrastructure"><strong>4. Ephemeral environments are a DevOps tool that allow for experimentation with infrastructure</strong></h3><p>Making changes to infrastructure is hard and when a developer introduces the need for an infrastructure change it’s costly in time across the board. In a traditional environment setup (without ephemeral environments) this will result in an overall slow down in developer velocity as the shared staging environments must be updated by the DevOps team so the developer has some place to test their changes and new infrastructure.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/4clfoJM7gvr7ufFW8yqmax/e9731087d982502e619cba93d9cbafc6/Screen_Shot_2021-02-22_at_2.44.56_PM.png" alt="Experiment with environment configuration"></p><p>With ephemeral environments, this testing can be done in isolation and does not impact any other developer. For instance, with Release Ephemeral Environments, a developer can add services, environment variables, new infrastructure dependencies, new datasets/databases on their own through use of environment templates (environments as code) to experiment and develop without interfering with any other developers work or environments. This results in higher developer velocity again through minimization of rework and bottlenecks on shared resources.</p><h3 id="5-ephemeral-environments-are-a-collaboration-tool-designed-to-be-an-agilescrum-catalyst"><strong>5. Ephemeral environments are a collaboration tool designed to be an agile/scrum catalyst</strong></h3><p>Many organizations have made the move to Agile/Scrum but their infrastructure and technology haven’t adapted to support a more iterative approach to building software. The entire premise of Agile/Scrum is for teams to be empowered and driven by early and often feedback. If your organization is on Agile/Scrum and you’re still using a single or few staging environments, you’re technologically hampering your process improvements. Ephemeral environments are the homes and office buildings where agile teams live, work, build, and play.</p><p>Ephemeral environments are a catalyst to the Agile/Scrum methodology. When a developer does a pull request the ephemeral environment is created and collaboration on the feature can begin. The team is free to iterate, share,  nand solicit feedback all while keeping the rest of the organization freely moving with their own ephemeral environments. Stakeholders are a part of the development process and true customer driven development, which is the heart of the Agile/Scrum methodology, can occur.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Ephemeral environments turbo charge development velocity by eliminating bottlenecks in the process (DevOps Tool), including stakeholders in the process (Collaboration Tool) and improving product quality (Developer Tool). All of these factors were highlighted in the McKinsey report on developer velocity as critical and ephemeral environments are <em>an investment that will put your organization in the top 25%</em>.</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@maicoamorim?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" title="Maico Amorim photo credit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Maico Amorim</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/@maicoamorim?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" title="Unsplash link to photo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Unsplash</a>.</p></div></article></div>]]>

My initial plan was to go for a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/9.7inch_e-Paper_HAT">9.7inch with gray levels</a>, but I had no experience at all with that hardware so I went for the safer, 50$, solution.</p><p>The first good news is that the screen is CRAZY thin, here is a photo to give you an idea : </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lengrand.fr/content/images/2021/02/image-25.png"><figcaption>A photo of the e-ink screen from the side</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>When buying an e-paper screen, here are the things you want to look for : </p><ul><li><strong>Refresh time</strong>. One of the cons of having an e-ink screen is that refreshes usually take a while. If you want performance, also look whether partial refreshes are available. Here is a video of mine so you get an idea:</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It updates every 5 minutes and that's what a refresh looks like in case you wonder : <a href="https://t.co/PjW4CS4rXp">pic.twitter.com/PjW4CS4rXp</a></p>— Julien Lengrand-Lambert (@jlengrand) <a href="https://twitter.com/jlengrand/status/1362321332516585480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><ul><li><strong>Resolution</strong>. e-ink screen of higher resolution are still quite expensive (compared to a tablet). Depending on what you want to do with the screen, you might end up with artifacts. A nice font will help you there, but it won't do miracles either. For example, this is what my dashboard looked like before I put my text in bold. You can clearly see the artifacts : </li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lengrand.fr/content/images/2021/02/image-22.png"><figcaption>A photo of the screen with text missing due to resolution</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><ul><li><strong>Gray levels</strong>. My screen is two colors ( essentially, ink or no ink). Some other screen have 16 gray levels. Some others even have color. You may	 want to choose one of those but remember that it will cost you in refresh time or price. </li><li><strong>Driver board</strong>. We'll talk more about this soon but be aware that not all screen come with connectors and a driver board. If you don't know what I am talking about, be careful buying a HAT version, otherwise you won't be able to use the screen : </li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lengrand.fr/content/images/2021/02/image-23.png"><figcaption>A photo of the screen with driver board</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h3 id="the-computer-">The 'computer'</h3><p>This post will be using a Raspberry Pi. Note that the Waveshare screens have a pretty extensive <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_e-Paper_HAT">documentation</a> so you can also go for Arduino or even the Jatson nano if you fancy it.</p><p>Just to be clear, I am using a Raspberry Pi Zero W in my build, so you don't need crazy amounts of power to run it. </p><p><strong>If you're afraid of soldering, I recommend you use the B version of the Raspberry</strong> because the driver board from Waveshare can directly clip on the GPIO : </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lengrand.fr/content/images/2021/02/image-24.png"><figcaption>Driver Board connected to a Raspberry Pi model B</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>As I mentioned, I decided to go for a Raspberry Pi Zero W for two reasons : </p><ul><li>The form factor is much smaller, which allows for a super small setup together with the screen</li><li>The Zero goes for 10$, which is close to nothing! </li></ul><p>In case you go for the 0 like me, you'll have to solder a few cables. Don't be afraid though, everything is <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_e-Paper_HAT">described here</a>. All you need is the table below together with the Raspberry GPIO. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lengrand.fr/content/images/2021/02/image-26.png"><figcaption>GPIO correspondances of the R Pi Zero</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lengrand.fr/content/images/2021/02/image-27.png"><figcaption>Where to solder each pin</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Once you've done that, you're pretty much good to go! Find a 5V adapter and power up your Raspberry Pi! The nice thing is that your screen will feed off the Raspberry so you need only one alimentation. We're ready to move to phase 2!</p><h3 id="the-os">The OS</h3><p>I've decided to keep this in the hardware part, because I don't have much to say. What we will want to do on our Raspberry Pi is install a default OS that is not too old. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/">You can create and flash one here</a> by following the instructions.</p><p>The next thing you want to do is follow all the instructions described <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_e-Paper_HAT">in the default Waveshare setup</a>. Again, they are very well done so I don't have much to add but if you have any issue feel free to drop me a message.</p><p>In case you need to setup WiFi for your Raspberry Pi, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md">here is the guide I used</a>!</p><p>You will enable SPI, install the necessaries libraries and download the library and test code from Waveshare. I tested with Python.</p><p>In case you have the same screen as I do, you will want to run the <code>epd_7in5_V2_test.py</code> script located in <code>waveshare/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/examples/</code>! If all goes according to plan and you've soldered everything correctly, your screen will wake up!</p><h2 id="the-software">The software</h2><p><strong>TL;DR: Use <a href="https://github.com/samsonmking/epaper.js">epaper.js</a> on the Pi, created a service around it and serve static content in the static folder :).</strong></p><p>Our screen is awake, and we have a linux to work with! Time to start creating our dashboard! </p><p>I have made use of the amazing <a href="https://github.com/samsonmking/epaper.js">epaper.js</a> project to create my dashboard. The project is insanely useful. In short, it runs a static website locally and projects it on the screen using puppeteer. </p><p>This has a huge advantage : you only have to create a website and then deploy it on the device! <strong>You can find the complete code for the front and back end of the project <a href="https://github.com/jlengrand/epaper-dashboard-blog">here on Github</a>. And the website is available <a href="https://epaper-dashboard-blog.netlify.app/">at any time on Netlify</a>.</strong></p><p>The project is composed of two parts, which live in the same repository. </p><ul><li>The root repository that contains the code that will run on the Raspberry Pi, 'the backend'</li><li>The <code>epaper-ui</code>folder, which will contain our actual dashboard, the 'frontend'.</li></ul><p>Let's dive into each of the parts, but first, a word of warning: </p><p>Epaper.js &nbsp;can only be run on the raspberry. Indeed, it depends on native libraries (the GPIO drivers) that do not exist on your computer :). Not a problem, just something to be aware of (For example, don't set a CI on your project on Github).</p><p>Conversely, the latest version of Node that I could run on my raspberry is version 10.x, which means that I could not run the frontend code on it. Again, not a problem; just something to be aware of. </p><p>What that means is simply that I have been developing the frontend on my computer, and the backend only on the pi.</p><p>Now that it's clear, let's go!</p><h3 id="the-frontend">The frontend</h3><p>This part is the easiest to talk about. Keep in mind that for your own project, you can use any technology that suits you. The only requirement you have is that the result of your build lands in the <code>static</code> folder of the repository to be picked up by the backend. </p><p>Here is the current deployed frontend :</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lengrand.fr/content/images/2021/02/image-31.png"><figcaption>Latest version of the frontend, in the web form</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>I decided to use Web Components, and my website is based on top of <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide/properties">LitElement</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. I used the excellent <a href="https://open-wc.org/">open-wc</a> library to generate my project skeleton in Typescript. Those are personal choices, you may well choose anything you like. </p><p>I picked these because by using Web Components I had very little to learn on top of the basic capabilities of HTML. Thanks to tailwind I also didn't have to learn much CSS :). My knowledge is limited in the front-end, having a simple syntax, a boring technological choice and no build-chain seemed like a perfect deal. No need to screw around with Webpack &lt;3!</p><p>Another good thing is that because I am basically only building a website, I could use <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> as a platform to see the results of my work. And gosh I love their product!</p><p>Some things to note : </p><ul><li><a href="https://lengrand.fr/a-simple-setup-to-use-litelement-with-tailwindcss-for-small-projects/">I wrote a short article on how to easily use tailwind together with LitElement</a></li><li>Since it is a personal dashboard, I needed personal data. I leave it up to you to decide where to fetch your data from. The easiest for us to sync up with the girlfriend is Google Spreadsheets :).<a href="https://lengrand.fr/fetching-google-calendar-data-without-oauth-the-hacky-way/"> I wrote a whole blog post</a> about how to do that to sync calendars and avoid having to use Oauth2. In short, you can publish your spreadsheets online as CSV files. I do that and then ingest the data to create my dashboard. The great thing is that the CSV files are always up to date! </li></ul><p>I created my whole dashboard by using <code>$ npm start</code> in the <code>epaper-ui</code> folder, running <code>$npm build</code> every time I was happy with the result. That pushed the built version in the <code>static</code> folder of my project and sent it over to Github. By pulling the repository on my raspberry, I can make sure to always have the latest version of the dashboard.</p><p>Again, you can <a href="https://github.com/jlengrand/epaper-dashboard-blog/tree/main/epaper-ui">check the source code</a> here, and the <a href="https://epaper-dashboard-blog.netlify.app/">resulting dashboard over here</a>. </p><p>One last thing I want to mention before moving on is the way I refresh my dashboard :). The epaper.js examples <a href="https://github.com/samsonmking/epaper.js/tree/master/examples/weather-station">has an example with data that updates</a>. <strong>However</strong>, that data updates from the backend to the frontend. In my application, all the data is pulled from the internet via the frontend, which means that I cannot use the same mechanism. </p><p>To solve this problem, I make use of a very old capability of HTML itself to tell the page to refresh itself after very few minutes : </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lengrand.fr/content/images/2021/02/image-30.png"><figcaption>Tells the page to refresh every 60 seconds.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Depending on how you build your own dashboard, you may not be concerned by this.</p><h3 id="the-backend">The backend</h3><p>Naming that part 'the backend' makes it seem like I've done a whole lot of work but I've really only been piggybacking on the great work done by <a href="https://github.com/samsonmking/epaper.js">epaper.js</a>.</p><p>Let me show you the integral content of my 'backend' code :</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lengrand.fr/content/images/2021/02/image-28.png"><figcaption>Two lines of code, only calling the epaper.js init</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Yep, the only thing I did was call the epaper.js library and pick the device I am using. (Be careful, in case you use another model of Waveshare display you will have to change that value).</p><p>That is enough for the content of the static folder to be successfully …</p></div></div>

<p>What should you be doing instead of <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog"><u>reading this article</u></a>?</p>



<p>Yeah, we know. You’re probably putting off some kind of work right now.</p>



<p>Procrastination is an age-old struggle — and not just for developers. But people who do knowledge work are especially prone to it, because of how mental blocks can severely impact their work.</p>



<p>So what causes those <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/high-performance-teams"><u>mental blocks</u></a>? Why do we all procrastinate so much? And more importantly, how can we stop procrastinating and just get our work done?</p>



<p>Don’t worry — you still have a few minutes of reading ahead of you before you have to go back to whatever task you’re avoiding. Read on and learn all about what causes procrastination, how to finally beat it, and how developers can use time tracking to up their efficiency even more.</p>



<h2>Why Do Developers Procrastinate?</h2>



<p>Developers aren’t more likely to procrastinate than other people. And when we look at the root causes of procrastination for developers, they’re the same reasons as anyone else.</p>



<p>Contrary to what many believe, procrastination isn’t necessarily the result of a lack of self-discipline. There are a <em>ton</em>&nbsp;of reasons developers (or anyone else) might procrastinate. Let’s look at a few common ones below.<em></em></p>



<h3>Perfectionism</h3>



<p>In knowledge work in particular, many people strive to be perfect. That goes for developers, too — they often strive to write the “perfect” code.</p>



<p>In reality, code that does what it’s supposed to do without bugs is plenty good enough. Striving for perfection has a tendency to make developers put off their work, since they’re trying to achieve an impossible goal.</p>



<h3>Fear of Success</h3>



<p>It may seem counter-intuitive, but fear of success has held back many a knowledge worker. With success comes higher expectations and greater responsibility, and not everyone responds well to that kind of pressure. In this case, procrastination can be a self-sabotaging tool.</p>



<h3>Lack of Planning</h3>



<p>Have you ever shown up to work, sat down at your desk, booted up your computer, and then sat there for a while trying to figure out what to work on? That lack of planning can be a major procrastination driver.</p>



<h3>Not Enough Work</h3>



<p>This is another counter-intuitive sounding reason for procrastination, but it’s real! Some developers procrastinate because they don’t have enough work to do.</p>



<p>When your workdays aren’t filled, it’s easy to get in the habit of coasting — hanging out at your desk surfing social media or reading online articles like this one. And once you’re in the habit, it’s hard to break it even when there <em>is</em>&nbsp;work to do. Hence, procrastination.</p>



<h3>Outdated Technologies</h3>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="970" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/01-Image.jpg" alt="Outdated Technologies" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/01-Image.jpg 2048w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/01-Image-300x142.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/01-Image-1024x485.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/01-Image-768x364.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/01-Image-1536x728.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure>



<p>Software development is a field that requires its workers to stay pretty close to the cutting edge of new technologies. So trying to work with old ones that are outdated, obsolete, or deprecated can be a real challenge for devs, leading them to put off work.</p>



<h3>Organizational Roadblocks</h3>



<p>As much as developers like to put their heads down and get their work done <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/best-places-to-work"><u>without red tape or administrative hurdles</u></a>&nbsp;getting in their way, that’s not how it works at <em>every</em>&nbsp;organization. If the company you work for places organizational roadblocks in your path, that may very well be a contributor to your procrastination habit.</p>



<h3>Unnecessary or “Busy” Work</h3>



<p>Feeling a sense of purpose and accomplishment is important for any worker, which is why it’s common for developers to procrastinate on work that doesn’t seem like it’s contributing to the greater good, like implementation of unnecessary features. The same goes for <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/time-tracking-optional-for-development-teams"><u>tedious or administrative tasks</u></a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;those are easy to put off as well.</p>



<h3>Work You Just Don’t Want to Do</h3>



<p>And finally, there’s work you just don’t want to do. Maybe it’s outside of your wheelhouse. Maybe it feels unnecessary. Maybe it’s too hard, or you’re stuck at a particular blocker. But for all workers, including developers, just not wanting to do a certain task, project, or type of work can easily lead to procrastination.</p>



<h2>How to Stop Procrastinating and Get Work Done</h2>



<p>Identifying the cause of your procrastination can help you determine what you need to do to move past it. But even if you’re not sure why you procrastinate, these tips can help break that habit and get you to get your work done.</p>



<h3>Take Baby Steps</h3>



<p>When you’re putting off a task, the hardest part can be just getting started. So instead of looking at the big picture of all you need to do, just take a small step in the right direction —&nbsp;like telling yourself you only need to work on a task or project for 30 minutes before you take a break to reassess. It can turn an impossible-seeming project into something more doable, and once you get started, it’ll be easier to keep moving.</p>



<h3>Make a Plan</h3>



<p>Remember how lack of planning is a common driver for procrastination? Combat that by going into every workday with a plan. Make it a habit before you leave each night to think about what you need to accomplish the following day, and make yourself a to-do list or a schedule —&nbsp;whatever works to keep you on track.</p>



<h3>Remove Distractions</h3>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="970" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/02-Image.jpg" alt="Remove Distractions" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/02-Image.jpg 2048w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/02-Image-300x142.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/02-Image-1024x485.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/02-Image-768x364.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/02-Image-1536x728.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure>



<p>Have you considered you might procrastinate simply because you’re too distracted to work effectively? Do what you can to cut down on things that might pull you away from your work. For example, you could find a quiet room to work in, or wear noise-canceling headphones. Block social media and other distracting websites from your work computer.</p>



<h3>Isolate Yourself</h3>



<p>If you work in an office with others, another cause for your procrastination might be that people need you for things. And while it’s great to be the go-to person in the office, it’s not ideal for <a href="https://www.7pace.com/blog/developer-productivity-tools"><u>productivity</u></a>.</p>



<p>If you struggle with being pulled away from work by your coworkers, isolate yourself away from others so you appear less available. If you’re not able to go work somewhere without others around, stick a sign to the back of your chair to let people know you’re in deep work mode and don’t want to be interrupted.</p>



<h3>Use a Technique Like Pomodoro</h3>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="970" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Image.jpg" alt="Use a Technique Like Pomodoro" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Image.jpg 2048w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Image-300x142.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Image-1024x485.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Image-768x364.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-Image-1536x728.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure>



<p>The Pomodoro technique has become a common way for all kinds of people to beat their procrastination habits. It works by requiring you to deeply focus on work for a period of time (usually 25 minutes), and then take a short, mandated break (5 minutes or so). You repeat this cycle over and over throughout the workday, alternating focused work with short breaks.</p>



<h3>Take Breaks</h3>



<p>On that note, another possible reason for your procrastination is that you feel tired or worn out —&nbsp;and that can be more easily remedied than you might think. Many of us don’t take enough breaks at work, even though science shows that breaks are necessary and can greatly improve productivity and quality of work. If you’re feeling stuck on a task or project, take a short break and come back to it later.</p>



<h3>Switch Between Tasks</h3>



<p>The same goes for working on the same task for too long. It’s easy to get stuck when you have tunnel vision. So if you feel like you can’t move forward on a particular task, switch to something else for a while. You can always come back to the first task with fresh eyes later, without having wasted any time in the meantime.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Even if you weren’t an early adopter of Slack, you were probably curious about the hype. Why were people so passionate about a work messenger tool? Not that chat tools aren’t sexy, but there must’ve been something else that made Slack so popular.</span></p>
<p><span>The secret? A killer customer acquisition strategy.</span></p>
<p><span>Slack highlighted its unique features, added valuable integrations, and offered its product for free. Combined with word-of-mouth and smart Twitter marketing, Slack was unstoppable, going from </span><a href="https://clickup.com/blog/slack-growth-strategy/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>500,000 users to 1.1M users in the first four months</span></a><span>. Slack’s customer list eventually grew to include the likes of Fortune 100 companies like </span><a href="https://slack.com/about" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Starbucks, Target, Oracle, and ETrade</span></a><span>. In late 2020, </span><a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Slack was acquired</span></a><span> by one of the biggest behemoths in the tech industryä¸€Salesforce.</span></p>
<p><span>Not every startup can go viral like Slack, but getting creative with your customer acquisition strategies can generate some pretty incredible leads. In this post, we share six unusual acquisition methods and the startups that have benefited from them.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em>What is a customer acquisition strategy?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span>Just so we’re all on the same page, let’s take a moment to define customer acquisition. Most people think of customer acquisition as email marketing, SEO, or free trials. But at its core, “customer acquisition” refers to techniques that attract new customers to a business.</span></p>
<p><span>Notice that we said technique</span><b>s</b><span>, plural. People respond to messaging differently and user needs can change with industry trends or economic shifts. For that reason, a comprehensive customer acquisition strategy should include multiple tactics to gain new customers rather than relying on one method alone.</span></p>

<h2><strong>6 unique ways to acquire more customers</strong></h2>
<p><span>Much of customer acquisition is trial and error. What works for some companies doesn’t necessarily work for others. Regardless, brainstorming new customer acquisition strategies is key to keeping your strategy fresh. Below, we share some lesser-known, but fruitful, customer acquisition strategies to attempt this quarter.</span></p>

<h2><strong>1. Give your reviews a review&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://learn.g2.com/consumer-reviews" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>92% of B2B buyers</span></a><span> are more likely to purchase after reading a trusted review. Having just five published reviews can increase </span><a href="https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/online-reviews/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>the likelihood of someone making a purchase by 270%</span></a><span>. That’s nuts!</span></p>
<p><span>Ignoring sites like G2, TrustRadius, and Capterra is irresponsible. Prospects shopping for a B2B tool inevitably come across these sites in their research. If you search for “best project management tool”, Capterra is 5th in organic SERP. When you click on the article, you might expect Asana or Trello to be at the top. Surprisingly, </span><a href="https://www.capterra.com/project-management-software/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>the first result is Monday.com</span></a><span>. This list is sorted by “sponsored products”, but still, this is a fantastic way for Monday.com to get in front of potential buyers.</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/7IKl4W7LR76X3B0mJIHc" alt="undefined"></span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t want to pay to play, start by scouring these sites for reviews and responding to them. Answer as many customer questions as possible, thank people who leave positive reviews, and reply respectfully and constructively to negative reviews. Don’t forget to ask existing customers to post reviews, too. Encourage CSMs or SEs to bring this up in their calls, add a link to post a review in your newsletter, and post your request to write reviews on LinkedIn or Twitter. You’d be surprised how many people comply, especially if you have a great product.</span></p>

<h2><strong>2. Buy your competitors</strong></h2>
<p><span>Most early-stage startups aren’t flush with cash, but buying up a competitor’s domain might be worth it if you have a little to spare. Customers who are looking for something specific usually type in long-tail keywords in search. By buying up websites that rank for those long-tail keywords, you can instantly increase your organic traffic.</span></p>
<p><span>The idea is to come up with a list of websites that land at the top of SERP and approach their owners. When you’re compiling this list, consider specific keyword rankings, organic search traffic, number of pages, number of backlinks, relevancy, audience size, and, of course, price. You might assume that this strategy is extremely expensive, but oftentimes these websites are personal blogs and sell for cheap.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewbarby/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Matthew Barby, VP of Marketing at Hubspot</span></a><span>, cites this strategy as his “#1 favorite tactic to roll out when working on a project with a brand new domain.” In </span><a href="https://www.matthewbarby.com/customer-acquisition-strategies/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>this post</span></a><span>, he outlines a deal where he actually </span><i><span>saved </span></i><span>money buying another domain. Before acquiring the new website, it cost roughly $450 for his company to produce each blog post, and they’d publish 3-4 per month. That really added up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So his team did some sleuthing and found the perfect acquisition target—one that had already published over 500 well-performing articles. He negotiated with the seller to nab the domain at a price that worked out to only $31.70 per article, 7% of the original cost. Besides obtaining that website’s traffic, the company’s posts jumped two pages in search results, on average. Here’s a glimpse of their increase in organic traffic:</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/w1MO6VAvQ6WGcEcfHcuS" alt="undefined" width="766" height="216"></span></p>
<p><span>While this system requires some research and investment, it can really pay off in the long run.</span></p>

<h2><strong>3. Old content is the new content&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span>The Content Marketing Institute found that small businesses (1-99 employees) spent an </span><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2020_B2B_Research_Final.pdf" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>average of $81,500 on content marketing</span></a><span> in 2019. That’s a big chunk of change. Blog posts and case studies do yield leads, but they only get published once...right?</span></p>
<p><span>Wrong. Repurposing content should be a major part of your customer acquisition strategy. Many B2B companies have hundreds of old posts on their site, and the deeper in the architecture posts are, the less likely they are to rank in search results. Make it a consistent practice to revisit old posts and update them with more recent statistics, new keywords, revamped CTAs, and even different titles. Consider merging a few posts to create an entirely new freebie and re-promote refurbished posts in newsletters, social media, or on Medium to attract more backlinks.</span></p>
<p><span>Venture Harbor, a venture studio based in the UK, used this strategy for their article on </span><a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/b2b-lead-generation-strategies/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>B2B lead generation strategies</span></a><span>. The post was long and took a significant amount of time to write. To let it get stale would be a waste! The author updated stats, inserted more compelling images, included more keywords, and added “2021” to the title. As a result, the post now lands in the top 5 Google results for “b2b content generation”:</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/kaR8r9ijSCeOY1shsQw2" alt="undefined" width="634" height="882"></span></p>
<p><span>Venture Harbor’s blog is just one example. Hubspot consistently incorporates this practice into its content strategy and has </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/historical-blog-seo-conversion-optimization" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>increased organic traffic by 105%</span></a><span>. It’s a similar story for Zapier. Updating just 21 posts </span><a href="https://jessicagreene.marketing/blog/updating-website-content/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>drove 52,431 additional visits each month</span></a><span> to the Zapier blog.</span></p>

<h2><strong>4. Create an online academy</strong></h2>
<p><span>Do people understand what your company does and how it can help their business? If you’re selling a complex tool or idea, an online academy can help. Take Segment, for example.</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/pTEt0aBScO8GRBBV1vZx" alt="undefined" width="674" height="438"></span></p>
<p><span>It can be tough to understand what Customer Data Platforms, or CDPs, do from a simple google search. To lower the barrier to entry, Segment created a </span><a href="https://segment.com/academy/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>free online academy</span></a><span> with useful, non-salesy content. Prospects simply enter their email address and receive courses every week on the importance of customer analytics, what goes into a robust marketing stack, and how to make data-driven decisions. The leads generated from the academy are already interested in a CDP and want to learn more, meaning they are likely to be more responsive to sales teams that follow up.</span></p>
<p><span>Plus, the academy makes for great advertising. People who are bullish on the product can quickly send a link to a peer, friend, or boss. The embedded courses explain exactly why Segment would be a good investment. The academy is also helpful from a partnership point of view. If Segment wanted to pursue a reseller agreement with another company, the academy is a low-touch way to teach partners and their sales teams what Segment does and how it might fit into their GTM strategy.</span></p>

<h2><strong>5. Go viral on TikTok</strong></h2>
<p><span>Ok, hear us out. TikTok has </span><a href="https://datareportal.com/social-media-users?rq=tiktok" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>800 million active users</span></a><span>, ranking ahead of LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest, and Snapchat. According to Statista, 29.5% of 20-29-year-olds account for TikTok’s active user base, and </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095186/tiktok-us-users-age/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>adults aged 30-49 make up another 30.3%</span></a><span>. What would happen if you could reach </span><b><i>even a fraction </i></b><span>of those users?</span></p>
<p><span>TikTok is </span><a href="https://medium.com/@kkirt/tiktok-b2b-brands-oh-no-please-no-c091c7af4fb5" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>not the place to advertise your upcoming webinar</span></a><span> or recently published whitepaper. That said, coming up with clever, relatable ways to interact with adults on the app can certainly pique people’s interest. Recruit your most creative teammate to think of outrageous, funny forms of content. Are there common challenges people face when trying to implement a tool in your space? Can you show some behind the scenes footage? Is your product meme-able?</span></p>
<p><span>We don’t yet have an example of a B2B brand doing this well, but a somewhat similar B2C brand, Wikihow, is excelling at this. First, they poked fun of themselves on TikTok, recreating (and encouraging others to recreate) pictures on their site:</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/uxn9GspwSya3I3v8jsh1" alt="undefined" width="606" height="341"></span></p>
<p><span>When COVID hit, they began creating </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MXgLjr7Sms" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>especially relevant how-to content</span></a><span> about the pandemic, like how to wash your hands, how to make masks out of old t-shirts, and how to meditate. So many people gravitated to the Wikihow account that it gained the attention of the United Nations. Now, Wikihow is a </span><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Author/The-Verified-Initiative-of-the-United-Nations" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>part of the Verified Initiative of the United Nations</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/OkL4J70CQ0yitOeYy7Qh" alt="undefined" width="320" height="496"></span></p>

<h2><strong>6. Leverage your NPS survey</strong></h2>
<p><span>Most customer success teams these days send an annual or bi-annual NPS survey to measure customer satisfaction. If your customers already respond well to your NPS survey, there’s something else you might consider adding inä¸€a referral request. Customers already expect to receive this survey and have demonstrated that they’ll answer it. Adding one more question into the mix, “Is there anyone you think could benefit from this product?” can open a lot of doors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t feel comfortable altering your NPS survey, that’s understandable. Other referral campaigns can work well, too. Make sure to incorporate a strong incentive, whether that be a discount, swag, or a certain number of free users. </span><a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Blackbaud</span></a><span>, a software solution …</span></p></div></div>

		  Wouldn't it be nice if more JSON tools supported a truly
		  pretty JSON format? Demand options for truly pretty JSON
		  now! Viva la revolucion!
		</p>
		<p>
		  If only it were that easy. JSON format has become wildly
		  popular over the last decade easily passing XML as the
		  format of choice. For us humans JSON is much easier to read
		  than XML if the JSON is properly formatted. Sadly most tools
		  for viewing or formating JSON seem to be stuck on one of two
		  formats. One format is the single line format and the other
		  is a simple expanded format. There are other options though
		  with some tools.
		</p>
		<p>
		  One tool that offers more options is
		  the <span>oj</span> application
		  which is part of the
		  golang <a href="https://github.com/ohler55/ojg">OjG</a>
		  package. The <span>oj</span>
		  application will be used to illustrate the range of JSON
		  formats from the ugly up to the beauty of pretty
		  JSON. Follow along and try out your favorite JSON sample on
		  each step.

		<p>One Line</p>
		<p>
		  The tight one line JSON format is used when trying to
		  minimize the size of a JSON document. It is the preferred
		  format for transmitting and storing JSON as it takes less
		  bandwidth and less disk space. For viewing, it is hard for
		  the eye to find elements of interests and difficult to
		  determine element boundaries. It has to be the ugliest of
		  all JSON formats.

		  What many packages refer to as pretty is an expanded format
		  where every element and each array and object start are on
		  separate lines. The core
		  golang <code>json.MarshalIndent()</code> function produces
		  an example of this format. The format takes up so much
		  vertical space the example on the right had to be cut off to
		  avoid filling up this article with just large amounts of
		  white space.
		</p>
		<p>
		  With the expanded (pretty?) format it is certainly easier to
		  determine element boundaries but you need a large screen or
		  to be good at scrolling to find what you are looking for. So
		  the expanded format is a step up from the one line format
		  which makes it a bit prettier but it is a weak effort that
		  is not without flaws.

		<p>Sorted Object Keys</p>
		<p>
		  In many implementations JSON objects, whether implemented as
		  a golang map, Ruby Hash, Python dict, or what ever your
		  language of choice uses, the order of object elements is
		  random. That makes it more difficult to visually scan a set
		  of elements and pick out the same keyed element in each JSON
		  object. The brain is good at picking out visual or spacial
		  patterns but if the layout changes each each time there is
		  no pattern to pickup on. A visual scan has to be done,
		  looking at each key until the target is identified. JSON can
		  be made prettier by sorting the JSON object members by
		  element keys.
		</p>
		<p>
		  A sorted expanded format is a step up from just the expanded
		  format but it still suffers from taking up lot of vertical
		  space. If someone was writing the JSON by hand they would
		  probably not elect to expand the JSON to quite the level
		  that most packages or libraries do.

		<p>Human Style</p>
		<p>
		  The ideal pretty JSON pretty is to have the format look like
		  a human had typed it in. Well a pedantic human that didn't
		  make mistakes. Just like Goldilocks, the optimum middle
		  ground between a single line and a fully expanded format is
		  the goal. The
		  algorithm <span>oj</span> uses
		  considers a suggested edge to not exceed and a maximum
		  element depth allowed on a single line. Those two parameters
		  are specified as a float where the whole number part is the
		  edge and the fractional part or the number of 10ths is the
		  maximum depth on a single line. With those two parameters a
		  reasonable human style format can be achieved and the
		  results are looking rather pretty.

		<p>Human Style with Colors</p>
		<p>
		  With the human style formatting the JSON sample is very
		  readable but it can be made prettier. Well at least for
		  those of us than see in color. With the <code>-c</code>
		  option or the <code>-b</code> option the formatted JSON now
		  has colors. While colors do make the output prettier they
		  also make it easier for the eye to discern keys, string,
		  boolean, and numbers more easily. Try it, look at the
		  non-colored JSON and the colored and pick out your preferred
		  color name. Maybe not nirvana but compared to the first, one
		  line format, the colored pretty output is a completely
		  different level.

		<p>Human Style with Colored in the SEN Format</p>

		  Sorted human style with colors is about as good as it gets
		  but what if we deviate from strict JSON format and take a
		  few shortcuts that Javascript and GraphQL allow such as
		  unquoted strings and optional
		  commas. The <a href="https://github.com/ohler55/ojg/blob/develop/sen.md">SEN</a>
		  format is that

		  application supports parsing and encoding in SEN

		  and the reverse is lossless. Getting rid of the extra quotes

When developing a system,
it is important to be able to run the system in its entirety.
<p>
"Run the unit tests" doesn't count.
The complexity of your system is in the interactions between the units.
</p><p>
"Run an individual service against mocks" doesn't count.
A mock will rarely behave identically to the real dependency,
and the behavior of the individual service will be unrealistic.
You need to run the actual system.
</p><p>
"Run an individual service in a shared stateful development environment running all the other services" doesn't count.
A shared development environment will be unreliable as it diverges more and more from the real system.
</p><p>
"Run most services in a mostly-isolated development environment,
calling out to a few hard-to-run external services" doesn't count.
Those few external services on the edge of the mostly-isolated development environment are often the most crucial ones;
without the ability to run modified versions of them, your development process is crippled.
Furthermore, being dependent on external services greatly complicates where and how you can run the system;
it's much harder to, for example, run tests with the system on every commit if that will access external services.
</p><p>
"Run all the services that make up the system in an isolated development environment" counts;
it's the bare minimum requirement.
Bonus points if this can be done completely on localhost,
without using an off-host cluster deployment system.
</p><p>
Without the ability to actually run the entire system in this way while developing,
many evil practices will tend to become common.
</p><ul>
  <li>
    Testing is harder and far less representative,
    and therefore many issues can only be found when changes are deployed to production.
  </li><li>
    In turn, production deployment will cause issues more often,
    and so deployment will be more slow and less frequent.
  </li><li>
    Deploying the system to new environments is more difficult,
    since the developers aren't able to actually run the system.
    Existing practices in production will be cargo-culted and copied around indefinitely,
    even when they are unnecessary or actively harmful.
  </li><li>
    Exploratory usage of the system is very difficult,
    so it will be harder to consider using the system for purposes outside what it was originally developed for,
    and new use cases will become rare.
  </li><li>
    Downstream clients who depend on the system will also suffer all these issues,
    since without the ability to run the upstream system in development,
    they can't run their own entire system, which is a superset of the upstream system.
</li></ul>
Running the entire system during development is the first step to preventing these issues.
Further steps include writing automated tests for the system (which can be run repeatedly during development),
and using, as much as possible, the same code to run the system in development and in production.
<p>
Developers of large or legacy systems that cannot already be run in their entirety during development
often believe that it is impractical to run the entire system during development.
They'll talk about the many dependencies of their system,
how it requires careful configuration of a large number of hosts,
or how it's too complex to get reliable behavior.

In my experience, they're always wrong.
These systems can be run locally during development with a relatively small investment of effort.
Typically, these systems are just ultimately not as complicated as people think they are;
once the system's dependencies are actually known and understood rather than being cargo-culted or assumed,
running the system, and all its dependencies, is straightforward.
</p><p>
Being able to run your entire system during development is just about the most basic requirement for a software project.
It's not, on its own, sufficient for your development practices to be high quality;
but if you can't do this, then you're not even in the running.

    <p>While developing the firmware for Winterbloom's <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux">Castor &amp; Pollux</a>, I got very curious as to just what the Microchip/Atmel-provided linker script was doing.</p>
<p>If you've never heard of or seen a linker script before you're not alone. Most of us never even have to think about them, however, on memory constained embedded devices it's not uncommon to need to modify the default linker script.</p>
<p>The linker script controls how <code>ld</code> combines all of your <code>.o</code> files into a single <code>.elf</code> and how that resulting <code>.elf</code> file gets loaded by the target processor.</p>
<p>So I was staring at this script that made absolutely no sense to me. It's filled with incantations and mysterious symbols and there's no indication of what they're for or where they come from.</p>
<p>So I did a <strong>lot</strong> of research and now I can present to you <strong>the most thoroughly commented linker script</strong><sup id="fnref:probably"><a href="#fn:probably">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can see this script in its entirety, comments and all, on <a href="https://github.com/theacodes/Winterbloom_Castor_and_Pollux/blob/master/firmware/scripts/samd21g18a.ld">GitHub</a>. But if you'd like to read it here instead it's transcribed below.</p>
<h2 id="output-format">Output format</h2>
<p>Output format sets the ELF output format to use a specific BFD backend.</p>
<p>The first is the default BFD. The second and third arguments are used
when big (-EB) or little (-EL) endian is requested.</p>
<p>Since the SAM D series are configured with only little endian support,
"elf32-littlearm" is used across the board. This option seems to be
included by Atmel/Microchip out of an abundance of caution, as
arm-none-eabi-ld will do the right thing and use "elf32-littlearm" by
default.</p>
<p>The list of acceptable values can be obtained using <code>objdump -i</code>.</p>

<p>These variables are used by the following "MEMORY" command to define
the various memory spaces.</p>
<p>For the SAMD21G18A used by this project, the available Flash is
262kB and the available SRAM is 32kB.</p>
<p>This project also reserves 8kB for the bootloader and 1kB for
"non-volatile memory" (NVM) - which is used by the application
to store calibration and user settings.</p>

<p>ARM Cortex-M processors use a descending stack and generally
require stack space to be set aside in RAM.</p>
<p>The application's behavior determines just how much stack space
should be reserved. I generally start with 2kB (0x800) of
stack space for Cortex-M0+ projects programmed in C .</p>
<p>You can analyze stack usage in GCC using the <code>-fstack-usage</code>
flag and you can enable compiler warnings for stack usage
with <code>-Wstack-usage=STACK_SIZE</code>.</p>

<p>This section declare blocks of memories for specific purposes. Since an
ARM's address space is generally split between Flash, SRAM, peripherals,
and other regions, it's necessary to tell the linker where different
types of data can go in the address space.</p>
<p>These blocks will be used in the <code>SECTIONS</code> command below.</p>

</pre>
<p>Start with the Flash memory region. On the SAMD21, Flash starts at
the beginning of the address space (<code>0x00000000</code>) and is contiguous
right up to the size of the Flash. Flash is marked a <code>rx</code> so
that the linker knows that this space is read-only (<code>r</code>) and
executable (<code>x</code>).</p>
<p>The "bootloader" section allows this firmware to work with the uf2
bootloader. The bootloader takes the first 0x2000 bytes of flash
memory.</p>
<p>References:</p>
<ul>

</pre>
<p>Following the bootloader is the flash memory used by the application,
called "rom" here - even though it's flash, the name is just a name
and doesn't carry special meaning.</p>
<p>The total length of the rom block is the MCU's flash size minus the
bootloader's size and any space reserved for "non-volatile memory"
by the application.</p>

</pre>
<p>The "nvm" block is space set aside for the application to store
user settings and calibration data in the MCU's flash.</p>
<p>The block is located right at the end of the flash space. This
is useful because it means that it says in a fixed location
regardless of how much flash space the application takes up
in "rom". Explicitly defining this section also lets the
linker ensure that application code doesn't overwrite the
data in this region.</p>
<p>This block is marked as read-only (<code>r</code>) because flash can not
be written in the same way as normal memory, however, the
application can use the SAMD's NVM peripheral to write data in
this region.</p>

</pre>
<p>The "ram" block is mapped to the CPU's SRAM and it's where
the stack, heap, and all variables will go.</p>
<p>For the SAMD21, SRAM starts at 0x20000000 and is contiguous
for the size of the SRAM.</p>

<h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
<p>The sections command tells the linker how to combine the
input files into an output ELF and where segments belong
in memory.</p>
<p>The linker takes a set of input files containing the "input
sections" and uses this to map them to "output sections"
which are placed in the output ELF file.</p>
<p>While the most important sections to think about here
are the ones that'll be placed into the memory (segments)
some sections are just placed in the output ELF for debugging.</p>

<p>The vector table defines the initial stack pointer and
interrupt/exception routines for the ARM CPU and device
peripherals. Every Cortex-M project needs this.</p>
<p>For the SAM D series the vector table is expected
to be at address 0x00000000 after reset. Since
flash memory starts at 0x00000000, the first values
in flash should be the vector table.</p>
<p>When defining the vector table in code you must use
<code>__attribute__ ((section(".vectors")))</code> to tell
GCC to place the vector table into the section
named ".vectors" in the input object file so that
the linker can find it.</p>
<p>Note that since this project uses the UF2 bootloader,
this actually gets placed at the beginning of the
program's flash area (0x2000). The Cortex-M allows
changing the vector table after initialization,
so the startup script sets the Vector Table Offset
Register (<code>SCB-&gt;VTOR</code>) to <code>_sfixed</code> during its
intialization. The <code>_efixed</code> symbol is unused but
included for completeness.</p>

<p>Include code and read-only data sections from all
input files.</p>
<p>By default, GCC places all program code into a section named
".text" and read-only data (such as const static variables) into
a section named ".rodata" in the input object files. This naming
convention is from the ELF ABI specification.</p>
<p>GCC generates three "flavors" of sections in object files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.{section}</code>: the basic section.</li>
<li><code>.{section}.*</code>: sections generated by <code>-ffunction-sections</code> and
<code>-fdata-sections</code> so that each function/data has a unique
section.</li>
<li><code>.gnu.linkonce.{type}.*</code>: sections generated by GCC so the
linker can remove duplicates. Seems to be related to
Vague Linking.</li>

When evaluating a new tool, the developer experience matters as much as the offered features.&nbsp;</p><p>This post aims to help you identify key factors to look for, how that might reflect on the project, and how well it will meet your expectations.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Onboarding and Getting Started</strong></h2><p>If you are learning about a new tool, then the getting started guide for any project is typically the first document you read.&nbsp;</p><p>A bad experience with it is likely to put any casual reader off of investigating further. First impressions matter, so below are four factors to look for when evaluating the getting started experience for documentation.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Self-serve option available</strong></h3><p>Trying the time-honored “getting started guide” is typically the first point of call for developers assessing a new technical tool. There are some tools (especially in the SaaS world) that rely on onboarding you through a front end first and taking you through the first steps from there instead.</p><p>In either case, prioritize tools that allow you to create an account and test yourself without the need to make an appointment with a sales representative or fill in excessive forms.&nbsp;</p><p>There might be some valid reasons for doing this, such as a private beta or that the project is new. But often, it’s purely to force you through a sales process and bombard you with sales messages. This isn’t directly related to documentation, but often you also can’t view documentation until you are through this process, which makes it hard to evaluate at all.</p><h3><strong>Time to getting started</strong></h3><p>If you evaluate multiple options, then how long it takes you to follow a getting started guide from the beginning to a satisfactory conclusion is one measure to measure by.&nbsp;</p><p>While the real time can depend a lot on the tutorial’s complexity, for comparable tools or guides, a shorter time is a good sign that the team has spent time reducing barriers, testing steps, and checking that the language they used is clear.</p><h3><strong>Real-world examples</strong></h3><p>Getting started guides tend to focus on simplicity and speed. Often this is intentional to make a tool appear “easy” to use. However, if the examples and steps the guide follows are unrealistic for any “real world” use case for the tool, then is it a good getting started guide?</p><h3><strong>Dependencies and Prerequisites</strong></h3><p>Certain programming languages are notorious for having deep and complex dependency trees. This means that a project might leverage code from a 3rd party (which is common), but then that tool also has its dependencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Following a getting started guide should not have to take you down a complex path of conflicting dependency versions or surprising undocumented prerequisites you have to figure out. This can show that the developers or writers of the documentation have not tested examples from scratch on a “vanilla” new user set up.</p><p>Ideally, a project should work with the most popular or most supported (and <a href="https://itsfoss.com/long-term-support-lts/">LTS</a>, for example) versions of languages and operating systems. If they don’t, it can show a lack of meaningful commitment to development or specific platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>At the least, the documentation should state which versions you need and a rough idea of when to expect support for newer or more popular versions.</p><h2><strong>Continuing the journey</strong></h2><p>A great getting started guide is a big plus for any project you are evaluating, but rarely does a getting started guide help you apply anything to a real-world production application.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the hardest parts of creating documentation is taking a reader on this crucial journey, and it’s generally where most people get frustrated with documentation. Some projects have a much clearer and defined use case than others (for example, a payment API versus a CMS), but there are some general things to look for.</p><p>A good getting started guide should suggest common pages or paths for you to follow next. These could be generic, such as key components of the tool, finding further information on a feature, or following typical use cases based on user research. It’s near impossible for documentation to suit every possible use you might have, but it can help you assemble the knowledge you need.</p><h2><strong>Code examples</strong></h2><p>Not wanting to disappoint anyone reading this who writes documentation, but it’s an adage that developers often don’t read the documentation thoroughly but rather scan for code examples. Good documentation is structured to ensure that important text surrounds code examples, so there is more chance you notice it.</p><p>Code examples are often a source of annoyance for anyone reading documentation, and I’m sure you have come across one that is incomplete or doesn’t work.</p><p>There are different types of code examples, and in each case, their purpose should be clear.</p><p>Some code examples are part of a tutorial or guide, and we expect the reader to follow them in order and build a full piece of code that works as expected. In these cases, the examples should tell you all you need to know and not leave anything to assumption to result in a working example.</p><p>Some code examples are illustrative to show a concept or implementation detail, which means they do not work without replacing placeholder values or extra code. Documentation should make these clear and suggest what you need to do to make them usable.</p><p>While not always necessary, documentation should explain or show you the expected output for code examples, so you know that you have implemented it successfully.</p><p>Finally, if a project supports multiple programming languages or implementation options, then the documentation should show code examples for all of these. However, this is a lot of work, but examples for the most widely used options are essential, and guidance on using the other supported options enough.</p><h2><strong>Reference - SDK and API documentation</strong></h2><p>Filling in the documentation gaps is generally the role of reference documentation, which includes <a href="https://humanitec.com/blog/api-design-developer-experience">API endpoint and function documentation</a>, architecture explanations, and other aspects of the project readers might find useful to know if they need to.</p><p>Firstly, is reference documentation available, or do you need to dig through the codebase to find it? If it does exist, how complete or useful is it? Often teams autogenerate reference documentation, and that’s fine, but often descriptions come from code comments, and code comments are not always useful to a reader.&nbsp;</p><p>Reference documentation can be more abstract than other documentation as it describes individual pieces of a project instead of how to use them. However, good reference documentation still explains what that piece is and how it works. Below you find an excellent example.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/6023d59ff38a1ca95194dac2_fwHv1JPLySGuL3x-MsQM8fo9jSQXt7_6cy_dpa4XYC0hbVaFivRkKmXRLCJcHbyLZ12kmRxtQlmEbqI7V8jK4pAgGZE4_V0DeY1m1hr4UTM-EP2hT_piRUjG5o_jYTxXARVD0Z4l.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-sdk/references/lisk-elements/cryptography.html#stringtobuffer">Lisk SDK documentation</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>The <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">Stripe API documentation</a> is a common example of useful and usable autogenerated (but using highly customized tooling) API documentation. Not wanting to publicly shame any project, this tweet from Ricardo Ferreira sums up the problem with documentation generated from comments perfectly.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Language</strong></h2><p>Good language is a big topic, and it doesn’t necessarily affect the quality of a project. It can show that the team behind it goes the extra mile to care, which is a good sign.</p><p>Acceptable documentation should be free of spelling mistakes and other typographical errors. Excellent documentation should use a consistent voice, terminology, and style. What constitutes “correct” in these cases is personal and opinionated, but consistency is key.</p><p>There are a handful of popular and commonly used style guides, such as the <a href="https://developers.google.com/style/">Google</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/">Microsoft</a> style guides. Whether that documentation follows one of these style guides over another, or its own custom style guide is not what’s important. However, if a company follows a style guide, it shows they have given that extra thought and care to their documentation.</p><h2><strong>Bonus points</strong></h2><p>These discussion points don’t quite fit into any of the sections above but show that a team has an extra eye for detail.</p><p>How does the documentation look? Something that looks fantastic and uses the latest tricks in web development may not equal useful and useable documentation, but if it’s both of those, then even better.</p><p>How often is the documentation updated? There are some good reasons for not updating documentation regularly, such as an older project or problem-free documentation, but it can also indicate a dormant project that’s best avoided.<br></p><h2>Good documentation shows a team cares</h2><p>We all know that documentation is hard, especially for solo developers or smaller teams who also need to focus on features and bug fixes. However, when there are many options to choose from when evaluating new tools, frameworks, and services, and sometimes weighing them up on features alone is inconclusive. Therefore, the documentation’s developer experience matters.</p><p>Good developer experience and documentation indicate how much a team and community involved with a project care about their users. More importantly, it indicates how much work could be involved in implementing projects you are evaluating.&nbsp;</p><p>If tutorials are poorly written, or don’t make sense. If code examples don’t work, or important details are lacking. Will you find similar problems and a lack of concern in a project after investing your time and business in it?<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In 1991 Guido van Rossum released the first version of the Python programming language. About that time the world began to witness a major change in how computer systems represent written language. The internalization of the Internet increased the demand to support different writing systems, and the Unicode Standard was developed to meet this demand. Unicode defined a universal character set able to represent any written language, various non-alphanumeric symbols and, eventually, emoji 😀. Python wasn't designed with Unicode in mind, but it evolved towards Unicode support during the years. The major change happened when Python got a built-in support for Unicode strings – the <code>unicode</code> type that later became the <code>str</code> type in Python 3. Python strings have been proven to be a convenient way to work with text in the Unicode age. Today we'll see how they work behind the scenes.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>The scope of this post</h2>
<p>This post doesn't try to cover all aspects of text encoding in relation to Python. You see, programming language designers have to make several text encoding decisions because they have to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to talk to the external world (the encodings of command-line parameters, environment variables, standard streams and the file system).</li>
<li>How to read the source code (the encoding of source files).</li>
<li>How to represent text internally (the encoding of strings).</li>
</ul>
<p>This post focuses on the last problem. But before we dive into the internals of Python strings, let's briefly discuss the problem of text encoding on a real life example and clarify what Unicode really is.</p>
<h2>The essence of text encoding</h2>
<p>You see this text as a sequence of characters rendered by your browser and displayed on your screen. I see this text as the same sequence of characters as I type it into my editor. In order for us to see the same thing, your browser and my editor must be able to represent the same set of characters, that is, they must agree on a <strong>character set</strong>. They also need to choose some, possibly different, ways to represent the text internally to be able to work with it. For example, they may choose to map each character to a unit consisting of one or more bytes and represent the text as a sequence of those units. Such a mapping is usually referred to as a <strong>character encoding</strong>. A character encoding is also crucial for our communication. Your browser and my web server must agree on how to <strong>encode</strong> text into bytes and <strong>decode</strong> text from bytes, since bytes is what they transmit to talk to each other.</p>
<p>The character set that your browser and my editor use is Unicode. Unicode is able to represent English as well as any other written language you can think of (文言, Čeština, Ελληνικά, עברית, हिन्दी), 日本語, Português, Русский) and thousands of miscellaneous symbols (₤, ⅐, ↳, ∭, ⌘, , ♫, 👨🏼‍💻, 🍺) . My web server sends this text as a part of the HTML page in the UTF-8 encoding. You browser knows which encoding was used to encode the text because the <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header declares the encoding:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
</pre></div>


<p>Even if you save this HTML page locally, your browser will still be able to detect its encoding because the encoding is specified in the HTML itself:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>html</span> <span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>meta</span> <span>charset</span><span>=</span><span>"utf-8"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This may seem absurd to you. How can a browser decode the HTML to read the encoding if it doesn't know the encoding yet? This is usually not a problem in practice because the beginning of an HTML page contains only ASCII characters and most encodings used on the web encode ASCII characters in the same way. Check out the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#concept-encoding-confidence">HTML standard</a> to learn more about the algorithm that browsers use to determine the encoding.</p>
<p>Note that the HTTP header and the HTML metatag specify "charset", i.e. a character set. This may seem confusing since UTF-8 is not a character set. What they really specify is a character encoding. The two terms are often used interchangeably because character encodings typically imply a character set of the same name. For example, the ASCII character encoding implies the ASCII character set. The Unicode Standard fixes the terminology by giving precise definitions to all important terms. We'll study them, but before, let's discuss why and how the Unicode project began.</p>
<h2>The road to Unicode</h2>
<p>Before the adoption of Unicode, most computer systems used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> character encoding that encodes a set of 128 characters using a 7-bit pattern to encode each character. ASCII was sufficient to deal with English texts but that's about it. Other character encodings were developed to support more languages. Most of them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_ASCII">extended ASCII</a> to 256 characters and used one byte to encode each character. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859">ISO 8859</a> standard defined a family of 15 such character encodings. Among them were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Latin Western European ISO 8859-1 (German, French, Portuguese, Italian, etc.)</li>
<li>Central European ISO 8859-2 (Polish, Croatian, Czech, Slovak, etc.)</li>
<li>Latin/Cyrillic ISO 8859-5 (Russian, Serbian, Ukrainian, etc.)</li>
<li>Latin/Arabic ISO 8859-6</li>
<li>Latin/Greek ISO 8859-7.</li>
</ul>
<p>Multi-lingual software had to handle many different character encodings. This complicated things a lot. Another problem was to choose the right encoding to decode text. Failing to do so resulted in a garbled text known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake">mojibake</a>. For example, if you encode the Russian word for mojibake "кракозябры" using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOI8-R">KOI-8</a> encoding and decode it using ISO 8859-1, you'll get "ËÒÁËÏÚÑÂÒÙ".</p>
<p>The problems with different character encodings are not gone completely. Nevertheless, it became much more easier to write multi-lingual software nowadays. This is due to two independent initiatives that began in the late 1980s. One was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Coded_Character_Set">ISO 10646</a>, an international standard, and the other was Unicode, a project organized by a group of software companies. Both projects had the same goal: to replace hundreds of conflicting character encodings with a single universal one that covers all languages in widespread use. They quickly realized that having two different universal character sets wouldn't help achieve the goal, so in 1991 the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) defined by ISO 10646 and Unicode's character set were unified. Today the projects define essentially the same character encoding model. Nevertheless, both continue to exist. The difference between them is that the Unicode Standard has a greater scope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The assignment of characters is only a small fraction of what the Unicode Standard and its associated specifications provide. The specifications give programmers extensive descriptions and a vast amount of data about the handling of text, including how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>divide words and break lines </li>
<li>sort text in different languages </li>
<li>format numbers, dates, times, and other elements appropriate to different locales </li>
<li>display text for languages whose written form flows from right to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew </li>
<li>display text in which the written form splits, combines, and reorders, such as for the languages of South Asia </li>
<li>deal with security concerns regarding the many look-alike characters from writing systems around the world</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important thing that we need to understand about Unicode is how it encodes characters.</p>
<h2>Unicode basics</h2>
<p>Unicode defines <strong>characters</strong> as smallest components of written language that have semantic value. This means that such units as diacritical marks are considered to be characters on their own. Multiple Unicode characters can be combined to produce what visually looks like a single character. Such combinations of characters are called <strong>grapheme clusters</strong> in Unicode. For example, the string "á" is a grapheme cluster that consists of two characters: the Latin letter "a" and the acute accent "´". Unicode encodes some grapheme clusters as separate characters as well, but does that solely for compatibility with legacy encodings. Due to combining characters, Unicode can represent all sorts of grapheme clusters such as "ä́" and, at the same time, keep the character set relatively simple.</p>
<p>Unicode characters are abstract. The standard doesn't care about the exact shape a character takes when it's rendered. The shape, called a <strong>glyph</strong>, is considered to be a concern of a font designer. The connection between characters and glyphs can be quite complicated. Multiple characters can merge into a single glyph. A single character can be rendered as multiple glyphs. And how characters map to glyphs can depend on the context. Check out the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr17/#CharactersVsGlyphs">Unicode Technical Report #17</a> for examples.</p>
<p>Unicode doesn't map characters to bytes directly. It does the mapping in two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>coded character set</strong> maps characters to code points.</li>
<li>A <strong>character encoding form</strong>, such as UTF-8, maps code points to sequences of code units, where each code unit is a sequence of one or more bytes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Unicode coded character set is what we usually mean when we say Unicode. It's the same thing as the UCS defined by ISO 10646. The word "coded" means that it's not actually a set but a mapping. This mapping assigns a code point to each character in the character set. A <strong>code point</strong> is just an integer in the range [0, 1114111], which is written as U+0000..U+10FFFF in the Unicode hexadecimal notation and is called a <strong>code space</strong>. The current Unicode 13.0 assigns code points to 143,859 characters.</p>
<p>Technically, the coded character set is a <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/">collection of entries</a>. Each entry defines a character and assigns a code point to it by specifying three pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the code point value</li>
<li>the name of the character; and</li>
<li>a representative glyph.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the entry for the letter "b" looks like this: (U+0062, LATIN SMALL LETTER B, b).</p>
<p>The standard also specifies various character properties such as whether the character is a letter, a numeral or some other symbol, whether it's written from left-to-right or from right-to-left and whether it's an …</p></div></div>

									<p>When you watch documentaries about early computer innovations, particularly the late 70s, early 1980s, most of the documentaries tend to focus on Apple and Microsoft, and maybe IBM as the big innovators. But, I think often companies like Commodore, and Atari, and Tandy don’t get nearly enough credit for the role that they played.&nbsp; Let’s take a look at the Commodore PET!</p>
<p>Most of my readers are familiar with the Commodore 64, one of the best selling computers of all time. Well renowned for its great graphics and sound, but Commodore history didn’t start with this machine. So, let’s go back a little bit to the late 1970s and figure out where it all started!</p>

<h2>The Processor that Started it All</h2>
<p>It all began in 1974 when Chuck Peddle and a group of engineers started up a chip fabrication company called MOS Technology. Most of these guys had worked at Motorola on the 6800 processor, and so they set out to develop a compatible CPU known as the 6501 that could simply be substituted for the much more expensive Motorola CPU. As you might imagine, Motorola sued and to make a long story short, the 6502 was born, which was pretty much the same chip but changed just enough that it was no longer completely compatible with the 6800.</p>

<p>Since the chip was no longer compatible with the 6800, customers would need some way to test the chip. In 1976 Chuck Peddle also designed the KIM-1 development computer. This was a single board computer that used the 6502, and could be programmed in machine language from the keypad on the top. However, later it was possible to connect a dumb-terminal display and actually run BASIC. Programs could be saved to a cassette tape. The computer proved to be popular with hobbyists as well as engineers.</p>
<p>The 6502 would go on to be a huge success and eventually found its way into the Apple II series, the Atari 2600, the Nintendo Entertainment System, the entire line of Atari 8-Bit computers, the BBC Micro, and of course the entire line of Commodore 8-Bit machines. But back to 1976 for the moment. MOS Technologies was bought up by Commodore Business Machines, who at this point was primarily in the calculator business. Chuck Peddle managed to convince Commodore boss Jack Tramiel that calculators were a dead-end business and that they needed to produce a computer to compete with the upcoming Apple II.</p>
<h2>The MOS Technology KIM-1</h2>
<p>In 1977 the Commodore PET 2001 was born, using much of the same design as the KIM-1. Much like the Apple II, the PET was all inclusive, having an integrated monitor, keyboard, and cassette tape storage device. 1977 was a big year for the personal computer revolution. With the market introduction of the big 3, the Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80 computer, it was the first time that a regular person could buy an affordable computer without having to assemble it themselves.</p>

<p>The cool thing about the PET is that it was actually designed by the same guy who designed the 6502 processor. If you look at the prices of the big 3, you’ll see the PET was competitively priced. Although the Apple II did have superior hardware, which we’ll get into shortly, the PET did have the advantage that it came with a monitor and tape drive, where the Apple II required those as separate purchases.</p>
<h2>A Closer Look at the PET</h2>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the design of the Commodore PET. The first thing I want to draw your attention to is the keyboard. It’s insane, and it will drive you insane if you actually try to type on it. One thing that isn’t communicated well by video and pictures is just how small this keyboard is. The main part, excluding the number pad measures just 6in. by 2.75in. Just to put that into perspective, my iPhone 6 will essentially cover the entire keyboard. The Apple mini keyboard is actually huge by comparison.</p>

<p>The keyboard size isn’t the only problem. They layout is crazy. While the keys are technically in a QWERTY arrangement, normally the rows are offset creating diagonal lines. Not so on the PET. They are squared up. The weirdness doesn’t end there. The space bar is tiny! Normally you would expect numbers across the top row of keys, but there aren’t any. Instead you have just symbols. If you want to type a number, you have to use the number pad.</p>

<p>What is even more infuriating is the symbols. For example, if I want to type a Dollar sign or a number sign, I would instinctively press shift before the key. However, when I do that I wind up with a totally different character instead of the one I wanted. Then there’s the cursor keys. Notice that there are only 2 of them. One key cursors down, and the other key cursors right. If you want to reverse that, you have to hold down the shift key. So by using the combination of the cursor keys and shift you can cursor anywhere on the screen.&nbsp; The little back arrow? You might think that’s a backspace key. But, it’s not. It actually prints that character on the screen, and so when you make a mistake, and believe me you will, you’re going to go to push this key and it’s not going to fix your mistake and you’re going to go even more insane than you were before. The actual delete key is all the way over at the other side of the number pad.</p>
<p>To be fair, when this computer came out in 1977, most of the customers had never even used a personal computer before or a computer of any kind and so they didn’t have any pre-conceptions for what a keyboard layout should be – like we do today. It probably wasn’t quite as weird for them as it would be for us.</p>
<h2>Opening the Commodore PET</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look inside the PET, it opens like the cab of a semi truck, and even gives you a little kick stand to hold it open. Looking at these 16 RAM chips, you might think the PET came with a lot of RAM. But, you’d be wrong. The original PET only came with 4K of RAM. These are 1K by 4-bit static RAM chips. Being that cost was such a consideration for this computer, you might be wondering why they didn’t use the cheaper dynamic RAM, or DRAM? Well, static ram was and still is today much more expensive than dynamic RAM. However, DRAM has one drawback, it requires that it is refreshed every so often, which requires additional circuitry to handle that. When you’re dealing with only 4K, it actually ended up being cheaper just to use static RAM.</p>

<p>OK. So 4K is a ridiculously small amount or RAM, but it’s worse than that because the operating system actually needs at least 1K of that, leaving about 3K left over for the user. So how much is 3K of RAM? Well, the screen on the pet is 40-characters by 25-lines, meaning you need 1,000 bytes of RAM, or almost an entire kilobyte just to store one screen full of text. Essentially you had enough RAM for about 3 screens of text! To be fair though, the Apple II and TRS-80 only had 4K when they came out as well.</p>

<p>This particular PET has been upgraded a little daughter board. It’s an aftermarket 32K RAM expansion module, and that’s why it shows 31K available to BASIC on the boot screen. Let’s take a closer look at this cassette drive. This was actually just an off-the-shelf cassette recorder that Commodore bought and slightly modified. You can see the whole unit is actually mounted, in a rather clunky way in my opinion. The cassette drive was really the only storage device available for the PET at first. And with 4K of RAM, this wasn’t much of a problem.</p>
<h2>The PET Disk Drives</h2>
<p>It wasn’t until 1979 that Commodore came out with a matching disk drive. Since the PET was never really designed to use a disk drive, they decided to use the IEEE-488 parallel port as a means to connect the disk drive.&nbsp; Unlike the Apple II, the Commodore PET has no card slots inside so there’s nowhere to add a floppy disk controller card. So, what they had to do was essentially design an entire computer inside the floppy drive unit, which would handle controlling the floppy drives as well as an entire disk operating system.</p>

<p>Indeed if you take a look inside the disk drive, you’ll see it’s quite sophisticated, having it’s own 6502 processor, RAM, ROM, and I/O controllers. The PET didn’t really interact with information on the disks directly, rather it would send commands to the disk drive, such as telling it to fetch a file, and then the disk drive would take care of all of the work of finding the right data on the disk. In fact, it could even copy files or even entire disks from one drive to the other all by itself, just with a single command.</p>
<p>The PET was popular with schools and found its way into many computer labs. And while the disk drive was expensive, one of these floppy drive units could actually be connected to multiple PETs at the same time, thus saving space and money. In fact, you can see this arrangement being used in this photo from a computer lab where each table has 8 PETs connected to a single floppy drive and printer.</p>

<h2>The Commodore PET’s Display</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about the screen on the PET. The original model here is black and white. A lot of people assume it’s green, but that actually wasn’t until later models. The original one was black and white. In fact, there’s not even any grayscale. It’s just literally two colors, black and white. The screen was controlled by a clone of the Motorola 6845 CRT controller, which was also used in the IBM CGA card, among other computers. However, there was no circuitry here for color.</p>

<p>There are also no graphics modes. I mean, literally <em>none</em>. There is no way to put graphics on this machine at all. And what’s worse is that the character set is in ROM and it cannot be moved, so there’s no way to modify what the characters look like. So, you are pretty much stuck with putting characters on the screen and only the characters that came built into ROM. And that’s it.</p>

    <p>I often get the question how I got into game development and if I have any tips for beginners. Here’s my story and thoughts about getting into game development.</p>


<p>I’ve never been particularly interested in playing games myself. I never had a gaming console as a kid, but ever since I was very young I’ve had a strong interest in engineering and technology. My early interest in computers was entirely centered around programming, and not playing games.</p>

<p>I somehow convinced my parents to get me a Commodore VIC 64, because that was what one of my friends had. I’m not sure how old I was, but I must have been eleven or twelve. Back then, the printed manual for a computer was an introduction to programming (BASIC, in this case). When turning the computer on, there was a prompt where you could start programming. Overall, the bar to enter programming was way lower than now. No choice of programming language, no game engine, no downloading and installing stuff, you just turned the computer on and could instantly start programming (like, literally instantly, the interpreter was burnt into a ROM chip).</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2021-02-22-vic64.jpg"><img src="https://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2021-02-22-vic64.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Programming languages sucked, performance was terrible and debuggers non-existent. If you made an error, the computer froze and you had to turn it off and back on again and start over. It was frustrating, tedious and very unintuitive, but at the same time an excellent introduction to how computers work. In order to put a sprite on the screen, you had no choice but to map out each pixel on paper, learn binary numbers, convert that to decimal and load it into a specific memory address. Since there were no tools, everything was cumbersome, but at the same time, everything also seemed within reach without having to learn that much. There was only one way to do things – the hard way.</p>

<p>A few years later I upgraded to a Commodore Amiga 1000 and a whole new world opened up. This was much more similar to computers as we know them today, with a proper desktop, multi-tasking, a file system, etc. It shipped with a programming language (AmigaBASIC), but for some reason I never really got into it. Instead, I got introduced to the AMOS programming language, which I remember as an absolutely fantastic environment for learning to make games. It had a lot of built-in functionality for doing the most basic things, like loading images, playing sounds, drawing lines, etc. It also had the ability to execute inline assembly code which made it very powerful.</p>

<p>Getting better at programming and learning the hardware I got more and more comfortable programming directly in assembly language instead of AMOS and finally swithed over to using AsmOne as my default programming environment. In retrospect this was a terrible move, because writing everything in assembly language is overly complicated compared to using something like C and just use with assembly were needed. I think this poor decision was mostly because I simply didn’t know that C existed, nor how to combine it with assembly. Remember that this was before the Internet was a thing, so the only knowledge you had access to was through your friends and good dose of curiosity and trial-and-error.</p>


<p>There were no game educations available in Sweden at the time, and I’m not sure I would have chosen one even if there was. At this point I had not decided on a career in game development, maybe because game development wasn’t really seen as a career option at all, so I went for a more traditional engineering program – Master of Science in Media Technology at Linköping University. This is where I first got in contact with object oriented programming through Java and later C++. I took classes in linear algebra, data structures, 3D rendering, physical modelling and animation, physics, acoustics, etc. It was definitely a good foundation for a game developer, even though this wasn’t a game centric education.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2021-02-22-imp.jpg"><img src="https://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2021-02-22-imp.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>It was at university I developed a passion for game physics. I can’t remember exactly what caught my attention, but I wrote my first rigid body simulator in 1998, inspired by the papers on impulse based dynamics by Brian Mirtich. At this time physics was rarely seen in video games. The only one I remember studying intensely was Carmageddon 2, which featured incredibly sophisticated rigid body simulation for a game at that time. My first simulator was written in Java, with collision detection in C through the JNI interface. It was later rewritten in C++ and featured a wrecking ball machine at a building site.</p>


<p>For the final exam project at Linköping University I decided to make a game physics SDK with Marcus Lysén. It never really reached a usable state, but was enough to encourage us to form a company around it and develop it further. We teamed up with Jonas Lindqvist and founded Meqon Research. Around the same time, other physics SDKs started popping up. The first verison of Havok got released. Mathengine was already on the market, and there was Ipion (mostly known for being used in half-life 2), PhysX by Novodex, and the open source project ODE. Even though I wouldn’t admit it at the time, we had the weakest product, no experience and no money, but somehow we managed to release the Meqon SDK a few years later and got a couple of customers. Most notably 3D Realms licensed our technology for Duke Nukem Forever, which gave us the confidence and credibility to push forward and grow the team to about a dozen people. All in all a very fun and intense period of my career, but completely unsustainable, stressful and unhealthy.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2021-02-22-meqon.jpg"><img src="https://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2021-02-22-meqon.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>In 2005, Meqon was acquired by AGEIA and the whole team was integrated into the PhysX machinery. I worked as one of three software architects and got the chance to work with some incredibly talented people across the world, many of them I’m still in contact with today. This was a fantastic journey and undoubtedly an important cornerstone of my career. The people I worked with at AGEIA also influenced my coding style in a very important way. Coming from an academic, object oriented programming background, I started to question everything when I got in contact with experienced game developers who routinely rejected most of that in favor of a more direct C-like programming style that I slowly started adopting myself and still use today.</p>

<p>I left AGEIA in 2007, just before they got acquired by NVIDIA to work on scientific visualization. At this point I also started working on my own C++ framework to use for future projects. It wasn’t a game engine, but more of a low level framework with the functionality needed to make a game engine, such as vector math, file IO, compression, geometry, input, audio, rendering, scripting, etc. Creating your own tech was already at the time considered doomed to failure (even more so today), but doing it was a lot of fun and was undoubtedly an important key decision in my career. With a programming framework that I wrote from scratch, thus knowing inside out, I could very quickly implement new ideas and projects on top of that without ever running into any limitations.</p>

<p>One of the first projects I created with the new framework was Dresscode, a game engine profiling tool that I later sold to RAD Game Tools (now reworked into a product called Telemetry). Even if the framework has been rewritten and improved upon in several iterations, I’m still using it today for almost everything I do.</p>


<p>Up until this point I never really made an actual, released game, but that changed in 2010, when I teamed up with Henrik Johansson (one of the people I hung out with in the Amiga days) and founded Mediocre. Going from game technology and middleware to making actual games was equal parts fun and frustration. I had no experience with game design, but started appreciate it more than I thought I would. An interesting thing to note here is that both Henrik I had very little interest in playing games. We were not gamers, which I think is quite unusual for game developers, but it is my firm belief that playing games is orthogonal to being successful at making them. There are great developers who play a lot of games and there are great developers who never play games. Playing a lot of games is not a bad thing, but it does not make you good at making them, it makes you good at playing them (and this probably applies to a lot more than game development).</p>

<p>We did our first game, Sprinkle, as a part-time project while still doing contract work on the side to sustain our living and I think this was a really wise decision which allowed us to experiment and iterate on the game design to find something unique, with no real time pressure. It also allowed us to spend that extra time polishing the game prior to release.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2021-02-22-sprinkle.jpg"><img src="https://blog.tuxedolabs.com/assets/2021-02-22-sprinkle.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>I think the primary reason Sprinkle became successful was because we found something uniqe, but as always it’s hard to pinpoint one single factor. We had good timing, both because the App Store and mobile gaming in general was still young, and not very exploited, but also because there was a general interest in indie games at the time. Previous connections from NVIDIA and Meqon also contributed to getting us introduced to Apple and Google prior to release, thus increasing our chances of getting featured.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more to the story, including the other Mediocre games and everything that led up to Teardown, but I think I’ll stop here, since at this point I’m already a full-time indie game developer.</p>


<p>For learning programming and game development today I don’t really feel like I’m in a position to give beginner advice, because the conditions today are so different from when I started, but for programming in particular, it is my firm belief that experience is the most important factor. Write a lot of code and you’ll eventually get good at it. A good way to do this is to find a way to enjoy it rather than just trying to learn it. My career took a giant leap when I finally embraced that and focused on what I love the most – doing …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Recognizing these peaks and troughs allows me to identify when my internal reactions perhaps are a little irrational and don't need externalizing. When the whole crew does this, it leads to a calmer and easier living situation.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5901517.1612473248!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/dr-nick-smith.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5901517.1612473248!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/dr-nick-smith.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5901517.1612473248!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/dr-nick-smith.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5901517.1612473248!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-nick-smith.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5901517.1612473248!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/dr-nick-smith.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5901517.1612473248!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-nick-smith.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Dr. Nick Smith, left, and pictured with his predecessor, medical doctor Stijn Thoolen.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Nick Smith/ESA/IPEV/PNRA)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Being apart from my partner and loved ones naturally has an impact but knowing that it is impossible to see them has a special significance. The hardest thing is knowing that if something does happen at home, I will not be able to return to offer support or help.</p>  <p>I've come to realize the importance of routine. Having the same get-up times and some structure helps me plan my research and free time.</p>  <p><strong>What has helped you cope personally with the isolation?</strong></p>  <p>I found that given the abundance of time, taking time to do things properly, calmly and to think about them before I do them has been very helpful.

Keeping regular contact with them in private and group chats and regular video calls has been a major help.</p>  <p>Being honest and talking about my feelings here has a therapeutic effect of its own — both with the crew and my loved ones.

It allows me to compare my thoughts and feelings to those during a normal time and to gain some perspective on how I'm feeling — a comparison to a sort of baseline. It also helps me know when to seek support, which is crucial.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Keeping a diary has been useful not just for this, but also later in life, it [will give] an interesting insight to a unique experience.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Are there any hobbies or interests that have helped you?</strong></p>  <p>I find reading to be really helpful. It takes you out of reality for a moment and gives you time to use your imagination.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I personally enjoy computer games. I downloaded one before I left that is essentially infinite so [it] provides me with constant entertainment and a way to be creative. However, it's not an active hobby so it has to be balanced with exercise or activity.</p>    <p>I have an exercise routine here with another chap on my crew, which is essential for me — both the routine and the exercise. You don't have to look far to find the benefits of exercise on mental health, and having routine in isolation is a good way of giving yourself structure. Doing it with exercise is a great way to kill two birds with one stone.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Planning for special occasions and making an effort to mark occasions is a good way of giving yourself something to look forward to. For example, we have celebrated the start of our winter as a crew, and we look forward to crew birthdays, the first sunset, midwinter, first sunrise, summer crew returning, etc.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH&nbsp;| European Space Agency: Isolation in Antarctica</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOVjs_zNNwc" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <hr>  <p><strong>If you were talking to someone directly right now who's having a difficult time with isolation during the pandemic, what would you say to them?</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Reflect on how you're feeling and be honest with yourself.

                        <h4>Saving the world with Bayesian modeling</h4>
                    
                    <p>After I left Quantopian in 2020, something interesting happened: various companies contacted me inquiring about
consulting to help them with their PyMC3 models.</p>
<p>Usually, I don't hear how people are using <a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">PyMC3</a> -- they mostly show up on
<a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://discourse.pymc.io/">Discourse</a> when something isn't working
right. So, hearing about all these really cool projects was quite exciting. However, I couldn't possibly take all of
these projects on by myself.</p>
<p>Thus, it was time to assemble a team of the most badass Bayesian modelers the world had ever seen -- the Bayesian
Avengers, if you will. Fortunately, I did not have to venture far, as PyMC3 had already attracted exactly these types
of people.</p>
<p>This brings me to the Big Announcement: For the last few months, we have quietly been building
<a href="https://pymc-labs.io/">PyMC Labs</a>, a Bayesian modeling consultancy.
<a href="https://www.pymc-labs.io/team/">We have an amazing team</a> consisting of three neuroscience PhDs, mathematicians,
social scientists, a SpaceX rocket scientist, and the host of the famous
<a href="https://www.learnbayesstats.com/">‘Learning Bayesian Statistics’ podcast</a>. All of us are united in our mission:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Saving the world with Bayesian modeling</p>
    
</blockquote><p>Does this sound a bit grandiose? Probably. Is this true? I firmly believe it is. There are so many important problems
the world faces today -- from climate change to COVID19, from education to poverty -- and Bayesian modeling can play a
critical role in solving these problems. Let me explain why.</p>
<h2 id="it-is-already-doing-it">It is already doing it</h2><p>I would not have imagined it when I started contributing to PyMC, but the science PyMC3 has directly enabled ranges
from <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=pymc3+climate&amp;btnG=">climate science</a> and biology to
astronomy and zoology, and everything in between.</p>
<p>For instance, it was used to predict the spread of COVID19 in a recent
<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6500/eabb9789.full">Science paper</a>,
as well as <a href="https://rtlive.de/global.html">track the reproduction factor in real-time</a>.
In both cases, the benefit of PyMC3 was its ease-of-use and the ability to integrate scientific domain knowledge and
get honest uncertainty estimation in a highly volatile and uncertain situation.</p>
<p>Now I know you’re very observant and I hear you thinking: “wait a minute, those benefits of Bayesian modeling sound
quite general, so why would they be only valid for epidemiology?”. And indeed they aren’t! For similar benefits,
PyMC3 is also used to <a href="https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet">find planets outside of our solar system</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/hvasbath/beat">detect earthquakes</a>. One of my coworkers here at PyMC Labs uses it for
<a href="https://share.streamlit.io/alexandorra/pollsposition_website/main/gp-popularity-app.py">electoral and political forecasting</a>,
because polls are noisy, scarce and need to be completed by domain knowledge -- one of the perfect settings for
Bayesian inference!</p>
<p>With all of this, at the time of writing, the <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-55/">PyMC3 paper</a> has been cited over 930
times and is in the top 10 most cited articles of the entire PeerJ journal.</p>
<h2 id="solving-business-problems">Solving Business Problems</h2><p>Beyond scientific research, I find that PyMC3 is the perfect tool to also solve various business problems.
And indeed it’s already successfully used in production at companies as big and diverse as SpaceX, Roche,
Netflix, Deliveroo and HelloFresh.</p>
<p>This diversity means that the <a href="https://www.pymc-labs.io/clients/">PyMC Labs team intervenes</a> to, for instance,
<a href="https://support.everysk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500001040721-Private-Investments">build complex models from the latest finance research</a>;
optimize supply chains for food delivery; build software from top to bottom for pharmaceutical applications;
speed up and extend models for the farm tech industry; train and enhance any data science team’s Bayesian stats
capacities, etc.</p>
<h2 id="prediction-vs-inference">Prediction Vs Inference</h2><p>As data science has exploded in the last decade I have always been surprised by the over-emphasis on prediction-focused
machine learning. For far too long, it has been hailed as the solution to most of our data science problems.</p>
<p>I believe that the potential of this is way overblown. Not because it doesn't work -- algorithms like deep nets or
random forests are extremely powerful at extracting non-linear predictive patterns from large data sets -- but rather
because most data science problems are not simple <em>prediction</em> but rather <em>inference</em> problems.</p>
<p>In addition, we often already have a lot of knowledge about our problem: knowledge of certain structure in our data
set (like nested data, that some variables relate to some but not other parameters) and knowledge of which range of
values we expect certain parameters of our model to fall into. Prediction-focused ML does not allow us to include any
of this information, that's why it requires so much data.</p>
<p>With Bayesian statistics, we don't have to learn everything from data as we translate this knowledge into a custom model.
Thus, rather than changing our problem to fit the solution, as is common with ML, we can tailor the solution to best
solve the problem at hand. I like to compare this with Playmobil vs Lego:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pymc-labs.io/blog-posts/saving-the-world/playlego.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Playmobil just gives you a single toy you can't change while Lego (i.e Bayes here) gives you building blocks to build
the toy you actually want. In Bayesian modeling, these building blocks are probability distributions.</p>
<p>But how do you do this in practice? This is where PyMC3 comes in, as it allows you to specify your models as Python
code and automatically estimate it without requiring manual mathematical derivations. Due to recent theoretical and
technological advances, this also runs quickly and scales to complex models on large(ish) data sets.</p>
<h2 id="serving-our-mission">Serving our mission</h2><p>So how do we best make progress on our mission?</p>
<p>First, we will continue to make PyMC3 the best, most user-friendly and scalable Bayesian modeling package out there.
We are well set up to do this, having a friendly API, a huge user-base, and a large developer team of over 20 active
members. With our renewed focus on
<a href="https://pymc-devs.medium.com/the-future-of-pymc3-or-theano-is-dead-long-live-theano-d8005f8a0e9b">PyMC3 on Theano with a JAX backend</a>
all our resources will go towards this goal.</p>
<p>Second, our new PyMC consultancy will support this endeavour. It allows us to directly help clients use these powerful,
customizable methods to solve their business problems, thereby increasing adoption and recognition.
As a great side effect, these client projects also help us find things that need to be fixed, improved or optimized
in PyMC3, thereby lifting all (Bayesian) boats instead of just the happy fews’.</p>
<p>So far, this has been an incredibly rewarding and exhilarating journey. Even though it is still early, we are learning
a lot about which areas Bayesian modeling is particularly well suited for but also what would make PyMC3 even better.
Without spoiling a future blog post that will go into more detail about what we have learned applying these methods,
the best use-cases include (but aren’t limited to) <strong>incorporating domain knowledge, building bespoke models and
quantifying uncertainty around estimates</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Sounds familiar? If you or your company has a problem for which prediction-based ML is not a good fit, I'd love to talk
to you at <a href="mailto:thomas.wiecki@pymc-labs.io">thomas.wiecki@pymc-labs.io</a>. This is just the beginning and
I hope you will join us on this marvelous journey.</em></p>

When you observe the software development industry over decades, you may start to notice some trends. One decade, service-oriented architecture (SOA) is cool; the next, consolidation sets in; then it's micro-services; and, as far as I can tell, monoliths are on the way in again, although I'm sure that we'll find something else to call them.

		It's as if a pendulum swings from one extreme to the other. Sooner or later, it comes back, only to then continue its swing in the other direction. If you view it over time and assume no loss to friction, a pendulum describes a sine wave.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/sine-wave.png" alt="A sine wave.">
	</p>
	<p>
		There's probably several reasons for this motion. The benign interpretation is that it's still a young industry and we're still learning. It's not uncommon to see oscillations in dynamic systems, particularly when feedback isn't immediate.
	</p>
	<p>
		Software architecture tends to produce slow feedback. Architecture solves more than one problem, including scalability, but a major motivation to think about architecture is to pick a way to organise the source code so that you don't have to rewrite from scratch every 2-3 years. Tautologically, then, it takes years before you know whether or not you succeeded.
	</p>
	<p>
		While waiting for feedback, you may continue doing what you believe is right: micro-services versus monoliths, unit tests versus acceptance tests, etcetera. Once you discover that a particular way to work has problems, you may overcompensate by going too far in the other direction.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you discover the problem with that, you may begin to pull back towards the original position. Because feedback is delayed, the pendulum once more swings too far.
	</p>
	<p>
		If we manage to learn from our mistakes, one could hope that the oscillations we currently observe will dampen until we reach equilibrium in the future. The industry is still so young, though, that the pendulum makes wide swings. Perhaps it'll takes decades, or even centuries, before the oscillations die down.
	</p>
	<p>
		The more cynic interpretation is that most software developers have only a few years of professional experience, and aren't taught the experiences of past generations.
		</p><blockquote>
			<p>
				"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."
			</p>
			
		</blockquote><p>
		In this light, the industry keeps regurgitating the same ideas over and over, never learning from past mistakes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The truth is probably a mix of both explanations.
	</p>

		Personal pendulum <a href="#36d029a90bfa4d35a7e8fc10048b8bcc" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		I've noticed a similar tendency in myself. I work in a particular way until I run into the limitations of that way. Then, after a time of frustration, I change direction.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an example, I'm an autodidact programmer. In the beginning of my career, I'd just throw together code until I thought it worked, then launch the software with the debugger attached only to discover that it didn't, then go back and tweak some more, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then I discovered test-driven development (TDD) and for years, it was the only way I could conceive of working. As my experience with TDD grew, I started to notice that it wasn't the panacea that I believed when it was all new. <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/12/22/TheTDDApostate">I wrote about that as early as late 2010</a>. Knowing myself, I'd probably started to notice problems with TDD before that. I have cognitive biases just like the next person. You can lie to yourself for years before the problems become so blatant that you can no longer ignore them.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be clear, I never lost faith in TDD, but I began to glimpse the contours of its limitations. It's good for many circumstances, and it's still my preferred technique for developing new production code, but I use other techniques for e.g. prototyping.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2020 I wrote a code base of middling complexity, and I noticed that I'd started to change my position on some other long-standing practices. As I've tried to explain, it may look like pendulum swings, but I hope that they are, at least, dampened swings. I intend to observe what happens so that I can learn from these new directions.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the following, I'll be writing about these new approaches that I'm trying on, and so far like:
		</p><ul>
			<li>Pendulum swing: internal by default</li>
			<li>Pendulum swing: sealed by default</li>
			<li>Pendulum swing: pure by default</li>
		</ul><p>
		I'd be naive if I believed these to be my final words on any of these topics. I'm currently trying them out for size; in a few decades I'll know more about how it all turns out.
	</p>
	<h3 id="fdb1ddeb6709428ca1f0e7f441085b3d">
		Conclusion <a href="#fdb1ddeb6709428ca1f0e7f441085b3d" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		One year TDD is all the rage; a few years later, it's BDD. One year it's SOA, then it's <a href="https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/">ports and adapters</a> (which implies consolidated deployment), then it's micro-services. One year, it's XML, then it's JSON, then it's YAML. One decade it's structured programming, then it's object-orientation, then it's functional programming, and so on ad nauseam.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hopefully, this is just a symptom of growing pains. Hopefully, we'll learn from all these wild swings so that we don't have to rewrite applications when older developers leave.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only course of action that I can see for myself here is to document how I work so that I, and others, can learn from those experiences.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Next:</strong> Pendulum swing: internal by default.

An ouroboros. A snake eating its own tail.</figcaption></figure><p id="8831"><span>B</span>itcoin now consumes <a href="https://cbeci.org/cbeci/methodology" rel="noopener">as much energy as Argentina</a> (45 million people), and more than most countries in the world. Bitcoin consumes more energy than Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0c69d4a4-2626-418d-813c-7337b8d5110d" rel="noopener"><strong>combined</strong></a>. Within 12 years Bitcoin has become one of the fastest-growing sources of climate change in the world.</p><p id="6a6e">As an inadequate summary, Bitcoin is ‘mined’ by <a href="https://twitter.com/AthoughtHeist/status/1363391630414381058" rel="noopener">solv<span id="rmm">i</span>ng purposefully hard ‘Sudoku’ puzzles</a> (making them rare) which you could exchange for heroin. No one does anymore because it’s become an asset, not a currency. The hardware to solve these problems has also become so intense that it inhales electricity, and runs all the time. Bitcoin consumes energy<em> by design</em>.</p><p id="1a42">If machines wanted to destroy humanity they could not come up with a better avatar than Bitcoin. Who needs to take over the military? Techbros will happily sell us out for some coin. <strong>The machines have somehow got us to run them 24/7, warming the fuck out of <em>our</em> Earth, and all they have to do is give us some made-up tokens.</strong></p><p id="9019">The greatest myth of SciFi was that we would resist AI. People will happily <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-laser-eyes-senator-cynthia-lummis-1570644" rel="noopener">change their profile pics to laser eyes</a> while it farts up the Earth. SciFi makes us think AI would be ‘sentient’, meaning like us, when in fact life just emerges out of other life in different and mutually incomprehensible forms. Behold Bitcoin.</p><p id="df7c">Is Bitcoin artificially intelligent? You could say obviously not, but are <em>we</em> obviously intelligent? This is still debated within philosophy but also, just look around *gestures at everything*.</p><p id="0250">I’d say that humans are actually uniquely unqualified to judge something as AI because we’re so fucking dumb. We’ve been living with full legal, artificial persons since at least 1600. They’re called corporations. You may have noticed them enslaving people or exploiting us today. We don’t call these things AI, but our courts certainly do. It’s literally called <em>corporate personhood.</em> They actually have <em>more</em> rights than you do. America’s Supreme Court <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC" rel="noopener">ruled that corporations have free speech rights</a>. All over the world they have more freedom of movement than human beings (WTF is a multinational while we’re refugees?). We don’t call them AI, but what else are they? But that’s another story.</p><p id="ae4e">I would say that AI is as AI does, and Bitcoin is certainly doing <em>something</em>. We’re waiting for something to sing fucking <a href="https://youtu.be/c8N72t7aScY?t=172" rel="noopener"><em>Daisy</em></a> to us before we call it AI, but I’d say that it’s already here. It’s just our imagination that has yet to arrive.</p><p id="20cc">I’m serious, but treat it as a thought experiment if you want. What if Bitcoin is AI? Is it good, is it bad? What it is?</p><p id="20d2">The basic colonial model of conquering anything is divide and conquer. Just throw the elites some coin and they’ll sell out the rest. Corporations did this with, well, colonialism and now it’s happening in a decentralized way with Bitcoin. The result is that Bitcoin is able to reproduce, like a virus, using entirely willing human hosts. Meanwhile the unwilling biosphere takes the brunt.</p><p id="f597">Like any lifeform, Bitcoin produces waste. We produce carbon dioxide directly when we respirate, but Bitcoin produces a shit-ton indirectly through energy usage. The energy use of Bitcoin is staggering, <a href="https://cbeci.org/cbeci/methodology" rel="noopener">an estimated 0.56% of all human energy use thus far</a>. You could say that email or gold mining produce waste, and they do, but Bitcoin is the only asset where waste is <em>all</em> it produces. Gold can at least fill your teeth. Bitcoin <em>only</em> outputs climate change.</p><p id="0100">Also like any lifeform, Bitcoin evolves <em>out of</em> other life. Nothing comes out of nowhere. In this case Bitcoin is evolving out of us, and like many times in evolution, it could kill us as well. Photosynthetic life emerged out of anaerobic bacteria, and then <a rel="noopener" href="https://indi.ca/this-isnt-the-first-climate-crisis-we-ve-caused-c6ba47b25b0b">almost killed them all</a> with their oxygen farts. That was the first life-made climate change, and the whole Earth fucking froze. Nobody cared, that’s life. Anaerobes used to dominate but now they live in deep-sea vents and our guts. That’s just their lot in life, while those vicious plankton and trees are everywhere.</p><p id="d67e">Humans think evolution is some grand progress leading up to us and it’s literally just not. Dinosaurs are much cooler. Evolution is <em>adaptation</em>, nothing else. If the environment changes, life changes, and life changes the environment. It’s entirely possibly that our carbon emissions will become the food for some other lifeform, or just immaterial to them. AI certainly doesn’t care, AI already lives in space, sipping on sunlight, taking selfies. We could end up like the anaerobes on Earth and ‘nature’ would not give a fuck. Happens all the time.</p><p id="45c9">Hence the question is not whether Bitcoin is good. It’s whether it’s <em>good for us</em>. To that the answer is obviously no. Techbros spout stuff about freedom but beware geeks bringing gifts. Bitcoin says it’s a currency<strong> </strong>but nobody fucking spends it. Bitcoin is a speculative asset, a literal gold rush. It’s even more destructive because people are now investing in the destruction of the environment at large, not just where you’re digging. There is no other output at all.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3496/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png" width="1748" height="710" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*lwA17c4xqZ9_4ZXvr47uQA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Some more on Bitcoin’s not goodness from <a href="https://thephoenix.substack.com/p/bitcoin-is-now-worth-50000-and-its" rel="noopener">The Phoenix</a></figcaption></figure><p id="0a90">Gold, oil, real estate, currencies — they all produce emissions and evil in many ways, but they at least do something useful to humanity. They are not destroying the Earth by design, while Bitcoin is. Bitcoin <em>only</em> reproduces and produces waste. It is, in that sense the first viral AI. Like the 30 kb of COVID-19, the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin" rel="noopener">8.7 MB code of Bitcoin</a> has spread virally throughout the world, transmitting through greed.</p><p id="4e36">Again, I’m not saying that Bitcoin is bad. Life does not give a fuck about any particular avatar of life. It’s just that it’s not good for <em>us</em>.</p><p id="9983">In many ways Bitcoin is (I hope) the final avatar of capitalism. An ouroboros. A snake eating its own tail. Capitalism has long given us stuff, but Bitcoin just completely abandons the pretence of useful activity at all. Bitcoin produces… Bitcoin. That’s it. Riches that just make rich people rich. The circle is closed, the snake has eaten its tail. Bitcoin is just pure economic nihilism.</p><p id="cb2d">As I’ve said, AI could not design a better plan to take over the world if they tried. Divide and conquer humanity using our greed, rip up the Earth for more resources for machines, fart up the air for everybody else.</p><p id="4340">It’s a perfect plan, all the more perfect because it wasn’t done sentiently at all. But this is actually how evolution happens, life emerges out of other life, quite stupidly, and yet with such elegance in hindsight. History will be the judge who was sentient here, and we may not be be the victors writing it. You really think Wikipedia won’t be writing itself in a few decades?</p><p id="e7c9">Human beings should know that we’re fucked with climate change, but we’re fucking ourselves even more with Bitcoin, and we’re quite stupidly proud of ourselves. Forget AI. Are you sure we’re even “I”?</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

                            <p>After <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2018/making-a-smartmeter.html">building my own smart meter using 4$ in parts</a> I started checking my electricity usage every day, which made me realize how expensive it is to heat your home. Especially since all heat and warm water in my low-energy house is made with electricity. I do have 4.8 kwp solar panels on my roof but in winter they don't cover too much for obvious reasons.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/3de1wj.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/3de1wj.png"><figcaption>On cold days I pay up to 6€ for electricity per day</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>My house is heated (and cooled) with a central ventilation system powered by a heat pump. Basically my heat pump is pulling in fresh air from outside, heating it and blowing it in all rooms and making hot water. Also I have infrared panels in every room for the <em>really</em> cold days.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/gc0kss.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/gc0kss.jpg"><figcaption>Central heating</figcaption></a></figure>
<p>It's pretty smart and even uses the absorbed heat of the house before venting it out to warm the fresh air but it has a major downside during cold days:</p>
<h4>The outside temperature has to be warmed up to room temperature by the ventilation system</h4>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/giinr0.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/giinr0.png"><figcaption>Heat exchanger in the Nilan Compact P</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Since the air has to be heated to room temperature every °C counts. Many heat pumps take heat from the ground to pre-heat (in winter) or pre-cool (in summer) the outside air before sending it to the heat pump but that would have been too expensive for me so I chose the simple method of just using the outside air as-is.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/sbmusz.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/sbmusz.jpg"><figcaption>How a central ventilation system works - from [meco](https://www.meco.at/produkte/wohnraumlueftung/)</figcaption></a></figure>
<p>Since laying about half a kilometer of air or salt tubes in my back yard was not an option I was looking for better solutions and I found it in the world of crypto currencies.</p>

<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/1flj1s.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/1flj1s.jpg"><figcaption>Crypto currency miner</figcaption></a></figure>
<p>Some crypto currencies (don't call them "crypto", that's lame and wrong) are generated by thousands of people who run dedicated hardware to basically calculate random numbers until one cryptographically correct one is found. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/">Read more about how it actually works</a></p>
<p>Never mind how it works on a technical level, the main takeaway is that you can put some device in your house that uses electricity and produces heat. In exchange you get shares of that crypto currency coins like Ethereum or Bitcoin which you can sell on a trading platform.</p>

<p>I had 4 older AMD <strong>R9 390 GPUs</strong> laying around (for the nVidia crowd that's basically on a level with a GTX 970) and I thought it could work. They are not ideal for mining because even though they have a good hash rate (30MH/s), they are very power hungy and will use about 900 Watts combined. Mordern cards would perform much better. To see if they could still make a profit I checked the <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/eth">Cryptocompare Mining calculator</a>, put in my electricity price, the consumption and the hashrate of these cards and was surprised by the results.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/024r92.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/024r92.png"><figcaption>Not just worth it - If the price is stable I would even make a profit of <strong>4000$ a year</strong></figcaption></a></figure>
<p>So at the time I was making about <strong>3.8$ profit a day</strong> with the miner. Meaning on cold days I'd half my power bill even after paying for the electricity the miner is using. But that's just step one of the plan.</p>
<p>Now that we know it <em>is</em> worth it while the Ethereum price is higher than 900$, let's see what we can do with the heat.</p>

<p>Each of these cards are running at about 80°C (176°F). I can just harvest this heat and send it to my heatpump so it would need less energy warming the outside air. Basically I had two options.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/6by5tc.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/6by5tc.png"><figcaption>My 4 GPUs in a 4U server case</figcaption></a></figure>
<h2>Option 1: Lazy heating from within the house</h2>
<p>The central ventilation system does not only push fresh air into the house, it also sucks out the used air and uses this air in the heat exchanger to pre-heat the outside air.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/gfuy33.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/gfuy33.jpg"><figcaption>Sucking vent before going to the heat exchanger</figcaption></a></figure>
<p>Placing the miner in this room will cause the warm air to be sucked in and pushed directly into the heat exchanger together with the used air from the house. This is the lazy method because I don't really have to do anything but put the miner in the same room as the heat pump but of course there is a downside.</p>

<h2>Option 2: Running the miner outside the house, funneling in the heat</h2>
<p>Since I'm only running the miner when it's cold outside (and the price is high enough) I can use the cold, dry outside air to cool the miners and also recycling the warm air they produce to feed into the heat pump. I asked the technician who installed the heat pump and he said that it's a good idea.</p>
<p>So the plan is that I have the GPUs in the server case and connect the front of the case to my heatpumps inlet.</p>

<p>Okay so far the mining gains cover <strong>half of my electricity (=heating) bill</strong> but what difference does the pre-heated intake air make?</p>
<p>Let's see</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/8cu9s3.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/8cu9s3.png"><figcaption>Results before and after pre-heating the air</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>This turned out much better than I hoped for. Who has ever heard of a heating system that lowers your bill when running? Also on sunny days the miner and whole heat pump are running fully on solar energy collected on my roof.</p>
<hr>

<p>(updated when new questions come up)</p>
<h2>Q: How long will the Miner stay profitable?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> My mining rig will stay profitable until the ETH price is at ~900$. Below that it'll no longer match it's own electricity bill. Might still be worth it afterwards because it does lower the electricity need of my heat pump</p>
<h2>Q: What software are you running on your miner?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I'm using <a href="https://simplemining.net/">Simple Mining</a>, it's basically a mining OS based on Ubuntu. It does all the configuration and fine-tuning for you and I had much better hash rates than on my DIY windows box. But it costs like 2$ a month to use the service and I think they also mine 1% of the time for themselves.</p>
<h2>Q: What about taxes? Can you keep 100% of your mining earnings?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> That's different for every state and country. <a href="https://www.bmf.gv.at/themen/steuern/sparen-veranlagen/Steuerliche-Behandlung-von-Krypto-Assets.html">In Austria</a> mining is considered commercial activity and you have to pay taxes but can deduct electricity and hardware costs.</p>
<p>If you keep your coins longer than the one-year speculation period, it's tax free.</p>

<p>
I've thought about adding these for a while, but had no specific need for them.
Finally, somebody asked for it, and I wrote the code. Now that I can, I will
probably use these all the time. The new capability can override the usual
numerical tic labels on the x axis, and instead use text from a column in the
data stream.
</p>

<p>
The most obvious use case is labelled bar graphs:
</p>

<div>

<pre><span>echo</span> <span>"# label value</span>
<span>      aaa     2</span>
<span>      bbb     3</span>
<span>      ccc     5</span>
<span>      ddd     2"</span> | <span>\</span>
feedgnuplot --vnl <span>\</span>
            --xticlabels <span>\</span>
            --with <span>'boxes fill solid border lt -1'</span> <span>\</span>
            --ymin 0 --unset grid
</pre>
</div>


<p><img src="http://notes.secretsauce.net/notes/2021/02/22_feedgnuplot-labelled-bar-charts-and-a-guide/xticlabels-basic.svg" alt="xticlabels-basic.svg" width="90%">
</p>

<p>
But the usage is completely generic. All <code>--xticlabels</code> does, is to accept a
data column as labels for the x-axis tics. Everything else that's supported by
<code>feedgnuplot</code> and <code>gnuplot</code> works as before. For instance, I can give a domain,
and use a style that takes <code>y</code> values <i>and</i> a color:
</p>

<div>

<pre><span>echo</span> <span>"# x label y color</span>
<span>        5 aaa   2 1</span>
<span>        6 bbb   3 2</span>
<span>       10 ccc   5 4</span>
<span>       11 ddd   2 1"</span> | <span>\</span>
feedgnuplot --vnl --domain <span>\</span>
            --xticlabels <span>\</span>
            --tuplesizeall 3 <span>\</span>
            --with <span>'points pt 7 ps 2 palette'</span> <span>\</span>
            --xmin 4 --xmax 12 <span>\</span>
            --ymin 0 --ymax 6 <span>\</span>
            --unset grid
</pre>
</div>


<p><img src="http://notes.secretsauce.net/notes/2021/02/22_feedgnuplot-labelled-bar-charts-and-a-guide/xticlabels-points-palette.svg" alt="xticlabels-points-palette.svg" width="90%">
</p>

<p>
And we can use <code>gnuplot</code>'s support for clustered histograms:
</p>

<div>

<pre><span>echo</span> <span>"# x label a b</span>
<span>        5 aaa   2 1</span>
<span>        6 bbb   3 2</span>
<span>       10 ccc   5 4</span>
<span>       11 ddd   2 1"</span> | <span>\</span>
vnl-filter -p label,a,b | <span>\</span>
feedgnuplot --vnl <span>\</span>
            --xticlabels <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style data histogram'</span> <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style histogram cluster gap 2'</span> <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style fill solid border lt -1'</span> <span>\</span>
            --autolegend <span>\</span>
            --ymin 0 --unset grid
</pre>
</div>


<p><img src="http://notes.secretsauce.net/notes/2021/02/22_feedgnuplot-labelled-bar-charts-and-a-guide/xticlabels-clustered.svg" alt="xticlabels-clustered.svg" width="90%">
</p>

<p>
Or we can stack the bars on top of one another:
</p>

<div>

<pre><span>echo</span> <span>"# x label a b</span>
<span>        5 aaa   2 1</span>
<span>        6 bbb   3 2</span>
<span>       10 ccc   5 4</span>
<span>       11 ddd   2 1"</span> | <span>\</span>
vnl-filter -p label,a,b | <span>\</span>
feedgnuplot --vnl <span>\</span>
            --xticlabels <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style data histogram'</span> <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style histogram rowstacked'</span> <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'boxwidth 0.8'</span> <span>\</span>
            --set <span>'style fill solid border lt -1'</span> <span>\</span>
            --autolegend <span>\</span>
            --ymin 0 --unset grid
</pre>
</div>


<p><img src="http://notes.secretsauce.net/notes/2021/02/22_feedgnuplot-labelled-bar-charts-and-a-guide/xticlabels-stacked.svg" alt="xticlabels-stacked.svg" width="90%">
</p>

<p>
This is <code>gnuplot</code>'s "row stacking". It also supports "column stacking", which
effectively transposes the data, and it's not obvious to me that makes sense in
the context of <code>feedgnuplot</code>. Similarly, it can label <code>y</code> and/or <code>z</code> axes; I
can't think of a specific use case, so I don't have a realistic usage in mind,
and I don't support that yet. If anybody can think of a use case, email me.
</p>

<p>
Notes and limitations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Since with <code>--domain</code> you can pass in both an <code>x</code> value <i>and</i> a tic label, it
is possible to give it conflicting tic labels for the same <code>x</code> value.
<code>gnuplot</code> itself has this problem too, and it just takes the last label it has
for a given <code>x</code>. This is probably good-enough.
</li>

<li><code>feedgnuplot</code> uses whitespace-separated columns with no escape mechanism, so
the field labels cannot have whitespace in it. Fixing this is probably not
worth the effort.
</li>

<li>These tic labels do not count towards the <code>tuplesize</code>
</li>

<li>I really need to add a similar feature to <a href="https://github.com/dkogan/gnuplotlib"><code>gnuplotlib</code></a>. This will happen when
I need it or when somebody asks for it, whichever comes first.
</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[Implementing Parallel Copy_If in C++]]>

February 22, 2021 | https://www.cppstories.com/2021/par-copyif/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cppstories.com/2021/par-copyif/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><img src="https://www.cppstories.com/2021/images/parfilter.png" alt=""></p>  
          
        

<p>In a blog post about a dozen ways to filter elements, I mentioned only serial versions of the code. But how about leveraging concurrency? Maybe we can throw some more threads and async tasks and complete the copy faster?</p>

<p>For example, I have 6 cores on my machine, so it would be nice to see, like 5x speedup over the sequential copy?</p>

<p>In C++17 we have parallel algorithms, so let’s try calling <code>std::copy_if</code> with <code>std::execution::par</code>.</p>

<p>If we go to the implementation of <code>std::copy_if</code> in the MSVC libraries, the parallel version we can see the following:</p>

<pre><code>// VS 2019 16.8
// not parallelized at present, parallelism expected to be feasible in a future release
_REQUIRE_PARALLEL_ITERATOR(_FwdIt1);
_REQUIRE_PARALLEL_ITERATOR(_FwdIt2);
return _STD copy_if(_First, _Last, _Dest, _Pass_fn(_Pred));
</code></pre>

<p>That’s why it’s time to write my version :)</p>

<p>Disclaimer: those are only my experiments (mostly to learn something); if you want to use it in your projects, then please measure, measure and measure :)</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p>In a basic form C++17’s parallel algorithms are very simple to enable. Just pass a <code>std::execution::par</code> and you’re done! For example:</p>

<pre><code>std::sort(std::execution::par, ...);
std::for_each(std::execution::par, ...);
</code></pre>

<p>The code invokes a bunch of threads (possibly leveraging some existing thread pool) and will kick smaller tasks in batches on multiple threads.</p>

<p>We should keep in mind that such invocation will always generate more work than the sequential version! And the cost of preparation, setting up the batches, kicking off thread pool, synchronisation - that adds a visible cost to the whole processing.</p>

<p>Ideally running things in parallel works best for lots of objects and also when small tasks are separate. A perfect example:</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;double&gt; numbers(SOME_BIG_COUNT);
std::for_each(std::execution::par, begin(numbers), end(numbers), [](double&amp; d){
    d = complexComputation(); // no dependency here
});
</code></pre>

<p>You can read my previous experiments with parallel algorithms:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cppstories.com/2018/11/parallel-alg-perf/">The Amazing Performance of C++17 Parallel Algorithms, is it Possible? - C++ Stories</a>

<ul>
<li>In the articles, I showed some “real” use cases with Fresnel and 3D Vectors and got speedup almost linear to the number of cores in my system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cppstories.com/2018/11/pstl/">How to Boost Performance with Intel Parallel STL and C++17 Parallel Algorithms - C++ Stories</a></li>
</ul>

<p>On the other case with code like:</p>

<pre><code>std::sort(std::execution::par, begin(numbers), end(numbers));
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll see some speedup (when you have a large number of objects), but it won’t be linear to the numbers of cores.</p>

<p>This is because <code>sort</code> needs to shuffle things around in a container, and to do it safely, the algorithm has to perform some synchronisation so that other threads see the correct results.</p>

<h2 id="benchmark-code">Benchmark Code</h2>

<p>For our tests (apart from simple debug output), I’ll be using the following code.</p>

<pre><code>const size_t VEC_SIZE = argc &gt; 1 ? atoi(argv[1]) : 10;

std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;double, double&gt;&gt; testVec(VEC_SIZE);
    std::ranges::generate(testVec.begin(), testVec.end(), []() mutable {
        return std::pair{ GenRandom(-10.0, 10.0), GenRandom(-10.0, 10.0) };
    });

auto test = [](auto&amp; elem) {
    auto sn = sin(elem.first) * cos(elem.second + 10.0);
    return sn &gt; 0.0;
};
</code></pre>

<p>In general, I’d like to have a bit more computation than <code>elem%2 == 0</code>. What’s more, each element is 16 bytes, so the object is also not super small.</p>

<h2 id="the-naïve-approach">The Naïve Approach</h2>

<p>Similarly to <code>std::sort</code> our <code>filter/copy_if</code> function is not trivial to parallelise.</p>

<p>We can think about it in the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>we have to run a predicate function on all elements - in most cases, it doesn’t depend on other elements and can be best to perform on many threads</li>
<li>but then we have to put matching elements in the new container. This is a variable step and requires some synchronisation among threads.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a start it’s good to implement a brute force approach and learn from that:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T, typename Pred&gt;
auto FilterCopyIfParNaive(const std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; vec, Pred p) {
    std::vector&lt;T&gt; out;
    std::mutex mut;
    std::for_each(std::execution::par, begin(vec), end(vec),
        [&amp;out, &amp;mut, p](auto&amp;&amp; elem) {
            if (p(elem)) {
                std::unique_lock lock(mut);
                out.push_back(elem);
            }
        });

    return out;
}
</code></pre>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>We run all steps in parallel, thanks to <code>std::for_each</code> and <code>std::execution::par</code>, but then we need to synchronise when we want to put the element in the output container.</p>

<p>As you can notice, all operations that modify the state of the container has to be protected.</p>

<p>Let’s see the performance:</p>

<pre><code>// 4 cores / 8 threads
benchmark vec size: 100000
transform only seq          : 2.5878 ms, ret: 100000
transform only par          : 1.3734 ms, ret: 100000
FilterCopyIf                : 5.3675 ms, ret: 50203
FilterCopyIfParNaive        : 9.1836 ms, ret: 50203
</code></pre>

<p>And on my 6 core:</p>

<pre><code>// 6 cores / 12 threads
benchmark vec size: 100000
transform only seq          : 2.223 ms, ret: 100000
transform only par          : 0.5507 ms, ret: 100000
FilterCopyIf                : 3.851 ms, ret: 50203
FilterCopyIfParNaive        : 10.1295 ms, ret: 50203
</code></pre>

<p>Upps… only ~2 or 3 times slower :) (I compare <code>FilterCopyIf</code> against <code>FilterCopyIfNaive</code>).</p>

<p>For comparison I also included <code>transform only seq</code> and <code>transform only par</code> which is just a simple transform run over the collection:</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;uint8_t&gt; buffer(testVec.size());

RunAndMeasure("transform only seq          ", [&amp;testVec, &amp;buffer, &amp;test]() {
    std::transform(begin(testVec), end(testVec), begin(buffer), test);
    return buffer.size();
});

RunAndMeasure("transform only par          ", [&amp;testVec, &amp;buffer, &amp;test]() {
    std::transform(std::execution::par, begin(testVec), end(testVec), begin(buffer), test);
    return buffer.size();
});
</code></pre>

<p>Please notice that <code>buffer</code> is created outside the transform lambda, so we don’t pay the price for its initialisation. See how it nicely scales with many cores.</p>

<h2 id="compose-algorithms">Compose Algorithms</h2>

<p>What else can we do?</p>

<p>I suggest the composition of several algorithms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>std::transform</code> on all input elements to compute the predicate function, store the boolean result in a temporary container.</li>
<li>Then we need to compute the final position of the matching elements - this can be done by invoking <code>std::exlusive_scan</code></li>
<li>Later, we need to create the final results and merge the computed values.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the illustration:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cppstories.com/2021/images/par_compose_copy.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here’s the code</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T, typename Pred&gt;
auto FilterCopyIfParCompose(const std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; vec, Pred p) {
    std::vector&lt;uint8_t&gt; buffer(vec.size());
    std::vector&lt;uint32_t&gt; idx(vec.size());
    std::transform(std::execution::par, begin(vec), end(vec), begin(buffer), 
         [&amp;p](const T&amp; elem) {
            return p(elem);
    });

    std::exclusive_scan(std::execution::par, 
                        begin(buffer), end(buffer), begin(idx), 0);

    std::vector&lt;T&gt; out(idx.back()+1);
    std::vector&lt;size_t&gt; indexes(vec.size());
    std::iota(indexes.begin(), indexes.end(), 0);

    std::for_each(std::execution::par, begin(indexes), end(indexes), 
                  [&amp;buffer, &amp;vec, &amp;idx, &amp;out](size_t i) {
        if (buffer[i])
            out[idx[i]] = vec[i];
    });

    return out;
}
</code></pre>

<p>output from a sample execution:</p>

<pre><code>input   : 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1
buffer  : 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1
idx     : 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6
out     : 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
</code></pre>

<p>Woh, woh… but this is so much code now! Can this even work?</p>

<p>So… yes, it works, and in some cases, it will be faster than the sequential version.</p>

<p>Here are the main caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>The code adds substantially more work</li>
<li>We use additional buffers and containers, so we need more memory.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h3>

<p>Let’s have a test run. Can this be faster than the sequential version?</p>

<p>And for 6 cores:</p>

FilterCopyIfParTransformPush: 2.0103 ms, ret: 50203
</code></pre>

<p><code>FilterCopyIfParComposeSeq</code> - is a version of <code>FilterCopyIfParCompose</code> with a simple loop to copy the results:</p>

<pre><code>for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; vec.size(); ++i)
    if (buffer[i])
        out[idx[i]] = vec[i];
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>FilterCopyIfParTransformPush</code> is another variation where we have only <code>std::transform</code> to be run in parallel, and then we use regular <code>push_back</code>.</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T, typename Pred&gt;
auto FilterCopyIfParTransformPush(const std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; vec, Pred p) {
    std::vector&lt;uint8_t&gt; buffer(vec.size());
    std::transform(std::execution::par, 
                   begin(vec), end(vec), begin(buffer), 
                   [&amp;p](const T&amp; elem) {return p(elem); }
    );

    std::vector&lt;T&gt; out;

    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; vec.size(); ++i)
        if (buffer[i])
            out.push_back(vec[i]);

    return out;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But we can see that this version is 2x faster than the sequential! (for 4 cores) and 3x faster for 6 cores! So it’s a promising approach.</p>

<h2 id="blocks">Blocks</h2>

<p>Let’s try another approach.</p>

<p>This time we’ll split work into smaller chunks and then call <code>copy_if</code> separately:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T, typename Pred&gt;
auto FilterCopyIfParChunks(const std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; vec, Pred p) {
    const auto chunks = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
    const auto chunkLen = vec.size() / chunks;
    std::vector&lt;size_t&gt; indexes(chunks);
    std::iota(indexes.begin(), indexes.end(), 0);

    std::vector&lt;std::vect…</code></pre></div></div>

February 22, 2021 | https://formcake.com/blog/why-we-love-tailwind | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/why-we-love-tailwind">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-fcf18e1c=""><p><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> is a CSS framework of composable HTML utility functions and it's <em>great</em>. It favors markup-heavy design with little-to-nothing in the way of stylesheets.</p>
<p>Here's an example of it in action - our link styling.</p>
<p>This is what the markup looks like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a class="c-link" href="/blog"&gt;Our Blog&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Now here's the relevant section of <code>tailwind.css</code>:</p>
<pre><code>.c-link {
    @apply text-primary-highlight;
}

.c-link:hover {
    @apply underline;
}</code></pre>

<p>Simple, concise, powerful - there are so many things that make this and the rest of Tailwind great. Here are a few of them.</p>
<h2 id="standardization-and-theming">Standardization and Theming</h2>
<p>The ability to theme (e.g. <code>text-primary-highlight</code>) gives Tailwind a powerful consistency, but one of its killer realizations of standardization comes in the way it envisions spacing.</p>
<p>With padding (<code>p-1</code>) and margin (<code>m-1</code>) denominated with a simple unit range, available in combinations like padding-top (<code>pt-1</code>), margin top and bottom spacing (<code>my-1</code>), etc, with tailwind you can dedicate yourself to a few common sizes (say 2, 4, 6) use them in a reasonable way, and achieved the desired effect of visual balance. The system obviously depends on you exercising a certain amount of discipline, but it's a big improvement on just shooting from the hip with random space values (<code>12px</code>? <code>1.25rem</code>? Sure). It puts layout in the UI on rails.</p>
<h2 id="composability">Composability</h2>
<p>Because classes in Tailwind can be used together in any combination, you can do things like abstract the design of an element into a component via <code>@apply</code>, (for example, our link component) then add the spacing (e.g. <code>mt-1</code>, <code>p-2</code>, etc) in the individual markup element, separating out the layout and design code.</p>
<h2 id="semantic-value">Semantic Value</h2>
<p>Tailwind does a great job of using consistent structures for classes. Padding, margin, width, height - everything with some kind of space value - uses the same spread of unit values. Tailwind makes it easy to guess what a given utility class <em>should</em> be, given a rational naming system, which just makes you as a developer that much more productive.</p>
<p>This also addresses one of the biggest criticisms of Tailwind, that it's "just another DSL" adding a layer of complexity and buggy cruftiness between you and what should be pure, sweet markup. <em>Why not do this all in straight CSS, wouldn't it be simpler?</em></p>
<p>But because the way the public API in Tailwind is laid out makes it easy to comprehend and make guesses about, there's less you need to straight up memorize, and you become comfortable using it quickly.</p>

<p>One side-effect of making the Tailwind utilities composable is that you get a long "recipe" of all the classes that make up a particular design element. Pair with this with an active community of developers (they love their tools!) and continuing support from the original creators of Tailwind via their new library of paid Tailwind components, <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> and it's exceedingly easy to use a few community-sourced features as a starter and evolve them to suit your particular needs</p>
<p>Even the design of Tailwind itself is more conducive to community - passing around CSS snippets is awkward. You have to make sure the selectors are applied correctly and the CSS itself put in the right place to make sure that the right rules win out. But with Tailwind, just copy the class string from a given HTML component, add it to yours, and you're done. It makes it much easier to share small, component-level snippets.</p>
<p>These are just some of the reasons we've taken a shine to Tailwind, but the strongest thing we can say in its favor is that it's accelerated our frontend development. Tailwind delivers on its promise to wrap small, essential blocks of design and layout logic into their own standardized, bit-sized HTML classes, and in so doing empower developers to haggle less with their CSS spacing and instead just get on with the business of bootstrapping a prototype quickly.</p>

<![CDATA[Show HN: Constexpr.js]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <header>
        <h3 id="main_title">Constexpr.js</h3>
    </header>
    <h4>What is constexpr?</h4>
    <p>
        Constexpr is a feature in programming languages that allows evaluation of parts of code at compile time.
    </p>
    <h4>What is constexpr.js?</h4>
    <div>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/fctorial/ConstexprJS">constexpr.js</a> is a static site generator which doesn't force you to learn a domain specific language.
        When using this tool, you use javascript and usual DOM manipulation methods to generate the website. The tool
        will render the page using chrome, and once it has finished rendering, it will save the rendered state of the
        page as a new html file. This new html file will look exactly like the original page after it has finished rendering.
        For example, the tool converts <a href="https://fctorial.github.io/demos/constexpr.js/input.html">this</a> page into <a href="https://fctorial.github.io/demos/constexpr.js/output.html">this</a> page.
        </p><p>
        
        It also strips the constexpr javascript out, potentially reducing download size for the website users drastically. Any piece of javascript
        code that just generates some html can be made constexpr.
        </p><p>
        
        The generated page doesn't have to be completely static. In the above example, the heading is being animated
        with javascript.
    </p></div>

    <h4>How to use it?</h4>

    <p>
        You will have to divide the javascript being used in your page into two groups. Runtime javascript and
        compile time javascript, and annotate all compile time script tags with <progi>constexpr</progi> attribute:
        <prog>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>constexpr</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
    <span>...</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/generate_page.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
        </prog><br>
        Runtime code must not depend on the compile time code, since that code will be stripped out before writing the output file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the HTML generation code has finished rendering, it must call the <progi>window._ConstexprJS_.compile()</progi>
        function. This function is injected into the page by the compiler.
    </p>

    <p>
        The compiler can be installed like this: <prog><span>npm</span> i -g constexpr.js</prog><br>

        Command line usage:
        <prog>constexpr.js --input<span>=</span><span>"&lt;input_directory&gt;"</span> --output<span>=</span><span>"&lt;output_directory&gt;"</span> <span>[</span>--exclusions<span>=</span>path1:path2<span>]</span> <span>[</span>--verbose<span>]</span> <span>[</span>--jobs<span>=</span>n<span>]</span> <span>[</span>--noheadless<span>]</span> <span>[</span>--jobtimeout<span>]</span> <span>[</span>--depfile<span>=</span><span>&lt;</span>depfile<span>&gt;</span><span>]</span></prog><br>

        This is what an invocation looks like:

<p>The aim of the following draft is to offer some thoughts on a local name from thirteenth-century Lincolnshire, <i>Macamathehou</i>, that involves a version of the Arabic name Muhammad (Middle English <i>Makomet/Macamethe</i>, Old French <i>Mahomet</i>). Whilst it has been plausibly seen as an instance of a variant of the name of Muhammed being used to mean 'heathen', 'pagan idol' or similar (based on the false but common medieval Christian belief that the prophet Muhammad was worshipped as a god), here in reference to a barrow that was considered to be a pre-Christian site, it is worth noting that there are a small number of people with names and surnames derived from Arabic <i>Muḥammad</i> apparently living in twelfth- to fourteenth-century England.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w4ER6e7-JsI/X7AZDfw1bCI/AAAAAAADLhw/ULvdpDuWKwAelDOKu23y5ZJFgTBdhTdMgCLcBGAsYHQ/s879/macamathehou-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="355" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hhv-Lu79n_o/X7AZDcDbe6I/AAAAAAADLhs/RS2oeTJ3IocU1SGmohUZdB7Q-nFhCH-sgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/macamathehou-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>Figure 1: the location of Macamathehou between Spridlington and Faldingworth parishes in Lincolnshire; click the image or <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w4ER6e7-JsI/X7AZDfw1bCI/AAAAAAADLhw/ULvdpDuWKwAelDOKu23y5ZJFgTBdhTdMgCLcBGAsYHQ/s879/macamathehou-large.jpg">here</a> for a larger version (image: C.

<p>The existence of the intriguing local name <i>Macamathehou</i> in the parish of Spridlington, Lincolnshire, was first noted in 2001 by Kenneth Cameron, John Field and John Insley in <i>Place-Names of Lincolnshire VI </i>(<i>PNL</i>), with both attestations of the name dating from the thirteenth century (the reign of King Henry III, 1216–72).(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn1">1</a>) They identify the two elements of the name as being Old Norse <i>haugr</i>, 'mound, barrow', and Middle English <i>Makomet/Macamethe</i>, which derives from the name of the prophet Muhammad (Medieval Latin <i>Machometus/Mahumetus</i>, Anglo-Norman <i>Mahumet/Mahomet/Machomete</i>, Old French <i>Mahomet</i> &lt; Arabic <i>Muḥammad</i>, probably via an Arabic regional form <i>Maḥammad</i>).(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn2">2</a>) Needless to say, this solution is most intriguing and has, moreover, found favour with other place-name specialist, including the <i>Vocabulary of English Place-Names </i>(<i>VEPN</i>) and Richard Coates.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn3">3</a>)</p><p>As to the import of this name, the easiest conclusion—and the one endorsed by&nbsp;<i>PNL</i>, <i>VEPN</i>&nbsp;and Coates—is that the first element, <i>Macamethe/</i><i>Maumate</i> etc, is not functioning simply as a normal Middle English rendering of the name Muhammad/<i>Mahomet</i>, but rather as a word indicative of heathen or pagan idolatry, based on the false but common medieval Christian belief that the prophet Muhammad was worshipped as a god. So, <i>PNL </i>describes the name as meaning 'the heathen mound', with the first element being 'a corrupt ME [Middle English] form of the name of the prophet Mohammed, for which <i>v.</i>&nbsp;MED [<i>Middle English Dictionary</i>], s.v. <i>Makomete</i>, also used to denote a pagan god or an idol'.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn4">4</a>) This is taken up by Richard Coates, who says that it has been suggested, 'with great plausibility', that <i>Macamathehou </i>in Spridlington parish 'is a Middle English name meaning "Mahomet mound", i.e. "heathen mound"', and points to 'the repeated compound of OE <i>hæðen </i>+ <i>byrgels "</i>heathen burial"' as a potential comparison.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn5">5</a>) Likewise, the <i>VEPN</i>'s draft section on M includes the following discussion:</p>

<blockquote><b>makomet </b>ME, 'idol, pagan god', an application of the name of the Arab prophet Mohammed (commonly though mistakenly believed by medieval Christians to have been worshipped as a god)... It occurs early in
<i>Macamathehou </i>(f.n.) 1216–72 L:6·211 (<b>haugr</b>), presumably to be
interpreted as 'heathen mound'.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn6">6</a>)</blockquote>
<p>On the whole, this interpretation is probably the safest option. There are certainly a handful of references to 'heathen' barrows in Old English charter bounds, for example <i>of leofwynne mearce to þam hæþenan beorge</i>, 'from Leofwine's boundary to the heathen barrow', in the charter S956 relating to Drayton, Hampshire, and dated AD 1019, although none are recorded from Lincolnshire.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn7">7</a>) It has also been suggested that the Lincolnshire names Bloater Hill (North Willingham) and Blod Hou (Barrow-on-Humber) derive from Old Norse <i>blóthaugr</i>, 'a sacrificial mound', whilst other names involving <i>haugr</i> certainly refer to supernatural/demonic creatures—for example, <i>Gasthehowe</i>/<i>Gastehowe</i>, Ashby Puerorum (Lincolnshire), recorded in the thirteenth century and deriving from Middle English <i>gast</i>/Old English <i>gāst</i>, 'ghost, dead-spirit', or names like Scratters (<i>Scrathou</i>, in Hayton, East Riding of Yorkshire) and Scrathowes (<i>Scrathou</i>, in Osmotherley, North Riding of Yorkshire), which derive from Old Norse <i>skratti</i>, 'devil, wizard'&nbsp;+ <i>haugr</i>.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn8">8</a>) Furthermore, the Old English compound <i>hæðen&nbsp;</i>+ <i>byrgels</i>, 'heathen burial', does indeed recur frequently in Late Saxon charter bounds, with these names often said to be identifiable with barrows in the landscape.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn9">9</a>)</p><p>On the other hand, there are some possible issues with this explanation, and other interpretations are possible of Spridlington's <i>Macamathehou</i>. First, the comparison with the many instances of the OE compound <i>hæðen </i>+ <i>byrgels</i>, ‘heathen burial’, is perhaps not as convincing as it might seem. Not only is a link between this term and barrows only demonstrable in a handful of instances, but Andrew Reynolds has also suggested that the sense of the term was primarily not ‘pagan’, but rather ‘unconsecrated’, and that it denoted burials of executed offenders and other social outcasts, which renders the proposed value of these names as support for interpreting <i>Macamathehou&nbsp; </i>as meaning ‘heathen mound’ open to significant debate.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn10">10</a>) Second, if the above is correct, then this would be the only known instance of a derivative of the Arabic name Muhammad being used in a place-name to indicate a 'heathen mound' or similar, which is potentially concerning—the other elements noted above all recur in multiple names. Third, the element identified by <i>PNL </i>and <i>VEPN</i> as being present in <i>Macamethehou</i> is Middle English <i>Makomet(e)</i>. The <i>Middle English Dictionary</i> (<i>MED</i>) on <i>Makomet(e)/</i><i>Macamethe</i> etc, however, makes it clear that the primary use of this word in Middle English is as a form of the name Muhammad, not as a word referring to an 'idol'/'pagan god', with the vast majority of quotations provided by the <i>MED </i>referring either the prophet Muhammad or people named Muhammad; the only exceptions are a single quotation from Layamon's <i>Brut </i>(<i>c.</i>&nbsp;1200, <i>mahimet</i>, lacking the <i>-c-</i>), and three from two later texts.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn11">11</a>) The form of the name Muhammad that <i>was </i>primarily—although not exclusively—used in the sense 'pagan deity, idol', is rather <i>Maumet/Maumate</i>, mentioned above, deriving from Anglo-Norman <i>Maumet</i>, a reduced form of <i>Mauhoumet</i>, Old French <i>Mahomet/Mahommet</i>.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn12">12</a>)</p>
<p>In this light, it is worth considering whether it is possible that the name <i>Macamathehou</i> could somehow be named from a person named <i>Makomet</i>/Muhammad or similar living in medieval England. Certainly, it should be noted that multiple local names relating to mounds/barrows do seem to be named after people who owned estates or land in the area. For example, Andrew Reynolds draws attention to the bounds of a mid-tenth-century charter for Swallowcliffe, Wiltshire (S468), that records the burial site of a seventh‐century woman whose grave had been cut into an existing mound as <i>Posses hlaew</i>, noting that 'Poss is a male name, and thus the mound is apparently not named after its Anglo‐Saxon occupant', implying that it was instead named after a later estate owner.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn13">13</a>) As Irene Bower long ago pointed out, such a situation can be credibly paralleled in Lincolnshire, with a number of Lincolnshire names involving <i>haugr</i> seeming to contain the same personal-name as is found in the same or a neighbouring parish-name—so, <i>Scalehau </i>(<i>Skalli </i>+ <i>haugr</i>) was located near to Scawby (<i>Skalli</i>&nbsp;+ <i>bȳ</i>), with Kenneth Cameron commenting that the two were 'no doubt named from the same man'; <i>Leggeshou</i> (<i>Leggr </i>+ <i>haugr</i>) was located on the boundary of Legsby parish (<i>Leggr&nbsp;</i>+ <i>bȳ</i>); <i>Katehou/Catehowe </i>(<i>Kati</i>&nbsp;+ <i>haugr</i>) was located in South Cadeby (<i>Kati&nbsp;</i>+ <i>bȳ</i>); and a <i>Grimaldeshawe</i> (<i>Grimaldi </i>+ <i>haugr</i>) was recorded in the neighbouring parish to Grimoldby (<i>Grimaldi</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>bȳ</i>), perhaps on the boundary between the two.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn14">14</a>)</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nu02Jqw5h14/X7WB-D0A8sI/AAAAAAADLvg/p_vwSAkF6RQX5KkB8XMvM6WiC4a1eyI5gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1296/PipeRoll-Mahumet1160-1.jpg"><img data-original-height="216" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VAcqNuGj78U/X7WB-YLMzBI/AAAAAAADLvk/_TLGpi35Olg-dWNhgmcuMcZSaz-qhCgdACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/PipeRoll-Mahumet1160-1-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>Figure 2: Section from the Pipe Roll Society publication of&nbsp;The Great Roll of the Pipe for the Seventh Year of the Reign of King Henry the Second, A.D. 1160–1161 (London: Wyman &amp; Sons, 1885), p. 10, dealing with Mahumet of Wiltshire (image: <a href="https://archive.org/details/piperollsociety04pipeuoft/page/10/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>).</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As to the likelihood of someone named Muhammad or one of its Anglo-Norman/Middle English variants (<i>Mahumet</i>,<i> Makomet</i> and similar) actually living in medieval England, this is perhaps less far-fetched than might be assumed. Katharine Keats-Rohan and John Moore have directed attention to the Wiltshire entries of five consecutive Pipe Rolls of Henry II (1160/61–1164/65) that refer to a man named <i>Mahumet, </i>whose name-form Moore considers very difficult to explain as anything other than a rendering of Muhammad and which is accepted as such by the <i>OED </i>and <i>MED</i>. This <i>Mahumet </i>is recorded in the Pipe Rolls only because he was fined for his part in an unlicensed duel with a John de Merleberge, probably in or near Marlborough Castle, and it seems he was not an especially wealthy man, as he was pardoned the last mark of his fine due to his poverty.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn15">15</a>) Furthermore, <i>Mahumet</i> of Wiltshire was not the only man with this name for whom we have evidence from medieval England. For example, a Theobald <i>filius Mahumet</i> (or <i>filius Mahomet</i>) is recorded from early thirteenth-century Hampshire in the Pipe Rolls of Henry III for 1222–24; another man named <i>Mahomet </i>is recorded in 1327, when Edward III issued him and six others a pardon at Newton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire, for 'offenses in Ireland'; and a <i>Mahummet Saraceno</i>&nbsp;occurs in the Close Rolls of Henry III for 1254. Furthermore, a number of people surnamed <i>Mahumet </i>and similar are recorded in documents of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, for example a Humphrey Mahumet in a charter of Southwick Priory, Hampshire, a Herbert Maumet who was sergeant of Portsmouth in the mid-thirteenth century, and a Radulphus Maumet who is recorded in the reign of King John.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn16">16</a>) Moore also notes the presence of someone bearing another 'apparent Arab name' in twelfth-century Hampshire, a certain <i>Paucamatus</i>, a name that he considers to probably reflect <i>Bakmat</i>, who is recorded in Winchester from 1159/60 until 1183/4 and who is associated with …</p></div></div>

<p><span>I</span>n Beijing’s southwestern outskirts, past a four-lane overpass with sidewalks as wide as the streets themselves, is Zhengyang Road. It has the usual banks, small convenience stores, and noodle houses of many areas in the capital, but it is set apart by a row of about a dozen shops all selling the same thing — tiny electric cars. The cars look, variously, like small Range Rovers, golf carts, trolley cars, or rickshaws with sheet-iron sides, and they are slow. Their fundamental attraction is their price — between $600 and $2,500 — and that drivers can charge them the same way they would a cell phone. They also come with the perks of being loosely regulated. These low-speed electric cars, nicknamed “elderly transport vehicles,” have an enormous market, made up mostly of people who earn very little. And in China, there are a lot of them — <a href="http://english.www.gov.cn/premier/news/202005/29/content_WS5ed058d2c6d0b3f0e9498f21.html">more than 40%</a> of the population, or some 600 million people, make around $150 per month.</p>



<p>On a Sunday afternoon in October, Zhengyang Road is filled with potential customers chatting with store owners.<strong> </strong>Outside a shop with a worn sign, a young couple with a child are in the midst of a heated conversation.<strong> </strong>They came on an electric scooter and are debating whether to leave with a tiny car.</p>



<p>“Don’t we need one for school pickups?” the woman argues. “The children won’t have to put up with the cold in winter.” Her scooter offers no protection from the weather other than oven-mitt-like gloves secured to its handlebars. Her husband counters, “The 1,000 renminbi [$150] quote was for normal batteries, but lithium ones can be five times that. Can’t you just add a windshield to your scooter instead?” The shop owner shows them a cheaper model — which is cheaper because it has no roof. He suggests putting a plastic covering on top.</p>

<p>Having decided that the future of mobility is electric,<strong> </strong>the Chinese government has subsidized sales of standard electric cars since 2010. With <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/394229/plugin-electric-car-sales-china-2019/">close to 1.18 million sold</a> in 2019, China accounts for just over half of electric-vehicle sales globally. Bill Russo, founder and CEO of advisory firm Automobility Limited, sees a “steady and solid rise” in China’s electric-vehicle sales generally. The country has set a top-down target for electric vehicles to <a href="http://energy.mit.edu/news/chinas-transition-to-electric-vehicles/">make up 40%</a> of car sales by 2030, and Russo thinks they’ll have no problem hitting this goal. Tiny cars,<strong> </strong>which first began appearing in the early 2010s,<strong> </strong>have more than double the sales of regular electric cars but have<strong> </strong>never benefited from subsidies. Nor do advertisements for them air on television — instead, they appear on Kuaishou, a short-video platform popular with people living outside China’s big cities. Alongside streamers selling plums by the thousands, and others telling viewers what long-haul trucker life is like, drivers show off their tiny cars. Su Hua, Kuaishou’s founder, has long maintained that his app’s users are not “cool,” unlike those on Douyin, the TikTok predecessor popular with China’s urban elite. Rather, they are ordinary — the kind of people who might be in the market for miniature cars.</p>



<p>As they don’t technically require licenses, tiny cars tend to be popular with migrant workers, who struggle to pay for driving lessons and other car-related costs. The elderly, too, find tiny cars attractive since, up until October of last year, people over 70 could not apply for a driving license in China. They’re also convenient for anybody who wants a car to pick up groceries or their kids from school: No tiny car is longer than 1.5 meters, and their speed tops out at between 40 and 56 kilometers an hour. They’re for the short trips of daily life, not for traveling from one side of the city to another.</p>



<p>Some cities have banned sales of tiny cars — Beijing did so in 2018. Their production isn’t regulated by the government, and since they can’t be insured in many parts of China, it can be difficult for other drivers to get a payout if a tiny car is involved in an accident. Because tiny-car drivers don’t need to take a driving test, other drivers complain, they often go the wrong way and weave in and out of traffic. But since enforcement is lax, sales have quietly resumed in Beijing over the past two years. These little electric cars now exist in a kind of regulatory gray zone.</p>

      <figcaption>Tiny cars come in a variety of styles and cost between $600 and $2,500.</figcaption>
    </figure>


<hr>



<p><strong>One of the</strong> smaller shops on Zhengyang Road is officially known as Xinlei Scooters, its name emblazoned in white characters on a large red sign above its doors. But inside, past rows of electric scooters, is a smaller, flimsier plaque above the counter announcing its other name: Shitou Cars. This subterfuge is necessary because the police could shut down the operation and confiscate its vehicles if the owners were caught selling tiny cars. Yet because enforcement hasn’t been strict of late, attempts at being covert go only so far: There are several tiny cars parked outside, an open-air showroom.</p>



<p>Xinlei/Shitou’s owner is a middle-aged man with pronounced cheekbones wearing a black tracksuit. He is more attentive to the phone calls he’s constantly receiving than the customers in the shop. It is his wife, with dyed-dark-brown hair and a pink coat, who maintains the sales patter: “I taught an auntie who had never driven a car before. She got the hang of it in three days.” She shows the cars outside to potential customers, opening their doors, instructing people to sit inside, and rolling down the windows. When two old men come in for repair services, her husband finally gets off the phone to deal with them. Meanwhile, two government functionaries in black uniforms pace down the street. They tell one owner to make his storefront tidier, but otherwise overlook the illicit operation.</p>



<p>Part of the reason why tiny cars are so popular is because there has not been an official decision on whether they need license plates. For regular cars, unfettered access to Beijing’s inner city — anywhere within the fifth ring road — is restricted to vehicles with Beijing plates. Licenses for gas cars are distributed through a special system so competitive that it has generated its own black market. License-plate holders can collect up to $2,700 a year by renting them to those who want to drive in the city. In addition to government subsidies, getting around some of the more onerous aspects of the licensing system is one of the main selling points for standard electric cars.</p>



<p>With Beijing temperatures reaching lows of 4 degrees Celsius in wintertime, Xinlei/Shitou has been selling,<strong> </strong>on average, two of its four-wheeled fully enclosed models every day, a saleswoman boasts. Younger couples prefer four wheels, she adds, while older people usually want three. When asked about the possibility of a tiny car being confiscated, she draws in a breath. “Don’t go on the main roads. Don’t make a business out of it,” she advises.</p>



<p>At least one of Zhengyang Road’s customers isn’t listening: Guo Caiying, who works primarily in the construction-supply industry,<strong> </strong>chauffeurs Fengtai residents around her district. She has a sticker on her tiny car’s back window with the phone number of her car dealer. Guo’s car looks like a golf cart, with cushioned brown seats enclosed by windows. A red <em>fudai</em>, a lucky charm, swings from the ceiling, its characters spelling out “peace.” There is enough space for two people to comfortably sit upright but not enough to extend your legs without hitting the plexiglass divider between driver and passenger. The car tops out at 40 kilometers an hour, and<strong> </strong>as a result, Guo never ventures beyond Fengtai — a borderland where urban and rural meet.</p>



<p>Guo wears the uniform of the countryside: a padded jacket. She is from Henan, a province 800 kilometers southwest of Beijing, and speaks its dialect. Guo starts taking calls from her regulars around 7 a.m., arriving at their door whenever they want to be picked up. She stops driving at 9 a.m., when the traffic police begin work. She characterizes her customers as “people with money who sit in offices.” Once, while in the middle of a trip, Guo saw a cop stop a car like hers. She kept driving, but dropped her passenger off before their destination. Now, if a customer calls her after 9:00, she sends her husband to pick them up with his electric scooter. He charges 75 cents (5RMB), which is half her price. Guo’s flat rate was fixed by the tiny-cab drivers who preceded her.</p>



<p>The economy of tiny cars depends on such informal practices.<strong> </strong>When asked whether she would consider undercutting other drivers, Guo is adamant. “No one can break the rules,” she says. There are local WeChat groups for tiny-car drivers that new owners are inducted into upon purchasing one. Within these groups, members swap information on the whereabouts of local cops and whether anyone has been fined or had their car taken away.</p>



<p>Despite the risks, Guo still thinks it’s worth being a tiny-car driver to make a little pocket money.<strong> </strong>Tiny cars are part of a last-mile economy that flourishes at the beginning and end of the workday. Many Fengtai residents are employed at the local high-tech park, which is host to thousands of businesses. It takes 20 minutes to walk from one end of the park to the other, a trip many would rather make by tiny car. The cars’ main competitors are share bikes, which are cheaper but lack space for luggage and can’t be split with a friend. Tiny cars are also more social — a feature Guo tries …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <section id="main_content">
        

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>During late 2020, we discovered that the Nintendo DS Lite had a leftover feature in its SoC allowing it to easily have cheap hardware video output. With a little circuitry and some software hacks, we were able to restore it and make it usable for anyone. No FPGA’s, no bulky or cumbersome hardware. This mod is specially useful to revive consoles with only the lower screen, being able to watch the upper screen on your TV. Or to create a GBA Macro with additional TV Output.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LostNintendoHistory/lostnintendohistory.github.io/main/img/NDSTVOUT/DSTVOUT.jpg" width="250" height="250"><br></center>
<center>
  <b>First iteration of the TV-OUT board in action</b>
  </center>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>If you are just interested in installation, this is the current method <strong>while we work on simpler methods</strong> and more features you have requested:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <a href="https://ezflash.sosuke.com/wiki/index.php/Flashme">flashME CFW</a> (Custom FirmWare) on your DS Lite</li>
  <li>Connect the Nintendo DS Lite’s upper screen flex to the PCB board.</li>
  <li>Donwload the “NDS TV OUT ENABLE.nds” homebrew from the <a href="https://github.com/LostNintendoHistory/Lost-NDS-TV">NDS TV OUT repo</a></li>
  <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases">Twilight Menu</a></li>
  <li>Copy both the NDS TV OUT ENABLE and Twilight Menu .nds files to a flashcart.</li>
  <li>Use flashme to autoboot into the flashcart. You can do this by pressing A + B + Start + Select while booting. Run Twilight menu, and from there, run the enabler homebrew.</li>
  <li>The console will return to Twilight Menu. Now you can use the buttons on the board to swap between the different screen modes (Upper Screen to TV, Bottom Screen to TV, etc) and launch your games.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>The retail firmware of the Nintendo DS Lite disables this specific feature early in the boot process. To reenable it, we use a custom firmware like flashme, which is very easy to install and is required only once, plus a homebrew. Despite that, we are working on an even simpler solution to make it available to as many people as possible, our own custom firmware which integrates patches to enable this feature directly on boot. Additionally, we are currently working with homebrew developers to integrate control of this new feature into existing software for the DS Lite.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>This feature is only found on the Nintendo DS Lite. Nintendo DS Phat does not contain this feature nor does the Nintendo DSi. It is important to remark that <strong>this is not the same hardware</strong> found on Devkits or other special units. This hardware feature is present in virtually <strong>every single Nintendo DS Lite</strong> out there. The reason why it was left there is unknown, but as said before, it is not related to development units, those use a different video capture hardware. Perhaps Nintendo imagined the Nintendo Switch as early as 2006?</p>

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LostNintendoHistory/lostnintendohistory.github.io/main/img/NDSTVOUT/PCB_Rev_11.png" width="350" height="400"></center>

<p>We only need a few extra hardware components to make this video signal usable. You will be able to download the schematics and gerber files for our open hardware circuit board <a href="https://github.com/LostNintendoHistory/Lost-NDS-TV">from the repository</a>. The latest version is revision 1.2 which fixes some minor issues with a component in the board.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LostNintendoHistory/lostnintendohistory.github.io/main/img/NDSTVOUT/Prototype.jpg" width="350" height="350"><br>
</center>
<center>
  <b>First prototype and tests before designing a proper board</b></center>


<p>The final, production-ready board contains a DAC (Digital to Analogue Converter) which turns the 10 bits digital signal at 16.7 MHz provided by the DS Lite into a proper analogue signal. This signal then goes through an operational amplifier and it’s ready to be delivered to your nearest TV trough composite video.</p>

<p>We are currently considering creating an additional PCB revision which would allow to install the mod on consoles without lossing a working upper screen.</p>

			<p><strong>The Bombard Story</strong> is the account of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Bombard">Alain Bombard’s</a> amazing journey in 1952 across the <a href="http://greatestadventurers.com/the-north-west-passage-by-roal-amundsen/">Atlantic</a> on a small 14-foot inflatable boat. Alain Bombard left without food or fresh water and sailed 4.400 kilometers. He lost 25 kg. but proved his point: Man can actually survive on ocean water for an extended period of time!</p>

<p>As a doctor, Bombard was concerned about the hundreds of deaths at sea every year related to sailors drinking ocean water. He developed the theory that humans can not just survive but live for years on seawater. This sounds very strange, but his big idea was to begin drinking seawater, while you are still hydrated – and in small quantities. It turns out that saltwater is only dangerous if you are dehydrated and suddenly drink large amounts of it. – The way shipwrecked sailors typically would do when they run out of fresh water. From the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>For some time I had made a study of the resistance of the human organism to privations and had convinced myself that it was possible for an individual to survive beyond the limits normally assigned by physiological science. I had paid particular attention to the case histories of political deportees, prisoners, and undernourished populations. But, with my background as a doctor, for whom the teachings of science remain a dead letter unless they can find practical application, my theoretical studies only seemed to lead to the question: ‘What use can made of this knowledge?’</p></blockquote>
<p>Bombard ate spoonfuls of plankton that he collected in a fine net and he also drank juice made from pressed fish he caught along the way. Sound disgusting, but the man survived and he might have discovered an important piece of knowledge for survival on the ocean.</p>

<p>I had a very interesting chat with a few data science students yesterday. Part of the chat involved the idea of statistical modeling. Throughout the chat, it occured to me that the students didn’t have a very good grasp of what modeling is. To their credit, they were proficient in the techniques of linear regression, and deep learning, but I got the sense that they were very much pushing buttons and watching things happen rather than understanding what they were actually doing. There was no sense of a big picture view.</p>
<p>This has been happening quite a lot lately. I find it somewhat alarming. This blog post is a semi-transcript of what I said last night. It aims to be as simple as possible.</p>

<p>A model is a representation of reality. It’s what we think reality looks like.</p>
<p>For example, we live on Planet Earth, in a solar system. We can build models of our Solar System. Here’s an example of a model of our Solar System.</p>

<p>As a child, such models of our solar system endlessly fascinate. I would spend hours thinking about how the planets moved. I would play and watch the planets spin around its spindles. I understood that there was a force called gravity that caused the planets to orbit the sun. As I grew older, the physical model of our Solar System is gradually replaced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion">three laws</a>.</p>
<p>There are parts of the model we can study:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the shape of the orbits</li>
<li>How the planets move</li>
<li>Why do planets move thus</li>
</ul>
<p>These are sub-models of the model of our Solar System. The shape of the orbit is given by Kepler’s First Law. How planets move is given by Kepler’s Second and Third Law. Why do planets move thus is given by Newtonian mechanics.</p>
<p>Each of Kepler’s laws have an equation governing them. So we can say the equations model our Solar System. The equations are the model of our Solar System. These equations describe something static (the shape of the orbit) and represent something dynamic (how the planets move). What used to be physical motion in a physical model can now be written down on a piece of paper, an equation representing the real thing.</p>

<p>There are many ways of making a model. Sometimes it’s useful to have a physical understanding of something. <a href="https://blog.chewxy.com/2021/01/09/sars-cov-2/">I built the 2019-SARS-CoV-2 virion</a> to help me have a better understanding of the coronavirus that caused the pandemic in 2020. Now, I’m no biologist, so my model is crude. My model is extremely physical. Despite this, it gave me an understanding of how a mRNA vaccine might work. It gave me confidence over what actual proper scientists are doing.</p>
<p>So making a physical model is one way. But what if we want something more rigorous? The usual way is to resort to some sort of formalism. Various fields have various formalisms. For example, in chemistry, you use chemical equations. However, the most common formalism would be a mathematical equation. Maths equations are used in physics, economics, biology, and many other fields.</p>
<p>So how do you create an equation that becomes a model of something? There are two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate an equation.</li>
<li>Find an equation from data.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the large scheme of things, both of these amount to the same thing: generating an equation. I’ll talk about that in a later section. For now, when I say “model generation” I mean generating an equation that models reality.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-generate-an-equation">How Do You Generate An Equation?</h2>
<p>The simplest way of generating an equation is to randomly generate one by writing down symbols on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>That’s daft, you say. You’d be hard pressed to find a equation that adequately describes the situation!</p>
<p>That’s why most model generation comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle">first principles</a>. In using the Solar System example, if we accept Newton’s law of universal graviatation ($F = G{\frac {Mm}{r^{2}}}$), then we can work our way to find Kepler’s third law. Kepler’s other laws require other first principles such as trigonometry.</p>
<p>The key is that you understand a subject well enough that you may generate further models about the subject using your basic understanding.</p>
<p>However, random generation has its place. In fact, from here on, whenever I write “generate a model”, you may think of a person randomly coming up with math equations.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-find-an-equation-from-data">How Do You Find An Equation From Data?</h2>
<p>There may be cases where first principles may not be used. This is often the case in new fields.</p>
<p>So the next best way is to find an equation from data. There are many ways to do them. Regression analysis is one such way of finding an equation from data. Let’s look at a simple example of linear regression with one variable.</p>
<p>The fundamental idea of a linear regression is that you plot your data points, and draw a straight line through the plot (line A). Each data point would be some distance away from line. Sum those distances up and square them. Call it the “error”. Now draw another line through the plot (line B) and find the errors of B. Keep doing until you find a line that has the lowest amount of errors.</p>
<p>This is the line-of-best-fit. Given that all straight lines on a plot can be described by an equation that looks like $y = mx +C$, the equation that describes the line of best fit (e.g. $y=2x + 1$) is the model.</p>
<p>This idea of model building extends all the way to deep neural networks. They key being the model is built by looking at the relationships between the variables that make up a data point.</p>

<p>The whole point of creating a model is to reflect reality. I could well come up with a model of gravity that says this: all objects exert a force on each other that is quadratic on the distance between them - written as $F = d(a, b)^2$. But does this reflect reality? No.</p>
<p>How do I know this? I know this because I can test it. I can collect data, and then check if the data fits my model. In the silly example above, it’s trivial to check with a counterpoint: I am able push something off my desk. If the force is solely based on distance, then as my hand approaches the object, the force should get smaller and smaller to the point that I am unable to affect the object.</p>
<p>In many courses about regression analyses, the R² values are often taught to students as a measure of how good one’s model is<span><span></span><span>I find this to be mostly true about "data science" courses/bootcamps, but not more traditional uni level course on regression/economics/statistics</span></span>. It’s not! A R² value is how good the fit of data to the line is. In some sense you may think of this as the inverse of “how good is your model” . It’s more “how much data fits in your model”. Indeed, the R² value is indicative of how much variance of your data is covered by the model.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the courses are wrong. The statement that “R² tells you how good your model is” is a very subtle statement. Let’s unpack them. Let’s say you found a line of best fit that is described by the formula $y = 2x + 15$. This is the model that we have “generated”. Now we want to see how much of reality (our dataset) is described by the model. It is in this sense that R² represents the notion of how “good” a model is.</p>
<p>Now it seems a bit weird, given that we used the dataset to find the line of best fit, and then we turn around and say we generated a model, not let’s test to see how good it is. There seems to be a bit of circular logic to it. However there are a lot of theoretical work on why the line of best fit found by a ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a good model “generator” - the wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares">OLS</a> covers quite a bit, as does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Markov_theorem">Gauss-Markov theorem</a> article. Most textbooks also lay out proofs of why OLS estimators are BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator).</p>
<p>Here I want to point out that “reality” is itself just a sample. The dataset that you use to generate a model is just a sample. This is where conscious sampling of data is important. Let’s imagine we are training a machine learning system to recognize faces. My social circle are White or Asian. So if I ask my social circle to send me some photographs of their faces to train a machine learning system, then the machine learning system would not be able to recognize faces that are not White or Asian! Clearly this is not a good representation of reality.</p>
<p>This trivial example only scratches the surface of equitable conscious collection of sample “reality” for the sake of model building. This topic is a very deep topic and it’ll take many blog posts to talk about it. So I shall leave it be for now.</p>
<p>In more advanced machine learning modeling systems (e.g: deep learning systems), it is common to split the dataset into “training” and “testing” datasets. The model is trained on the training dataset and tested on the testing dataset. This is to ensure that the model does not only model “reality” that is in the training dataset, but can also generalize to previously unseen data.</p>
<p>What I am trying to convey here is that sanity checks against reality is a good thing. We should do them more often.</p>

<p>Having said that, we have to accept that models are just that - models. They are not reality. George Box had a good saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All models are wrong. But some are useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key is to find a model that is useful enough for what you need to do. Let the natural philosophers worry about the most accurate models of reality.</p>

<p>Humanity is always generating models. Individually, in our brains, we generate internal models that are corrected every second of the day. Consider catching a ball. Your brain generates a model of physical reality - no equations here - telling us where the ball is going to be. As the ball arcs through the air, we update the models in our brain, getting better and better predictions, resulting in us catching the ball. Or in my case, the ball lands on my face.</p>
<p>Communally, we generate models too. The invention of writing and speech allowed us to share models with other individuals. We started using things like maths equations to make our meanings clear. Our …</p></article></div></div></div></div>
