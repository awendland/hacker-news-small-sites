<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A question I often hear from teams - both new and established - is “should we host our stack on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>?”.  Given all the buzz it gets in the tech world a lot of people assume&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with k8s for several years - often with very powerful and complex platforms - and I think the truth is more&nbsp;nuanced.</p>
<p>Here’s my attempt at untangling that decision.  It’s geared toward startups and self-sufficient teams in wider organisations with responsibility for hosting their own products.  It might also have value to people in more traditional <span>IT</span> departments at larger&nbsp;organisations.</p>
<h3>How Can it Help&nbsp;Me?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t just a 2018-era buzzword.  It’s a robust, highly scalable system that allows you to construct application deployments out of well-considered primitives (<code>Pod</code>, <code>Service</code>, <code>Ingress</code> etc) then does its damnedest to make the reality match.  When applications crash it restarts them.  When whole swathes of underlying machines disappear it tries to replace them.  If you’re running numerous services (probably developed as a microservice architecture) and you’re looking for efficiency, resilience and a good story for deployment it can do a lot for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Want a basic degree of resilience in your service? (yes you do) - run <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/">multiple replicas</a> in your deployment then balance traffic between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>If your workload is ‘bursty’ (e.g. a lot of <span>API</span> traffic) you could build on this by rigging up <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/">autoscaling</a> to grow capacity when it’s needed.  This can save you a lot of money - instead of paying for peak capacity all of the time, provision a baseload amount to keep the platform ticking over and bring up more replicas when they’re needed.  And if you can <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/custom-and-external-metrics">import the queue length</a> into your system autoscaling works for queue-based workloads&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Worried about your code breaking?  Configure liveness/readiness <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">probes</a> and Kubernetes will automatically restart your services when they fail.  Likewise for hardware failure - I’ve seen clusters who’ve lost half their nodes keep on trucking like nothing happened.  A well-configured and maintained Kubernetes cluster can be incredibly robust.  If you have the resources you might even try running a <a href="https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/">chaos-monkey</a>-like <a href="https://www.gremlin.com/chaos-monkey/chaos-monkey-alternatives/kubernetes/">tool</a> to make certain your stack will tolerate regular&nbsp;failures.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has excellent features for integrating with your <span>CI</span> workflow.  The most common pattern I see for this is a build (ideally standardised across all your projects) that pushes an image to a Docker registry then kicks your k8s cluster to load it.  Depending on taste that can be done by modifying the deployment to pull a new tag, or pointing the tag to the new image and triggering k8s to reload all pods.  In most cases (migrations ruin everything) deployment can be fully automated: if you trust your tests and feature flags it can be 100% automatic (aka <a href="https://www.continuousdelivery.com/">Continuous Delivery</a>); for the less brave a manual approval step after the build eases the pain.  Either way your developers should be able to release most builds to the cluster without any help from Kubernetes&nbsp;specialists.</p>
<p>In a similar vein to <span>CI</span> it can help you standardise logging and monitoring for your applications.  Doing this is by no means unique to Kubernetes, but having a single cluster-wide system that gathers together data about all your services in the same place can greatly ease the pain of debugging.  I’ve seen particularly good results come from using <a href="https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset">fluentd</a> to pipe json-structured logging output from applications into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/"><span>AWS</span> CloudWatch</a> and query it through <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html">Insights</a>.</p>
<p>Finally it can do a great deal to increase efficiency - both at the hosting layer (i.e. jamming as many applications onto those expensive <span>EC2</span> instances as possible) and also reducing the time your developers need to spend deploying software.  Humans cost more than computers so for most organisations the second of these will be the biggest win.  But Kubernetes isn’t magic - I’ve seen some beautiful, efficient clusters and some total gas guzzlers.  <em>You’ll only save money with Kubernetes if you invest in using it&nbsp;correctly.</em></p>
<h3>Where Does Kubernetes&nbsp;Shine?</h3>
<p>First of all think about your workload.  What kind of applications do you need to run?  How do they talk to each other and the outside world?  From experience I’d say the following attributes make your stack a good&nbsp;fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadly speaking have you followed a microservice architecture?  There’s little value in Kubernetes if your world only has one application.  You’ll need to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/">Dockerize</a> your applications to deploy them to k8s; doing this from day 1 of any project is a good way to make yourself think about the boundaries between&nbsp;services.</li>
<li>Are your services exposed to each other and the outside world via <span>HTTP</span>(s) (probably yes, it’s 2020)?  This will fit k8s’ model nicely and you can use one of the normal <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controllers</a> to front&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Are your applications suitable to be load balanced?  No local state (use PostgreSQL / Redis / whatever for that), communication over known endpoints, fast startup/shutdown.  That isn’t to say you can’t keep shortlived state like a Redis cache in your cluster but for many cases you’d do better to use the boxed services a cloud provider&nbsp;offers.</li>
<li>Kubernetes is also well suited to headless applications like batch processing (through its <code>Job</code> <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/">controller</a>) and long-lived&nbsp;queue-consumers.</li>
<li>Is memory (and to a lesser extent <span>CPU</span>) usage predictable?  Kubernetes will try to host your applications on the same physical machines, so if one of them goes haywire and consumes all the <span>RAM</span> other workloads may be randomly killed.  In my experience this is the single biggest source of instability on Kubernetes clusters.  If you understand the resource usage of your applications you can declare a <code>resources.requests</code> and <code>resources.limits</code> to guarantee they’ll always get the memory they need and won’t be bad&nbsp;neighbours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely here are a few kinds of workload I <em>don’t</em> think you should use it&nbsp;for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static websites.  Typically you’d do this by baking your content into an <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/">Nginx</a>-derived image and exposing it via your cluster’s ingress controller.  That’s a terrible way to host static content: all those little copies of Nginx need to be maintained, it’s inefficient and far less resilient / performant than it could be at the network level.  Sure you could stick it behind a <span>CDN</span> but if you’re doing that, why not have a cloud service host the content as&nbsp;well?</li>
<li>Hosting untrusted code.  That could mean applications supplied by your customers or third party code with a history of security problems, e.g. Wordpress or a dodgy library from <span>NPM</span>.  By default Kubernetes’ features for isolating workloads aren’t great.  You can add things like <a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/">Calico</a> to control network access but it’s easy to screw up and your security model is always going to be 100% dependent on the container runtime.  The default for this (Docker, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">Linux cgroups</a>) offers a huge attack surface to compromised applications: if a codebase your cluster is running gets hacked an attacker will not find it hard to escalate their access to the rest of the cluster.  Interesting work is being doing on alternatives to cgroups (e.g. <a href="https://katacontainers.io/">Kata Containers</a>) but it’s not yet mainstream enough to recommend to the average&nbsp;user.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your workload isn’t a good fit you may still have options for shoehorning it into Kubernetes (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/">volumes</a> can be used for long-lived state), but expect to spend a lot of engineering time working around the problems.  A lot of them are bad practices anyhow so your resources time might be better spent designing them out of the stack altogether - they’re only going to hurt you further down the&nbsp;line.</p>
<h3>No Magic&nbsp;Bullet</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t a magic bullet.  It can help to move the complexities of hosting applications into a well-designed layer of their own but it won’t make them go away.  You’re always going to have to secure and maintain your&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>To make a cluster useful for the average workload a menagerie of add-ons will be required.  Some of them almost everyone uses, others are somewhat niche.  Examples include (the Nginx <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controller</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">cert-manager</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler">cluster-autoscaler</a> to add extra nodes when you don’t have enough capacity.  Having a bespoke set of software operating key features of the environment makes your cluster a unique snowflake and it needs to be managed as such.  Also they need to be updated regularly and can sometimes be of questionable quality.  Configuration management tools like <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> or <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs">Terraform</a> are nigh-on mandatory: tinker with a cluster by hand at your peril, absent a declarative setup you’ll never be able to spin up another in exactly the same way.  I’ve seen this lead to no end of problems when operating or replacing more mature&nbsp;clusters.</p>
<p>When running any nontrivial stack on Kubernetes a degree of curation is always going to be required.  Letting anybody deploy whatever they like, however they like to your cluster can only lead to chaos.  You’ll end up with mess of inconsistently named applications scattered across dozens (or worse, one) namespaces with nobody knowing how they fit together.  Congratulations: you took your old spaghetti infrastructure and replaced it with a new flavour of spaghetti infrastructure, just served on a cooler kind of&nbsp;plate.</p>
<p>The most successful Kubernetes implementations I’ve seen are those where infrastructure specialist(s) work with developers to make sure workloads are well-configured, standardised, protected from one another and have defined patterns of communication.  They’ll handle the initial setup of an application on an infrastructure, hopefully wired up to a build/release system so dev teams can ship new versions of the code without help.  In a lot of ways this mirrors the wider culture of your organisation - if engineering is a chaotic free-for-all of bad communication and ill-defined responsibilities your hosting environment will mirror it.  At best this leads to unreliability; at worst an unreliable, unmaintainable, expensive&nbsp;mess.</p>
<h3>Cost of&nbsp;Ownership</h3>
<p>If you’re running applications on a large scale …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
          <section>
            <p>On our journey to true zero carbon hosting we want to explore if the world is ready for the next step: low power computing resources based on ARM.</p>

<p>For this reason we started this crowdfunding campaign that lasts 30 days and you can make an impact by choosing ARM or Intel for running your workload.</p>

<p>If only 50 people decide to go for ARM, we will build a new ARM hosting in our Zero Carbon Data Center here in Switzerland.</p>

<h2>Dedicated ARM computing</h2>

<p>We would like to take the next step and introduce <em>dedicated ARM compute resources</em>. Initially the offer will be for a Quad (4) core systems featuring 2 GB of RAM and 16GB of storage (microSD, class 10). These systems are using very little power and could shape the way how hosting is offered.</p>

<p>Using ARM, you will get a real, physical hardware instead of virtualised resources. The CPU will be based on the Allwinner A64 SoC running at 400 Mhz.</p>

<p>The choice of operating systems will be adjusted to ARM. Planned are Armbian, Arch Linux, Alpine Linux and NetBSD. More are likely to follow.</p>

<h2>The classic Intel/x86 way</h2>

<p>This crowdfunding also works as a vote. 
Do you prefer staying on x86_64, Intels 64 bit technology or do you want to switch to ARM?
While x86 is proven and virtualisation also helps to be energy efficient, the general design of x86 CPUs is more performance orientated and thus by design requiring more energy.</p>

<p>The choice of operating systems for the x86 VMs is the same ones as listed on <a href="https://datacenterlight.ch/">DataCenterLight.ch</a>.</p>

<h2>The offer</h2>

<p>If you can choose freely, what would you buy? We would love to know! We have created the following 4 offers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dedicated IPv6 Only ARM, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB microsd storage for 159.5 CHF/year</li>
<li>Dedicated IPv6 ARM with dedicated NAT64 mapped IPv4 address, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 16 GB microsd storage for 258.5 CHF/year</li>
<li>IPv6 only x86 VM, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 10 GB CEPH SSD for 170.5 CHF/year</li>
<li>Dual Stack x86 VM, 4 Cores, 2 GB RAM, 10 GB CEPH SSD for 269.5 CHF/year</li>
</ul>

<p>(all prices excluding VAT where applicable)</p>

<h2>Conditions</h2>

<p>If at least 50 people commit to ARM resources, we will setup dedicated ARM hosting in 2020. 
The one who participate in this crowdfunding campaign will be the first to get their hands on ARM resources.
ARM resources </p>

<p>If less than 50 people commit on ARM, all dedicated ARM servers will be refunded and no ARM infrastructure will be established in the Data Center Light.</p>

<p>The x86 based resources will be setup independently of whether or not the goal of ARM servers is reached. You can see real time on this crowdfunding page who is in favor for which technology.</p>

<h2>Get in touch with us</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or would like to discuss the ARM offer, we welcome you in our <a href="https://chat.with.ungleich.ch/">Open Chat</a>. You can also reach us by mail at support -at- ungleich.ch.
You can also checkout the <a href="https://ungleich.ch/">ungleich homepage</a> and the <a href="https://datacenterlight.ch/">Data Center Light hosting</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>An Iverson ghost is an embedding of APL like array programming features in nonAPL languages and tools.</strong></em></p>
<p>You would be surprised at how often Iverson ghosts appear. Whenever programmers are challenged with processing large numeric arrays they rediscover bits of APL. Often they’re unaware of the rich heritage of array processing languages but in <code>NumPy's</code>&nbsp;case, they <em>indirectly</em> acknowledged the debt. In <a href="http://numpy.sourceforge.net/numdoc/numdoc.pdf"><em>Numerical Python</em></a> the authors wrote:</p>
<p><em>“The languages which were used to guide the development of NumPy include the infamous APL family of languages, Basis, MATLAB, FORTRAN, S and S+, and others.”</em></p>
<p>I consider “infamous” an upgrade from <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/ewd498.html">“a mistake carried through to perfection.”</a></p>
<p>Not only do developers frequently conjure up Iverson ghosts. They also invariably turn into little apostles of array programming that won’t shut up about how cutting down on all those goddamn loops clarifies and simplifies algorithms. How learning to think about operating on entire arrays, versus one dinky number at a time, frees the mind. Why it’s almost as if array programming <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm">is a tool of thought.</a></p>
<p>Where have I heard this before?</p>
<p>Ahh, I’ve got it, when I first encountered APL almost fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Yes, I am an old programmer, a fossil, a living relic. My brain is a putrid pool of punky programming languages. Python is just the latest in a longish line of languages. Some people collect stamps. I collect programming languages. And, just like stamp collectors have favorite stamps, I find some programming languages more attractive than others. For example, I recognize the undeniable utility of <code>C/C++</code>, for many tasks they are the only serious options, yet as useful and pervasive as <code>C/C++</code> are they have never tickled my fancy. The notation is ugly! Yeah, I said it; suck on it C people. Similarly, the world’s most commonly used programming language <code>JavaScript</code> is equally ugly. Again, <code>JavaScript</code> is so damn useful that programmers put up with its many warts. Some have even made a few bucks writing books about its <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">meager good parts</a>.</p>
<p>I have similar inflammatory opinions about other widely used languages. The one that is making me miserable now is <code>SQL</code>, particularly Microsoft’s variant&nbsp;<code>T-SQL</code>. On purely aesthetic grounds I find well-formed <code>SQL</code> queries less appalling than your average <code>C</code> pointer fest. Core <code>SQL</code> is fairly elegant but the macro programming features that have grown up around it are depraved. I feel dirty when&nbsp;forced to use them which is just about every other day.</p>
<p>At the end of my programming day, I want to look on something that is beautiful. I don’t particularly care about how useful a chunk of code is or how much money it might make, or what silly little business problem it solves. If the damn code is ugly I don’t want to see it.</p>
<p>People keep rediscovering array programming, best described in Ken Iverson’s 1962 book <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APL.htm"><em>A Programming Language</em></a>, for two basic reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s an efficient way to handle an important class of problems.</li>
<li>It’s a step away from the ugly and back towards the beautiful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these reasons manifest in <code>NumPy</code>‘s resounding success in the Python world.</p>
<p>As usual, efficiency led the way. The authors of <em>Numerical Python</em> note:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why are these extensions needed? The core reason is a very prosaic one, and that is that manipulating a set of a million numbers in Python with the standard data structures such as lists, tuples or classes is much too slow and uses too much space.</p></blockquote>
<p>Faced with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBAijg5Betw">“does not compute”</a> situation you can either try something else or fix what you have. The Python people fixed Python with <code>NumPy</code>. <a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-exact-difference-between-a-Pythoneer-and-a-Pythonista">Pythonistas</a> reluctantly embraced <code>NumPy</code> but quickly went <em>apostolic!</em> Now books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038481.do"><em>Elegant SciPy</em></a> and the entire <code>SciPy</code> toolset that been built on <code>NumPy</code> take it for granted.</p>
<p>Is there anything in <code>NumPy</code> for programmers that have been drinking the array processing Kool-Aid for decades? The answer is yes! <a href="http://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/NuVoc">J programmers</a>, in particular, are in for a treat with the new Python3 addon that’s been released with the latest J 8.07 beta. This addon directly supports <code>NumPy</code> arrays making it easy to swap data in and out of the J/Python environments. It’s one of those best of both worlds things.</p>
<p>The following <code>NumPy</code> examples are from the <code>SciPy.org</code> <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html">NumPy quick start tutorial</a>. For each <code>NumPy</code> statement, I have provided a J equivalent. J is a descendant of APL. It was largely designed by the same man: Ken Iverson. A scumbag lawyer or greedy patent troll might consider suing <code>NumPy</code>‘s creators after looking at these examples. APL’s influence is obvious. Fortunately, Ken Iverson was more interested in promoting good ideas that profiting from them. I suspect he would be flattered that APL has mutated and colonized strange new worlds and I think even zealous Pythonistas will agree that Python is a delightfully strange world.</p>

	<p>Looking at Mozilla’s finances, it’s reasonable to conclude that Google is keeping them on life support to keep the anti-trust hounds at bay. Mozilla’s deal with Google will account for at least 70% of their revenues going forward. That’s over $400 million to be the default search provider in 4% of browsers. For 1 year. I’ll bet my next paycheck that Google reupped this rather generous agreement to avoid a repeat of Microsoft’s troubles over an Internet Explorer monopoly. My guess is that Google will decide it’s in their interest to pull the plug right around the time this latest wave of anti-trust talk blows over.</p>

<p>With the troubles at Mozilla, Google is one step closer to replicating the WeChat and Facebook walled-garden model on the Web. A quick survey a the field of play shows just how far Google has come in capturing the once open Web.</p>

<h2 id="browser-war-is-over">(Browser) War is over</h2>

<p>Chrome’s ability to dictate web standards will only get stronger over time. Safari and Firefox have been able to apply some shame to Chrome on things like disabling third-party cookies, but soon it’ll just be Apple left with a voice.</p>

<p>But Google doesn’t even need Chrome to dictate standards since it controls the Web’s front door. AMP, a technology no one asked for, is now on over 70% of all marketing websites for no other reason than Google said so.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget that most people now access the web via mobile devices, 75% of which run Google’s Android.</p>

<h2 id="original-sins">Original Sins</h2>

<p>Two deficiencies have determined the course the Web has taken: lack of native search and lack of native payments.</p>

<p>Lacking native distributed search allowed Google to grab a monopoly position as the entry point to the web. The Web’s orignal architects were off base on hyperlinks; it turns out people just want to skip right to the answer they’re looking for. There was once the beginnings of an alternative in public bookmarking sites, but social networks came and sucked all the air out of that space.</p>

<p>Lack of a safe and easy way of exchanging funds was a big factor in advertising becoming the dominant business model on the Web. No-charge services became the norm because, for a long time, there was no reasonable way to pay for them. Enter advertising to fill the void. I think it’s safe to say that Google’s AdWords is the dominant advertising platform on the open Web, which means it holds a commanding position in the Web’s finances.</p>

<p>I’m also going to throw in an honorable mention to poor native video support (it is hyper_text_ after all). It’s beating a dead horse to point out that Google also serves up the vast majority of videos streamed on the Web.</p>

<h2 id="so-then">So then…</h2>

<p>So Google controls the Web’s search and video infrastructure. It can and does dictate standards and media formats. It also controls a huge chunk of the revenues available when publishing and selling on the Web. It even controls the operating system and browser through which most people interact with it.</p>

<p>Google’s capture of the Web is a <em>fait accompli</em>. Only legislation will keep the World Wide Web from finally becoming Web by Google (TM).</p>

          <p>I worked at Amazon for 17 years as a network engineer. Now I’m out of Amazon and looking at the industry, I’m learning new things. <strong>One of the things I’ve learned recently is that OSPF shouldn’t be used for Clos leaf-spine networks because of scale.</strong> I’ve heard that it can’t keep up with the size and scale of the modern datacenter networks. <a href="https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/release-independent/solutions/topics/task/configuration/ip-fabric-underlay-cloud-dc-configuring.html">Juniper IP Fabric Underlay Network Design and Implementation</a> is an example of the recommendation.  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938</a> is what as used as the reference for using eBGP to be the routing protocol inside of large Clos networks.</p>

<p><strong>This is a shock to me</strong> since we built large OSPF Clos networks a decade ago. We built networks this way with hundreds of routers (even thousands) speaking OSPF. I’m not saying it is easy or that we didn’t have to understand OSPF well; If you don’t design it well, you get a flooding disaster. But if you do set it up right, it works really well. It converges quickly and doesn’t collapse under failure. The key thing is to be sure you understand how flooding works and you focus on areas and summarization. There are different things you have to be aware of when you are designing a Clos network with BGP vs OSPF. With BGP you have to be figure out how to mitigate path hunting. With OSPF need to work on how to avoid congestion collapse.</p>

<p>There is also work on building new protocols for these large Clos or Clos-like networks, such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/</a>. I don’t understand why OSPF or ISIS isn’t good enough so I don’t understand why these are necessary. There <a href="https://pc.nanog.org/static/published/meetings/NANOG74/1763/20181003_Martin_Routing_In_Dense_v1.pdf">are some good ideas in RIFT</a>, I’m just haven’t seen a reason to use it.</p>

<p>When we did this we were using CPUs from 2003 and we were using a lesser known OSPF stack. It’s OSPF implementation was okay, but we were strongly warned away from using their BGP implementation by the developers. <strong>We had to understand and mitigate risk</strong>. We had to test it as well as we could and be very careful in our first deployments. The stack had never been battle tested like this before. We still ran into some scary performance issues but got to work with great software engineers on the protocol stack to work through problems and figure out our scale.</p>

<p>Others agree with me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg</a>, even though they are mostly focusing on smaller networks than I was working on. But either way, OSPF can be made to work just fine on very large (or small) Clos networks.</p>

<p>As an example of the scale, this is a generic 24 port 3-tier Clos. It is possible to make OSPF work on this. This is smaller than what we were working on in 2012.
<img src="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/assets/images/24port-3tier-clos-resize.png" alt="24 port 3-tier clos"></p>

<p>To understand and then mitigate the risks an unknown OSPF stack, at scale, is why I started building a configuration management system and started <a href="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/Network-Validation-with-Vagrant/">simulating our network design</a>. We needed to understand how any OSPF protocol stack would work. Could we make the protocol scale at all? We needed to see what would actually happen with a real OSPF implementation. <strong>I cannot stress enough how important this simulation was.</strong> We did not understand the problem of flooding and we did not understand the solution until we had tried it out in simulation.</p>

<p>Before that, though, we spent a lot of time on white boards arguing about topology and OSPF. <strong>I think whiteboards are the most important tool for network design</strong> currently available, which makes me sad. I wish that wasn’t true, I want much better tools. I can’t even tell you the number of disasters averted by 2-3 great network engineers arguing over a whiteboard. This works really well, but there are important reasons it’s not good enough. One is that for many of these discussions, it’s extremely hard to get data to make the decisions. In this case, a comparison of convergence time and failure detection in a 3-tier Clos with eBGP, iBGP, and OSPF should be required, but we didn’t have that capability.</p>

<p>In a dense mesh-like network such as a Clos network, the concerns around OSPF swirled around four main issues: the effect of flooding, the size of the link state database, the speed of SPF calculations, and the ability for OSPF to carry a large number of prefixes. We were concerned about OSPF scaling w.r.t. its flooding and it’s the flooding that is expensive with a Link State Database protocol, not the Shortest Path First (SPF) calculations. Which means you have to be very careful about what is flooded, what are the areas, and how things are summarized. I didn’t understand this until I had a simulation and I could try things out with areas or without, and the effect was dramatic. I think it’s often true that there is a part of a design that you don’t understand, which is one of the big reasons to do simulation. We didn’t have the ability to lab up a network as big as we were going to be building, so the simulation was critical. I can’t even imagine what we would have done without it. Based on the simulation, we created targeted tests for real hardware to understand how it would deal with the scale.</p>

<p>The point of this article is not that OSPF is better than BGP, but that it does work in very large size Clos networks. I’m frustrated that so much of the industry went a direction without great data or analysis, just following one set of opinions and design choices. <strong>I wish there were easy ways for people to be able to design, simulate and test different designs</strong> like this so that they could decide for themselves the tradeoffs they’d like to make, rather than have to rely on some type of industry hype. There needs to be a better way to be able to describe topologies and designs so that it’s really easy to try out different ideas.</p>

<p>If you have other considerations, such as you want to run IPv6, or EVPN, a single instance of eBGP such as the one popularized by the open source routing suite, FRR, maybe the simplest or elegant. But with proper design, scale is not the reason to use BGP over OSPF. If you are running a small Clos network and don’t have IPv6 or EVPN, OSPF is more straightforward and generally faster, as was the common practice before the advent of BGP in the data center.</p>

<p>No matter what, you need to understand the choices that you are making and understand the tradeoffs. This is hard to do, and especially hard in networking because we lack design patterns and good tools to help us understand the implications of our choices.</p>

<p>If anybody knows about tools or design patterns or even somebody who’s actually compared OSPF vs BGP in Clos networks with data, I’d love to hear about it.</p>

<p>Looking at some “exciting” <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html">features landing in Python 3.8</a>, I’m still disappointed and frustrated by the language… like by quite a few other languages.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="7204" data-permalink="https://ilya-sher.org/chimpanzee-978809_640/" data-orig-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg" data-orig-size="640,640" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D7000&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0015625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="chimpanzee-978809_640" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=640" src="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=640" alt="" srcset="https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg 640w, https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=150 150w, https://ilyasherdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/chimpanzee-978809_640.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></div>



<p>As an author of another programming language, I can’t stop thinking about how things “should have been done” from my perspective. I want to be explicit here. My perspective is <strong>biased</strong> towards correctness and “WTF are you doing?”. Therefore, take everything here with a appropriate amount of salt.</p>



<p>Yes, not talking about any “positive” changes here.</p>



<h2>Assignment Expressions</h2>



<blockquote><p>There is new syntax <code>:=</code> that assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.</p></blockquote>



<p>A fix which couldn’t be the best because of previous design decision.</p>



<p>“Somebody” ignored the wisdom of Lisp, which was “everything is an expression and evaluates to a value” (no statements vs expressions), and made assignment a statement in Python years ago. Now this can not be fixed in a straightforward manner. It must be another syntax. Two different syntaxes for almost the same thing which is <code>=</code> for assignment as a statement and <code>:=</code> for expression assignment.</p>



<h2>Positional-only Parameters</h2>



<blockquote><p>There is a new function parameter syntax <code>/</code> to indicate that some function parameters must be specified positionally and cannot be used as keyword arguments:</p></blockquote>



<pre><code>def f(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f):
    print(a, b, c, d, e, f)</code></pre>



<p>Trying to clean up a mess created by mixing positional and named parameters. Unfortunately I did not give it enough thought at the time and copied parameters handling behaviour from Python. Now <a href="https://ngs-lang.org/">NGS</a> also has the same problem as Python had before 3.8. Hopefully, I will be able to fix it in some more elegant way than Python did.</p>



<h2>LRU cache</h2>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache"><code>functools.lru_cache()</code></a> can now be used as a straight decorator rather than as a function returning a decorator. So both of these are now supported</p></blockquote>



<p>OK. Bug fix. But … (functools.py)</p>



<pre><code>    if isinstance(maxsize, int):
        # Negative maxsize is treated as 0
        if maxsize &lt; 0:
            maxsize = 0</code></pre>



<p>If you are setting LRU cache size to a negative number, it’s 99% by mistake. In NGS that would be an exception. That’s the approach that causes <code>rm -rf $myfolder/</code> to remove <code>/</code> when <code>myfolder</code> is unset. Note that the <code>maxsize</code> code is not new but it’s still there in Python 3.8. I guess that is another mistake which can not be easily fixed now because that would break “working” code.</p>



<h2>Collections</h2>



<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.somenamedtuple._asdict"><code>_asdict()</code></a> method for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple"><code>collections.namedtuple()</code></a> now returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#dict"><code>dict</code></a> instead of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict"><code>collections.OrderedDict</code></a>. This works because regular dicts have guaranteed ordering since Python 3.7</p></blockquote>



<p>OK. Everybody had the mistake of making maps unordered: Perl, Ruby, Python.</p>



<ol><li>Ruby <a href="https://www.igvita.com/2009/02/04/ruby-19-internals-ordered-hash/">fixed that with the release of version 1.9</a> in 2008 (according to the post).</li><li>Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/">fixed that with the release of version 3.7</a> in 2018 (which I take as 10 years of “f*ck you, the developer”).</li><li>Perl <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/keys.html">keeps using unordered maps according to documentation</a>.</li><li>Same for Raku, again according to <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/hashmap">the documentation</a>.</li></ol>



<p>NGS had ordered maps from the start but that’s not a fair comparison because NGS project started in 2013, when the mistake was already understood.</p>



<hr>



<p>How all that helps you, the reader? I encourage deeper thinking about the choice of programming languages that you use. From my perspective, all languages suck, while NGS aims to suck less than the rest for the intended <a href="https://github.com/ngs-lang/ngs/wiki/Use-Cases">use cases</a> (tl;dr – for DevOps scripting).</p>



<hr>



<h2>Update 2020-08-16</h2>



<p>Discussions:</p>



<ol><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24176823">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24176823</a></li><li><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/rgcgjz/python_3_8_makes_me_sad_again">https://lobste.rs/s/rgcgjz/python_3_8_makes_me_sad_again</a></li></ol>



<h2>Update 2020-08-17</h2>



<p>It looks like the article above needs some clarification about my perspective: background, what I am doing and why.</p>



<h3>TL;DR</h3>



<p>The main points of the article are:</p>



<ol><li>Everything still sucks, including Python. By sucks I mean does not fit well with the tasks I need to do neither aligned with how I think about these tasks.</li><li>I am trying to help the situation and the industry by developing my own programming language</li></ol>



<h3>Background about my Thinking</h3>



<p>In general, I’m amazed with how bad the overall state of programming is. That includes:</p>



<ol><li>All programming languages that I know including my own NGS. This is aggravated by inability to fix anything properly for any language with substantial amount of code written in it because you will be breaking existing code. And if you do break, you get the shitstorm like with Python 3 or Perl 6 (Raku).</li><li><a href="https://github.com/MohGovIL/hamagen-react-native/issues/115">Code quality</a> of the programs written in all languages. Most of the code that I have seen is bad. Sometimes even in <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/cpp-docs/issues/1929">official examples</a>.</li><li>Quality of available materials, which are sometimes <a href="https://dev.to/ilya_sher_prog/comment/m9oe">plainly wrong</a>.</li><li>Many of existing “Infrastructure as code” solutions, which in most cases follow the same path:<ol><li>Invent  a DSL or use YAML.</li><li>“figure out” later that it’s not powerful enough (by the way there is an elegant solution – a programming language, forgot the name)</li><li>Create pretty ugly programming language on top of a DSL that was intended for data.</li></ol></li></ol>



<p>I am creating new programming language and a shell out of <strong>frustration with current situation, especially with bash and Python</strong>. Why these two? Because that’s what I was and still using to get my tasks done.</p>



<p>Are these languages bad? I don’t think it’s a question with any good answers. <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2017/10/10/why-i-have-no-favorite-programming-language/">These languages don’t fit the tasks that I’m trying to do</a> nor are aligned with how I think while being apparently one of the best choices available.</p>



<h3>This Article Background</h3>



<ol><li>Seen some post on RSS about new features in Python 3.8.</li><li>Took a look.</li><li>Yep, everything is still f*cked up.</li><li>Wrote a post about it which was not meant to be “deep discussion about Python flaws”.</li></ol>



<p>I was not planning to invest more time in this but here I am trying to clarify.</p>



<h3>And your Language is Better? Really?</h3>



<p>Let’s clarify “better”.  For me, it’s to suck less than the rest for the intended use cases.</p>



<blockquote><p>author really does consider himself a superior language designer than the Python core-dev team</p></blockquote>



<p>( From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iartgp/python_38_makes_me_sad_again/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/iartgp/python_38_makes_me_sad_again/</a> )</p>



<p>I consider myself in much easier circumstances:</p>



<ol><li>No substantial amount of code is written in NGS yet.</li><li>I’m starting later and therefore have the advantage of looking at more languages, avoiding bad parts, copying (with adaptation) the good parts.</li><li>NGS targets a niche, it’s not intended to be general purpose language. Choices are clearer and easier when you target a niche.</li><li>The language that I’m creating is almost by definition is more aligned with how I think. Hoping that people out there will benefit from using NGS if it is more aligned with how they think too.</li><li>See also my <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2016/10/28/creating-a-language-is-easier-now/">Creating a language is easier&nbsp;now</a> (2016) post.</li></ol>



<p>Will I be able to make a “better” language?</p>



<p><strong>From technical perspective</strong>, that’s probable: I am a skilled programmer in several languages and I have languages to look at more than everybody else had before. My disadvantage is not much experience in language design. I’m trying to offset that with thinking hard (<a href="https://github.com/ngs-lang/ngs/wiki#design-documents">about the language</a>, the essence of <a href="https://ilya-sher.org/2019/05/18/on-information-loss-in-software/">what is being expressed</a>, common patterns, etc), looking at other languages and experimenting.</p>



<p><strong>From marketing perspective</strong>, I need to learn a lot. I am aware that “technically better” doesn’t matter as much as I would like to. Without community and users that would be a failed project.</p>



<p>Also don’t forget luck which I might or might not have.</p>



<h3>What if NGS fails?</h3>



<p>I think that the situation today is unbearable. I’m trying to fix it. I feel like I have to, despite the odds. I hope that even if NGS fails to move the industry forward it would be useful to somebody who will attempt that later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>The Indonesia National AI Strategy, now known as <span><a href="https://ai-innovation.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranas KA</a></span> (<em>Strategi Nasional Kecerdasan Artifisial)</em>, has been published. The new strategy was announced by the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Research_and_Technology/National_Research_and_Innovation_Agency_(Indonesia)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minister of Research and Technology</a></span> and head of the <a href="https://www.ristekbrin.go.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>BRIN</span></a> (the National Research and Innovation Agency) <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambang_Brodjonegoro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bambang PS Brodjonegoro </a></span>in an television address made last Monday to mark the country’s 25th National Technology Awakening Day. The minister also launched an electronic innovation catalogue, helping Indonesian technology developers to market their offerings and sell to government procurement offices.</p>
<p>Transforming Indonesia into a Fourth Industrial Revolution economy has become focus for the government over the past few years and the necessity of creating a digital-savvy workforce has become a top priority. Stranas KA aims to tie together many of the country’s digital initiatives and maps closely to <em><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_of_Indonesia_2045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visi Indonesia 2045</a></span></em>, the country’s broad economic, social, governance and technology development strategy. The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy Framework provides an at-a-glance view of how these different goals are held in context.</p>
<p>Stranas KA aims to support five national priorities, where the government believes that artificial intelligence could have the biggest impact on national progress and outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Health services</strong> – With 268 million people living across 6,000 of Indonesia’s total 17,504 islands, delivering a consistent standard of healthcare is a national challenge. The archipelago also faces increased risks from global disease outbreaks such as SARS and, recently, Covid-19. The country’s response to the pandemic has already somewhat accelerated plans for smart hospitals and health security infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Bureaucractic reform</strong> – With a civilian civil service of about 4 million, reforming the government’s highly centralised administration remains a significant challenge. Indonesia is lagged in implementation of digital services, according to the United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/publications/publication/2020-united-nations-e-government-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>E-Government Development Index (EGDI)</span></a>, ranking below Borneo, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. President <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joko_Widodo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joko Widodo</a></span> has promised to create a citizen-centric digitised service government <em>(Pemerintahan Digital Melayani)</em> in the next five years.</p>
<p><strong>Education and research</strong> – Education is integral to Visi Indonesia 2045 and the move towards online schooling during the Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare the country’s digital divide. The pressures of the digital economy are also recognised by development plans. According to the government, Indonesia needs a digital workforce of 113 million by 2030-2035.</p>
<p><strong>Food security</strong> – According to President Widodo, food security remains Indonesia’s top priority and the Food Security Agency focuses on three main areas: food availability, food accessibility and food utilisation. Food, agriculture and fisheries government departments and agencies have already begun using satellite technology, machine learning and smart farming to better plan, forecast and manage agricultural production and natural resources.</p>
<p><strong>Mobility and smart cities</strong> – The number of people living in Indonesia’s urban areas is now close to 60 percent and is expected to rise to 70 percent of the total population by the year 2050. The government currently plans to develop 98 smart cities and 416 smart districts, under Indonesia’s 100 Smart Cities Plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20.png" alt="Indonesia National AI Strategy, August 2020" width="1191" height="701" srcset="https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20.png 1191w, https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20-640x377.png 640w, https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20-1024x603.png 1024w, https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Indonesia-National-AI-Strategy-10Aug20-320x188.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 1191px) 100vw, 1191px"></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Indonesia national AI strategy identifies four key focus areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Ethics and Policy</li>
<li>Talent Development</li>
<li>Infrastructure and Data</li>
<li>Industrial Research and Innovation</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Indonesia is already one of South East Asia’s biggest investors in artificial intelligence, with IDC’s 2018 <span><a href="https://www.idc.com/ap/pulse/2018-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asia-Pacific Enterprise Cognitive/AI survey</a></span> finding that 25 percent of large organisations in the country have adopted AI systems (compared with 17% in Thailand, 10% in Singapore and 8% in Malaysia).</p>
<p>Smart cities, one of Stranas KA’s five top priority areas, have been identified as a fundamental building block for Indonesia’s Industry 4.0 future. Last year President Widodo announced plans to create a new futuristic smart city capital on the island of Borneo, to replace Jakarta. The <span><a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/12/23/nagara-rimba-nusa-announced-as-winner-of-new-capital-city-design-contest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new capital</a></span> will rely heavily on sustainable smart city systems, cleantech and infrastructure run by emerging technologies such as 5G, AI and IoT (Internet of Things). Originally slated for completion by 2024 (pre-pandemic) and estimated to cost $33 billion, the project reportedly received an offer by Japanese multinational investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftBank_Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoftBank Group</a> to invest up to $40 billion.</p>
<p>The Indonesia National AI Strategy details a programme roadmap for both its four key focus areas and the five national priorities, for which it considers plans as short-term (2020-2024) and longer-term (2025-2045). All in all, the strategy document identifies 186 programmes, including many that aim to develop the plans, pilot schemes, policies and regulations, plus checks and balances, necessary to drive the overall strategy.</p>
<p>Underpinning the acceleration of Indonesia’s artificial intelligence journey, Stranas KA includes plans for national standards, regulations and an ethics board to ensure that usage of AI is in accordance with the country’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancasila_(politics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pancasila</a> </em>values system.</p>
<p>The development of the 194-page National Artificial Intelligence Strategy was coordinated by the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology or <span><a href="https://www.bppt.go.id/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BPPT</a></span>, a non-ministerial government agency under the coordination of the Ministry for Research and Technology, and was widely anticipated to be announced in July or August. A wide variety of public and private sector organisations contributed to the plan including government ministries, universities, industry associations and national telecom providers.</p>
<p>Although many of the programmes and initiatives detailed in the Indonesia National AI Strategy can be found in existing government strategies, plans and policy, Stranas KA is nevertheless highly ambitious. The success of the overall plan will likely rest heavily on how many of the foundation programmes it is able to get off the ground during the next 4-5 years.</p>

<h2>Or, Why is Mediterranean Maritime Sovereignty So Complicated?</h2>



<p>The Mediterranean Sea could almost be considered an inland body of water, except for a small connection to the Atlantic Ocean (only 16 km or 10 miles) between the coasts of Spain and Morocco at the Strait of Gibraltar. The waters of the Mediterranean can be further divided into the Alboran, Libyan, Levantine, Aegean, Ionian, Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, and Balearic Seas. Twenty-three separate States lay claim to the waters of the Mediterranean Sea, and many of these are overlapping or disputed leading to an incredibly complex picture of maritime sovereignty.</p>



<h2>The Established Boundaries</h2>



<p>There are, however, twenty-two established maritime boundaries between the various Mediterranean States. The oldest is between Cyprus and the UK on behalf of its Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) of Akrotiri and Dhekelia located in the south of the island. Both the land and maritime boundaries between the SBAs and Cyprus were established by the same agreement from which Cyprus gained its independence from the UK on 16 August 1960. The <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-united-kingdom-maritime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maritime boundary</a> extends in four separate parts from the various land boundary termini on the coast and delimits the UK’s claimed three nautical mile territorial sea and Cyprus’s 12. The UK ceded all exclusive economic zone (EEZ) claims to Cyprus.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="749" height="1024" src="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Cyprus_UK-Airbases-01-749x1024.png" alt="Map showing the maritime boundary between Cyprus and the UK Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia.

<p>The most recent (as of late July 2020) Mediterranean maritime boundary is between Greece and Italy, signed on 9 June 2020. This new agreement updates a 24 May 1977 Treaty, transforming the already-established 16 point maritime boundary into WGS-84 and confirming its application for the EEZ, in addition to the continental shelf (CS). The 2020 update left the tripoints, with Albania in the north and Libya in the south, undefined. The Italy–Greece boundary is arguably less interesting than the second most recent Mediterranean maritime boundary between Turkey and Libya (signed 27 November 2019). That will be covered in greater depth below.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="749" height="1024" src="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-749x1024.png" alt="A map depicting the maritime boundary between Greece and Italy." srcset="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-749x1024.png 749w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-219x300.png 219w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-44x60.png 44w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-768x1050.png 768w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01-600x821.png 600w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/Greece_Italy-01.png 1123w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"><figcaption><em>Greece and Italy’s original 1977 maritime boundary was updated to WGS-84 in 2020.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you’re interested in learning more about the maritime boundary between Greece and Italy, check out our <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/greece-italy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boundaries</a> page.</p>



<p>Surprise! Greece and Egypt signed a new EEZ boundary Agreement on Thursday, August 6. The details have not yet been released to the public, but both Turkey and Libya have already protested the new boundary.</p>



<p>The shortest established Mediterranean maritime boundary is between <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/italy-slovenia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy and Slovenia</a> at 15 M and the longest is between <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/italy-tunisia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy and Tunisia</a>, which runs for 528 M.</p>



<p>That leaves about 30 maritime boundaries to be established, some of which are currently being negotiated (Greece and Albania) and some of which have 300 plus years of dispute that will need to be resolved before maritime boundary delimitation can begin (Spain and the UK on behalf of Gibraltar).</p>



<h2>Disputed Maritime Space</h2>



<p>When looking at disputed maritime areas in the Mediterranean, Turkey is the shadow over all of the eastern Sea. Its role in the Cyprus–Northern Cyprus conflict as well as the full extent of maritime disputes with Greece will be discussed in greater detail below. This section is to delve into Turkey’s full set of unilateral maritime claims which were updated in 2019.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1024x576.png" alt="Map showing Turkey's unilateral maritime claim, overlaid with established maritime boundaries and provisional equidistance lines from Sovereign Limits." srcset="https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-300x169.png 300w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-60x34.png 60w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-768x432.png 768w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-1536x865.png 1536w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-2048x1153.png 2048w, https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Turkey_Claims_v2-01-1-600x338.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>This map depicting extensions of Turkey’s EEZ claims was released by a Turkish diplomat in December 2019 (the map source and more information is from this <a href="https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/map-delineates-turkeys-maritime-frontiers-in-med-sea-149379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>). To capture the complicated nature of all of the other claims and established maritime boundaries, we’ve overlaid Sovereign Limits maritime data over top.</em> Between points A and B is the established maritime boundary with Northern Cyprus and between points E and F the new line with Libya.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Additionally, on 27 November 2019, Turkey and the UN-backed government of Libya (Libya is in the midst of a civil war, so yes, there are two entirely separate governments) signed a short, two-point maritime boundary agreement that dangles in the middle of Greek-claimed sea. This new boundary enraged neighboring Greece and Egypt as well as the entire EU. Its location deviates from the equidistance default stipulated by UNCLOS. Turkey and Libya note that the bilaterally negotiated boundary has nothing to do with third states, but as Greece claims the waters surrounding this new delimitation, it has caused quite a stir. The new August 2020 Egypt–Greece maritime boundary likely overlaps with the Libya–Turkey boundary in some capacity.</p>



<p>The conflict between Cyprus and Northern Cyprus would not have reached its modern outcome without Turkish involvement. Disagreements between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots on the island of Cyprus have been ongoing since even before Ottoman control of the island, and the modern conflict began shortly after independence from the United Kingdom. Turkey moved to occupy northern Cyprus in 1974 and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared independence in 1983. Today, Turkey is the only country who recognizes Northern Cyprus’s statehood.</p>



<p>The island of Cyprus is now divided by a UN mandated and monitored buffer zone that snakes its way through hilly territory and divides the capital city (for both Cypruses) of Nicosia. The southern Greek Republic of Cyprus is an EU member and is recognized by the UN as the sole sovereign power of the island.</p>



<p>Related to the Cyprus dispute, the maritime picture off the coast of the island is quite complicated. The Republic of Cyprus has established maritime boundaries with <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-egypt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egypt</a>, <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-israel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel</a>, and <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/cyprus-lebanon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lebanon</a>, in addition to the short UK boundaries already mentioned. Northern Cyprus agreed to a maritime boundary with Turkey, that the southern Republic of Cyprus disputes. Due to the nature of the dispute, the maritime boundaries between Cyprus and Northern Cyprus are also unresolved (and unlikely to become so in the foreseeable future).</p>



<p>Turning to the maritime disputes between Turkey and neighboring Greece offers an even more complicated picture (at least delimitation wise) due to the multitude of Greek Islands that lay just off the Turkish coast. Relations between Turkey and Greece have been historically complicated and often quite problematic, negativity driven by both the conflict in Cyprus and unresolved maritime issues in the Aegean Sea. Oil was discovered in the continental shelf in 1973, adding [literal] fuel to the fire.</p>

Turkey’s proposed maritime boundary lies to the west of equidistance.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Greece and Turkey have two extremely different perspectives on the possible delimitations of the maritime boundary through the Aegean Sea. Turkey is not a signatory of UNCLOS and claims that Greece’s Aegean Islands are not entitled to full continental shelf claims and would seek to have a mainland coast equidistance boundary through the middle of the Aegean Sea, while enclaving the Greek islands on the Turkish side of the maritime boundary line. Greece, a signatory of UNCLOS, meanwhile proposes a strict equidistance-based maritime boundary utilizing all of its islands, pushing the maritime boundary far to the east, just off the Turkish coast. Turkey’s position on the Greek claim is that this would create a “Greek Lake” of the Aegean Sea and severely limit Turkey’s freedom of navigation from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.</p>



<p>There is also at least one officially disputed island between Turkey and Greece known as Imia by the Greeks and Kardak by the Turks. Turkish claims to additional islands have been made and redacted over the years.</p>



<p>Conflict over Greek and Turkish maritime claims is common. During the summer of 2020, Turkey has been conducting seismic surveys in Greek-claimed waters. And Greece is working on increasing its military power in response to Turkish aggression. Meanwhile, diplomats from the two states also sat down for a round of negotiations. In August, Greece called for talks to continue or a referral of the dispute to the ICJ.

<p>Looking beyond Turkey-centered disputes, there is a handful of interesting and impossible to resolve conflicts that speckle the entire Mediterranean Sea and neighboring bodies of water. Israel and Lebanon seem to be constantly in conflict over both their unresolved <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/israel-lebanon-land" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">land boundary</a> and maritime frontier. Natural gas reserves have been discovered in maritime space that both states claim, and in 2018 Lebanon auctioned off several disputed oil blocks. Israel is currently working on its own oil exploration in the disputed area.</p>



<p>The Palestinian territory of Gaza set forth maritime claims in 2015 and 2019 in which they proposed lateral boundaries with Egypt and Israel, creating a corridor of Palestinian maritime space before reaching the boundary with Cyprus. Both Israel and Egypt have submitted protests to the UN over Palestine’s unilateral maritime claims.</p>

<p>The former Yugoslav States of Croatia and Slovenia also have disputed maritime space in the northern Adriatic Sea despite a <a href="https://sovereignlimits.com/boundaries/croatia-slovenia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 Permanent Court of Arbitration Award</a> delimiting the boundary (Croatia had unilaterally withdrawn from the case in 2015 following a scandal). Slovenia accepts the Tribunal’s delimitation, but Croatia does not.</p>



<p>Some similarities can be drawn to the maritime boundary between Greece and Albania in the southern reaches of the Adriatic Sea. The two States signed a maritime boundary agreement in 2009, but this document was annulled shortly thereafter by Albania. Negotiations over the maritime boundary began again in 2018 and are ongoing. And with Greece’s current dedication to maritime boundary delimitation with its neighbors it is plausible that a new Greece–Albania maritime boundary Agreement …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Read about how we were able to use publicly available data to create large amounts of content and take our marketing to the next level.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-read-this">Why Should You Read This?</h2>
<p>Are you in the process of starting a SaaS, e-commerce store or a local business? Then I think this story can help you develop a strategy to get your first hundred dollars MRR without spending tons of money on marketing. Lets begin.</p>
<h3 id="we-had-a-product-without-traffic-what-to-do">We Had a Product Without Traffic, What to Do?</h3>
<p>One of the first products we developed was an online preparation course for the Swedish SAT test. We created thousands of practice questions, hired math experts to write tutorials and spent a lot of time creating optimized landing pages. However, the traffic never came. This was our start.</p>
<p><img src="https://mocki.io/hpskolan.png" alt="Swedish SAT" title="Swedish SAT"></p>
<p>At the stage we were at, I think a lot of developers creating their own products give up. Developers can spend an insane amount of time creating a product <strong>THEY</strong> like. But unfortunately we are not good at selling our products or showing them to users in a way that make them interested.</p>
<p>We started thinking what people actually search for in regards to the Swedish SAT and college education. After doing some analysis we noticed that a lot of people used search queries like:</p>
<ol>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into Law at Stockholm university?</li>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into any Law school in Sweden?</li>
<li>What SAT score is required to get into Computer Science at Linköping university?</li>
<li>Which education in Sweden was the hardest to get into?</li>
<li>Which education had the most applications 2015?</li>
</ol>
<p>You see these are all related to education. And we figured out that a lot of people searching for these things are interested in improving their SAT test score. So how did we use this? We could have started writing articles like crazy about each education programme, but that would be really time consuming. Instead we approached the problem like developres and started to look at how we could actually generate one page with this kind of data for each education in Sweden.</p>
<h3 id="open-data-apis--the-golden-egg-">Open Data APIs - the Golden Egg 🥚</h3>
<p>This is where things start to become interesting. Open data APIs! At Mocki we are very supportive of governments and organizations opening up their data publicly. It's an amazing way to let normal companies or people develop applications that never would have been developed otherwise. Our interest in open data started that day when we got our hands on application data for every education in Sweden.</p>
<p>For a specific education programme we were able to see</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of applicants.</li>
<li>The number of accepted people.</li>
<li>The required SAT score to get accepted.</li>
<li>The percentage of women/men</li>
<li>The percentage of Swedish/Non-Swedish people.</li>
<li>And a lot more…</li>
</ol>
<p>Suddenly we were able to answer all the questions mentioned earler. We also realised that we could create a website out of this. So that's what we did. At that time there wasn't much competition for these search queries either which was great.</p>
<p>This is a screenshot of some of the data for med school and Lund University. One of the most popular universities in Sweden. It may be hard for a non Swede to understand what the data means. But that's not important here. The important thing is that we created pages with hundreds of words, graphs and tables all automatically generated.</p>
<p><img src="https://mocki.io/antagningspoang.png" alt="Swedish SAT" title="Med school Lund"></p>
<h3 id="could-this-be-considered-spam">Could This Be Considered Spam?</h3>
<p>If you use this tactic in the wrong way with randomized data or just non useful information it's not good. But we knew that this was data people really wanted to find! All the generated texts were useful and provided great user value. And modern day search engine optimization really comes down to providing great value for a <strong>user</strong>.</p>
<p>This was all confirmed when Google started picking up the pages and loved them. We quickly started ranking on all sorts of keywords related to SAT. In just a couple of weeks we reached traffic numbers of around 10 000 users per month and it kept steadily increasing each day. All user metrics were amazing. Long average time spent on page and many interactions with the graphs. We also noticed people visiting several different pages because they got hooked on seeing all the different graphs we provided.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-step">The Final Step</h3>
<p>So we had suddenly created our own traffic source with relevant users. We started putting up banners on the site with the SAT data leading directly to our SAT prep SaaS. The results were great! We got a lot of signups and had to go back working on our course platform since the users discovered bugs and other problems. But we now had a steady flow of new paying customers. That's where you want to be because that is when a SaaS becomes fun.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-you-use-open-data-apis-to-do-the-same">How Can You Use Open Data Apis to Do the Same?</h3>
<p>This strategy may not be applicable for every service out there. But I will try to create one other example where I think this could work.</p>
<p>Lets say you own a snow shoveling business and you are currently expanding to a lot of different cities. Then I think you could combine this strategy with using local SEO.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use an open API to get all cities in your country with more than x amount of people</li>
<li>Try to find some weather API providing detailed data about if its going to snow</li>
<li>Try to find historical snow data for every city.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what can we do with with this data? We can generate something like the following text</p>
<p>“What is the snow situation town X right now? - Snow shoveling forecast”,</p>
<p>“Town with X with Y inhabitants usually has around Z number of snow days per year. The temperature in September to February is between K degrees. On our snow and ice scale town X has the score of S (scould be calculated by an algorithm that you create). You will probably have to shovel snow around D days per winter.”</p>
<p>“It's currently heavily snowing in town X, so be prepared to shovel snow the next D days.”</p>
<p>Each page would be both useful and kind of unique. It's important to make sure to have enough variables as Google might think its duplicate content otherwise. When you have created these pages you now have a local snow shoveling page for a lot of cities. Put up your phone number or a link to your booking system and start scaling your snow shoveling business.</p>
<p>There are probably a lot of better examples, but I hope I gave you enough to get thinking :)</p>
<h3 id="create-an-open-api-and-start-sharing-your-data">Create an Open API and Start Sharing Your Data!</h3>
<p>If you are a government, organization or just a company with some great data set you should think about sharing it. In some cases the data is your business and then it's of course not the best idea. But in a lot of cases there is not much to lose. In Scandinavia where Mocki is founded the governments are currently doing great efforts to make data publicly available. There are a lot of applications that will never be developed by governments and state organizations but that companies or hobby programmers would love to create.</p>
<p>Lets say your government would release all the data on every traffic accident in your country, including the location and severity. Then you could create an app warning about historically dangerous roads. It's these types of things that become possible when the data is released to the public.</p>
<p>With Mocki it's very easy to create a simple API with mock data or real data. You can for example use Mocki if you want to make some of you data available to a hackathon or other event. It's a good and safe start as you wouldn't need to expose any of your own infrastructure or sensitive data sources. If that sounds interesting you can sign up with GitHub or send us a message to the bottom right.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>With Mozilla Corporation laying off about 350 employees since the beginning of 2020, things don't look bright for Firefox, the only cross-platform browser providing any alternative to Google's Chrome(ium) monopoly. While they're not going away for the next few years at least, I believe it is also clear that they need to diversify their income pretty urgently. Here's how I hope to see them bouncing back.</p><h2 id="mozilla-foundation-vs-mozilla-corporation">Mozilla Foundation vs. Mozilla Corporation</h2><p>Since I see the confusion around this happening way too often, I want to start off by explaining the difference between the Mozilla Foundation (MoFo) and the Mozilla Corporation (MoCo).</p><p>MoCo was created as a subsidiary of the MoFo almost exactly 15 years ago. It's in charge of developing all the Mozilla's products: Firefox, Pocket, and others. All of its profits are going straight to MoFo, and nobody else owns any part of it (no other shareholders, no stocks, no dividents).</p><p>This structure allows MoCo to pursue business partnerships and deals that are hard or impossible to do in a non-profit, but as a consequence, you can't donate money to a corporation. That's why the donations to Mozilla go to the Foundation, which mostly does advocacy, finances fellowships, and similar, meaning that you can't donate directly to the Firefox development.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I was a Ford-Mozilla Open Web Fellow in 2017/2018, during which I was an employee of <a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/">Bits of Freedom <i></i></a>, with my sallary being sponsored by the by MoFo and the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/">Ford Foundation <i></i></a>.</p><br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-you-can-give-money-to-the-mozilla-corporation-today">How you can give money to the Mozilla Corporation today</h2><p>MoCo currently has three B2C (business-to-consumer) products that you can purchase.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The oldest of them is <a href="https://getpocket.com/premium">Pocket Premium <i></i></a> ($4.99/month). While Pocket is definitely more than usable without paying anything, it has some features that are exclusive to its premium members. Since Pocket is owned by the MoCo (which is itself owned by MoFo), money spent towards its premium account counts as a revenue gained by the corporation that's in charge of developing Firefox.</p>
<p>The second B2C product a newly-released <a href="https://vpn.mozilla.org/">Mozilla VPN <i></i></a> (also $4.99/month), currently available in only 6 countries (the US, the UK, Canada, New Zealand, Signapore, and Malasyia), though that list should expand later in the year.</p>
<p>The last one is <a href="https://fpn.firefox.com/">Firefox Private Network</a> ($2.99), which is more like a proxy than a VPN. If you decide to use it, all of your Firefox traffic gets routed through some Cloudflare server (you can't choose your location like you can with a VPN). It's currently only available in the US.</p>
<p>All in all, Mozilla would need quite a large amount of paid users to support their development. Then there are other smaller, free-to-use products:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://monitor.firefox.com/">Firefox Monitor <i></i></a>, which checks if some of your email addresses were a part of some breach (in cooperation with <a https:="" input.sh="" mozilla-subscription-service-pack="" href="">Have I Been Pwned <i></i></a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/lockwise/">Firefox Lockwise <i></i></a>, which is a password manager rivalling the likes of Bitwarden, LastPass, 1password, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://send.firefox.com/">Firefox Send <i></i></a>, which is an end-to-end encrypted file sharing web service. (Note: at the time of writing this, Mozilla shut it down because it was increasingly used for Malware transfer, but they're planning on bringing it back online.)</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/notes-by-firefox/">Firefox Notes <i></i></a>, an experimental end-to-end encrypted note taking app that allows you to take notes on your desktop and your Android/iOS device.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I've seen many people suggesting that Mozilla Corporation should abandon these smaller projects to focus exclusively on Firefox. I, however, believe that they should double down on these smaller projects.</p><h2 id="the-service-pack">The service pack</h2><p>I could see a future in which Mozilla has a bunch of freemium online services that would enhance the online experience of its users. Similarly to Pocket, they could add more features to these smaller projects and hide some of them behind a paywall.</p><p>I could also see them bundling those premium features together across products into one service pack behind the Firefox brand, effectively making a Firefox Power Pack.</p><p>Firefox, on its own, would still be free and open to everyone to use with no payment necessary, but you can optionally boost your online experience and support Firefox's development by paying for the app pack.</p><p>The biggest advantage of this approach is that they could charge more than their currently do in their B2C products. Throughout the years, I've payed $13-20/month for the services that Mozilla's already offering. If I were to switch all of those subscriptions to a brand I can get behind, I can see myself paying quite a bit for them.</p><ul><li>I'd pay $15/month right now if there was an option to do that.</li><li>I'd pay up to $25/month if they double down on this approach and offer more features across their current services.</li></ul><p>Since I can't do that today, the least I could do is re-subscribe to Pocket Premium, which I have proudly done while writing this:</p><figure><img src="https://input.sh/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png" alt="A screenshot of me completing the signup to Pocket's Premium service." srcset="https://input.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png 600w, https://input.sh/content/images/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-14-16-44-20.png 962w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Unfortunately, the country I'm in right now is not currently supported by their other B2C products, so please Mozilla, take more of my money!</p>

<p>Last May, I  discovered that a critical vulnerability I had reported earlier this year had resulted in my first CVE. Since the combination of vulnerabilities that led to this unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) was pretty fun to discover, I want to share the story about how brute force enabled me to hack into two organizations’ Active Directory-linked systems.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I did a thing! Found a pretty cool chain of vulnerabilities leading to RCE. Go and be patching your ADSelfService. 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/ZEybiAnpIg">https://t.co/ZEybiAnpIg</a></p>— Pieter Hiele (@honoki) <a href="https://twitter.com/honoki/status/1258122265989963781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2>The Target</h2>



<p>While performing some routine visual reconnaissance with <a href="https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone">Aquatone</a>, I noticed a similar-looking login page on two different subdomains from unrelated bug bounty programs.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="703" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x703.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x703.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-300x206.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-768x527.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-700x480.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png 1374w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Both subdomains contained customized versions of this default login screen.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The software behind this login screen is Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, which offers a portal that allows users to reset the password of their own Active Directory (AD) accounts. (Anybody who has worked in a large organization will recognize why this sounds like a useful thing to have.)</p>



<p>Since I figured that any bugs I would find on this product could potentially impact multiple companies, and more so, because it sounded very likely that this is linked to the organization’s Active Directory, it seemed like a good idea to spend some time here.</p>



<p>My first efforts led to discovering a few basic reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which had apparently been identified by other researchers already. So I had to dig a little deeper. Luckily, it turned out the whole product can be downloaded and installed as a trial for 30 days.</p>



<h2>The Setup</h2>



<p>Since I was convinced there would probably be more XSS vulnerabilities to find, I decided to download and install the software with the idea of browsing through the Java source code looking for more bugs.</p>



<p>Having installed the software, I now had the advantage of being able to execute all tests locally, as well as read through the source code to understand exactly what happens in the application, and even use <code>grep</code> in the installation folder to find potentially interesting files.</p>

<p>I started off manually browsing through some of the Java source files without many interesting discoveries. However, I did build an understanding of the software components and how they work together. This tends to be invaluable when looking for complex bugs in applications, so was definitely worth spending a couple of hours on. As a result, I had a pretty good picture of application features, the parts of the application that consisted mostly of legacy code vs. the parts that looked more recent, the parts that had been modified to fix previous security vulnerabilities, etc.</p>



<p>At one point, I decided to build a word list of application endpoints, which could hopefully serve two purposes: to perform some “classic” security tests directly against the endpoint, and to serve as a useful resource when targeting similar applications at some point in the future.</p>



<h2>The Bugs</h2>



<h4>1. Insecure deserialization in Java</h4>



<p>During my enumeration of the application’s endpoints, I spotted the following lines in one of the <code>web.xml</code> files:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="xml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
&lt;servlet-name&gt;CewolfServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
&lt;url-pattern&gt;/cewolf/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;</pre>



<p>When I googled that, I found <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48176">a published RCE against a <code>cewolf</code> endpoint</a> on another ManageEngine product, using a path traversal in the <code>img</code> parameter – this looked very promising!</p>



<p>Sure enough, after manually placing a file in a folder on my local installation, I could confirm that the deserialization vulnerability also existed in this version of ADSelfService Plus by browsing to <code>http://localhost:8888/cewolf/?img=/../../../path/to/evil.file</code></p>



<p>This meant I had a ready-to-use Java deserialization vulnerability on the targeted sites, but I would only be able to exploit it if I found a way to upload arbitrary files to the server first. So the work wasn’t quite done yet.</p>



<h4>2. Arbitrary file upload</h4>



<p>Finding an arbitrary file upload vulnerability did not look like an easy challenge. To maximize my attack surface, I continued to configure the software on my machine, which required setting up a local Domain Controller and an Active Directory domain to play with.</p>



<p>Fast forward through hours of downloading ISOs, making space on HDDs, VMware Workstation shenanigans, Microsoft Windows Server administration and watching Youtube videos with titles like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRf_uU0vrMM&amp;t=773s">How to Set Up a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller</a>“, and I finally had a setup that allowed me to log in to the admin panel.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="445" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-1024x445.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-1024x445.png 1024w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-300x130.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-768x334.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-700x304.png 700w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13.png 1469w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>I finally set up a working copy of ADSelfService Plus, time to hack.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With full admin access to the application, I could now further map out application features and API endpoints. For obvious reasons, I spent most of my time investigating all different upload features in the application, until I came across one feature that supported uploading a smartcard certificate configuration, resulting in a POST request to <code>/LogonCustomization.do?form=smartCard&amp;operation=Add</code></p>



<p>When I noticed that the uploaded certificate file was stored on the server’s file system without modifying the name, I figured that this might be the way forward to leverage the deserialization bug! So I traced this API call through the source code to find out more about possible ways to attack this.</p>



<p>On a high level, this is how that worked:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="888" height="410" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12.png 888w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-300x139.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-768x355.png 768w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-12-700x323.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"></figure>







<ol><li>A logged-in administrator can upload a smartcard configuration to <code>/LogonCustomization.do?form=smartCard&amp;operation=Add</code>;</li><li>This triggers a backend request to the server’s authenticated RestAPI on <code>/RestAPI/WC/SmartCard?HANDSHAKE_KEY=secret</code> using a secret handshake that is generated on the server side;</li><li>Before executing the requested action, the <code>HANDSHAKE_KEY</code> is validated against a second API endpoint on <code>/servlet/HSKeyAuthenticator?PRODUCT_NAME=ManageEngine+ADSelfService+Plus&amp;HANDSHAKE_KEY=secret</code> which returns <code>SUCCESS</code> or <code>FAILED</code> depending on the passed <code>secret</code>;</li><li>If successful, the uploaded certificate is written to <code>C:\ManageEngine\ADSelfService Plus\bin</code></li></ol>



<p>Interestingly, the <code>/RestAPI</code> endpoint was publicly accessible, so any request with a valid <code>HANDSHAKE_KEY</code> would bypass user authentication and be processed by the server.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the <code>/servlet/HSKeyAuthenticator</code> was also publicly accessible, allowing an unauthorized user to manually verify if an authentication secret was valid or not.</p>



<p>With this in mind, I returned to the now familiar source code.</p>



<h4>3. Bruteforceable authentication key </h4>



<p>I identified two interesting Java classes with some help from <code>grep</code>, and from my installation’s PostgreSQL database that contained a useful inventory of API endpoints and their authentication needs:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="711" height="459" src="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10.png 711w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10-300x194.png 300w, https://honoki.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-10-700x452.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px"><figcaption>Another benefit to local installations of software is full access to the underlying database.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A snippet from <code>HSKeyAuthenticator.class</code> in <code>com.manageengine.ads.fw.servlet</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="5-8" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
      try {
         String message = "FAILED";
         RestAPIKey.getInstance();
         String apiKey = RestAPIKey.getKey();
         String handShakeKey = request.getParameter("HANDSHAKE_KEY");
         if (handShakeKey.equals(apiKey)) {
            message = "SUCCESS";
         }

         PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
         response.setContentType("text/html");
         out.println(message);
         out.close();
      } catch (Exception var7) {
         HSKeyAuthenticator.out.log(Level.INFO, " ", var7);
      }

   }
</pre>



<p>And one from <code>RestAPIKey.class</code> in <code>package com.manageengine.ads.fw.api</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="3-4,11,13" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">  public static void generateKey()
  {
    Long cT = Long.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis());
    key = cT.toString();
    generatedTime = cT;
  }

  public static String getKey()
  {
    Long cT = Long.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis());
    if ((key == null) || (generatedTime.longValue() + 120000L &lt; cT.longValue()))
    {
      generateKey();
    }
    return key;
  }
</pre>



<p>As you can see from those pieces of code, the API authentication key of the server is set to the current time in milliseconds and has a lifespan of 2 minutes. This means that at any given moment, there are 120 000 possible authentication keys (120 seconds * 1000 milliseconds/second).</p>



<p>In other words, if I could generate at least 1000 requests per second consistently over a time span of 2 minutes, I would have a guaranteed hit at the moment the authentication key expired and regenerated. While that seems like a large number for a network-level attack, a successful attack is not necessarily beyond the realm of possibility. Especially keeping in mind that even at a lower than 100% success rate, and given sufficient time, a successful hit becomes more and more likely.</p>



<p>In practice, I quickly had a working proof-of-concept that would brute force my local instance’s secret in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>However, when employing the script against a live target (i.e. over an <em>actual</em> internet connection), I wasn’t as lucky. I ran and reran the script with different configurations and settings for hours, and overnight without result, and was starting to fear my approach would have to be abandoned.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I got temporarily sidetracked because I wasn’t sure what time zone my target servers were running in. I ended up rerunning my script with multiple offsets from my own (CET) until I found out that Java’s <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis()">currentTimeMillis</a></code> apparently returns time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and I needn’t have bothered.</p>



<p>Eventually, after more trial and …</p></div></div>

<h3>Break someone’s code today!</h3><p>On September 1st of 2000 Damian Conway sent a proposal №188, promoting the idea of Private Keys and Methods.</p><p>In those days, Perl’s object-oriented programming relied heavily on hashes. Indeed, a hash can store data values by keys, as well as  references to routines, which is how you can describe an object with data attributes and methods. With bits of syntax sugar here and there one can make shortcuts to work with such an object’s state and behavior.</p><p>So can be done in Raku nowadays:</p><pre id="advent-code-fdb55dec-8cdf-4465-89e6-a64a01297843"><table>

It gives you means to divide your coding efforts into a couple of different realms, one of which has “Nobody but I can use this” policy and its opposite takes the famous “Use it as you please and we will try really, really hard not to break anything knowingly” stance.</p><p>While encapsulation by itself is not a Great Code Problems Solver (you can write scary code anyways!) nor it reduces the amount of bugs (as if it happens!), but it certainly can save you some nerves during rewriting code (which sometimes is a Great Way To Solve Problems) and reduces coupling between components (which does reduce the amount of bugs, right? Hope never dies).</p><p>Here, inspired by the <code>Tie::SecureHash</code> module approach, Damian Conway has proposed a way to support encapsulation in a hash-based object-y system.</p><h3>Sugar – the keyword way</h3><p>The proposal describes a unary function named <code>private</code>, which can be applied to a single hash entry, a slice of entries or a whole hash:</p><pre id="advent-code-922ff4d7-0f96-4ebf-b620-d3383d9fe9e7"><table>

<h3>Conclusion: Huffmanize it!</h3>

<p>Raku wisdom says “Huffmanize your syntax”, as mighty Huffman coding it tells you to make things which are common to type easier to type.</p><p>With the Raku object system being ground up overhauled, the question of encapsulation was not forgotten! Not! In! A! Bit! (sorry for all the line noise you just heard).</p>

<p>Private things in Raku are marked with an exclamation mark. Firstly, it indicates to the reader those code bits are important. Secondly, for attributes it serves as a secondary “sigil”, namely “twigil”, which tells the reader that some interesting scoping is involved here. Thirdly, it looks like it has some class. Fourthly… Do you really expect more reasons here? Please, come up with your ideas in the comments!</p><p>Using Raku for some years, it suddenly strikes with a simple consistency here:</p><pre id="advent-code-e041a903-314f-48ac-a379-d7ea49cce3f1"><table>

          <p>Languages are often judged initially on their "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">Hello,
world!</a>" program.
How easy is it to write? To run? How easy is it to understand? It's a very
simple program, of course, one of the simplest, even... just produce a little
text, and display it, what could be simpler?</p>
<p>It's really not fair to judge a language by such a cursory impression, but it
<em>can</em> give you an idea of what a language <em>values</em> and how it works. What does
the syntax look like? Is it typed? Is it interpreted? You can usually tell a
lot at a glance.</p>
<p>For example, One of Ruby's (many) hello worlds is so simple, it's also Python!</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>'Hello world!'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Often, people coming from interpreted languages experience compiled, systems
languages to be more complicated right off the bat. There is the obvious added
complexity of compiling and running being separate steps, as opposed to simply
pointing an executable at some source code and seeing a result right away, but
there are often syntactical constructs to go along with that...</p>
<p>At first glance, Rust's hello world looks fairly inert, as well:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
    <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>But <code>println!</code> is actually a macro, what does it look like expanded?</p>
<pre><code><span>macro_rules!</span> println {
    () =&gt; ($crate::<span>print!</span>(<span>"\n"</span>));
    ($($arg:tt)*) =&gt; ({
        $crate::io::_print($crate::format_args_nl!($($arg)*));
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice that this <em>also</em> has a macro <em>inside of it.</em> This matches on the
second case (because there is an argument present) and calls into
<code>$crate::format_args_nl!</code> and passes the result of that to <code>$crate::io::_print</code></p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>_print</span></span>(args: fmt::Arguments&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;) {
    print_to(args, &amp;LOCAL_STDOUT, stdout, <span>"stdout"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>which calls into <code>print_to</code>, which looks like</p>
<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>print_to</span></span>&lt;T&gt;(
    args: fmt::Arguments&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;,
    local_s: &amp;<span>'static</span> LocalKey&lt;RefCell&lt;<span>Option</span>&lt;<span>Box</span>&lt;<span>dyn</span> Write + <span>Send</span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,
    global_s: <span><span>fn</span></span>() -&gt; T,
    label: &amp;<span>str</span>,
) <span>where</span>
    T: Write,
{
    <span>let</span> result = local_s
        .try_with(|s| {
            
            
            
            <span>let</span> prev = s.borrow_mut().take();
            <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(<span>mut</span> w) = prev {
                <span>let</span> result = w.write_fmt(args);
                *s.borrow_mut() = <span>Some</span>(w);
                <span>return</span> result;
            }
            global_s().write_fmt(args)
        })
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| global_s().write_fmt(args));

    <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Err</span>(e) = result {
        <span>panic!</span>(<span>"failed printing to {}: {}"</span>, label, e);
    }
}

</code></pre>
<p>Which is, uh, well let's just say it's not exactly <em>simple</em> looking now? There
is a lot going on here!</p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not faulting Rust here at all, my point is exactly the
opposite actually, in that there is <em>always</em> necessarily more going on in a
"Hello world!" than <code>puts "la de da"</code> or similar would have you believe on its
face. Speaking of Ruby's <code>puts</code>, what <em>is</em> the code that runs <code>puts</code> in the
Ruby interpreter itself, which is written in C?</p>
<p>Well it looks like <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/7c2bbd1c7d40a30583844d649045824161772e36/io.c#L7727-L7758">this</a></p>
<pre><code><span>VALUE

</span>{
    <span>int</span> i, n;

    <span>for</span> (i=<span>0</span>; i&lt;argc; i++) {
        <span>if</span> (RB_TYPE_P(argv[i], T_STRING)) {
            <span>line</span> = argv[i];
            <span>goto</span> <span>string</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> (rb_exec_recursive(io_puts_ary, argv[i], out)) {
            <span>continue</span>;
        }
        <span>line</span> = rb_obj_as_string(argv[i]);
      <span>string</span>:
        n = <span>0</span>;
        args[n++] = <span>line</span>;

            args[n++] = rb_default_rs;
        }
        rb_io_writev(out, n, args);
    }

    <span>return</span> Qnil;

<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>We all know that a languages like Ruby or Python are designed explicitly to
hide this sort of complexity from us and let us get on with the dirty business
of munging data blobs or serving web requests or solving sudokus or whatever,
and thank goodness for that, but wow that is <em>quite</em> a lot, isn't it?</p>
<hr>
<p>When people come from languages that were designed to be ergonomic to more
systems oriented languages, they're often jarred by what they perceive to be
code thatis inelegant, ugly, and verbose. To be sure, it sometimes <em>is</em> exactly
that... (although anyone who has worked with a "pretty" language in a production
codebase knows that those are not immune to these descriptors either).</p>
<p>Usually, the tradeoff is explicit: elegance and simplicity for
<em>control</em>...  specific and granular <em>control</em>, over the program that will
eventually be run.  It isn't always necessary, in fact it is almost always _un_necessary,
to have <em>that</em> much control over your program. Obviously, productivity matters,
and if your business is <em><em>insert viable business</em></em>, well it's likely that your
goals are not going to be optimally met by futzing with manual memory
management all day (<a href="https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/">at least from the macro level, in the general
sense</a>).</p>
<p>But what if you <em>do</em> need that control? Well then, <em>you need it</em>. When every
ounce of performance actually is necessary, or on embedded systems with hard
memory constraints, or when writing code for some bespoke or otherwise uncommon
processor.</p>
<p>I'm going to choose one language, Zig, and dive deep into its hello world, but
it is important to note here that my point is not primarily about Zig, it's
about how <em>all</em> languages have to contend with an enormous amount of complexity
in order to do <em>anything</em>, even the simplest of tasks like a hello world
program. Complexity that is, for the most part, hidden from us in our day to
day. So what in the hello world is <em>actually</em> going on then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll be using the most current minor release version of Zig: 0.6.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Let's take a walk</h2>
<p><a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>'s hello world looks like this, from the docs.:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);

<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
    <span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
    <span>try</span> stdout.print(<span>"Hello, {}!\n"</span>, .{<span>"world"</span>});
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you are new to zig, a quick word on this syntax before I get into the gritty
details.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><code>@import</code> is a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Builtin-Functions"><em>compiler
builtin</em></a> function
that assigns the namespace of the file it is referencing to the <code>const</code>
variable on the left hand side.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
  
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just like in C, <code>main</code> is a special function that marks the entry point to a
program after it has been compiled as an executable. Unlike in C, it accepts no
arguments (C's main function has a variety of vagaries that make it a bit
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4207223">unique</a>) and command line input is
available through utility functions to allow easier cross platform use.</p>
<p>It is marked <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Keyword-pub"><code>pub</code></a> so
that it is accessible from outside of the immediate module ('module' here
referring to nothing more than the top level scope of the current namespace...
i.e., the file), this is a necessary step since, as the program's entry point,
<code>main</code> would <em>have</em> to be accessible from outside the immediate scope.</p>
<p><code>fn</code> is the function keyword.</p>
<p><code>main()</code> is the name of the function (and where the argument list <em>would</em> be)
and <code>!void</code> is the return type. Looking a little closer at that return type:</p>
<p>In C, the return type of a function is declared <em>before</em> anything else. This
makes a certain amount of sense: it's congruent with how variables are
declared, after all, and scanning the file you can see clearly "calling this
will get you that."</p>
<p>In Zig, the return type comes after the function declaration but before the
function body. This also makes sense! It's the same in Rust and Go, and seems
to be generally a more modern approach. The reason is actually pretty simple:
doing it this way makes it possible to have a context-free grammar! C and C++
put the parser in a position where it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive">has to understand semantics to even just
<em>parse</em> the source
code.</a></p>
<p>In Zig, <code>main</code> returns <code>void</code> (well, actually, it can return a variety of
things, and if it returns void (which is just a way of saying it doesn't return
anything at all)), it's actually returning
<a href="https://github.com/jfo/zig/blob/7381aaf70e0cad92fc52b79f3aa2a0abb7c3ee04/lib/std/start.zig#L241-L244"><code>0</code></a>
as a success code, but) there is a wrinkle!  <code>void</code> is preceded by an
exclamation mark. This means: "This function is supposed to return <code>void</code>, but
it <em>could</em> fail and return an error." This is an <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Inferred-Error-Sets">inferred error
set</a>, and
whenever a function that <em>could</em> fail is called, the compiler will enforce that
you handle that error at the call site. More on Zig's error handling some other
time, for now it is enough to understand what the <code>!</code> in front of the return
type declaration means. I want to move on to the body of the function, let's go
line by line.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
</code></pre>
<p>So, we can see that this is a call into a standard library function (<code>std</code>)
that returns something that we assign to <code>const stdout</code>. Standard out (stdout) and
standard error (stderr) may be familiar concepts from the shell, but what does it
mean to be referring to <code>stdout</code> here in this program? What exactly <em>is</em>
<code>stdout</code>? Whatever it is, it's being returned by the call to <code>outStream()</code>,
which is a method called on the return value of <code>std.io.getStdOut()</code>, so we
first need to know what <em>that</em> is.</p>
<p>To the source! In the Zig source tree, <code>std</code> lives in <code>lib/std/std.zig</code>, which
is a file that makes a wide variety of functionality available. It includes the line:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> io = <span>@import</span>(<span>"io.zig"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Which is referred to on the <code>std</code> variable as <code>std.io</code> (again, notice the <code>pub</code>
keyword, without which this declared constant would be inaccesible outside of
this immediate scope). Going deeper, into <code>lib/std/io.zig</code>...</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>getStdOut</span></span>() File {
    <span>return</span> File{
        .handle = getStdOutHandle(),
        .capable_io_mode = .blocking,
        .intended_io_mode = default_mode,
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, <code>stdout</code> is a <em>File</em> struct. Let's look at that. It is imported at the top
of <code>io.zig</code> as</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> File = std.fs.File;
</code></pre>
<p>and lives in the source, perhaps unsurprisingly, at <code>lib/std/fs/File.zig</code>. This
struct definition is quite long, so I'll focus on what we want to look at, the
<code>outStream()</code> method.</p>
<h2>An aside: methods vs functions</h2>
<p>Zig doesn't <em>really</em> have methods, but it's useful to talk about a special
class of functions <em>as</em> methods, since the calling convention supports implicit
passing of <code>self</code> when called on a struct "instance" using dot syntax. Let me
show you what I mean.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);

<span>con…</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>tl;dr: Four graphs show that almost all of Mozilla’s revenue comes
from Google et al., and the majority of its expenses go to software
development.</em></p>

<p>In my <a href="https://civilityandtruth.com/2020/08/13/mozillas-uncertain-future/">last post about Mozilla</a> I included a bit of data and a
lot of opinions. In this post I’ll reverse that and provide more data
and fewer opinions.</p>

<p>I was interested in knowing at a high level what were the major
categories of Mozilla’s revenue and (what’s a bit more interesting)
what were the major categories of Mozilla’s expenses. To do this I
went through the consolidated financial statements for the Mozilla
Foundation and Mozilla Corporation, extracted the data I was
interested in, and applied a bit of R code.</p>

<p>The graph above shows the major categories of revenue for Mozilla from
2005 through 2018, the last year for which we have financial
data. Note that I consolidated some categories of revenue to simplify
the graph. For example, I combined income from interest and dividends,
investment gains and losses, and similar categories into an overall
category of miscellaneous revenue.</p>

<p>The results are not surprising: by far the major driver of revenue was
royalties received from Google and other search engine vendors, with
everything else (including grants and donations to the Mozilla
Foundation) being relatively negligible.</p>

<figure>
  <p><a href="https://civilityandtruth.com/assets/images/mozilla-revenue-categories-pct.png"><img src="https://civilityandtruth.com/assets/images/mozilla-revenue-categories-pct-embed.png" alt="Graph of Mozilla’s main categories of revenue as percentages of total revenue"></a></p>
  <figcaption>This graph shows the main categories of revenue for
the combined Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation from the

of total revenues. Graph © 2020 Frank Hecker, made available under the

</figure>

<p>The data for the various high-level categories is bit more interesting
when expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Again, royalties from
Google and other search engine providers dominate the picture, never
going below 90% of total revenue and typically at 95% or greater.</p>

<p>There’s one interesting anomaly for the years prior to 2009, in which
miscellaneous income rose to almost 10% of total revenue and then
dropped below zero (i.e., it constituted a net loss). This appears to
be due to Mozilla Foundation and/or Corporation investments doing well
in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008, and then suffering
losses. Since 2009 miscellaneous income has been more stable as a
percentage of total revenue, possibly due to the favorable economic
environment and/or more conservative investment strategies.</p>

<p>Also, for future reference note the category relating to subscriptions
and advertising, which is currently under 5% of total revenues. I
presume that revenues relating to Pocket are assigned to that
category, and that revenues from the Mozilla VPN and other services
will go there as well. It will be interesting to see in future
financial statements whether that category grows substantially as a
percentage of total revenue. That will be a key indicator of whether
Mozilla is going to be able to move beyond its dependence on Google and
other search engine providers.</p>

<p>The graph above shows the main categories of expenses incurred by the
Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation considered together. As one
might expect, the largest category of expenses is for activities
related to software development, including the salaries of the
software developers themselves.</p>

<p>The next two largest categories are marketing, i.e., activities
relating to promotion of Mozilla products and services, and general
and administrative, i.e., all the support activities needed to keep
Mozilla running, including the salaries of people not involved in
software development. It’s interesting to note that marketing-related
expenses seem to have leveled off somewhat in the years leading up to
2018.</p>

<p>The programs category includes things other than software development
that further the nonprofit goals of Mozilla. Mozilla Foundation grants
and fellowships go here, among others.</p>

</figure>

<p>The final graph shows the data in the previous graph expressed as a
percentage of total expenses. Here again we see the large amount of
expenses relating to software development, just above 60% in the years
leading up to 2018.</p>

<p>Marketing and general and administrative expenses have tended to be in
the range of 10% to 20%, with marketing sometimes higher than G&amp;A
and sometimes lower. Finally, program-related expenses have been
rising in the years leading up to 2018, and if this trend continues in
2019 and beyond may come to make up around 10% of total Mozilla
spending.</p>

<p>That concludes this brief tour of Mozilla’s finances. There is more
that could be said about Mozilla’s finances, but that’s a task I will
leave to others; see the section below for how to get started.</p>

<p>Finally, thanks to all who read my prior post and tweeted about it,
and to those who ended up following me on Twitter or subscribing to my
(very occasional) newsletter. If you’re interested in more of my
thoughts on Mozilla I will likely end up disappointing you: this will
probably be my final Mozilla-related post for a while, and perhaps
forever. Feel free to unfollow me or unsubscribe unless you have an
interest in whatever other topics I might end up writing about next.</p>

<p>A lot of my Google searches are specific and require lots of typing, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>site:cppreference.com OR site:cplusplus.com realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This searches for "realloc" on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">cppreference.com</a> and <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/">cplusplus.com</a>.
To reduce the amount of typing, I built a command line tool that allows me to
use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)">macros</a> that expand into larger phrases. E.g. I can write</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{cpp} realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>instead of writing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>site:cppreference.com OR site:cplusplus.com realloc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this week's post, I'll show you how I built this tool. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html">pathlib</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">re</a> modules to parse macros from a text file.</li>

</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I could copy-and-paste these URLs into my browser. But, since I use macOS, I
create a <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Functions">shell function</a> that uses the <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/open.html">open</a> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>$ gg() { open "$(./search-google "$@")" ; }
$ gg {movie} alien 1979
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>(Opens URL in my browser.)
</code></pre>

<p>I place the macro file in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory">home directory</a> using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.home">pathlib.Path.home</a>.</p>
<p>I read from the macro file using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.read_text">pathlib.Path.read_text</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.finditer">re.finditer</a>.
I use a regular expression to extract the macros from the macro file, and I use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip">str.strip</a> to remove excess whitespace from the macros.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format_map">str.format_map</a> to perform the macro substitutions.</p>
<p>Instead of performing substitutions until I hit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)">fixed point</a>, I perform a
finite number of substitutions.
(This is the constant <code>MAX_MACRO_SUBSTITIONS</code>.)
I do this because it is an easy way to prevent unbounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>, and, in
practice, my macros are not complex enough to cause this strategy to fail.</p>
<p>A macro substitution will fail if I reference a macro that doesn't exist, e.g.
<code>{xyxhkj}</code>.
I handle this by using the context manager <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.suppress">contextlib.suppress</a>.
This allows me to catch the relevant exception and stop performing
substitutions, without terminating the whole program.</p>
<p>I build the URL by combining a constant prefix,
<code>https://www.google.com/search?q=</code>, with the query string.
I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.quote_plus">urllib.parse.quote_plus</a> to properly escape the query string. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>import urllib.parse
query = "site:news.ycombinator.com haskell"
print(query)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>site:news.ycombinator.com haskell
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>print(urllib.parse.quote_plus(query))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>site%3Anews.ycombinator.com+haskell
</code></pre>

<p>In this week's post, you learned how to build a command line tool that helps
you search Google.
You learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html">pathlib</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">re</a> modules to parse the macros.
And you used the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html">urllib.parse</a> module to properly construct the URL.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read about the different Google search operators. (<a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en">"Refine web searches" via
google.com</a>.)</p>
<p>Create a few macros that would be useful to you. Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a macro that restricts searches to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby-lang.org</a>.</li>
<li>Create a macro that searches for upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5K_run">5K races</a> in a specified city.</li>
<li>CreateÂ&nbsp;a macro that searches a person's name, but excludes results from
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</li>
</ul>

Erdős, who is well-known for his contributions to number theory, set theory, probability theory, graph theory, and more, as well as the invention of the Erdős Number, a measure of one's proximity to having collaborated with him, is of course a subject himself. That said, in Hoffman's biography of him, there is a bit about the behavior of mathematicians and a lone physicist that does well to embody the spiritual and cognitive differences between the two groups, both of which share a passion for mathematical thinking but nevertheless are separable beasts.&nbsp;</p><p><span></span>The excerpt of interest tells of a mathematics conference in which a group of mathematicians return to the coffee table after a talk only to find a puzzle.</p><p><a name="more"></a><i>The rest filed out and raced toward a folding table that supported two large brown plastic tanks, one labeled WITH CAFFEINE, the other WITHOUT CAFFEINE. The mathematicians had already tanked up once, before the graph theo- rist's talk, and now the labels on the tanks were curiously switched. The mathematicians were in a tizzy and stared, puzzled, at the tanks. Their collective brainpower, fine for discerning the latest wrinkles in infinite graph theory, was stalling out on the case of the true Joe.</i></p><p><i>Finally a lightbulb went off in the head of a jovial, beer-bellied fellow in a JOY OF SETS T-shirt. He stepped forward and filled his Styrofoam cup, half from one tank and half from the other.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>"I see," laughed one of his compatriots, "the game-theoretic solution!"</i></p><p><i>"I have another solution," said a thin man whose hands trembled slightly, apparently from a caffeine high. He&nbsp;</i><i>filled his cup a quarter full from one of the tanks.&nbsp;</i><i>"This is the asymptotic solution," he announced. "I'm already so wired I only want a little bit more; whatever is in the cup, I win."</i></p><p><i>A bystander who was a physicist rather than a mathematician didn't understand the need for all this sophisticated thinking. He pointed out that one tank was bigger than the other, and that the bigger tank presumably held caffeinated coffee since more people drink it than drink decaf. &nbsp;The mathematicians were taken aback by the simplicity of the solution. "Our different approaches," said the physicist, "remind me of an old joke. A physicist and a mathematician are flying cross-country together. Each is keeping a diary of the trip. They fly over a white horse in Iowa. The physicist writes, 'There is a white horse in Iowa.' The mathematician writes, 'There exists, somewhere in the Midwest, a horse, white on top.'"</i></p><p>For all that has been written about the difference between physicists and mathematicians, especially with the goal of illuminating their inner minds, this passage provides both a reasonable illustration and a good laugh.</p><p><b><a href="http://twitter.com/philliplevin"> Did you enjoy this?

<![CDATA[Why Remote Working Is Bad]]>

August 15, 2020 | https://aboutsnack.com/blog/why-remote-work-is-bad | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aboutsnack.com/blog/why-remote-work-is-bad">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Tips for when the novelty of remote working wears off</span></p></div><div><p>Many of us have unexpectedly found ourselves remote working this year. At first, it seemed like a dream - no more commute! No more tedious office politics! An extra hour in bed in the morning! But now that we've all been working away in our spare rooms and on our sofas for weeks on end the novelty is beginning to wear off.</p>
<p>Here are some of the downsides to remote working, and tips for how to overcome them…</p>
<h2>It's impossible to focus</h2>
<p>When you're working in isolation it can be really hard to keep your mind from wandering. Whether it's taking a minute to load the dishwasher, feed the cat or plan your weekend it's all too easy for those five minute breaks to become half an hour of mindless scrolling on TikTok.</p>
<p>It's a fine balance between keeping on task, and allowing your mind a bit of breathing room - after all in the buzz and noise of an office you'd likely face micro distractions all day.</p>
<p>A great way to keep yourself motivated, productive and focussed is to try the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pomodoro Method</a>. It's a scientifically proven technique where you knuckle down and work in 25 minute bursts, followed by timed five minute breaks to refresh your mind. There are great <a href="https://tomato-timer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pomodoro apps</a> available so that you can time it on your phone, or even on your <a href="https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/fa42ebf3-10ec-4b0e-8dbb-2e36d4020f0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fitbit</a>!</p>
<h2>It can be lonely</h2>
<p>If you're used to going into an office every day it's a big adjustment to miss out on the team culture. All those water cooler moments, team meetings and coffee breaks really help to top up your mind's need for social interaction. You might have found Greg from accounts seriously annoying with his constant holiday stories, but now that you don't speak to him (or anybody else) for hours on end you strangely find yourself wondering if he ever got to go to Cancun?</p>
<p>Teams using Slack can help their members to keep social interaction going by using tools such as <a href="https://aboutsnack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Snack</a>, which enables spontaneous video chats between colleagues, with ice breaker questions and timers to keep it fun and brief.</p>
<h2>Work/life balance becomes a blur</h2>
<p>You've always wanted more 'life' in your work/life balance, but now that work is in your home, and you only have to walk a few steps from your bed to your desk, it all seems a bit too close for comfort.</p>
<p>The ideal situation is of course to have a home office that you can close the door on at the end of the day, but if that's not possible, consider solutions such as a Murphy desk that you can close up when you clock off so that your work space isn't staring you in the face as you try to relax.</p>
<h2>Creativity can dry up</h2>
<p>When you are sitting in the same environment day in day out, without the stimulation of your team around you, it can be hard to keep coming up with fresh new ideas. When you find yourself hitting the brick wall, take some time to see what the competition are up to. Also have a look at your customers, see what they're talking about on social media, or how they are adapting to current circumstances. By bringing the outside into your day you can create serendipity by stumbling across something that inspires your next brilliant project. Sometimes you have to get out of your zone and create your own lightbulb moment!</p>
<h2>Unexpected video calls</h2>
<p>There's no getting around this one. Just make sure you at least change out of your pyjamas each day!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Last Friday, my carbon footprint dropped from 7 tons per year to 0. That is like saving 6 trees or over 200 square feet of Arctic ice every year.</p>



<p>For those who are not familiar with the terminology, that is okay. I was like you not too long ago. A person’s carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide produced directly or indirectly in support of the life that person leads. When a person has a carbon footprint of zero, that means they are carbon neutral. In other words, it means that their impact on Earth’s atmosphere is zero. It is neutral.</p>



<p>It took me a few years to get my carbon footprint down to 7 tons per year in the first place. It used to be closer to the American average of 19.5. We are lucky that what is good for Earth is often good for us too. I started doing things that were good for Earth and good for me, mostly because they were good for me. I did not know much about the climate crisis back then.</p>



<p>I walked to work. I kept my electric bill down. I tried to buy things less often and more locally. I lived in <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/04/17/minimalism/">minimalist </a>apartments in San Francisco and New York. I even started <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/01/21/the-gluten-free-vegan-diet-intermittent-fasting-and-green-smoothies/">eating vegan </a>during the week. These choices made me healthier and happier while lowering my carbon footprint. Still, they did not make me carbon neutral. I did not think that was possible.</p>



<p>Then I found <a href="https://projectwren.com/">Wren</a>.</p>



<p>Wren made it look easy to go carbon neutral. It quickly turned out to be even easier than it looked.</p>



<p>Wren helped me calculate my carbon footprint with some simple questions. Then it showed me how much I could contribute on a monthly basis to any of a few trustworthy projects that would offset my carbon footprint to zero. I chose to support a <a href="https://projectwren.com/projects/community-tree-planting">community tree planting project</a> in East Africa. Like all the other things that are good for Earth and good for us, the tree planting project is good for Earth and good for the people involved. I committed less than $6 per month. That was the moment I became carbon neutral.</p>



<p>Some people say the climate crisis is too large a problem for any individual to make a difference. Those people must not have read about The Civil Rights Movement. They must have missed the #MeToo Movement too. They must not know Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old environmental activist from Sweden who stood up to the leaders of the world and last year became the youngest ever&nbsp;<em>Time Person of the Year</em>.</p>



<p>We cannot all be the next Greta Thunberg, but we can all join the global movement to end the climate crisis. We can all do things that are better for Earth and better for us. We can all become climate neutral as individuals, and then as humanity. We can all help save Earth.</p>



<p>I recommend going to <a href="https://projectwren.com/">projectwren.com</a> to get started.</p>

	<div>
		<p>While I often say that I don’t respond to recent business news here, I have also recently broken that rule a few times. So I decided to look at the potential Tiktok ban in the US. To connect this potential ban to my other writing I’ll go back to Merton’s five causes of unintended consequences to point out some less discussed reasons for why the ban might be good or bad.</p>
<p>Related to the discussion around Tiktok, I was reminded that this week marks the 30th year since I first visited mainland China. I remember this because I was in Beijing at the same time that Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded Kuwait — the first week of August 1990. The hotel TV did not black out that specific part of the news.</p>
<p>Since that time I went to mainland China perhaps around 50 times both for work and to travel. For a large country with big regional differences, I don’t count 50 trips as a lot. But I’ve found my perspective to be different from that of others who spent more time there simply because I have seen the country over a longer time.</p>
<p>While it’s now been two years since I have been to China, also for work, a lot of my experience was of a China that doesn’t really exist anymore. Many of my trips to the country were in the 1990s and early 2000s. First off, that was a cash society and not the mobile payments-driven one of today. On longer trips, I had several occurrences where I needed to coax bank employees through a long process of filling out long handwritten forms so that I could make an international withdrawal. Today’s China of mobile payments (and monitoring) is one that I haven’t experienced that much personally. For example, in a previous <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/a-second-step/">article</a> I used a picture of stacks of bike share bikes which were plentiful, but not accessible to me because I didn’t have a bank account linked to the relevant app.</p>
<p>Many of my trips in China were also before smart phones were common. It did not hinder anything about my experiences there, it just made them different than they would be today.</p>
<div dir="auto">
<p>In a way connected to the previous two, another experience I had in China was that a lot of my trips were during a period of growing freedom. I did many things that are probably unusual or impossible today, including making friends with <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/uyghurs-xinjiang-onward-to-the-inevitable/">Uyghurs in Xinjiang</a>, seeing multiple arrests (related to <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/very-different-funeral-deng-xiaoping/">Deng Xiaoping’s funeral</a> and Falun Gong), having thoughtful discussions with people I met on China’s development, the US, Taiwan, and other topics.</p>
<p>But back to Tiktok, a popular short video app that is an American company owned by ByteDance, a Chinese parent company. Tiktok’s corporate behavior and the history of non-reciprocity of tech in China is problematic. Does a ban or potential sale to an American company (perhaps Microsoft) make sense?</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/">pointed out</a> that an issue with Tiktok is not only that it censors political information unwanted by China’s government, but its algorithmic feed determines what content users see. Tiktok has hundreds of millions of users which means that at scale it can influence what ideas become the norm, whether by suppressing undesirable ones or encouraging users to avoid ones that would lead to their own accounts being suppressed.</p>
<p>And as others have mentioned, Tiktok’s users were responsible for low turnout at Trump’s political rally in Tulsa. How should we look at the potential to ban an app in the US — something that is common to do in China?</p>

<h2>Merton’s List</h2>
<p>Robert Merton’s five causes of unintended consequences are <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/acquiring-ignorance/">ignorance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/basic-values/">basic values</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/long-reach-of-short-term-interests/">short vs long-term interests</a>, the <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-self-defeating-prophecy">self-defeating prophecy,</a> and <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/origins-of-error">error</a>. His list is high-level, but it will do for today.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at each related to Tiktok and why we are in a situation to have this discussion.</p>
<h3>Ignorance</h3>
<p>One of the differences between the US and China is that it is easier to learn about the American side than the Chinese side. The exchange of people is relatively lopsided (more Chinese citizens studying and working in the US than the reverse). American customs are easier to learn. In spite of the above, the China side invests more time to learn about the US than the reverse. This is a fault of interest and expectations on the US side.</p>
<p>As I wrote in my article on <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/acquiring-ignorance/">ignorance</a>, “First-order effects of ignorance include incorrect decisions. Second-order effects include not understanding why the decisions are incorrect.”</p>
<h3>Basic Values</h3>
<p>From the typical American perspective, a grating part of a ban is that “it’s not who we are, it’s just not something we do.” Let users decide where to put their time. After all, if they want to use a well-designed app that has millions of users, but also concerns around security and influence, it’s their choice. The best ideas will win out. The problem with this argument is that most of the past examples of this argument have been domestic products. The US has also been quite critical of (though seldom willing to ban or break up) domestic tech companies that gain too much power.</p>
<p>Should the same be extended to foreign companies, at least those owned by antagonistic countries? Tiktok’s own censorship, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/15/tiktoks-beijing-roots-fuel-censorship-suspicion-it-builds-huge-us-audience/">including that of</a> protests in Hong Kong, treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, and even of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-censorship-users-deemed-ugly-overweight-or-disabled-2020-3">unattractive users</a>, is also contrary to US basic values.</p>
<h3>Short vs Long-Term Interests</h3>
<p>Tiktok’s American management of course came out against the ban. I have no idea what they actually think, though I do remember <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/upton_sinclair_138285#:~:text=Upton%20Sinclair%20Quotes&amp;text=It%20is%20difficult%20to%20get%20a%20man%20to%20understand%20something,upon%20his%20not%20understanding%20it.">that</a> “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.”</p>
<p>Tiktok claims that it will create 10,000 jobs in the US over the next three years. The company is rallying its users in its defense. Why wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>But this is where the interests of Tiktok (the short-term) don’t match with the interests of the US (the long-term). Yes, banning Tiktok would leave its users without the entertainment (until they find a new app or a workaround). The ban would probably eliminate some jobs. But in the timeline of social media companies, perhaps we shouldn’t care. We rarely mourn for MySpace today, even if it’s decline was for market reasons. Other products will fill Tiktok’s void. Long-term detriments or benefits of its ban may include the slippery slope of banning other apps, opening the way for other countries to ban apps, and more.</p>
<p>Another view on the ban is that it comes up within 100 days of the presidential election. Government timescales in the US are shorter than those in China not because of the different ages of the countries but because the US has elections every four years and the political party in the executive branch often flips, while China has one party and Xi Jinping might last for decades now that he removed term limits.</p>
<h3>The Self-Defeating Prophecy</h3>
<p>I’ll just quote my earlier article on <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-self-defeating-prophecy/">this type</a>: “I think of this phenomenon as a tortoise and hare situation. Not the “slow and steady” part, but instead that the unexpected nature of who would win a tortoise-hare race is baked into the participants’ behavior. The hare only stops to rest because it is so obvious that it will win, which in turn becomes the reason it loses.”</p>
<h3>Error</h3>
<p>A common error in American discussions of Tiktok is assumptions about a bilateral nature of its ban. China has banned or blocked many American companies for years now. A partial list of these American companies includes Google, Youtube, Facebook, Wikipedia, Instagram, and Twitter.</p>
<p>It was a mistake to not require reciprocity for the years these companies have been blocked in China. That being said, Tiktok is the first China-owned tech company to gain the consumer mass market in the US.</p>
<p>The explanations for banning US tech companies in China includes both information flow but also the ability for Chinese versions of these products to have a chance. It’s like saying that the US should ban Tiktok so that domestic companies have the ability to build their own short video apps. That’s a concept typically not considered for Americans.</p>
<p>And what happens when the movement is in a different direction? What about Zoom, an American company that has banned user activity in the US at China’s request? Actually, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfg1ce/list_of_companies_under_chinas_censorship_orders/">the list</a> of non-Chinese companies companies complying with pressure from China (to say nothing of those doing so proactively) is quite long.</p>
<p><span>The Opposite Trap</span></p>
<div dir="auto">
<p>There is a common lack of critical thinking about Tiktok but a prevalence of imagination for reasons Trump has for its ban. One of the frequent explanations is the Tulsa Rally. From a recent Forbes article: “What if this has nothing to do with China, nothing to do with national security? What if this does have everything to do with Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June?”</p>
<p>Such an argument actually is connected to national security. Such an outcome could have just as easily happened to Biden (or to Clinton had she been elected). I read much of the argument against Tiktok’s ban as being more about supporting the opposite of whatever Trump says rather than critical thinking about outcomes.</p>
<p>Quotes like this one <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-tiktok-ban-hypocrisy/">from Wired</a> also make me question the supporting examples: “For the past several years, I’ve warned that the biggest threat to the internet is the technological cold war between the reasonably open, free internet of the West, and the closed authoritarian internet of the East. Now, with the President’s repudiation of free speech and open markets, I worry whether there isn’t as much difference between the two sides after all.” For the long lists of companies above and the large volume of domestic speech critical of Trump when there is no such comparison for Xi — I take this to be, well, hypocrisy on the part of the writer making this claim.</p>
<p>Even the <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1289412933991174144?s=20">ACLU seemed to be</a> both against and for a Tiktok ban in recent tweets: “Banning an app like TikTok, which millions of Americans use to communicate with each other, is a danger to free expression and technologically impractical.” But the prevented free expression on Tiktok, noted above, is a great danger too. And since when does the ACLU care about …</p></div></div></article></div>

<p><em>Nathan Law, 27, has spent the past seven years fighting China’s gradual takeover of Hong Kong. In 2017, he and other activists were sentenced to prison after thousands of Hong Kong citizens joined together to form the umbrella movement and called for free elections. In 2016, Law’s election to the Hong Kong parliament was declared invalid on dubious grounds. He fled to London this year after Beijing enacted a new national security law for Hong Kong on June 30. The law is directed against activities deemed to be subversive, separatist or terrorist from a Chinese perspective, and security forces have gained unprecedented power as a result.</em></p>


<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Mr. Law, you left Hong Kong at about the same time the new Chinese national security law was imposed. Was that a personal or a political decision?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> It was a bit of both. Of course, every one of us with a high-profile position in international advocacy work is very vulnerable under the national security law.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Who are you referring to when you say "us”?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> Joshua Wong, for example, and Jimmy Lai, Martin Lee, and others. It has become very difficult for us to continue our work and, for example, demand a strategy of less appeasement to China. So, I talked with Joshua and we agreed that I am suitable for bearing the role of being an advocate of Hong Kong outside Hong Kong. Here, I can speak freely.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How has the situation in Hong Kong developed since the security law came into effect?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> There is a politics of fear and terror dispersing. Nobody knows exactly what is going to happen because the law deliberately leaves so much room for interpretation. And I don’t think that the security bureau has actually established themselves to operate fully at this stage -- we are only in the very first weeks. But they have already arrested individuals who were merely in possession of stickers or flags with the words "Free Hong Kong, revolution of our time.”</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The slogan of the democracy movement.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Law:</strong> Some of my friends are deleting their Facebook posts. They are concerned, especially for their families. Many people are testing the waters, really guessing where the line is. So, the law is encouraging political fear and people self-censoring and the erosion of our freedom of expression and assembly.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL: </strong>What are your thoughts on the Hong Kong government delaying the election that had been planned for September for one year?</p><p><strong>Law: </strong>The reason the government delayed the election is that the government is afraid of losing and is trying to buy time to reverse its very low popularity. I don’t think it will work -- people will still be very angry with them as long as they are still deploying heavy-handed approaches&nbsp;in Hong Kong. It shows that the law and procedures in Hong Kong serve Beijing's political agenda. Hong Kong’s government is not accountable&nbsp;to the people and it's a puppet that is ordered to destroy&nbsp;the freedom of Hong Kong’s people.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Is the security law the nail in the coffin for the movement?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> I don’t think so. Actually, it will transform the movement in a more subtle form that circumvents the restriction. And you can see that there are a lot of people voicing their opposition despite COVID-19. The atmosphere in Hong Kong has changed. We’re in a period of quietness now, but it’s just a calm surface before the storm.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Are you concerned about your family?</p>

<p><strong>Law:</strong> Of course. If you look at the implementation of the national security law in mainland China, then it not only targets you -- but also your family, your friends, your colleagues.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> You recently wrote in a newspaper column that your mother witnessed the Cultural Revolution and is about to witness another one. Isn’t that exaggerated? As many as 1.8 million people died during the Cultural Revolution.</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> Well, I don’t want to claim that we are the most tragic people in history. But it is a cultural revolution because of the foreseeable transformation of society. We can already see the beginning of it. For example, in the national security law, there is a clause that, if you turn in someone else, you could have a reduction in your own sentence. That encourages a reporting culture. And that’s the thing that cultural revolutions emphasize -- people monitoring people. With no trust in society, the social bonds between people are getting destroyed and infiltrated with totalitarianism and the narrative of power.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> What does your worst-case scenario look like?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> That none of us can run for election on a pro-democracy platform anymore. That the secret police arrest you in the early morning, and none of your friends know where you are. That you are being locked in a remote detention camp, being tortured, just like what happened to Chinese dissidents. That is the worst we can get. I see it as my responsibility to turn the fight against that into an international front.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> As a kind of foreign minister of your movement?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> I wouldn’t put it that way. I am just trying to be a voice.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How did you spend your last day in Hong Kong?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> Like all the other days before. I met with my team and pretended to campaign in order to avoid worries. I needed to keep it secret because, if I were to be indicted and people helped me or they recognized my leaving, but didn’t turn me in, they would also have been in danger. I didn’t do anything special.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> That can’t have been easy. You knew that you probably wouldn’t be able to return to Hong Kong for years.</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> It was difficult. But sometimes, all you can do is hold back your emotions and try to be as calm as possible to protect others.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Did you have any troubles leaving the city?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> I thought I might have been blacklisted by the authorities, but it turned out I wasn’t. So, I left quite smoothly.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Why did you choose London?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> London is a very special place. I’ve been here a couple of times before. The United Kingdom has an historical relationship with Hong Kong, and they play a major role in dealing with the issue. And I think London as a media hub is good place to tell people that there is not only a warfare going on between China and the United States. Europe needs to become a more united values-bound front against the authoritarianism in China.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Do you feel safe in London?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> We all know that danger is everywhere because China’s reach could be really extensive. I’ve just read news about a New Zealand car crash that killed two Chinese dissidents, and the authorities found it very suspicious. So, you have to be extremely cautious about the surroundings and move frequently, trying not to expose yourself too much.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Is that why we are meeting here in Regent’s Park.</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> That’s one reason. The other is, it’s beautiful here. I love how green London is.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> But even here, you are in some ways surrounded by China everywhere. When you land at Heathrow Airport, take a black cab into the city, eat at Pizza Express or watch a Premier League game with the Wolverhampton Warriors, Chinese money is involved everywhere.</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> Yes, I think the West has long underestimated what’s happening with that kind of investment. There is no such thing as independent companies in China. They all have to listen to the orders of the Communist Party. That’s why the global community needs to act as a coherent front whenever they do business with China: to enforce human rights, to hold them accountable.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How would you judge the British government’s recent approach toward Beijing?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> They are moving in the right direction. And fast. At the beginning of this year, the U.K. government said it will continue using Huawei for its 5G network, but it changed course completely in several months after the pandemic and after the Hong Kong protests. But in order to address the internal human rights violations in mainland China and the brutality in Hong Kong as well as in Xinjiang, there are a lot more things the UK and others could do.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Such as?</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> For example, boycotting the Winter Olympics in 2022. That would really be a strong signal. As would be recognizing Taiwan and addressing the human rights violations in Xinjiang. You could impose laws stating that companies that use Xinjiang labor should not be allowed in your country. We’ve got a lot of tools, and Germany as China’s biggest trading partner could play a crucial role in this debate.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> But the Germans are clearly trying not to get into any trouble with Beijing.</p><p><strong>Law:</strong> It wouldn't be appropriate for us to say we are disappointed by Germany. But we know the history of Germany as a champion of liberal values after the Wall came down, its understanding of the problem of totalitarianism and authoritarianism. We are talking about a country that has supposedly embraced democratic values more than the others, but they are still prioritizing trade far more than human rights. The least the German government could do is suspend the extradition deal with Hong Kong as the UK has done. When it comes to preserving democratic values, Germany is a very symbolic place. Chancellor Merkel should know that.</p>

Product A is letting you use it without engaging with you <strong>like it swore silence.</strong></p><p>Product B is popping up messages when you are in the product to <strong>let you know there is a new feature or give a tip that will make you a more efficient user.</strong></p><p><em>I would choose Product B over Product A any day because I know there is a business behind it that cares about the users.</em></p><p><strong>In-app messaging</strong> is a proven way to improve <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/increase-user-engagement/">customer engagement</a> and satisfaction with a product, and also <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/increase-retention/">increase customer retention</a>.</p><p><strong>But only when it is done right. </strong></p><p>Done well, it helps show users how to get the most out of the product that they are using and drives sales to relevant upgrades and features. Done badly, it is a nuisance that <strong>breaks users’ workflows and drives customers away.</strong></p><p><em>With UserGuiding, you can create in-app messages and product tours in minutes, <strong>without coding</strong>. <a href="http://panel.userguiding.com/register">Start your </a><a href="https://panel.userguiding.com/register">free</a><a href="http://panel.userguiding.com/register"> trial.</a></em></p><p>In this article, I tried to explain what a good in-app message is, collected and examined the best examples I have seen to help you start using in-app messages<strong> like a champ.</strong></p><p>You can <a href="#examples">jump straight to the examples by clicking here.</a></p><h2 id="ftoc-heading-1">What is In-App Messaging</h2><p>In-app or in-product messaging is the term for the notifications that users receive while they are using an application or product:</p><p>This can be <strong>slip-outs, pop-ups, modals</strong>, really a<strong>nything that catches the user’s attention</strong> to provide them with information or call them to action.</p><p>In-app messaging should be clearly distinguished from<strong> push notifications</strong>, which pop-up when the app is closed and appear as an external notification on a user’s device.</p><p>The type of messaging that can be delivered in-app can really be anything but is generally <strong>up-sales, notifications about new features, guidance, and requests for feedback</strong>.</p><p>In-app messaging works well because you have a captive audience. Also, anyone who uses the product can receive messages without having to provide separate permissions. This is in contrast to push notifications, which must be opted into or out of separately.</p><p><em>About 30% of people opt out of push notification, <strong>which I could relate.</strong></em></p><p>In-app messages can also be worked into the user’s workflow. Users can be shown <strong>relevant information</strong> while they are using the product, and therefore when the information is most useful to them.</p><p>They can also be given different information at different stages of their workflow to ensure that they always receive the <strong>most important and effective messaging.</strong></p><p>According to<a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/6-stats-that-prove-how-important-push-notifications-in-app-messaging-are-to-your-apps-success" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"> Localytics</a>, in-app messaging, <strong>when done well</strong>, can lead to user retention rates <strong>3.5 times higher</strong> than for products not using this feature. It can also improve conversion rates fourfold.</p><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1160x373.jpg" alt="what is in app message" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1536x494.jpg 1536w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-2048x659.jpg 2048w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1920x617.jpg 1920w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-scaled.jpg 2560w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1536x494.jpg 1536w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-2048x659.jpg 2048w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-1920x617.jpg 1920w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-in-app-message-scaled.jpg 2560w"></figure><h2 id="ftoc-heading-2">How to create the perfect In-app Messages</h2><p><em><strong>Now it all comes down to separating in-app messages from annoying, life-devouring pop-ups</strong> and I will try my best to do so.</em></p><p>First and foremost, the key is to <strong>provide people with information that has value</strong> to them. Guidance on how to make the most of the product <strong>has value. </strong></p><p>Providing feedback <strong>has value</strong>, as it lets you make a better product.</p><p>While a user may not wish to upgrade, knowing that option is available <strong>has value.</strong> This is what sets in-app messaging from the kind of pop-up marketing that we expect to see on websites.</p><p>So, <strong>as a rule of best practice</strong>, if you haven’t got anything engaging to say, it’s best you don’t say anything.</p><p>Aside from that, the main things to consider are <strong>timing, relevance, personalization, and conciseness.</strong></p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-3">5 Steps to the Perfect In-app Message</h3><h4>1- The right user needs to get the right message at the right moment.</h4><p>This refers, in the first place, to properly identifying and <strong><a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/customer-segmentation/">segmenting audiences</a></strong>.</p><p>You don’t want to be asking brand new customers for feedback, or directing super-users to introductory tutorials. You should know what type of customer the user is, and provide them with<strong> information that is relevant to them.</strong></p><h4>2- Users also need to receive messages at the right stage in their <strong>workflow</strong>.</h4><p>There is nothing more annoying than a message popping up while you are trying to concentrate on doing a complicated or creative task.</p><p>Messages are better displayed when users are <strong>transitioning</strong> and have the capacity to give the information appropriate attention. For example, guidance should be provided when users are starting a task, and feedback should be requested once they complete a task.</p><h4>3- Wherever possible, messaging should be <strong>personal</strong>.</h4><p>This means both properly <strong>segmenting</strong> the user so that they receive relevant information, but also <strong>personalization</strong> features such as addressing the user by name, and perhaps saying good morning or good evening depending on the time of day and the time zone.</p><p>This can have a surprisingly strong impact when it comes to making the customer feel valued.</p><h4>4- Messages should communicate their purpose in as few words as possible,</h4><p> giving the customer the most important information that they need <strong>at a glance.</strong> The message can then call them to engage further if they decide that the information is of value to them at that moment.</p><h4>5- <strong>Calls to action</strong> should always be clear,</h4><p>and the user should never be left wondering how they can follow up on the information provided in the message. Users should always have the option to dismiss a message, but to return and follow-up later if now is not a good moment for them to engage.</p><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1160x373.jpg" alt="how to create in-app messages" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1536x494.jpg 1536w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-2048x659.jpg 2048w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1920x617.jpg 1920w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-scaled.jpg 2560w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1536x494.jpg 1536w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-2048x659.jpg 2048w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-1920x617.jpg 1920w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/in-app-messaging-practices-scaled.jpg 2560w"></figure><h2 id="examples">In-App Messaging Examples</h2><p>Let’s see some real word examples of in-app messages that are created for various purposes such as:</p><ul><li>Onboarding</li><li>New Feature Introduction</li><li>Upselling</li><li>Gathering Feedback</li></ul><h3 id="ftoc-heading-5"><strong>Onboarding</strong></h3><p>Onboarding is the process of getting someone signed-up and logged-on to your product.</p><p>This is an <strong>incredibly important part </strong>of the user-acquirement process, as according to<a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/21-percent-of-users-abandon-apps-after-one-use" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"> Localytics</a>, 21 percent of people abandon new apps after just one use.

          <small>8 August 2020</small>


<p>by Greg Vaughn</p>

<p>I’ve noticed changes in how I prefer to develop software since I’ve been
focusing my career on Elixir. It allows me to think bigger thoughts and to
develop with lower friction and less fear. I don’t want to go back.</p>

<h2 id="it-began-with-fault-tolerance">It Began with Fault Tolerance</h2>

<p>Many people are introduced to Elixir because of its focus on concurrency.  Joe
Armstrong even called Erlang a “concurrency oriented” language. (Note: most of
my points are generic to any BEAM language, but my experience comes from an
Elixir perspective, so please excuse bias in my terminology). I find it helpful
to consider concurrency a logical consequence of a more primeval concern: fault
tolerance. Achieving BEAM-style fault tolerance comes from isolated processes
which do not affect any other if they crash, plus a supervisory process being
informed when another process dies.</p>

<p>The core point of processes is to contain the “blast radius” of damage caused
by an error. It just so happens that the isolation qualities that enable that
also make them great candidates for concurrency.</p>

<h2 id="let-it-crash">“Let It Crash”</h2>

<p>When I first heard the “Let It Crash” mantra of the Erlang community, it
sounded crazy based on my prior development exerience. It’s important to
understand that it is not a license for irresponsibility, or that we should not
care about the system crashing. What it is, at the core, is a recognition that
our systems will have errors (even <em>if</em> we write bug-free code, hardware will
bug us eventually) and that with an architecture of managing the “blast radius”
of damage, then little parts of the system crashing are no longer a scary
thing.</p>

<p>Less fear – yes, please! I’ve learned to write my Elixir code with a focus
on “blast radius” as a driver for when to reach for processes. Even in cases where I
don’t need concurrency, I’ll use a process to enclose the damage an error might
cause. I use supervision trees and durable work queues to recover from those
minor crashes of processes.  I’ve learned to prefer upserts over inserts to
allow my logic to be retried safely for greater idempotency. These two ideas
of processes to enclose possible errors plus idempotency have become second
nature to me in any Elixir code I write.</p>

<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>

<p>This automatic ability to recover from errors changes the complexion of topics
like test coverage enforcement, static types, extensive code reviews, etc. All
those, at heart, are about preventing errors from being introduced in the first
place (yes, I recognize their secondary benefits too). Those are still good
things (I am not advocating irresponsibility), but with the solid safety net of
fault tolerance from BEAM, we are able to look at them from a different
perspective and see that they do add some friction and inertia to delivering
software.  Perhaps we can temper our reliance upon them in favor of greater
delivery speed in some circumstances. Less fear means more freedom to choose.</p>

<h2 id="bigger-thoughts">Bigger Thoughts</h2>

<p>Elixir re-ignited my intellectual interest in software development. I found,
via Erlang and BEAM history in general, a huge body of wisdom in distributed
systems that I can learn from, and new tools in my toolbox of how to think
about software. With processes so lightweight, pervasive, and offering freedom
from fear of crashing, my perspective shifted in exciting ways. If I think I’m
writing a “web application” then my thoughts are immediately limited. I now
think of building systems. I can think bigger thoughts because I have better
abstractions to build them upon.</p>

<p>Some teams are happy to use Elixir to write web applications, to fit it into
their pre-existing microservice deployment model. I urge developers to reach
for those bigger thoughts that fault tolerant lighweight processes enable. You
can consider each process a logical microservice, but you don’t need the
friction of deploying it separately, and serializing to/from json, and
containers, and orchestration, and distributed logging, et.al.  You can deploy an
entire system of millions of interacting logical microservices in a single BEAM
release.</p>

<h2 id="game-changer">Game Changer</h2>

<p>Elixir and BEAM certainly have been a game changer for me. I’m more fearless when I
build systems, and I hope I can share that freedom with others. The BEAM has spoiled
me, but in a good way.</p>

<p>Airplanes are a luxury for most people to own, let alone toy with—given all the national security regulations. This year’s DEF CON, however, revealed a fascinating finding leaving many, including myself, surprised.</p>



<p>July this year, British Airways announced it would retire its BOEING-747 fleet “due to the downturn in travel caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic,” as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53426886">stated</a> by their spokesperson.</p>



<p>This enabled security researchers, Ken Munro and Alex Lomas of <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/">Pen Test Partners</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/thekenmunroshow?lang=en"></a>to get their hands on a BOEING-747, and show us what goes on behind the scenes in the aircraft.</p>



<p>In their DEF CON presentation, the researchers gave a thorough walkthrough of the aircraft and pointed out something that Gareth Corfield of <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/10/boeing_747_floppy_drive_updates_walkthrough/"><em>The Register</em></a> wasted no time in reporting on.</p>



<p>They revealed a critical component of the BOEING-747 jet, the “navigation database loader” which uses <strong>3.5″ floppy disks for updates</strong>, even in 2020!</p>



<figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FoTiYTYuLerOJsmYRVttqIdGESsa2-5g4g3u5i.jpeg?alt=media&amp;token=6466a2bc-40cc-4c42-ab2f-4457634700e6" alt=""></figure>



<p>The “diskette stowage” compartment next to the component has a number of floppies as the video (provided at the bottom) gives a quick glimpse of.</p>



<p>To update the navigation database, Lomas explained, an engineer would have to visit the aircraft <strong>every 28 days</strong>, with a set of floppy disks.</p>



<h2>But why floppy disks?</h2>



<p>In times where smartphones and IoTs are abundantly ubiquitous, and airlines brag about their inflight entertainment systems equipped with USB ports and Wi-Fi, why would such a critical nav system still rely on these legacy diskettes?</p>



<p>To be clear, <strong>not all airplanes do.</strong></p>



<p>Jeff Carrithers, President of <a href="https://www.globalair.com/">GlobalAir.com</a> and a former aircraft researcher, has shed light on the matter:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The aircraft you are referring must be a vintage aircraft. Floppy disk are no longer used in any modern era aircraft. The vintage aircraft may only have the legacy system still in place because the cost of updating the navigation system would be too cost prohibitive.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Carrithers further stated this is a remnant of legacy aviation hardware from the seventies. “At a guess, this aircraft would be a commercial or military aircraft made in the early ’70s. Some private aircraft still use CDs to update their navigation systems,” he continued.</p>



<figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FoTiYTYuLerOJsmYRVttqIdGESsa2-7d843ua8.jpeg?alt=media&amp;token=925ddd18-d695-4272-9f37-dc181920ce6f" alt=""></figure>



<p>These points were further confirmed by a Flight Operations Expert from <a href="http://www.simpfly.aero/">Simpfly</a>, José Godoy who said, “Most aircraft flying out there have been designed in the 1980s or early 1990s when floppy disks were the ‘state of the art’ technology.”</p>



<p>Godoy said one can find these legacy technologies replaced from time to time whenever a newer fleet is launched:</p>



<p>“A good example is the A320, with the original project from the 1980s which uses floppy disks, while his new version, the A320neo, from 2010s, has ‘retired’ the floppy disks.”</p>



<h2><strong>What are “navigation databases” in an aviation context?</strong></h2>



<p>Jeff Hall, a senior consultant with and <a href="http://www.wesbeyassoc.com/">Wesbey Associates</a> and a former private pilot explained that the navigation databases are not maps in the context of Google Earth of MapQuest.</p>



<p>“It is location and frequency information about flight navigation aids and airports in particular countries or regions. This is used in conjunction with programming a flight path when the pilots get on board for the flight.”</p>



<p>“The flight cases that pilots used to carry had the physical navigation charts from Jeppesen. <strong>Now those charts are stored on iPads or tablets that the pilots carry</strong>,” said Hall.</p>



<p>Godoy also weighed in on the subject, “navigation database comprises routes (composed by airways, waypoints and navigation aids) and airport information (runways, approach and departure instrument procedures).”</p>



<h2>What’s with the 28-day mark?</h2>



<p>It’s to do with how the U.S. government regulatory body, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would update the U.S. airport databases every four weeks, explained Carrithers.</p>



<figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackernoon-app.appspot.com/o/images%2FoTiYTYuLerOJsmYRVttqIdGESsa2-466g3u2q.jpeg?alt=media&amp;token=97afa50a-4b1f-422f-8572-d482d8163233" alt=""></figure>



<p>The FAA would then mail these floppy disks to flight departments, aircraft control towers, airlines, and weather services around the country.</p>



<p>“This was all pre-internet and WAN networks were limited to single buildings, [unless] you were with the CIA or other secret organizations. But all large commercial or military aircraft were just starting electronic navigation systems in the cockpits,” Carrithers continued.</p>



<h2>What about the security implications?</h2>



<p>This is what’s debatable and I can understand both sides of the argument.</p>



<p>Arguably, leaving physical access the <em>only possible way </em>of accessing a critical system, such as via floppy disks, makes it much more secure than expanding the attack surface by opening up remote network access.</p>



<p>If the ground staff tasked with pushing the updates need physically go into the plane to update its navigation loader, the approach is far safer than Wi-Fi-powered “smart updates.”… But that makes ground staff the weakest link in the security chain.</p>



<blockquote><p>“In theory, it would be more secure from a hack outside the aircraft. But it would probably not have any security protocols to login. Just put the floppy in the drive and it is on and then download it to a hard drive and overwrite the base code. Basic DOS prompts,” explained Carrithers.</p></blockquote>



<h2>What about malware and viruses?</h2>



<p>Hall acknowledged, using floppies to provide updates is more secure than doing so over-the-air. But, floppies aren’t exempt from the risks of viruses and malware as expected from any external media device. Although this hasn’t caused any notable problems on airplanes thus far, as Hall states:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I don’t recall an airplane ever becoming infected using floppy disks as the FAA and airlines had strict procedures for scanning disks for viruses and malware before they ever got near an airplane. <strong>But there were a number of incidents over the years where ATMs got infected by floppy disks and CDs performing updates on them.”</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Further, these airplanes aren’t running widely used commercial OSes like Windows or Linux which attract malware attacks, “but special non-stop operating systems that are Unix derivatives, so it’s not as easy to infect as one might think,” Hall continued.But the other concern that remains is the use of outdated technologies in aviation.</p>



<h2>“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!”</h2>



<p>Aircraft use multiple legacy systems but the approach works and has worked sufficiently well for years.</p>



<p>“So much about aviation is old-school: the hardware, the software, the infrastructure. And ESPECIALLY the way people in aviation THINK,” said Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and the host of <a href="http://askthepilot.com/">AskThePilot.com</a>.</p>



<p>Reflecting on Carrithers’ previous comment, Smith said, “What is a ‘modern era’ aircraft? The 787 and A350, maybe? Most other planes are based on platforms developed in the 1980s or even the 1970s.”</p>



<p><em>[Full disclosure: Smith had no knowledge of Carrithers’ comment. I had posed to him a general question: if modern aircraft still relied on floppies]</em></p>



<h2>Inconvenience: too many disks!</h2>



<p>If it’s too expensive to replace floppy disk readers with say, a USB interfaced system, it’s understandable.</p>



<p>Moreover, USB ports can’t always be trusted. A cybersecurity professor had recently crashed an in-flight entertainment system using nothing but a USB mouse (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/buffer-overflow-exploitation-british-airways-system-marco-gisbert/">CVE-2019-9019</a>).</p>



<p>But using floppies is downright inconvenient. Each diskette can store a mere 1.44 megs. This means a typical update of navigation database may require a series of 8 or so floppies, loaded in a particular order.</p>



<p>A higher-capacity CD-ROM would likely be more efficient and eradicate errors—by that I mean, you wouldn’t have to worry about messing up the sequence in which the diskettes are to be inserted.</p>



<p>ACI Jet, a global aviation services company recently published a blog post titled, <em>“</em><a href="https://mro.acijet.com/newsroom/can-data-loading-be-fun-no-but-it-can-be-quicker-and-a-lot-less-painful/"><em>Can data loading be fun?</em></a><em>” </em>which actually discusses this very issue.</p>



<blockquote><p>“In any environment other than aviation, database loading would be easy and cheap (<em>don’t say it</em>). Being that the hardware required is on an aircraft, however, means that you’re likely doing this with archaic media such [as] Zip or floppy disks.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The post describes the process of pushing the updates may sound easy but can take hours on older systems that have “spotty availability” and are unreliable. And, this nuisance has to be repeated every 2-4 weeks.</p>



<p>In the same blog post, the company lists some products which can take the plain out of the update process. These include capabilities like USB interfaces and wireless updates powered by an iPad app.</p>



<p>The company’s Avionics Manager, Brian Ford stated, “We routinely work on aircraft that use ZIP disks and PCMCIA cards to update databases, along with proprietary software to load said cards.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The <em>‘if it ain’t broke, dont fix it’ </em>concept may be how people rationalize it, but ultimately the development cycles for getting hardware approved for aircraft moves glacially show compared to consumer electronics.</p><p>Much of that is due to the reliability, safety, and testing requirements to get the approval of the regulatory agencies involved. That means that once a piece of hardware in approved and installed, that design is unlikely to be improved upon.</p><p>If there are features that could be added to justify the cost of a hardware upgrade (perhaps Wi-Fi loading through an iPad vs. proprietary PC software that may require older hardware) then we can start to see components with modern interfaces like USB, such as in the article of ours you mentioned”</p><cite>Brian Ford, Avionics Manager at ACI Jet</cite></blockquote>

It also may help doctors rule out other illnesses, according to the study led by doctoral candidate Joseph Larsen and his colleagues with faculty advisors Peter Kuhn and James Hicks at the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience’s Convergent Science Institute in Cancer.</p><p>Recognizing the order of symptoms also could help doctors plan how to treat patients, and perhaps intervene earlier in the disease.</p><p>“This order is especially important to know when we have overlapping cycles of illnesses like the flu that coincide with infections of COVID-19,” said Kuhn, a USC professor of medicine, biomedical engineering, and aerospace and mechanical engineering. “Doctors can determine what steps to take to care for the patient, and they may prevent the patient’s condition from worsening.”</p><p>“Given that there are now better approaches to treatments for COVID-19, identifying patients earlier could reduce hospitalization time,” said Larsen, the study’s lead author.</p><p>Fever and cough are frequently associated with a variety of respiratory illnesses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

                                    <p><img alt="SquareOps Blog for how-devops-can-help-startups" src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/squareops.com/img/STARTUP_DEVOPS.jpg">
                            </p>
                                  <p dir="ltr"><span>Managing a tech startup has its own challenges. And although we have come a long way ahead, every new solution seems to build a new problem. Just take a moment and recall. In the early, 2000’s building complex applications was not everyone’s piece of cake, and hence the microservice architecture started becoming popular. But, with time, it became difficult to deploy these small services of the same application in different environments, especially as the companies started becoming serverless</span><span>&nbsp;with the introduction of cloud computing. Thus,</span><span>&nbsp;Docker&nbsp;</span><span>was built. Everything seemed well, but then came the problem of managing these large numbers of containers and so container orchestration tools like Kubernetes</span><span>&nbsp;started becoming popular.</span></p>    <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Every Technology Has Its Baggage</span></h2>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Today the problem is not just technical. With&nbsp;</span><span>continuous integration &amp; continuous delivery</span><span>&nbsp;becoming the key focus as companies try to beat competitors to market, fast deployment is not just a perk, but a necessity for young startups</span><span>&nbsp;to survive. &nbsp;Faster deployment not only saves money, but even history teaches us that the first to launch has the first influence on the customers (Just look at how Netflix changed the streaming industry .)</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Although the software tools like Version Control Systems and Virtual Environments have helped organize production, since the adoption of the cloud-based microservice architecture, the deployment procedure has changed a lot. It is no longer new to see applications pass tests in production and later crash in deployment. Techniques like</span><span>&nbsp;IAAC</span><span>( Infrastructure As A Code ) have helped document the infrastructure and keep them in sync with the production environment. However, it still throws light on a lot of areas of improvement, like increased testing times and the big data logs that have to be gone through.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Now we are at a point where software alone cannot speed up deployment. The whole system has to change! Though luckily we have the solution:&nbsp;</span><span>DevOps</span><span>.</span></p>  <h2 dir="ltr"><span>How does DevOps help you?</span></h2>   <p dir="ltr"><span>The traditional approach to streamlining the production of an application can be broken into two parts: Development and Operation.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>The development includes development, testing, and bug fixes, and although they are categorized as one unit, in most companies the developers and testers generally have a communication barrier that leads to more time in finding and fixing bugs.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>When the application is finally approved for deployment, the operations team is responsible for containerizing individual microservices</span><span>&nbsp;and deploying them on the servers. &nbsp;But most startups are serverless these days and their services are hosted on the cloud. Maintaining the cloud infrastructure is in itself a time-taking task, and the constant changes in the development phase result in an increase in the time to market.</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>This is because Cloud servers have added a lot of tasks to the operations team. Managing incoming traffic to match the number of servers required (because now you are paying by the hour), going through logs of crashes, and reporting these issues to the development are necessary tasks.</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Most problems that are faced in this process are generally due to a lack of communication and data transfer. Either the development team is not completely aware of the production environment, or the logs of the crashes and test results are not reported on time.You will also notice that a lot of time and money can be saved by automating certain processes, like automatically increasing the server base when traffic is expected to be high.</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>DevOps is neither a software stack nor is it some additional hardware for your server. Instead DevOps</span><span>&nbsp;is a set of practices and an interdependent organization structure that is aimed to target several problems that most tech startups face, by bringing the Dev and the Ops team together.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>These problems are:</span></p>  <ul> 	<li><span>Increasing deployment frequency.</span></li> 	<li><span>Reduce crashes in the deployment phase.</span></li> 	<li><span>No infrastructure to automate testing.&nbsp;</span></li> 	<li><span>Faster bug discovery and fixes.</span></li> </ul>    <blockquote>  	<p dir="ltr"><span>In short DevOps</span><span>&nbsp;aims at better and faster production at a cheaper price. Now which startup would not want that?</span></p> </blockquote>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Some number's on how ROI is measured in adopting DevOps :</span></p>    <p><img src="https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/squareops.com/img/state-of-devops-report-2019-insights.jpg"></p>   <h3 dir="ltr"><span>The DevOps Culture</span></h3>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Large companies, like Google, Amazon, and Netflix, were the early adopters of the&nbsp;</span><span>DevOps culture.</span><span>&nbsp;Although it isn’t common to see these large scale companies adopting new practices, because they have always been the market disruptors, it was when the stats were compared before and after the establishment of an in-house DevOps</span><span>team that the benefits became evident.</span></p>   <blockquote> <p dir="ltr"><span>A great example of a radical change due to DevOps is</span><span><b>&nbsp; Target.</b></span></p> </blockquote>    <p dir="ltr"><span>After it’s data breach in 2013, Target was forced to rethink its company structure as the data exposed a complex development and organizational structure. It was so inefficient that in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Heather Mickman, a director at Target, revealed that the situation was so bad that just to get one server provisioned it would take ten teams!&nbsp;</span></p>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Starting with changes in leadership, by the end of 2015, Target had completely transitioned to an organization based around the infrastructure of the products. Every unit of the engineering team now had API access to other teams to monitor logs and environment setups. This setup also had an automated testing and deployment environment. All this resulted in a steady increase in revenue with the annual revenue being $70.27 billion in 2016 to $78.11 billion in 2019 (an all-time high) according to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/255957/revenue-of-target-in-north-america/"><span>statista.com</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>    <h3 dir="ltr"><span>The Ending Note</span></h3>    <p dir="ltr"><span>Today, it is advised that startups</span><span>&nbsp;adopt DevOps</span><span>&nbsp;practices from the day of their establishment because it is essential to become used to&nbsp;</span><span>continuous integration &amp; continuous delivery</span><span>&nbsp;to convert clients to customers.&nbsp;</span></p>    <blockquote>  	<p dir="ltr"><span>Moreover, if the startup is just too young to afford an in-house DevOps&nbsp;</span><span>unit, outsourcing to a third-party DevOps</span><span>&nbsp;could be the solution. This saves time and effort on R&amp;D and also the economic costs of implementing any infrastructure. At the same time, it helps the organization adopt effective practices that have already been tested by the provider on a large scale due to their years of experience in the field.</span></p> </blockquote>

    <p>Peergos uses IPFS to store its data and IPFS supports several kinds of blockstores, from various kinds of local disk based storage to an S3 based store. The S3 store is useful because it automatically provides redundancy and availability, and can also hold much more data than any disk. There are also many providers of S3 compatible storage now. For a while now, we've supported using the S3 based blockstore in Peergos. However this wasn't visible to end users, it was only a server side thing. This means that when uploading or downloading data it all had to go through the Peergos server.</p>

</center>
<p>We have now implemented direct S3 access for reads and writes from the browser/client. Clients can read and write directly to an S3 bucket after authorization from the Peergos server. This new feature makes the Peergos server much more scalable and reliable. The typical bandwidth required of the Peergos server is reduced by ~100x.</p>
<p>There are two modes of read operation; public and authorised. In public mode, all encrypted blocks can be read directly from S3 without any permission. This is the fastest, but may not suit your pricing model for S3. In authorised mode every read request has to first get permission from the peergos server, which signs a url that is temporarily authorised to read that object from S3. The client then directly downloads the block from S3. This is illustrated below. </p>

<p>This is all very well, but what about writes? What if there are many users on the same server? This is where it starts to get beautiful... All users on the same Peergos server share the same S3 bucket, and yet there is no possibility for conflict! This is because the blocks in S3 are content addressed! When a client wants to upload a block they first pre-authorise the block hash with the peergos server which returns a signed url the client can use to upload directly to S3. Upon upload, S3 automatically checks the sha256 hash and size of the block with what was signed. The data flow is shown below.</p>

<br>
Direct S3 writes
</center>
<p>It should be clear how this takes most of the load off of the Peergos server, thus allowing a single server to handle many more users. </p>
<p>The kind of functionality required for this isn't actually exposed by the official S3 SDK. So to get this working we had to implement our own version of the S3 client. It's remarkably simple and only took us a single class, without any dependencies except an hmac-sha256 implementation. The added benefit of this is that we've been able to remove the amazon S3 sdk entirely from our codebase, which was 60mb of dependencies! Compare this with the rest of Peergos including all dependencies, which add up to only 16mb. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Youâ€™ve had a long week but fortunately itâ€™s Friday and things are looking up. After grinding through the day, you stop on the way home to buy groceries for dinner. After getting the necessities, you decide on impulse to buy a dozen cookies. Youâ€™re on a diet, but you reassure yourself that youâ€™ll eat only one, two at most, to celebrate the arrival of the weekend. Once home, you enjoy your celebratory cookies as planned. Two are enough, but despite your best efforts you continue eyeballing those remaining cookies. Wouldnâ€™t they go great with milk? Maybe just one more with a glass? Before you know it, youâ€™ve polished off a dozen cookies and several glasses of milk, and youâ€™re cursing your poor self-control.</p>
<p>Look on the bright side, at least it was fat-free milk. Also, youâ€™re not alone. Research that prompted people to record whatâ€™s happening multiple times a day <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149456">found</a> that self-control failures are a frequent and common occurrence of everyday life. Whether itâ€™s pizza, beer or doing anything but exercising, we all have our vices, and many of us would like to have better self-control. But what is self-control exactly? A working definition is that itâ€™s the ability to do whatâ€™s in your best interests in the long run â€“ such as managing your weight â€“ over whatâ€™s enjoyable right now â€“ such as gorging on cookies.</p>
<p>In 2007, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister put forward what has become the most influential psychological model of self-control. His <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00534.x">strength model</a> likens willpower to a muscle. If you start doing pushups, youâ€™ll feel only a minor burn. But keep it up, and that minor burn will grow into a full-blown conflagration, at which point you wonâ€™t be able to keep going. Baumeister suggested that the same thing happens when you use self-control. If you overwork your self-control muscle, youâ€™ll eventually run out of willpower, and lose the ability to exert self-control.</p>
<p>The success of Baumeisterâ€™s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307740/willpower-by-roy-f-baumeister-and-john-tierney/">book</a> <em>Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength</em> (2012), co-authored with John Tierney, suggests that the strength model resonates with many people. As a doctoral student studying self-control, I can understand why. The model eloquently explains many of our most vexing self-control failures. In the cookie example, the tumultuous week, capped off by an agonising day, sapped your willpower, leaving you unable to resist those cookies. Additionally, it conforms to our commonsense beliefs about self-control. After all, everyone knows that self-control is hard and, more often than not, we need herculean willpower to overcome temptation.</p>
<p>If the strength model is correct, what does this mean for improving your self-control? Applying the muscle analogy, one possibility might be to strengthen your â€˜self-control muscleâ€™. Researchers have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149456">tested</a> this by asking people to do things such as brush their teeth with their nondominant hand for two weeks. Such exercises are quite challenging because they force you to curtail deeply ingrained habits using â€˜inhibitory self-controlâ€™. But does self-control training actually work? According to a 2017 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691617697076">meta-analysis</a> of many relevant studies, self-control training seems to be effective at improving â€˜self-control staminaâ€™ â€“ the ability to exert inhibitory self-control for longer periods.</p>
<p>So, is that the solution to greater self-discipline? Exercise your self-control muscle and get better at inhibitory self-control?</p>
<p>Your heroic efforts are likely to leave you looking more like Sisyphus than Hercules</p>
<p>Unfortunately, itâ€™s not so simple. You might have noticed how I switched back and forth between â€˜inhibitory self-controlâ€™ and the broader concept of â€˜self-controlâ€™, but the two are not synonymous. Though boosting your inhibitory self-control or â€˜willpowerâ€™ might sound appealing â€“ perhaps you imagined yourself using inhibitory self-control to force yourself not to eat the cookies, just like you would if you forced yourself to brush with the opposite hand â€“ itâ€™s not clear that inhibitory self-control actually works this way in everyday life.</p>
<p>Take the findings from a 2017 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550616679237">study</a> that involved volunteers recording their daily experiences of temptation for a week. The individuals who experienced more temptation were less likely to achieve their long-term goals, even if they also reported using more inhibitory self-control. This suggests that using inhibitory self-control to resist those cookies might help you in the moment, but not in the long run. So even if you use inhibitory training (eg, the teeth-brushing challenge) to build a brawny self-control muscle, your heroic efforts are likely to leave you looking more like Sisyphus than Hercules.</p>
<p>Research in my own lab and others suggests that, if you want to improve your self-control, what you should do instead is focus on proactively reducing, rather than reactively overpowering temptation. Fortunately, there are several ways and opportunities to do this.</p>
<p>Before getting to the specifics, it helps to think in terms of a model that the American psychologist Angela Duckworth and her colleagues <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691615623247">proposed</a> â€“ â€˜the process model of self-controlâ€™. It organises self-control strategies according to when theyâ€™re initiated in the â€˜temptation generation cycleâ€™. This cycle describes the stages we must go through before we get to the point where we actually act upon a temptation â€“ see the figure below.</p>
<p>For example, to gorge on those cookies at the end of your working week, you first had to go through a <em>situational stage</em>, where you put yourself in a compromising situation with tempting cookies. From there, you transitioned to an <em>attentional stage</em>, where you directed your attention back towards those cookies. After that, you went through an <em>appraisal stage</em>, where you thought about how good those cookies would taste (especially with a glass of milk). All this led to a <em>response stage</em>, where you broke down and eventually ate all the cookies. To put it bluntly, a lot of things had to go wrong for you to end up giving in to temptation. The good news is that this means you could have applied self-control at several instances prior to when you tried and failed to exert <em>inhibitory</em> self-control (or â€˜willpowerâ€™ in everyday talk).</p>

<p>Letâ€™s start with the situational stage. You donâ€™t need to be well-versed in social psychology to recognise the power of the situation. Most teachers will tell you itâ€™s easier for students to focus when they sit in the front of the classroom. With this in mind, you could have employed what Duckworthâ€™s team call â€˜situational self-control strategiesâ€™. For instance, instead of sitting in front of a box of cookies and forcing yourself not to eat them, you could have either not bought them in the first place â€“ known as â€˜situation selectionâ€™ â€“ or simply removed them from sight by placing them in a cabinet (or thrown them out) â€“ â€˜situation modificationâ€™.</p>
<p>Prior research suggests that these situational strategies are quite effective. For example, one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27158155">study</a> that instructed high-school students to use situational strategies (such as removing buzzing cellphones and other temptations from sight) found that they made more progress towards their academic goals, compared with others who were simply instructed to use inhibitory self-control. Similarly, dieting <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666318305889?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint">research</a> suggests that a simple yet overlooked way to lose weight is to avoid situations where tempting, high-calorie foods are readily available. For example, when you go grocery shopping, plan to avoid walking through the bakery. That way, you are less likely to encounter cues (pleasant smells and sights) that strengthen temptation. Think â€˜out of sight, out of mindâ€™.</p>
<p>But what if you canâ€™t use situational strategies? After all, you might have no choice but to walk through the bakery, or perhaps youâ€™ll upset your kids if you throw away the cookies. Thankfully, there are other â€˜psychological strategiesâ€™, initiated during the attentional and appraisal stages, that can be useful when the situation is uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Some clues come from Walter Mischelâ€™s classic â€˜marshmallow testâ€™ that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/152988602317319285">involved</a> children attempting to resist a single beckoning marshmallow for 15 minutes, for the reward of two if they were successful. Among other crucial variables, Mischel and his collaborators, including the American psychologist Ozlem Ayduk, suggested that one reason some kids were so good at resisting temptation was their ability to use â€˜cooling strategiesâ€™. For instance, research in Mischelâ€™s lab found that children would wait longer if they distracted themselves by simply turning away from the marshmallow. He also found that they could wait longer if he taught them to â€˜reappraiseâ€™ the temptation by thinking of the marshmallows as â€˜puffy round cloudsâ€™.</p>
<p>Importantly, these strategies work for adults too. In a series of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167219883606">studies</a> I conducted with Ben Wilkowski at the University of Wyoming, we found that the use of distraction (for instance, directing attention away from the temptation to go out by focusing on work thatâ€™s particularly interesting) and reappraisal (reminding oneself there will be many opportunities to go out, but only one opportunity to take the upcoming exam), along with the situational strategies discussed earlier, consistently helped college students make progress towards their long-term goals. So, it might be useful to direct your attention away from the cookies by simply picking up a book or reframing the cookies in a way that makes them seem less desirable. You know, from where Iâ€™m sitting, the cookies look kind of old.</p>
<p>Taken altogether, the message from the latest research on willpower is that itâ€™s time to stop lamenting your poor self-control and accept that you have a weak self-control muscle. It might be fun to change things up while you brush your teeth but, remember, building your self-control muscle probably wonâ€™t help you …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article>
  
  <div><p>If you’ve ever met me or read this blog, you know that I have a soft spot for the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust programming language</a>. I’m also excited about and interested in <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, a declarative and reactive web framework. In this blog post I will explain how these two completely different technologies are actually quite similar and why these similarities are what make them great.</p>

<p>Let’s start by talking about Rust. I could write several blog post about all of Rust’s excellent features, in fact I am planning to, but for now let’s focus on its most important feature: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html">lifetimes</a>. Lifetimes are Rust’s most unique and innovative feature and they are the solution to several problems that are nearly as old as programming itself. These problems all relate to managing memory and safe access to that memory. To understand why lifetimes are so important we need to understand how memory has been managed historically.</p>

<p>The earliest programming languages left memory management up to the programmer, but it didn’t take long for systems to be created that took this responsibility out of the programmer’s hands. Lisp was the language that introduced the concept of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">Automatic Garbage Collector</a>, GC for short, and since its inception different forms of GC has been staple features of most popular programming languages. GC is an important innovation but it’s not free. All GCs come with a nontrivial runtime cost. This has made them, and the languages that use them, undesirable for many tasks, such as operating systems, games, and other realtime systems. For these task the indeterministic nature and high runtime cost are unacceptable; for example we cannot afford to stop the world for several milliseconds when the task at hand requires sub-millisecond precision. For these use cases C, C++, and other languages with manual memory management still reign supreme. It turns out, despite what some programmers say, that humans are terrible at manually managing memory. The consequence of errors in manual memory management range from crashes and data corruption, to information leaks and remote code execution. Microsoft has found that about <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-70-percent-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/">70% of their security bugs</a> are due to errors in manual memory management.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/why-svelte-is-like-rust/memory-safe-venn-diagram.png"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/why-svelte-is-like-rust/memory-safe-venn-diagram.png?1597500852" alt="Venn Diagram with two circles, the first labelled &quot;Memory Safe&quot; and the second labelled &quot;Deterministic&quot;. The overlap between them is labelled &quot;Rust&quot;"></a></p>

<p>So back to lifetimes. They enable the compiler to determine <strong>at compile time</strong> when memory can be <strong>safely</strong> freed and reused. After compilation Rust code ends up kind of like C code written by a perfect programmer who makes no mistakes and knows exactly where to insert calls to <code>free</code>. The compiler can also use lifetimes to ensure that the code is correct and avoids common concurrency bugs in the presence of multiple threads. In conclusion, Rust solves the complex problem of memory management, while retaining the deterministic runtime performance required for many tasks that we typically associate with C and C++.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Let’s switch gears and talk about the web a bit. When I started working as web developer Javascript heavy applications where just starting to gain popularity. Back then, one would write applications in “vanilla Javascript”(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#5th_Edition">ES5</a>) usually with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. As complexity moved from the server side to the client, a class of bugs started occurring with the underlying cause of application state ending up out of sync with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>. This hadn’t been a problem in server side rendered applications, because every state change involved rendering a completely new page from the current state. With client side applications one would write code to alter the DOM based on every state change, add a class here, remove an element over there etc. This approach was fraught with issues and almost always caused the afore mentioned bugs.</p>

<p>Several client side libraries started popping up to try and tackle the issue of keeping state and UI in sync. <a href="https://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>, <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, and <a href="https://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> where some of these libraries. <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> from Google was also released around the same time. In common these libraries had the idea of two-way data bindings which would automatically keep the DOM in sync with changes to the underlying state and vice-versa. Still, these libraries didn’t solve the problem completely.</p>

<p>It would be great if we could, like on the server side, simply re-render our whole application in response to every single state change, but this would be extremely computationally expensive and would result in unacceptable performance. This notion of re-rendering in response to every state change is the idea that underpins <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, which was released in 2013. React got around the performance issues inherent in re-rendering the whole application with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html">Virtual DOM</a>. Virtual DOM is an in memory representation of the DOM itself which React uses to determine a small set of changes that can be applied to the real DOM in response to every state change. The Virtual DOM was the crucial invention that made React a huge step forward for the web ecosystem. As an application developer one could “re-render” the whole application in response to every single state change and React would take care of making the desired changes to the underlying DOM.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="plain">// With React UI could
// be treated as a pure function of state
state =&gt; UI</code></pre></figure>

<p>React is of course not entirely free, to determine the small set of changes to make to the DOM it has to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html">reconcile</a> two Virtual DOMs on the client side. If we squint a bit, automatic garbage collection and the Virtual DOM are kind of similar, they are both runtime solutions to problems programmers just weren’t up to solving correctly and consistently. So what’s the <em>lifetimes</em> of web frameworks? You’ve probably guessed it, it’s Svelte!</p>

<p>Svelte takes a similar approach to React and other frameworks that use a Virtual DOM, it’s both reactive and declarative. However, just like Rust does automatic memory management at compile time, Svelte determines the possible changes to DOM based on the possible state changes at compile time. With Svelte we get the benefits of React et al. without the downside of client side reconciliation that taxes performance.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/why-svelte-is-like-rust/client-side-state-venn-diagram.png"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/why-svelte-is-like-rust/client-side-state-venn-diagram.png?1597500852" alt="Venn Diagram with two circles, the first labelled &quot;Free from state bugs&quot; and the second labelled &quot;Optimal performance&quot;. The overlap between them is labelled &quot;Svelte&quot;"></a></p>

<h2 id="hard-problems-at-compile-time">Hard Problems at Compile Time</h2>

<p>So why is Svelte like Rust? Svelte is like Rust because it solves a problem that programmers are clearly not capable of solving themselves <strong>at compile time</strong>. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows however. As I mentioned at the top I haven’t yet used Svelte, but with Rust long compiles times are a significant problem. When we solve complex problems at compile time the complexity of compilers naturally increases and we pay the price of longer compile times for our runtime gains. Luckily there’s lots of <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2019/10/11/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-some-more-in-2019/">work</a> happening to improve the compile times of the Rust compiler.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-93721eb4371f185371ed"><div><p>Productivity has somehow jumped from economists’ toolbox to every online creator’s bio.&nbsp;</p><p>I know because I had it in mine. Talking about productivity offered the luxury of a wide array of topics to pick from and a seemingly universal audience. I mean, who wouldn't want to learn how to be more efficient and effective? However, as I began to continue to publish and iterate, I realized that the majority of "productivity-related" content seemed to follow one singular trend: Grind and hustle.&nbsp;</p><p>I felt there was a missing piece. I believe in sustainable and mindful productivity. But we are surrounded by a hectic, competitive environment that frowns upon resting, breathing and enjoying oneself.</p><p>Mindful productivity is the process of prioritizing sustainable practices of thinking, creating, and making. Mindful productivity prioritizes the efficiency of our work and the freedom of our time, leading others to obsess over the concept of “flow.”&nbsp;</p><p>Normally when you hear about flow, it elicits a warm feeling, as you think of the flow state and free-flowing ideas. However, the bane of mindful productivity is <strong>flow paralysis</strong>.</p><p>Flow paralysis is when you lose agency in your life and begin to fall in an endless habitual loop. You are so lost within the momentum of daily progression, that you lose sight of the end goal. You fail to consider that you and the world are changing, while your actions stay the same.&nbsp;</p><p>You go with the flow.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Magic of Mental Models</strong></h3><p>This is where mental models come in. They are the safety nets that prevent you from falling into flow paralysis, the lightning bolts that jolt you out of complacency,&nbsp; a new lens for you to look at yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Mental Models are the frameworks that guide our understanding of the world. In the age of abundance, where over 547,200 web pages are created every day, we need ways to simplify the complex systems. Mental Models act both as a filter and a lens. They maintain what information is necessary and then display that information in chunks or buckets that you can easily process.</p><p>We subconsciously develop mental models as we learn and grow from birth. The power is in learning to consciously build and add these models into our toolkit. There can be a fundamental evolution in our world view and perspective simply by being aware and taking control of our mental models.&nbsp;</p><p>I am still learning to use and synthesize all the Mental Models in the world. You can read about them and understand them, but until you instill them in your weekly and daily routines and habits, they will continue to live in your subconscious. Until you bring them to the forefront of your mind, allowing them to challenge your worldview, can they truly counteract the influences of the flow state.&nbsp;</p><p>I have selected the three mental models that have provided me with the highest leverage after I have begun to actively implement them in my day-to-day life. Use them to discern the signals in your life from the noise.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1.Regret Minimization</strong> - Pursue the projects and opportunities that you will have regretted not having pursued when you look back at your life.&nbsp;</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597339833769_15005"><div><p>Long-term happiness is the subtraction of regret from our lives. The dopamine hits of audience growth, financial success, and platitudes from others can temporarily fill us with excitement and joy. We are not programmed to think in the long-term, short term gains can easily overpower our internal operating system and throw off our calculations.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard to look ten years in the future and learn about what we wished we accomplished, instead I have incorporated questions in my weekly review to give me the opportunity to refocus my intention.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Am I taking steps that drive me closer to freedom? What were they?</p></li><li><p>Am I putting anything off? Is this because I am not interested in it or because I was not mentally strong enough to face it?</p></li><li><p>Are my actions in line with my monthly and annual objectives?</p></li><li><p>Do I have any changes I want to make to my monthly and annual objectives? If so, why (convince yourself)?</p></li></ul><p>Some weeks, I breeze through these answers, there have been no major shifts with what I have been doing. Other weeks, there are clashes between where I currently am and where I want to be. Having a consistent practice cuts through the noise.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. Inversion</strong> - Addressing problems and scenarios by thinking about them backward.&nbsp;</h3><p>Inversion thinking is like a round-trip drive. On the first leg, you observe the major landmarks and scenes around you. Typically we think of the future in a forward way, addressing our desires and aspirations. We ask things like:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How can I have a good life?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How can I lose weight?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>How can I make money?&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>On the return leg of the round trip, it is a completely different experience. Although the route is unchanged, the opposite direction will allow you to see a completely new landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>Inversion is the process of working through your problems backwards. Inversion places you in the mindset of avoiding rather than achieving. Let’s apply inversion thinking to the three questions above:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How do I <strong>not</strong> have a good life? -&gt; How do I guarantee a bad life?</p></li><li><p>What would I do to <strong>not</strong> lose weight? -&gt; How do I guarantee I am out of shape?</p></li><li><p>How would I <strong>not</strong> make money? -&gt; How do I avoid becoming wealthy?&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Usually the problems we face in life are caused by things we are <strong>already doing</strong>, not things that we need to do. You sleep poorly because you check our phone right up until we go to bed, not because you have not purchased the latest Oura ring. You feel lazy and unmotivated because you never exercise, not because you haven not read the latest book by <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/">Cal Newport</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When you approach a new problem, approach it with the following process:&nbsp;</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Write down the problem you are trying to solve.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Invert the problem.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Expand on the inversion to specific actions that you need to avoid.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Avoid said actions.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Here is an example model:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Original goal:</strong> How do I lose weight?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Inversion:</strong> How do I guarantee being out-of-shape?&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Operating at a caloric surplus.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Having unbalanced macros.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Reducing all activities that require energy and movement.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>We are always told to “look at things from a different angle or perspective.” Inversion forces this upon us. It is counterintuitive and challenges our own beliefs, forcing us to take time with a decision. Instead of deciding you need to get a new exercise plan or hire a new personal trainer for the tenth time, you might finally realize that change starts from within. You realize that you need to stock your fridge with healthier options, track your diet and stay active regularly instead of depending on an exercise plan to be the “fix-all.”&nbsp;</p><p>That is the power of new perspective.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3. Pareto Principle</strong> - 80% of your total output in a field is determined by 20% of your inputs.&nbsp;</h3><p>Everyone knows this principle as the 80-20 rule. You are told to “80-20” something when the gurus want you to apply the Pareto Principle. We often assume that the equation where 80% of our outputs are affected by 20% of our inputs are locked in. However, the biggest stopping point for most people is pausing on execution because they want to use numbers to calculate the amounts of their work that fit the Pareto equation.</p><p>This is absurd.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea behind the use of the numbers 80% and 20% is that they are the most commonly observed outcome and should serve as a goalpost for people. The simple end goal is to determine whether there is a <strong>minority</strong> input that is affecting a <strong>majority</strong> output. There are scenarios where there are no statistical points to make calculations. How can you differentiate between 80% happiness and 60% happiness?&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, it’s a gut feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>To be more conscious with the Pareto mental model, I have implemented a daily practice within my to-do list. Above all the smaller tasks, I now always have a “daily highlight,” a non-negotiable, high-leverage task that leads to <strong>majority output</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>I ask myself, what is the highest priority task that will yield the largest results?&nbsp;</p><p>It could be finishing the first draft for the long-form essay you have put off to watch the NBA Bubble matches.It could be creating a project roadmap for your team. It could be spending the day cold emailing prospective mentors. Generally, the highest priority tasks also have the highest energy requirement. In the past, this meant that I would opt to complete <strong>low-leverage</strong> “busy work” ahead of it, draining my energy so that when I got started on the <strong>high-leverage</strong> task, I was not as effective.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597339833769_5036"><div><p>Akin to the division of [BC] and [AD] of the Gregorian Calendar, there is a similar distinction in my life where there was a period before I became aware of Mental Models and a period after.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, if I had been offered a ghost-writing opportunity with good pay, I would have taken the assignment regardless of the topic. After learning about inversion and regret minimization, I began to focus more on my personal projects that allowed me to grow and learn (ie. the <a href="https://www.brandonzhang.com/podcast">podcast</a>, working for <a href="https://shop.visualizevalue.com/">Visualize Value</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>I was recently approached to write an article on the differences between Notion and OneNote, I decided to turn it down. The topic and style of writing did not speak to my personal interests, I felt forced to work with SEO keywords and restrained in the writing I was delivering. I asked myself, would I regret doing this in the future? The answer, yes. I asked myself, is this a high leverage task? The answer, no. I realized that there was a lot more value to be earned speaking with guests on my podcast and networking with people on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>On a weekly and daily basis, I have checks in place that force me to consciously apply these mental models. Everyone recommends completing weekly reviews, but applying the frameworks of the Pareto Principle, Regret Minimization and Inversion will lead you to be more thoughtful about your life and your future.&nbsp;</p><p>I am working through the list of mental models in this <a href="https://www.notion.so/Mental-Models-a222ae61d8b8427b98099a8fbe72ce85"><span>Notion database</span></a>, looking for more tools to add to my toolbox in the fight against <strong>flow paralysis</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Wrest control of your future by taking control of your thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>You can …</p></div></div></div>

August 15, 2020 | https://www.chatwoot.com/blog/woot-journals-one-year-since-open-sourcing-chatwoot/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.chatwoot.com/blog/woot-journals-one-year-since-open-sourcing-chatwoot/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Looking into the one year of open-sourcing Chatwoot.</p><div><p>Chatwoot is now one of the most popular open-source live chat software on Github. If you haven’t been following the story so far, here is the story, in a nutshell, to get you started. </p>
<p>Chatwoot started as a commercial project in 2016 and strived to help businesses provide exceptional customer support through Facebook messenger. The product inspiration came through the customer pain points which we observed while working in this space as a part of our previous gigs. Nevertheless, the project didn't culminate into a viable business and we shut shop in 2017. </p>
<p>With the amount of sweat we put into the project, Chatwoot still stayed alive in our hearts. In 2019, as an impromptu decision, we ended up open-sourcing the project as a part of the #hacktoberfest. The story took a different twist then and Chatwoot went on to be a top post on Hackernews. Ever since then, the project has been growing at an incredible pace with almost 5k stars on Github currently. </p>
<p>Today marks a year since the initial commit for Chatwoot’s resurrection as an open-source project and so let's take a step back to look at Chatwoot's journey in the last year.   </p>
<h2 id="the-decision-to-go-open-source"><a href="#the-decision-to-go-open-source" aria-label="the decision to go open source permalink"></a>The Decision to go open-source</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you start a popular open-source project?   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the last year, we might have told our story countless times. However, often, the larger story fails to capture the minute moments and the thought processes behind deciding to go open-source. Many a time, we have felt that the Chatwoot story as an answer to the question <code>How did you decide to go open-source?</code>  leaves the questioner unsatisfied. That said, in all honesty, there was never a grand scheme behind the decision. </p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2019, the core Chatwoot team was back together prototyping yet another SaaS product. It was in one of our regular sync-up calls that <a href="https://twitter.com/pranavrajs">@pranavrajs</a> floated the idea of making Chatwoot open-source. The idea didn’t attract any criticism, but there wasn’t too much enthusiasm in the air either, thanks to our Imposter Syndrome.  </p>
<p>Our experience in open-source till that point was limited to being consumers. Being ardent fans of the code quality in open source projects like Vue.js and ruby on rails, we had our insecurities exposing the project to the whole world.  </p>
<p>With zilch expectations, we went through it like just another day in our lives and decided to commit the codebase to GitHub. We would leave it there while the team continued working on our next big thing, we had thought! ;).   </p>
<h2 id="ignition-ready-set-go"><a href="#ignition-ready-set-go" aria-label="ignition ready set go permalink"></a>Ignition: Ready Set Go</h2>
<p>In August 2019, as unprepared as we were, Chatwoot codebase was brought out as a public repo. Our expectation of an uneventful day, quickly turned around, thanks to the spammers who got hold of an SES key from an old commit. The incident ended in raking up quite a surprise in the form of AWS billing alerts. We did act swiftly to mitigate the issue, but as far as the business plan behind open source goes, This is the story.</p>
<p>October saw the repo getting some attention thanks to #hacktoberfest, which re-kindled the whole team's interest in Chatwoot. It even resulted in the team deciding to put on-hold the then on-going project and give Chatwoot our full attention for the next 2 months. We did the much-needed maintenance chores over the repo and ended up shipping the website live chat feature that we lacked in. The absence of other communication channels, especially website live chat, was one of our prime hypotheses behind the earlier failure of Chatwoot. Having been able to ship that feature in 2 weeks, amidst the newfound enthusiasm, is something the team is still extremely proud of.   </p>
<p>The ultimate unexpected kickstart, however, came in December in the form of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21559197">Hackernews</a>, which we attribute as the start of Chatwoot as a serious open-source business.</p>
<p>After Hacktoberfest, we saw the attention on our GitHub repo reducing despite the team shipping new updates. In all helplessness,  <a href="https://twitter.com/pranavrajs">@pranavrajs</a> gave it a final go on ShowHN one night and to our joy, we were received with much love from the community, a wonderful surprise for the whole team, and a sleepless night for <a href="https://twitter.com/pranavrajs">@pranavrajs</a>, replying to comments. Chatwoot hasn’t stopped growing ever since. </p>
<h2 id="almost-a-year-later"><a href="#almost-a-year-later" aria-label="almost a year later permalink"></a>Almost a year later</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The work that the Chatwoot community does, matters!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the adversities since the beginning of 2020, the Chatwoot community continues to generate moments that have carried us through these tough times. Working in isolation from a remote corner of the world, you might fail to see the impact you are creating, but testimonies like the following make us realize why we matter as a community.  </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’m so glad I found your software. It’s a tremendous help for startups like me who, because of the global pandemic, had to shift from a physical store to online selling through social media. You guys will save my store as well as the jobs of my employees as we are now about to be efficient in addressing our customers’ inquiries. Again, I’m grateful. "</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We are what we are today, not just because of the core team but also because of our 70+ contributors to the codebase, the community members who have been helping us ship in multiple languages and businesses that have opted to go with Chatwoot.   </p>
<p>Over the last 6 months, Chatwoot has outgrown itself from being a Facebook only chat-solution. We have also seen the community leveraging Chatwoot as a messaging platform for their conversational business need. From specific sectors like healthcare, banking, etc for their data privacy requirements to bot companies looking for a conversational frontend, we continue to see endlessly expanding use cases than we ever imagined for Chatwoot.  </p>
<p>With the flexibility of opensource, we continue to see the community tweak Chatwoot into even powerful solutions. We have been receiving some wonderful <a href="https://satchel.com/live-chat/">reviews</a> for our cloud version too as we continue to learn from all the comments from the community and work on our future versions.  </p>
<p>We might have been relatively quiet on our blog for the last couple of months. If it ever seems like we've slowed down a bit, you can rest assured that it's only because our team is working hard on some exciting features. As always, stay tuned for all the cool updates coming your way, real soon!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <article role="main">
        <p>The headlines don’t lie.
<a href="https://www.crn.com/news/mobility/microsoft-extends-work-from-home-option-through-january">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/27/tech/google-work-from-home-extension/index.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326017/amazon-work-from-home-extend-january-2021-corporate">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/06/facebook-will-allow-employees-to-work-remotely-until-july-2021.html">Facebook</a>, and a whole host of other tech companies have announced employees will be working from home until early-mid 2021.
There are reasons to believe this will be pushed back; even if the <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/04/15/coronavirus-vaccine-prospects">staggeringly ambitious</a> timelines for vaccine development are met, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1772035651845">a vaccine might not be a silver bullet</a> and the pandemic could require management for the next 2-3 years.
As a software engineer in big tech’s orbit, this means it’s time to settle in for the long haul and take my home work setup seriously.</p>
<p>I’ve been very concerned with ergonomics ever since early-career wrist issues had me mousing with my non-dominant hand for six months.
One of my university friends had such terrible pain that he became a pioneer in <a href="https://livestream.com/internetsociety3/hopeconf/videos/131671656">open-source speech recognition for programming by voice</a> (although his issues didn’t turn out to be from repetitive stress injuries).
All of which is to say I haven’t used a non-ergonomic keyboard or mouse in about a decade.
Still, my home setup, while decent, fell short in a few crucial areas.
It was time to make some improvements - I’m in this career for the long run.
Join me on this somewhat self-indulgent journey!</p>

<p>My top-level aims were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a setup where I’m happy &amp; comfortable working for long periods of time</li>
<li>Create a setup which will not cause injury in the mid to long term</li>
</ol>
<p>To facilitate these aims, I chose these constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on basic uncomplicated ergonomics, anchored in <em>adjustability</em></li>
<li>Prioritize <em>frugality</em> by buying used, and only buying features I definitely need</li>
<li>Avoid falling into the <em>consumerist perfection trap</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ergonomics--adjustability">Ergonomics &amp; Adjustability</h3>
<p>When it comes to ergonomics, the science isn’t complicated; here’s how you get the biggest bang for your buck:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the relative height of your chair &amp; desk so that you type &amp; mouse with straight wrists (not flexed up or down)</li>
<li>Reduce wrist pronation (inward twisting) by using a split/tented keyboard and vertical mouse or trackball</li>
<li>Ensure monitors are placed high enough so you can see them without sagging your neck forward (this is a big drawback with laptops)</li>
</ol>
<p>All the rest of it - standing desks, exotic chair designs, desk treadmills, mechanical keyswitches, keyboard trays, gas spring monitor arms - are basically a huge waste of time &amp; money if you can’t nail these three basic things.
I’m not going to spend time on good posture because that falls in the domain of flossing &amp; working out every day: if you want to do it, you’ll do it.
Programmer’s slouch can even be accomodated to a degree:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXYLVbt7j7o" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Regarding adjustability, we’ve all probably heard the tale of how the USAF designed its airplane cockpits for “average” body dimensions, with the end result that <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html">literally nobody exactly fit those designs</a>.
This informs our approach here: prioritizing adjustability over other concerns like “quality” or whatever. Everyone reading this post will have body dimensions purely unique to themselves, and mere inches can make a difference.</p>
<h3 id="frugality">Frugality</h3>
<p>Buy used. Not complicated.
Computing equipment depreciates like milk left out in the sun, so you can snag perfectly good five-year-old equipment for 75-80% off MSRP.
Check Craigslist first (or Facebook Marketplace), then eBay.
I’ve been doing this for years and haven’t been burned once.
Single-core CPU performance <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/year-on-year.html">has been flat for almost a decade now</a>; you probably don’t really need the latest &amp; greatest to do your work.
Also, most ergonomic equipment is built like a tank and can easily stand the test of time &amp; use.</p>
<p>The second component to frugality is much more subjective, but basically amounts to not buying what you don’t really need.
A great example here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/__K4V8pFhf4">$25 generic metal bolt monitor stand vs. $300 gas spring monitor arms</a> from Ergotron:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/__K4V8pFhf4" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>If you’re like me, once your monitors are in the appropriate position they’re basically never touched again.
Buying a fancy gas spring stand would be a complete waste of money.
The example makes it sound simple, but it’s really easy to forget this as you’re watching flashy product videos.
Buying stuff is fun!
Which leads into our next constraint…</p>
<h3 id="the-consumerist-perfection-trap">The Consumerist Perfection Trap</h3>
<p>This is best illustrated by a YouTube comment I found under <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LALQsqZP1nA">a Linus Tech Tips video</a> reviewing the very expensive Ergodox split mechanical keyboard:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/ergonomics/ergodox-youtube-comment.PNG"> 
</figure>

<p>Humans are endlessly adaptable, for better or worse.
Before setting out, know this: you might sink days of research and thousands of dollars into your work setup, but it will never be quite perfect.
Just accept this. Live with it.
It’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">hedonic adaptation</a>.
Even if your monitors end up an inch too close to your face, remember that the whole setup is <em>massively</em> better than sitting at your kitchen table or couch with a laptop.
Buying things is fun, and spending money begets spending more money.
It’s a good idea to let a setup sit for a couple weeks or a month before rushing off with further tweaks &amp; improvements.</p>
<p>Inside us all there is a void.
People want to complete themselves and fill this void with spirituality, or hedonistic pursuits, or material things.
If you’ll indulge a metaphor, this is not a void that can be filled - its nature is more akin to a black hole of the cosmic variety.
Feeding it things - for example, expensive ergonomic equipment - will simply add to its mass and pull.
Only if left alone might it slowly evaporate.
You must learn to live with it.
Materialism is the belief that something outside yourself will finally bring you permanent satisfaction, and we don’t want to be materialistic.</p>
<p>Just remember why you’re doing this: to facilitate work and avoid injury.</p>

<p>The main event. Here’s what I ended up getting.</p>
<h3 id="desk-uplift-v2-motorized-adjustable-standing-desk">Desk: UPLIFT V2 motorized adjustable standing desk</h3>
<p>This one hurt the most: it cost $835!
I’d been spoiled with a motorized adjustable standing desk while working at Microsoft, and was loathe to give it up.
I ended up springing for an uplift desk because it drives me crazy when things are wobbly, and many standing desks are allegedly quite wobbly if you’re a taller person.
I bought a <a href="https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-standing-desk-v2-or-v2-commercial/">very basic uplift desk model</a>: 60x24” white laminate with just the memory pad and power grommet added on.
No way was I going to find something like this on the used market, sadly.
Buy once, cry once.
It came with a very nice cushy mat which really does improve the standing experience.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/ergonomics/uplift-desk.jpeg"> 
</figure>

<p>If you’re looking to save money here and don’t mind buying the motorized legs &amp; desk top separately, there are allegedly <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fvnhyd/taking_my_home_work_setup_seriously#c_sj3n6z">good deals to be had on Monoprice</a>.</p>
<h3 id="chair-haworth-zody">Chair: Haworth Zody</h3>
<p>Here’s where I got a pretty good deal.
Forget Herman Miller: their chairs still go for crazy prices used, but one can easily find a gently-used <a href="https://www.haworth.com/na/en/products/stools/zody-1.html">Haworth Zody</a> for $200 (vs. $1400 new) on Craigslist in any large-ish metropolitan area.
I also grew used to these while working at Microsoft, and it’s a truly wonderful high-quality chair - and very adjustable!
You can change seat height, seat depth, tilt tension (or lock it from leaning back), lumbar support height, and armrest position along all axes (height, side-to-side, forward/backward).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/ergonomics/haworth-zody.jpg"> 
</figure>

<p>If you’re buying used you should test two things.
One, put it on a level surface and extend seat height to maximum; check whether it’s developed a wobble.
Two, test whether the tilt tension control still works (adjusted with a crank on the right side).
I use it locked all the time anyway, but you might care about this feature - I’d just use its absence to secure a further discount!</p>
<p>The only other advice here is not to buy one of those <a href="https://youtu.be/x3DpVTyQOyM">ergonomic kneeling chairs</a>.
They’re cheap &amp; compact, but if you’re like me your back will get tired and you’ll just revert to a horrible forward-slouching posture.
If you really think you’ve got what it takes, try sitting on an inexpensive yoga ball first - at least you might be able to use it for other things when the whole venture goes sideways.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-goldtouch-gtn-0099">Keyboard: Goldtouch GTN-0099</h3>
<p>Let’s start this section with a hot take: mechanical keyswitches are wholly unnecessary for a good keyboard experience.
I had a <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional/">Das Keyboard</a> long ago (without keylabels for <em>extra hacker cred</em>), and it was nice for a bit but you quickly tune out the clickiness (although your roommates don’t).
In the end it just isn’t worth the huge extra cost &amp; noise (yes I’ve heard of Cherry MX Silent Red switches, leave me alone you fanatics).
Mechanical keyswitches provide very dubious ergonomic benefit.
I will say it’s humorous seeing tons of love &amp; effort dumped into custom mechanical keyboards that still use a flat slab layout like they’re some throwaway Dell keyboard from 2006.
Show some love toward your wrists, you barbarians!</p>
<p>For a number of years I used the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/8xk02kz6k69w?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab">Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</a>, which was nearly perfect except for the build quality being complete crap - I burned through two of them in four years (this seems to be a common story).
After the second one died I started using the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000/b2m-00012">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</a>, an enormous dinosaur which can reliably be found for $20 used.
Unfortunately it has a full number pad on the right side, meaning you’re either reaching way out toward your mouse or pushing the keyboard to your left and typing with asymmetric hand positions:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/ergonomics/ms4k-hand-position.jpg"> 
</figure>

<p>I wanted a keyboard that was split/tented, no number pad, bombproof build quality, and less than $120 or so.
It came down to the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-pc-us/">Kinesis Freestyle2</a> and the <a href="https://shop.goldtouch.com/products/goldtouch-v2-adjustable-comfort-keyboard-pc-only">Goldtouch GTN-0099</a>.
In the end I chose Goldtouch because it’s much less expensive ($60 on eBay!) and looks decidedly less cheap than the Kinesis and its weird sold-separately tenting kit.
I couldn’t be happier!
I love the Goldtouch’s chunkiness &amp; solidity.
The keyswitches are sturdy &amp; pleasant to type on.
Also, it is very adjustable - the keyboard halves are connected by a lockable ball joint you can set to any reasonable combination of split and tent angle.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/ergonomics/goldtouch-keyboard.jpg"> 
</figure>

<p>It strikes me as odd that I so rarely saw mention of Goldtouch in any of the (many) discussions of ergonomic keyboards I’ve read in my time online.
Maybe it’s …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Author: (Not) Mitchell Baker</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://mozillasfuture.com/img/mozilla-hero.jpg" alt="Mozilla Hero; picture of optimistic- and courageous-looking young woman of color"></p><p><em>Ready or not, here we come...</em></p>
</div>

<p><em>(The following is what I, <a href="https://tryingtobeawesome.com/about/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Steve Phillips</a>, would say to all Mozillians if I were CEO.)</em></p>

<hr>

<p>The time has come to make a choice: will Mozilla fade into irrelevance, or will we enter our finest period yet?</p>

<p><em>I choose the latter.</em>  Here is how we will seize this moment, beginning <em>today</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-stand-for">What Do We Stand For?</h2>

<p><strong>We stand for the user</strong>.  We are trusted, and our products are trustworthy.  It is this fundamental advantage that we must leverage going forward, in conjunction with our world-class engineering and design teams.</p>

<p>We will do what our competitors are structurally and morally incapable of doing -- empowering users, not exploiting them.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-will-be-encrypted">The Future Will Be Encrypted</h2>

<p>We will build <strong>Firefox Sync Plus</strong>, an encrypted file- and data-syncing service that gives users secure access to all of their documents, contacts, files, calendar events, passwords, chat history, browser settings, and more.  Sync Plus will be accessible from all their devices and every browser -- not just Firefox.  This service will be at the center of their digital life, and make their everyday lives much more convenient, private, and secure.</p>

<p>If 5 million users pay us an average of $7.50/month, that would be $37.5 million/month or <strong>$450 million/year</strong>, doubling our current budget (or keeping us fully intact if Google eventually pulls the plug) -- and this is just one service.  Sync Plus will be built on open standards that empower anyone to host their own server -- which may even federate with ours (stay tuned).</p>

<p>We have already built several pieces of this vision: Firefox Sync, Firefox Send, and Firefox Lockwise.  What's missing is a generic, encrypted data-syncing layer to tie them all together, and we are the best-positioned organization in the world to create precisely that.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-will-be-web-assembled">The Future Will Be Web-Assembled</h2>

<p>We will continue to revolutionize software security with Rust and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WebAssembly + WASI</a>, bringing about a future where programmers create one version of their app that runs natively on every device, and in every web browser, without users needing to trust it with <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/11/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the keys to the kingdom</a>.</p>

<p>By enabling the construction of universal apps that can be built using any popular programming language, WebAssembly will collectively save developers' employers <strong>tens of billions of dollars per year</strong> that is currently wasted on recreating the same exact app for the web, Android, and iOS.  And they can save even more money (or use those funds to build uniquely valuable software) by paying us to help them accelerate their adoption of WebAssembly.</p>

<p>(There are other, more counterintuitive ways to monetize WebAssembly that are too sensitive for such a public forum; contact me privately for details.)</p>

<h2 id="the-future-will-be-voice-controlled">The Future Will Be Voice-controlled</h2>

<p>The average person types on their phone at 20 words per minute (wpm), types on a physical keyboard at 40 wpm, but speaks at 120 wpm -- 6x faster than typing on their phone.  It is inevitable that we will use our voices to control our devices (alongside other methods).</p>

<p>Speaking commands to our devices and using speech-to-text are increasingly common, but Amazon, Google, and Apple's voice assistants almost always upload the audio of you speaking to some data center rather than "transcribing" it locally.</p>

<p>With our recent launch of <a href="https://voice.mozilla.org/firefox-voice/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Firefox Voice</a>, we are giving users a better option -- one we will extend far beyond the browser (hear that, Samsung?).  And <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/06/15/what-is-differential-privacy/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">differential privacy</a> techniques will improve privacy even more while enabling us to create world-class products without being at a data disadvantage.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-will-be-ethically-monetized">The Future Will Be Ethically Monetized</h2>

<p>Getting users to pay for open source is simple -- offer it as a service instead.  (Trying to monetize FOSS via consulting is a trap; it simply doesn't scale.)</p>

<p>We will also embrace the <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ethical Source</a> movement to ensure that the software we create is compatible with human rights, and to prevent the exploitation of open source developers -- ourselves included -- by tech giants who sell our software as a service and cut us out of the loop.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-will-be-federated">The Future Will Be Federated</h2>

<p>We will partner with the most innovative, privacy-friendly organizations in the world: CloudFlare, Mullvad, ProtonMail, DuckDuckGo, Freedom of the Press Foundation, and <em>especially</em> <a href="https://effective.af/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Effective.AF</a> .</p>

<p>We will also partner with other trusted tech organizations to provide end-to-end encrypted, federated services, where each node is hosted by a different org, and where the network has no single point of failure.  Millions and millions of users will gladly pay a nominal fee each month to a nonprofit they love in exchange for a reliable gateway to a new and better internet -- especially if a portion of their subscription is used to provide the same service to the poor and underprivileged, free of charge.</p>

<h2 id="death-is-not-an-option">Death Is Not An Option</h2>

<p>If we don't let go of the false belief that innovating is riskier than not innovating, we will die.</p>

<p>If we behave like a big, slow, <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">weary giant</a> irrationally obsessed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and nothing else, we will die.</p>

<p>If we fail to pursue much of the above <em>and more</em>, then we will die, and we will deserve to die.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-thrive">How to Thrive</h2>

<p>Just because we're a nonprofit doesn't mean we have to suck at designing incentive structures.</p>

<h3 id="three-rules-for-success">Three Rules for Success</h3>

<h4 id="rule-1-performance-based-compensation-for-all-managers-starting-at-the-top"><strong>Rule #1: Performance-based compensation for <em>all</em> managers, starting at the top</strong></h4>

<p>Compared to current compensation, this means significantly higher pay for those who achieve their yearly and/or quarterly goals, and somewhat lower pay for those who don't.  Mozilla can afford this by giving lower base pay to all managers, myself included.</p>

<p>Failing to incentivize ourselves to innovate and move quickly is literally 100% more expensive -- it will cost us everything unless we change <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>Besides: a combination of performance-based pay and building products that pull in revenue means that good performance will pay for itself <em>and then some</em>, enabling us to invest more in what is working and to spin up new iniatives.</p>

<h4 id="rule-2-ambitious-goals-only"><strong>Rule #2: Ambitious goals only</strong></h4>

<p>"Achieving" goals that weren't worth striving for in the first place doesn't do us any good.  If you are not trying to change the world, you should not be working at Mozilla; our mission is too important.</p>

<p>Unambitious yearly and quarterly goals will not be approved.</p>

<h4 id="rule-3-whatever-lin-clark-wants-she-gets"><strong>Rule #3: Whatever Lin Clark wants, she gets</strong></h4>

<p>In addition to Lin, we will also maximally support other team leads who possess the trifecta of being a visionary, a clear thinker, and a clear communicator.</p>

<p>Greetings Mozillians! :-)</p>

<p><a href="https://tryingtobeawesome.com/about/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Steve</a> here.  I've thought quite a bit about existential risk and which technologies we must invent -- or oppose -- to create a bright future.  I think about how this mission-critical work can be sustainably funded while inventing what we need.  I'm an ambitious programmer, entrepreneur, and cypherpunk, and have been for many years.</p>

<p>A few things I've learned the hard way: <strong>We must protect human privacy while funding our continued ability to do so</strong>; good intentions are not enough to pay the bills.  We must <strong>be more ambitious</strong> than most organizations think necessary -- especially nonprofits.  And we must <strong>innovate or die</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>It is hard to imagine a world of humane computing without the success of Mozilla, and I would love to help.</strong></p>

<p>Please reach out to me (<a href="https://twitter.com/elimisteve" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Twitter</a>, <a href="mailto:steve@tryingtobeawesome.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">email</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdphillips/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>).  Thank you.</p>

    <section>
                   
        <p><a href="http://www.mattwardman.com/blog/2007/08/22/dumping-itunes-because-of-software-bloat/" title="See this blog entry, for example"><img src="https://blog.brush.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2008_06_nobloat.png" width="125" height="126" alt="No bloat"></a>Solomon once said <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eccl%207:10;&amp;version=31;">not to pine for the good ol’ days</a>, and that’s sage advice, but I’m sure he didn’t intend it to apply to software bloat.</p>

<p>I’m not just talking about memory and megahertz bloat — we’ve also got performance <i>un</i>bloat. And it almost seems like the two go hand-in-hand. The <i>more</i> memory something hogs, the slower it’ll run.</p>

<p>Compare <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php">Foxit’s PDF reader</a> to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Adobe Reader</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Foxit is a 2.5 MB download, Adobe is a 25 MB one.</li>
<li>Foxit uses 8 MB of memory for a 700 KB PDF, Adobe uses 56 MB.</li>
<li>Foxit loads in about 1 second, Adobe in 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Foxit is as fast or faster to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so maybe Foxit doesn’t display all the latest 3D JavaScript-enhanced PDFs, but it does all you need, and it does it (relatively) small, fast, and light.</p>

<p>Maybe it helps (or hinders) to be an <a href="http://brush.co.nz/software">embedded programmer</a>, and know how much you <i>can</i> do with 32 KB of code, 2 KB of RAM, and an 8 MHz, 8-bit processor. Sometimes I wish developers had to write code on ancient 66 MHz 486s. Constraints are the mother of optimization, and programmers will usually forget about optimization after it runs “fast enough” on their 42-core Pentium IX, 10 TB RAM development machine.</p>

<p>Sure, I grant that RAM and clock cycles are cheap these days, and we might as well use ’em. But surely there’s a limit to all this. When my (plain text!) editor runs slow enough so I can see the screen updating, there’s something wrong.</p>

<p>When Visual Studio takes 2 entire seconds to pop up a simple properties window the first time, there’s something wrong.</p>

<p>Back in the days when programmers cared about how many characters they could write to video memory during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter">CGA</a> horizontal retrace time without it producing snow — back in those days, and running on a 286, I couldn’t see my screen updating.</p>

<p>We now have 1000’s of times the computing power, and as far as user experience is concerned, stuff runs slower than it used it. And we put up with it, because they’ve added one or two features we like, and it’s “good enough”. But it just ain’t right.</p>

<p>And it’s not just the my text editor and Visual Studio. When <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> first came out, it was so slow on my fairly average hardware that I simply couldn’t use it. And now on my 2 GHz dual-core whatever-it-is, it’s still slow. I click on Inbox the first time, and it takes a second and a half for the message to pop up. Come on, people — you could load a usenet thread off a floppy drive in that time!</p>

<p>Somehow we’ve convinced ourselves that Gmail’s conversation view and anti-spam features make it worth putting up with 750 millisecond <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000722.html">Ajax delays all the time</a>. <i>Nope, it just ain’t right.</i></p>

<p>Recently I was reading from Michael Abrash’s <a href="http://www.byte.com/abrash/"><i>Graphics Programming Black Book</i></a>, and he has something telling (albeit provocative) to say about all this in chapter 2:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.byte.com/abrash/" title="Abrash is the Antibloat"><img src="https://blog.brush.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2008_06_abrash.png" width="150" height="133" alt="Abrash's Black Book"></a>You will notice that my short list of objectives for high-performance assembly programming does not include traditional objectives such as easy maintenance and speed of development. Those are indeed important considerations— to persons and companies that develop and distribute software. <b>People who actually <i>buy</i> software, on the other hand, care only about how well that software performs, not how it was developed nor how it is maintained.</b> These days, developers spend so much time focusing on such admittedly important issues as code maintainability and reusability, source code control, choice of development environment, and the like that they often forget rule #1: From the user’s perspective, <i>performance is fundamental.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>My theory is that it’s gonna take an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">RMS</a>-style prophet to come along, take a few pages out of Abrash’s book, write his own instant-GUI operating system, wake up the masses to the 
joy of responsive computing, and watch the bloat industry crumble.</p>

<p>It’ll be a world where you can turn on your computer and use it immediately. A world where you wait at most half a second for big programs to load. A world where your screen will update even before the keyup event is sent. It won’t be utopia, but I’m still looking forward to it.</p>

<p>We’re taking submissions for this kind of prophet. Drop your résumé or CV in the comments below. :-)</p>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to participate in the Fall 1 2020 batch of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, during the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, I only attended for one day. Still, <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/02/15/how-was-hacker-school/">keeping</a> <a href="https://www.somerandomidiot.com/blog/2015/07/20/retrospective/">with</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@byshiny/my-recurse-center-batch-winter-2-2019-is-the-best-5e9593386ab">the</a> <a href="http://dev.jdherg.com/posts/2015/07/20/the-recurse-center-a-qa-for-past-me/">spirit</a> <a href="https://ljungblad.nu/post/63534520693/new-york-and-recurse-center-prev-hacker-school">of</a> <a href="https://johnloeber.com/w/hackerschool.html">the</a> <a href="https://blog.jabid.in/2017/08/10/rc.html">times</a>, I thought I would write a retrospective. Time to look back on my RC journey!</p>

<p>I had heard of the Recurse Center some years ago, through (I believe) <a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu’s blog</a>. The basic idea is that RC is a “self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers based in New York City”. My mental model for what this looked like is something like this: people from various walks of life come together in a common space to do cool/fun software stuff. Longer term or overarching goals vary somewhat from person to person (e.g. some may want a career change, some want to goof off, some want to learn something very specific), but broadly speaking the participants are there to learn, play, and improve as programmers. As a business, RC operates via supplying recruiters with a pool of talented and motivated job candidates. But for the participants itself it is free, and there is no particular pressure to take a job. Sounds pretty awesome!</p>
<p>Looking back at what I was hoping to get out of RC, the main things were</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to get better at software development, and in my experience one of the best ways to do this is through collaboration with others.</li>
<li>I get excited about sharing things I have learned with. I’m rather introverted, but when it comes to topics I am interested in (e.g. math, programming) there is a lot of joy in communication.</li>
<li>I was interested in learning more about alternative institutions for “adult education”. In today’s age, most people have to navigate an uncertain career path, which involves learning new skills, thinking about how to “rebrand” themselves, and so on. I spent some years in academia (including 5 years teaching), so I am fully aware of how that system works and the baggage it carries with it (<strong>cough</strong> lots of time and debt <strong>cough</strong>). Likewise, now that I’ve been in industry for a few years, I have also come to recognize how unseriously “career development” is taken by many employers (though good managers take it upon themselves to look out for their employees in this regard). For these reasons and more, I have felt institutions like the Recurse Center can play an increasingly important role in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus I thought the Recurse Center had a lot to offer above and beyond an independent sabbatical. But it’s not easy to make it out there to NYC.</p>

<p>I had flirted with the idea of applying to RC for some time, but personal circumstances made committment to it difficult. The first time I considered attending was in 2016, after finishing a math phd. At the time, I did not have the money to support myself living in NYC without a job for 3 months, and so let go of the idea. The second time I considered attending was last year. I was working in the Bay Area as a software engineer and had enough money to pay the bills, but I was also engaged in a long-distance relationship at that time, and was hesitant to uproot myself in a way that would put more physical and emotional distance between myself and my partner (the good news is we’re married and living together now!).</p>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Recurse Center has shifted to an online-only format, and suddenly my excuses for not attending had evaporated. I applied for a batch and went through the standard interview process: first a quick Zoom call to talk about big picture stuff (personal motivation and so on), followed by a pair programming session (I worked on a toy computer algebra system in Python). And like that, I had been accepted!</p>
<p>I was quite excited to attend. But the last step was also the scariest: I had to quit my job. There’s a nerve wracking element to quitting a job during a pandemic, but I felt that in my current role I had stopped growing in a positive direction and imagined that attending RC would give me some time and space to move things forward. So I did it – I put in my notice at work, and spend the last two weeks trying my best to leave my (former) teammates in a position for success with me gone.</p>

<p>The RC interview process was relatively simple: there had been two Zoom calls scheduled, and the information about these was displayed on the Recurse website immediately upon login. Once I had been accepted, though, things got a bit messier.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that running an online educational retreat differs substantially from an in-person one. In the week leading up to the first day of my batch I received a dozen or so emails covering various operational details, invitations to join Zulip (the chat / discussion software used), to join the GitHub organization, requests to fill out my Recurse profile, links to documents with titles like “Remote RC Orientation Guide”, and so on. It was a lot to take in, and I was wrapping up my last week at work, but I figured that I would get the hang of things once the batch officially started.</p>
<p>I also was assigned an onboarding buddy, who I chatted with the Saturday before my first day. This was quite fun, as we happened to have a number of overlapping interests, so the conversation naturally took care of itself. This experience reinforced in my mind that I had made the right decision to attend: spending a few weeks / months hacking around on software stuff with people like this seemed like a real treat.</p>
<p>The last thing I remember from onboarding was a link to a shared calendar, to which anyone could create a new event. There were already quite a few on there, such as a weely meeting for people trying to learn more mathematics, another weekly meeting for a ML reading group, a daily leetcode practice time, “office hours” held by various RC staffers, some fun stuff, like a streamed cello practice on saturdays, music / book clubs, and many more.</p>
<p>One of my concerns about attending remotely is the time difference between participants. I’m on Pacific time, the Recurse Center itself is on Eastern time, and many of the participants for the remote batches are even further away: some in South America, some in Europe, and so on. But most seemed to be based out of North America, and it was a relief to see the calendar events: although some were at times which I likely wouldn’t attend (e.g. there was an Elm hacking session at 3am my time), most were mid-morning to early afternoon PST.</p>
<p>Pretty cool! I went to bed Sunday night, looking forward to my first day at RC.</p>

<p>My first day started like many of my recent days: I woke up, fed the cat, made some coffee, and then sat down at my computer. There were a few convesations on Zulip. I RSVP’ed for the ML reading group and mentioned I’d be happy to join them at whatever point they were at (this group had started a few weeks earlier, so they had already read 6 chapters of a book). I chatted with someone re: asyncio in Python. We talked about how you can view `async def` as syntactic sugar over ordinary python coroutine stuff, what the event loop is doing, and so on.</p>
<p>I observed, but did not participate in some slightly touchier conversations. One discussion was about a blog post re: Google, “don’t be evil”, and the actual nature of incentives. As you would expect, people feel rather strongly about this, and two camps emerged (one roughly “capitalism bad; eat the rich”, the other “welcome to realpolitik; smash your illusions”) before it was shut down by RC staff. I confess much of my interest in this particular conversation was just in getting a feel for the norms around such a discussion (i.e. to understand expectations around how I conduct myself or discuss controversial topics, and so on – basically, I just want to talk code and math and otherwise don’t want to piss anyone off). The Recurse Center has a formal code of conduct and set of community guidelines, but at any organization there are also many the unwritten rules. In this case, for example, I am not sure whether the discussion actually violated any explicit guideline, but once a RC staffer asked them to stop it, the participants did so.</p>
<p>And so it goes. Anyways, after this, I started scoping out the first project to work on: I wanted to write a toy version of the <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/">mill</a> build tool in python to use for another project I had been involved with (basically a big hairy pipeline for astronomical data reduction). I thought through this some, drafted some notes on its design, and ate a late lunch.</p>

<p>There is a common dream which many people experience at some point in their life: they show up to school for the first day of classes, only to realize that they have forgotten to get dressed. I’d never thought about what form this would take for online school. With Zoom, anybody can show up in their underwear, thinking perhaps that the camera is off. But I was dressed!</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, RC used six distinct channels for communicating information to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>direct email, which was the main channel used before I was accepted to the batch</li>
<li>threads on the “Recurse Community” site, which supports something like a message board (but which will also send you emails)</li>
<li>discussions in Zulip (which seemed to be the most active – many conversations every day)</li>
<li>the 1-1 I had with my “onboarding buddy”</li>
<li>the wiki pages, mentioned above</li>
<li>the calendar itself, which is the main way in which events are communicated and coordinated. It’s how I found friends to talk about ML with, for example.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also a “Virtual RC” space, which is something like a 2D HTML5 canvas MMO where you can move your avatar to various “rooms”. It’s kind of cute; someone was camped outside by a tree.</p>
<p>Bombarded by all of this information, much of which came last week when I was trying to wrap things up at my job, I basically a) added a tag in gmail to at least get all the RC related notifications under one heading, b) made sure to read the “Remote RC Orientation …</p></div></div>

<p>The Indian Space Research Organization’s (ISRO’s) <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/flipping_book/annual_report_2019-20_english/files/assets/common/downloads/Annual%20Report%202019-20%20(English).pdf">annual report</a> for 2019-2020 lists a bunch of future space missions that India’s premier, albeit only, space organization plans to undertake. Among other things, there are some unique space science missions that ISRO aims to launch within the next five years.</p>



<h3>Collaboration with NASA on a radar-imaging satellite</h3>



<p>The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite will be the first satellite with a dual-frequency radar imaging system. At <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://syntheticapertureradar.com/nasa-isro-sar-project-nisar/" target="_blank">$1.5 billion</a>, it’s among the most expensive Earth-observation satellites ever built. Following its planned launch onboard a GSLV Mk II rocket in 2021, it will be placed in a Sun-synchronous orbit so that its solar panels can provide constant power.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="834" src="https://i2.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fdf52-nisar-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C834&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>An artist’s impression of the&nbsp;NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar. <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/nasa-isro-synthetic-aperture-radar-nisar/">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>NISAR’s dual-frequency radar imaging system will reveal ongoing changes in Earth’s crust, polar ice, climatic processes, biomass, etc., at a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/nisarmission/observationstrategy/" target="_blank">high resolution</a> of 3–50 m, at a rapid bi-weekly pace, globally. The satellite will also be used for disaster management, whereby its data will be available only a few hours after observations. ISRO and NASA have said they’ll place all science data from the mission in the public domain.</p>



<h3>India’s first solar observatory</h3>



<p>India’s first space telescope, Astrosat, was designed to observe high-energy cosmic objects in multiple wavelengths. ISRO’s second space telescope will study the Sun with its seven instruments. Launching next year onboard a PSLV-XL rocket, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.isro.gov.in/aditya-l1-first-indian-mission-to-study-sun" target="_blank">Aditya-L1 mission</a> will observe the Sun’s surface and atmosphere. It will be placed at the first Lagrangian point (L1) between the Sun and Earth, where the dynamic gravitational attraction between these two bodies roughly cancel out.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1085" height="942" src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/b798a-aditya-l1-1.jpg?resize=1085%2C942&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>A schematic illustration of Aditya-L1 and its instruments. <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/aditya-l1-first-indian-mission-to-study-sun">Credit: ISRO</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The L1 point is not a point as much as a small region in space, host to multiple solar science missions in the past, such as SOHO, ACE, WIND, DSCOVR, etc. Like those, Aditya-L1 will observe the Sun uninterrupted from this vantage point. The spacecraft’s uniqueness is the ability to observe the Sun in multiple wavelengths while also measuring the solar magnetic field and the solar wind radiation using its in-situ instruments.</p>



<p>In 2018, NASA launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://jatan.space/space-missions/parker-solar-probe/">Parker Solar Probe</a>&nbsp;on a mission to go right into the Sun’s atmosphere to unravel its mysteries! ESA also launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/solar-orbiter/-/44167-objectives">Solar Orbiter</a>&nbsp;this year on a similar mission except it’ll study the Sun from a bit farther away but still closer in than Mercury. Aditya-L1 will study the Sun from much further away but its global views will allow for its observations to complement data from the NASA and ESA probes.</p>



<p>The hope for scientists globally with these solar missions is to explain why the Sun’s corona is hotter than its surface by several million degrees. This is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/the-mystery-of-coronal-heating" target="_blank">major unsolved problem</a> in solar physics.</p>



<h3>Specialized X-ray telescope</h3>



<p>ISRO will be launching another space science mission, called X-ray Polarimetry Satellite (<a href="http://www.unoosa.org/documents/pdf/copuos/2017/copuos2017tech30E.pdf">XPoSat</a>), on a PSLV rocket in 2021. Unlike the Swiss Army knife that is Astrosat, XPoSat will be a smaller, specialized Earth orbiting satellite that will study the polarization of X-rays in space. How radiation is polarized gives away the nature of its source, including the strength and distribution of its magnetic fields and radiation around it.</p>



<p>To this day, the Crab Nebula remains the only X-ray source for which scientists have measured the polarization. XPoSat is expected to provide the same information about the 50 brightest known sources in the universe, including pulsars, X-ray binary stars and gigantic-black-hole-hosting galactic cores.</p>







<p>XPoSat’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://rri.res.in/~bpaul/polix.html" target="_blank">polarimeter instrument</a> works in the medium X-ray region, specifically 8–30 keV. It is being built and tested by scientists at the Raman Research Institute.</p>



<h3>A Venus orbiter in the making</h3>



<p>Last year, ISRO <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/ao_venus.pdf" target="_blank">called for instrument proposals</a> for a Venus orbiter mission, <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/meetings/archive/vexag-17/presentations/Nigar.pdf">Shukrayaan</a>, to be launched in 2023. This is great because an initial interest in exploring the planet, in the 1960s and 1970s, quickly faded after Mars started getting all the attention.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="887" src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/isro-venus-orbiter-cover.jpg?resize=1024%2C887&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/isro-venus-orbiter-cover.jpg?resize=1024%2C887&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/isro-venus-orbiter-cover.jpg?resize=200%2C173&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/isro-venus-orbiter-cover.jpg?resize=768%2C665&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/isro-venus-orbiter-cover.jpg?resize=1200%2C1039&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/isro-venus-orbiter-cover.jpg?w=1494&amp;ssl=1 1494w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>A not-to-scale representation of ISRO’s Venus orbiter mission Shukrayaan.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://jatan.space/why-explore-venus/">Venus needs to be explored</a> not just because it hosted water for at least 2 billion years, longer than Mars, but also to understand&nbsp;how Earth-like planets change over time, and what makes Earth a haven for life. Right now, there is only one spacecraft at Venus, the Japanese orbiter <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sas/planet_c/" target="_blank">Akatsuki</a>, compared to <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-images/where-we-are-on-1-june-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight at Mars</a> and <a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/mars2020">three more on its way</a>. So ISRO sending a mission to Venus should be refreshing for the global planetary science community.</p>



<p>Shukrayaan is expected to have a payload capacity of 100 kg and the spacecraft will be placed in a highly elliptical orbit of 500 ✕ 60,000 km, allowing for both closeup and global observations. In addition to the room for 12 Indian instruments, ISRO will also be adding a few international ones. This is great, as attested by Chandrayaan 1’s <a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">co-discovery of water on the Moon</a> with NASA.</p>



<p>The primary scientific objectives of Shukrayaan include studies of Venus’ surface and subsurface, its atmospheric chemistry and solar wind interactions with the planet. NASA has <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20181130/3483688.html" target="_blank">expressed interest</a> in sending a terahertz instrument onboard the orbiter to see through Venus’s thick atmosphere and observe chemical reactions below.</p>



<hr>



<p>Other missions in ISRO’s pipeline include a follow-up of the Mars Orbiter Mission in 2024. It’ll likely be an orbiter similar to Shukrayaan in terms of payload capacity. There are also plans to follow up on Astrosat and <a href="https://jatan.space/space-digest-chandrayaan-2/">Chandrayaan 2</a> but details are unclear at the moment.</p>



<p>Given ISRO’s fairly nascent space science program, the boost to such missions is a welcome trajectory for India’s space exploration endeavors. Here’s hoping that India goes all in on this trend and makes deep space exploration a prioritized national goal just like it has done to <a href="https://jatan.space/astronauts-begin-training-for-gaganyaan-in-russia/">launch astronauts</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This document provides a brief introduction to logic grammars,
as background information for work on the representation of
XSD schemas in logic grammar form.</p><p>The term <i>logic grammar</i> is used to denote
grammars written in logic-programming systems; this paper describes
both <em>definite-clause grammars</em> (DCGs), which are a
built-in part of most Prolog systems, and <em>definite-clause
translation grammars</em> (DCTGs), which employ a similar formalism.
DCTGs closely resemble attribute grammars as described by [<a href="#id2633220">Knuth 1968</a>] and later writers and it is a bit easier to
handle complex or voluminous attribute value functions in DCTGs than
in DCGs.</p><p>Both DCGs and DCTGs can be regarded as syntactic sugar for straight
Prolog; before execution, both notations are translated into Prolog
clauses in the usual notation.</p><div>
<h2><a name="id2619314">1. </a>Definite-clause grammars</h2><p>This section reviews the basics of definite-clause grammars and their
notation.  I'll present a simple grammar in two or three versions,
to illustrate the use of DCG notation.</p><p>Readers who don't find this introduction detailed enough
may consult one of the Prolog books listed among the references.</p>
<div>
<h3><a name="id2614439">1.1. </a>Grammar E1: A trivial grammar for a fragment of English</h3><div><p>Here is a simple DCG for a trivially small fragment of English, 
which I'll call E1.  It is taken from example 8.1 in 
[<a href="#id2633257">König/Seiffert 1989</a>], an 
introduction to Prolog for linguists:</p><pre>%%% Grammar E1, a trivial fragment of English
s --&gt; np, vp.  % A sentence (s) is a noun phrase (np) 
               % plus a verb phrase
np --&gt; det, n. % A noun phrase is a determiner plus a noun
np --&gt; n.      % ... or just a noun.
vp --&gt; v, np.  % A verb phrase is a verb and its direct 
               % object, which is an np
vp --&gt; v.      % ... or just the verb (for intransitives).
n --&gt; [mary].  % 'mary', 'john', 'woman, 'man', 'apple' 
               % are nouns.
n --&gt; [john].
n --&gt; [woman].
n --&gt; [man].
n --&gt; [apple].
det --&gt; [the]. % 'the' is a determiner
v --&gt; [loves]. % 'loves', 'eats', and 'sings' are verbs.
v --&gt; [eats].
v --&gt; [sings].
</pre><p>
This grammar generates sentences like “John loves Mary”
and “The man sings” and “The woman eats the apple”,
as well as the somewhat less plausible “The apple sings the Mary.”</p></div><div><p>When a Prolog system consults a file containing this grammar,
the rules of the grammar are automatically translated into 
canonical Prolog clauses using <em>difference lists</em>:</p><pre>?- listing([s,np,vp,n,det,v]).

s(A, B) :-
        np(A, C),
        vp(C, B).

np(A, B) :-
        det(A, C),
        n(C, B).
np(A, B) :-
        n(A, B).

vp(A, B) :-
        v(A, C),
        np(C, B).
vp(A, B) :-
        v(A, B).

n([mary|A], A).
n([john|A], A).
n([woman|A], A).
n([man|A], A).
n([apple|A], A).

det([the|A], A).

v([loves|A], A).
v([eats|A], A).
v([sings|A], A).

Yes
?- </pre>
</div><div><p>
Difference lists are pairs of lists such that the second list is a
suffix of the first list (i.e. the same from some point or other to
the end), for example, the pair </p><tt>[a, b, c, d]</tt><p> and
</p><tt>[c, d]</tt><p>, which together denote the list </p><tt>[a,
b]</tt><p>, or (among the terminal rules above) </p><tt>[loves|A]</tt><p>
and </p><tt>A</tt><p>, which together denote the list
</p><tt>[loves]</tt><p>. Prolog-based parsers commonly use difference
lists to represent the input; they allow the Prolog clauses which
recognize structures in the input list to consume as much of the input
list (the first list in the pair) as they wish, and pass the rest of
the input (the second list in the pair) to the next clause.  If a DCG
predicate succeeds with its final two arguments unified to the
difference-list pair </p><tt>[a, b, c, d]</tt><p> and </p><tt>[c,
d]</tt><p>, what it means is that the grammar rule recognized the list
</p><tt>[a, b]</tt><p>.
</p></div><p>
In the clause for <i>s</i>, we can see how one part of the
parser picks up where another leaves off. The input list is
<i>A</i>, and the <i>np</i> predicate recognizes a
noun phrase at the beginning of <i>A</i>.  The portion of the
list which follows the noun phrase is assigned to <i>C</i>.
The predicate <i>vp</i> then tries to recognize a verb phrase
at the beginning of list <i>C</i>.  What is left after the
verb phrase is assigned, in turn, to list <i>B</i>, which is
both ‘<span>the part of the input list after the verb phrase</span>’
(in the predicate <i>vp</i>)
and (because the verb phrase can be the last item in a sentence)
also ‘<span>the part of the input after the <i>s</i></span>’
(in the predicate <i>s</i>).
</p><div><p>For example, given the sentence </p><tt>[the, woman, eats,
the, apple]</tt><p>, the first rule for <i>np</i> will
be called with its first argument bound to the entire input
string; after it recognizes the initial noun phrase, the
second argument will be bound to the part of the sentence
which follows the noun phrase, namely </p><tt>[eats,the,apple]</tt><p>.
The predicate <i>vp</i> will then recognize the
verb phrase </p><tt>[eats,the,apple]</tt><p>, leaving the empty
list </p><tt>[]</tt><p> as the part of the input after the sentence.[<a name="ref-to-id2614744" href="#id2614744">1</a>]
</p></div></div>
<div>
<h3><a name="id2614771">1.2. </a>Calling the parser</h3><div><p>
The following fragment of a Prolog session log shows how the
grammar can be used to test the grammaticality of sentences;
it also shows that the grammar could use some refinement.
To test whether a given sequence of tokens is an <i>s</i>,
we call the Prolog predicate <i>s</i> with two difference-list
arguments.  If we specify the empty list as the second argument,
we in effect require that the entire input sequence be a legal
sentence.

</p><pre>?-  s([john,loves,mary],[]).

Yes
?- s([the,woman,eats,the,apple],[]).

Yes
?- s([the,man,sings],[]).

Yes
?- s([apple,eats,woman,the],[]).

No
?- s([apple,sings,the,mary],[]).

Yes
?- </pre>
</div><div><p>We can use a variable as a second argument, instead of the
empty list; in this case, Prolog will tell us each prefix of the
input list which can be parsed as a sentence according to our grammar:
</p><pre>?- s([the,woman,eats,the,apple],Remainder).

Remainder = [] ;

Remainder = [the, apple] ;

No
?- </pre><p>
In one parse, the entire input is parsed as a sentence, and
the remainder is the empty list.  An alternative parse, however,
is just to take </p><tt>[the,woman,eats]</tt><p> as a sentence,
leaving </p><tt>[the,apple]</tt><p> as the remainder.</p></div></div>
<div>
<h3><a name="id2614874">1.3. </a>Grammar E2: A simple attribute grammar</h3><p>An <em>attribute grammar</em> is a context-free grammar in
which the nodes of the parse tree carry attributes (annotations in the
form of name-value pairs).  The values of attributes are calculated
according to specifications associated with the production rules of
the context-free grammar.  Attribute values may propagate top-down
(inherited attributes) or bottom-up (synthesized attributes) in the
parse tree.</p><p>An accessible formal description of attribute grammars is given
by [<a href="#id2632913">Alblas 1991</a>].  Informally, attribute
grammars are sometimes described as context-free grammars with
parameters on the non-terminals.</p><p>We can turn the simple context-free grammar E1 into an attribute
grammar by adding parameters to the productions; I will call the
attribute grammar E2.  In E2, one parameter is used to generate a 
structural description of the sentence, another to check for 
subject-verb agreement in grammatical number.</p><div><p>Thus extended with parameters, and a few more words in the
lexicon, the grammar looks like this:</p><pre>%%% E2: a trivial attribute grammar for a fragment of
%%% English, with a synthesized attribute for structural 
%%% description and enforcement of number agreement.

s(s(S,P)) --&gt; np(S,Num), vp(P,Num).
np(np(D,N),Num) --&gt; det(D,Num), n(N,Num).
np(np(N),pl) --&gt; n(N,pl).
np(np(N),sg) --&gt; pn(N,sg).
vp(vp(V,O),Num) --&gt; v(V,Num), np(O,_).
vp(vp(V),Num) --&gt; v(V,Num).
n(n(L),Num) --&gt; [L], { lex(L,n,Num) }.
pn(pn(L),Num) --&gt; [L], { lex(L,pn,Num) }.
v(v(L),Num) --&gt; [L], { lex(L,v,Num) }.
det(det(L),Num) --&gt; [L], { lex(L,det,Num) }.

lex(mary,pn,sg).
lex(john,pn,sg).
lex(woman,n,sg).
lex(women,n,pl).
lex(man,n,sg).
lex(men,n,pl).
lex(apple,n,sg).
lex(apples,n,pl).
lex(the,det,_).
lex(some,det,pl).
lex(one,det,sg).
lex(loves,v,sg).
lex(love,v,pl).
lex(eats,v,sg).
lex(eat,v,pl).
lex(sings,v,sg).
lex(sing,v,pl).
</pre></div><div><p>When parsed with this grammar, the sentence 
“John loves Mary” is assigned the structure </p><tt>s(np(pn(john)),
vp(v(loves), np(pn(mary))))</tt><p> — or, with
pretty-printing:</p><pre>s(
  np(
     pn(john)
    ), 
  vp(
     v(loves), 
     np(
        pn(mary)
       )
    )
 )</pre><p>
Here, the grammatical structure for each non-terminal on the
left-hand side of a grammar rule is synthesized from
the grammatical structures of the non-terminals on the right-hand side
of the rule.  So it's a synthetic attribute.</p></div><p>On some productions, a second parameter is used to enforce
agreement in number between subject and verb and between
determiner and noun.  Here, Prolog's unification mechanism makes
it unnecessary to distinguish between synthetic and inherited
attributes.  The sentence is grammatical if and only if the
number (<i>Num</i>) of the <i>np</i> and that of
the <i>vp</i> agree; whether the attribute flows bottom-up
on each of these, or bottom-up on one and top-down on the other
need not concern us.</p><div><p>In this version of the grammar, it is worth calling the reader's
attention to the Prolog clauses enclosed in braces on the right-hand
side of some rules, e.g. in 
</p><pre>n(n(L),Num) --&gt; [L], { lex(L,n,Num)}.</pre><p>
These Prolog clauses express constraints on the grammatical
construction which are not themselves grammatical constituents.  They
are sometimes called ‘guards’ (e.g. by [<a href="#id2632980">Brown/Blair 1990</a>]); they correspond directly to
the ‘semantic conditions’ which are a constituent
part of attribute grammars as described by [<a href="#id2632913">Alblas 1991</a>].  With the guard, this rule can be paraphrased as
saying “A noun (an <i>n</i>), has the structure
</p><tt>n(L)</tt><p> and the grammatical number </p><tt>Num</tt><p>,
<em>if</em> (a) <i>L</i> (for ‘lexical
form’) is a single item in the input list </p><tt>[L]</tt><p>,
and (b) the relation <i>lex</i> contains the triple
</p><tt>(L,n,Num)</tt><p>.”</p></div><p>Such guards will be present in many of the rules we use
to represent XML Schema in logic grammars.</p><div><p>By calling the grammar rules, we can instantiate a variable
with the structural description of the sentence.</p><pre>?- s(Struc,[john,loves,mary],[]).

Struc = s(np(pn(john)), vp(v(loves), np(pn(mary)))) 

Yes
?- s(S,[the,woman,eats,the,apple],[]).

S = s(np(det(the), n(woman)), vp(v(eats), np(det(the), n(apple)))) 

Yes
?- s(S,[the,man,sings],[]).

S = s(np(det(the), n(man)), vp(v(sings))) 

Yes
?- s(S,[apple,sings,the,mary],[]).

No
?- s(S,[the,apple,sings,mary],[]).

S = s(np(det(the), …</pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>Besides podcasts, blogs, vlogs, etc. reading books is still something many software developers don’t want to miss.</p>
<p>Although I have read many good books covering software engineering and other things in tech, I’m currently studying finances and investments. I want to learn their “best practices” just like in programming.</p>
<p><strong>Today there are hundreds (if not thousands) of books on wealth growth, and obviously, it’s impossible to skim all of them because the average person reads between 25 and 30 books per year.</strong> Hence, finding the ones worth reading in finance and investment to accomplish your financial goals like below is not that easy; at least it wasn’t for me.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Financial Goals To Start Now:</p><p>- Build an Emergency Fund of 10k</p><p>- Save / Invest 25-50% of Income Per Month</p><p>- Read 10 Books About Finance </p><p>- Find a New Side Hustle </p><p>- Pay Off Your Debt </p><p>- Track Your Expenses </p><p>- Monetize a New Skill </p><p>- Buy Real Estate</p></div>— Real Estate John 🏡 (@john_moore7) <a href="https://twitter.com/john_moore7/status/1282810412841472001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>However, there are evergreens available, books that are still relevant today, and often recommended by investors, financial experts, and people who are interested in investment in general.</p>
<p><strong>Here are my top-10 books.</strong> I would recommend reading these for any software developer or person in tech, who is willing to become financially literate, set up their financial goals, reach financial independence and early retirement:</p>
<h2 id="1-the-intelligent-investorhttpsamznto3kklamy"><a href="https://amzn.to/3kKLaMy">1. The Intelligent Investor</a></h2>
<p>It’s the definitive book on value investing written by none other than Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett’s tutor.</p>
<p>The author preaches diversification, prudence, and the importance of not getting caught up in bull markets—speculative investments during bull markets can lead to huge loss of principal investment.</p>
<p>Graham also pointed out that <strong>investors should look at the underlying value of a business before investing in any company business:</strong> there are no good or bad stocks; there are undervalued and overvalued ones.</p>
<p>Investing formula from the book: buy more shares when the market is low than when it is high, and it’ll likely end up with satisfactory overall pricing for your investor’s holdings.</p>
<p><strong>There are three principles of intelligent investing:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An intelligent investor always analyzes the long-term evolution and management policies of a company before investing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An intelligent investor always protects themselves from losses by diversifying investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An intelligent investor never looks for crazy returns but focuses on safe and steady profit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In Buffett’s words:</strong></p>
<p>Rule No. 1: Never lose money.
Rule No. 2: Never forget, Rule No. 1.</p>

<h2 id="2-common-stocks-and-uncommon-profitshttpsamznto3flaidc"><a href="https://amzn.to/3fLAidC">2. Common Stocks And Uncommon Profits</a></h2>
<p>Fantastic if you are interested in what makes any business tick!</p>
<p><strong>This is the only investment book I ever read and even studied that gave me a feeling of being “well-equipped” with the potential to become a successful investor.</strong></p>
<p>Fisher’s guidelines are quite helpful, but they are mostly qualitative-based compared to those of Graham’s and Buffett’s, which are more quantitative, like how to research management and qualitative details of a company; R&amp;D investments; what the company’s doing to improve margins, among other criteria.</p>
<p>In my own experience, I have tried to apply some of the few tricks and tips from the author, which helped me answer the questions while analyzing stocks because I know that the growth stock (when bought young) offers by far the highest possibility of gain.</p>
<p>Comprehensible and timeless investment classical book that should be read by anyone serious about achieving success in the stock market.</p>

<p>If you understand mathematics, you will definitely understand money.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of Tony Robbins, but in his book, Tony provides <strong>the best explanation of why most people don’t make it in the markets, and the minority does.</strong> The main focus is on</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>core principles of investing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asset allocation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>investor psychology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>admin fees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tax laws</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, even though his book most US-centric on US tax law examples, while being a tax resident in Germany, I knew not much about tax laws in Germany. Still, the theory behind these principles is the same in the majority of developed and developing countries. That’s why always make sure you invest in a way that is the most tax-efficient, and you don’t get a hefty chunk of money removed from your profit when you come to withdraw.</p>
<p><strong>The core lesson is to shape your mindset into unshakeable financially,</strong> which requires determination, integrity, smart working, knowledge, and forward-thinking!</p>

<h2 id="4-rich-dad-poor-dadhttpsamznto2cmykss"><a href="https://amzn.to/2CmyKsS">4. Rich Dad Poor Dad</a></h2>
<p>If you stop working today, how long can you survive?</p>
<p><strong>No. 1 advice on how to make your assets work for you, so you can quit your job, enjoy life, and make money while having a dream life.</strong></p>
<p>The truth that the rich dad focuses on generating income and assets, and the poor dad and middle-class dad view their liabilities as an asset.</p>
<p><strong>This book is a must for everyone who is looking for financial independence.</strong> It will help you to grow your mindset towards money and shows you how people, in reality, are held back in terms of finance due to their upbringing.</p>

<p>There’s nothing truly revolutionary in the book published in 1926, which is why I like it. It is a bit of a fiction, but the stories bring out important lessons.</p>
<p>I was lead to this book by “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” and this book further explains what Robert means by “pay myself first.”</p>
<p><strong>The underlying message is to spend less than you make and save (invest) the rest.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant book takeaway is that wealth goes as quickly as it comes if in the hands of a negligent person, in other words, in the hands of a materialistic consumer.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read this book yet, you must do it. It’s a powerful read on wealth creation.</p>

<p>The receipt in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t work too much for someone</li>
<li>Earn the same money for less amount of work</li>
</ul>
<p>Tim Ferriss earns around $90000 per month with 4 hours of work per week. <strong>How does he do it exactly?</strong> More importantly, how can you do it, the answer you can find is by reading his book.</p>

<p>This book is clear and to the point about how to be a long-term investor to pursue average market gains with minimal losses.</p>
<p>Though it is a heavy emphasis on sticking to <a href="https://ilonacodes.com/investor-profile/?r=ic">your financial plan that fits your risk profile</a>, asset class allocation, and investing in index funds and ETFs, keep it simple and passive as much as possible.</p>
<p>It’s an excellent overview of investing, especially when saving for retirement. The book is down-to-earth and straight to the point. It contains a lot of valuable advice for any new person who wants to start investing and understanding financial jargon.</p>

<p>Beginner investors will not go wrong, implementing the advice outlined by the author!</p>
<p>Because <strong>it is very applicable to the many individual investors today:</strong> investing in index funds is a great low-cost and low-maintenance way to profit and get the market’s return.</p>
<p>To provide more context to the reader, Bogle illustrates returns of various mutual funds and index funds through diagrams and charts. Also, he compares, based on how invested, your original investment, and how it would look after a particular time.</p>
<p>Moreover, I like the book format. It’s divided into short chapters along with useful data, and neat quotation sections at the end of each chapter.</p>

<h2 id="10-think-and-grow-richhttpsamznto2pkkllk"><a href="https://amzn.to/2PKKLLK">10. Think and Grow Rich</a></h2>
<p>No doubt, this book’s principles can be used in any area of life, not just about monetary wealth, because richness means not only necessarily money. It measures not only in terms of financial gain and success but also in business ownership, development, intelligence, and working in general.</p>
<p><strong>Richness has everything to do with investing in yourself!</strong></p>
<p>Everything starts with how we think. We can achieve anything we want:</p>
<p><em>“Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.”—Napoleon Hill</em></p>
<p><strong>The book contains success stories for 13 lessons from people who have made great strides in achieving unbelievable financial goals.</strong> Every story begins with the idea when the person has committed themselves, so the opportunities come, and they begin to prosper.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it’s the only book a person needs to read to learn how to grow rich because most of the other such books are either inspired, referenced, or paraphrased from this book.</p>
<p><strong>Think, grow, be rich!</strong></p>

Be sure to check the <a href="https://esphome.io/devices/nodemcu_esp8266.html">documentation</a> for the specific board you’re using, and connect the pins correctly.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Managers are responsible for partnering with reports to grow their career. This growth should be primarily facilitated by the work that is given to the report. This growth should not be primarily facilitated by “extracurriculars.” Let’s dive into some details.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of ways people can grow skill-sets: the work the business needs or extracurriculars. Extracurriculars are things that are not (or are not in service of accomplishing) a priority for the business. Extracurriculars commonly include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading a book</li>
  <li>Doing side projects</li>
  <li>Taking an online class</li>
  <li>Going to meetups</li>
  <li>Going to conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies should to the best of their ability support people who want to do these things. However, it’s a common anti-pattern for managers (and reports, and companies) to treat these activities as primary drivers of growth. There’s a couple main reasons why people intuitively lean on extracurriculars when trying to drive growth:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The alternative to extracurriculars is having people take on work that stretches their ability/skill set, which is less efficient for the business. Stated otherwise: extracurriculars are perceived as 0-risk to the business.</li>
  <li>Interests are confused with growth. Instead of finding ways to strategically grow in a role and in the company, people start growth conversations from “what kind of stuff are you interested in?”*</li>
</ul>

<p>Extracurriculars-as-growth has some major problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The machinery of the company is not set up to hold you accountable to actual delivery of extracurriculars. Nobody ever got a raise because they read a book. Nobody ever got fired because they didn’t read a book. It’s very common to see  extracurricular tasks in growth plans only to never be followed up on.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are usually done off the clock. Companies often don’t make time for people to actually do that work and it’s implicit that the report needs to find time to do both those things and their regular work. Company-driven growth should be done nearly exclusively on the company’s time. Because homework is often not a priority, the company often doesn’t support it being done on the clock, and this - appropriately, obviously - leads to conflict. Expecting homework from an employee isn’t fair.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are often interest-based, not growth-based. So the work often doesn’t translate into any meaningful increase in impact at the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so extracurriculars-as-growth is bad. Let’s fix it. It’s easy - skills should be grown via work the business needs. The company supports that work and holds people accountable to doing it. That growth will be directly in-line with what the company needs. And growing via that work will also actually deliver impact in a way that gets you rewards.</p>

<p>Like eating your vegetables or daily exercise - it sounds easy, but putting this into practice can be difficult. In fact, getting it done is a major culture shift. You have to build a culture that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is willing to invest in people at the cost of optimal delivery in the short term.</li>
  <li>Trusts people to fail. The other main anti-pattern is to give people a chance and then pull them out of the critical path the minute they make a mistake.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Try it <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/try.html">here</a>! The online version is mainly good for small programs currently; see <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/running.html">running.md</a> for more options.</em></p>
<p><strong>BQN</strong> is a new programming language in the APL lineage, which aims to remove inconsistent and burdensome aspects of the APL tradition and put the great ideas on a firmer footing. BQN is aimed at existing and aspiring APL-family programmers, and using it requires a solid understanding of functions and multidimensional arrays. However, because of its focus on providing simple, consistent, and powerful array operations, BQN should also be a good language for learning array programming and building stronger array intuition.</p>
<p>BQN maintains many of the ideas that made APL\360 revolutionary in 1966:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human-friendly <strong>infix notation</strong> with no precedence rules to remember.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in array operations</strong> handle any number of dimensions easily.</li>
<li><strong>Higher-order functions</strong> allow basic functions to be applied in more powerful ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>It incorporates concepts developed over years of APL practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/leading.html"><strong>leading axis model</strong></a>, which allows for simpler built-in functions.</li>
<li>Trains and combinators for <strong>tacit programming</strong>.</li>
<li>Lightweight <strong>anonymous functions</strong> (like <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dfn">dfns</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But BQN is redesigned from the ground up, with brand new ideas to make these paradigms easier to use and less likely to fail.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>based array model</strong> makes non-arrays a fundamental part of the language, and removes the surprise of floating arrays and the hassle of explicit boxes. New <strong>array notation</strong> eliminates the gotchas of <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Strand_notation">stranding</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/context.html"><strong>context-free grammar</strong></a> where a value's syntactic role is determined by its spelling makes it easier for machines and humans to understand code.</li>
<li>Oh, and it naturally leads to <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/functional.html"><strong>first-class functions</strong></a>, a feature often missed in APL.</li>
<li>The <strong>new symbols</strong> for built-in functionality allow the syntactic role of a primitive to be distinguished at a glance, and aim to be more consistent and intuitive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-name-is-bqn">What kind of name is "BQN"?</h2>
<p>It's three letters, that happen to match the capitals in "Big Questions Notation". You can pronounce it "bacon", but are advised to avoid this unless there's puns.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-bqn-look-like">What does BQN look like?</h2>
<p>Rather strange, most likely:</p>
<pre>    <span>âŠ‘+</span><span>`</span><span>âˆ˜</span><span>âŒ½</span><span>â�Ÿ</span><span>12</span><span>â†•</span><span>2</span>  144
</pre>
<p>For longer samples, you can <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/src/c.bqn">gaze into the abyss</a> that is the self-hosted compiler, or the <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/src/r.bqn">shallower but wider abyss</a> of the runtime, or take a look at the friendlier <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/md.bqn">markdown processor</a> used to format and highlight documentation files. There are also <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/examples/fifty.bqn">some translations</a> from <a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/50/">"A History of APL in 50 Functions"</a> here.</p>
<h2 id="array-model">Array model</h2>
<p>Most of BQN's functionality deals with the manipulation of multidimensional arrays. However, it discards many of the complications of traditional APL <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Array_model">array models</a>. Unlike in APL, non-array data is possible, and common: numbers, characters, and functions are not arrays (see the full list of <a href="#types">types</a> below). This avoids some difficulties that show up when trying to treat scalar arrays as the fundamental unit; in particular, there is no "floating" so a value is always different from a scalar array that contains it. This system has been <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/586656.586663">proposed</a> in APL's past under the name <strong>based array theory</strong>.</p>
<p>Currently, the intention is that arrays will not have prototypes, so that all empty arrays of the same shape behave identically. Different elements of an array should not influence each other. While some APLs force numbers placed in the same array to a common representation, which may have different precision properties, BQN will enforce 64-bit floating-point precision, and only use representations or methods compatible with it (for example, integers up to 32 bits).</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>BQN syntax consists of expressions where computation is done with a little organizing structure around them like assignment, functions, and list notation. Expressions are where the programmer is in control so the design tries to do as much as possible with them before introducing special syntax.</p>
<h3 id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
<p>Like APL, BQN uses four <em>syntactic roles</em> for values in expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>, like APL arrays or J nouns</li>
<li><strong>Functions</strong>, or verbs in J</li>
<li><strong>1-Modifiers</strong>, like APL monadic operators or J adverbs</li>
<li><strong>2-Modifiers</strong>, like APL dyadic operators or J conjunctions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These roles work exactly like they do in APL, with functions applying to one or two subject arguments, 1-modifiers taking a single function or subject on the left, and 2-modifiers taking a function or subject on each side.</p>
<p>Unlike APL, in BQN the syntactic role of a value is determined purely by the way it's spelled: a lowercase first letter (<code><span>name</span></code>) makes it a subject, an uppercase first letter (<code><span>Name</span></code>) makes it a function, and underscores are used for 1-modifiers (<code><span>_name</span></code>) and 2-modifiers (<code><span>_name_</span></code>). Below, the function <code><span>{</span><span>ð�•Ž</span><span>ð�•©</span><span>}</span></code> treats its left argument <code><span>ð�•Ž</span></code> as a function and its right argument <code><span>ð�•©</span></code> as a subject. With a list of functions, we can make a table of the square and square root of a few numbers:</p>
<pre>    <span>âŸ¨</span><span>Ã—</span><span>Ëœ</span><span>,</span><span>âˆš</span><span>âŸ©</span> <span>{</span><span>ð�•Ž</span><span>ð�•©</span><span>}</span><span>âŒœ</span> <span>1</span><span>â€¿</span><span>4</span><span>â€¿</span><span>9</span>
â”Œâ”€         
â•µ 1 16 81  
  1  2  3  
          â”˜
</pre>
<p>BQN's built-in operations also have patterns to indicate the syntactic role: 1-modifiers (<code><span>ËœÂ¨Ë˜â�¼âŒœÂ´`</span></code>) are all superscript characters, and 2-modifiers (<code><span>âˆ˜â—‹âŠ¸âŸœâŒ¾âŠ˜â—¶âš‡âŽ‰â�Ÿ</span></code>) all have an unbroken circle (two functions <code><span>âŒ½â�‰</span></code> have broken circles with lines through them). Every other built-in constant is a function, although the special symbols <code><span>Â¯</span></code>, <code><span>âˆž</span></code>, and <code><span>Ï€</span></code> are used as part of numeric literal notation.</p>

<h3 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h3>
<p><em>Combinators</em> only control the application of functions. Because a non-function operand applies as a constant function, some combinators have extra meanings when passed a constant. For example, <code><span>0</span><span>Ëœ</span></code> is the constant function that always returns 0 and <code><span>0</span><span>âŠ¸</span><span>&lt;</span></code> is the function that tests whether its right argument is greater than 0.</p>

<p>Choose isn't really a combinator since it calls the function <code><span>âŠ‘</span></code>, and Under is not a true combinator since it has an "undo" step at the end. This step might be implemented using the left operand's inverse (<em>computational</em> Under) or its structural properties (<em>structural</em> Under).</p>
<p>Other modifiers control array traversal and iteration. In three cases a simpler 1-modifier is paired with a generalized 2-modifier: in each case the 1-modifier happens to be the same as the 2-modifier with a right operand of <code><span>Â¯1</span></code>.</p>

<p>Numbers allow the typical decimal notation with <code><span>Â¯</span></code> for the negative sign (because <code><span>-</span></code> is a function) and <code><span>e</span></code> for scientific notation (or <code><span>E</span></code>, as numeric notation is case-insensitive). <code><span>âˆž</span></code> and <code><span>Ï€</span></code> may be used as special numeric values. Complex numbers are also allowed, with the components separated by <code><span>i</span></code>.</p>
<p>Strings are written with double quotes <code><span>""</span></code>, and characters with single quotes <code>''</code> with a single character in between. A double quote within a string can be escaped by writing it twice; if two string literals are next to each other, they must be separated by a space. In contrast, character literals do not use escapes, as the length is already known.</p>
<h3 id="separators">Separators</h3>
<p>The characters <code><span>â‹„</span></code> and <code><span>,</span></code> and newline are completely interchangeable and are used to separate expressions. An expression might be an element in a list or a line in a function. Empty sectionsâ€”those that consist only of whitespaceâ€”are ignored. This means that any number of separators can be used between expressions, and that leading and trailing separators are also allowed. The expressions are evaluated in text order: left to right and top to bottom.</p>
<h3 id="list-notation">List notation</h3>
<p>Lists (1-dimensional arrays) are enclosed in angle brackets <code><span>âŸ¨âŸ©</span></code>, with the results of the expressions in between being the list's elements. Lists of two elements or more can also be written with the ligature character <code><span>â€¿</span></code>. This character has higher binding strength than any part of an expression. If one of the elements is a compound expression, then it will need to be enclosed in parentheses.</p>

Some find the PinePhone Linux smartphone an experiment worth trying out while others critique its hardware which is closer to a budget Android smartphone. However, we have to handover to the Pine64 engineers for tackling privacy-related issues first hand.</p><p>Ever since <a href="https://androidrookies.com/taping-your-macbook-camera-to-prevent-it-from-spying-is-not-a-good-option-says-apple/">Apple issued an advisory to MacBook users</a> not to tape their webcam, many users have been demanding a physical kill switch to stop webcam/microphone/Wi-Fi/GPS being hacked or abused. The Pine64’s PinePhone smartphone comes with a neat physical kill switch to turn those on/off. Under the back cover of PinePhone users can find an array of kill switches that can be used to physically toggle the camera, Wi-Fi, microphone, and GPS transmitters on or off.</p><div id="attachment_10180"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10180" loading="lazy" src="https://androidrookies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/physical-switch.jpg" data-src="https://androidrookies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/physical-switch.jpg" alt="Pine64's $200 PinePhone Linux smartphone comes with a physical switch in the back to turn off the camera, Wi-Fi, microphone, headphone, and Bluetooth transmitters" width="657" height="371" data-srcset="https://androidrookies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/physical-switch.jpg 657w, https://androidrookies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/physical-switch-300x169.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" srcset="https://androidrookies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/physical-switch.jpg 657w, https://androidrookies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/physical-switch-300x169.jpg 300w"></p><p id="caption-attachment-10180">Courtesy AndroidPolice</p></div><p>The neatly arranged stack of switches situated in the rear of the PinePhone lets you shut down the modem, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, microphone, rear camera, front camera, and headphone with a small screwdriver.</p><h2>Specifications of Pine64’s PinePhone:</h2><p>The PinePhone comes with a 5.95-inch 1440×720 18:9 HD IPS capacitive touchscreen with 16M colors and runs on <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/A64" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Allwinner A64</a> (quad-core ARM Cortex A53, Mali 400 GPU) chipset. Many expected a better chip but then you are paying $200 for this smartphone. The PinePhone runs on 3GB RAM and has 32GB internal memory(eMMC) which can be extended up to 2TB via a microSD card.

  <h2>A tiny JavaScript music renderer for ZzFX.</h2>

<section id="code">
  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>ZzFXM is a tiny JavaScript function that generates stereo music tracks from patterns of note and instrument data.
  Instrument samples are created using a modified<sup>[<a href="#note-code-1">1</a>]</sup> version of the super-tiny <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX">ZzFX</a> sound generator by <a href="https://twitter.com/KilledByAPixel">Frank Force</a>.
   </p><figure><pre><code>//! ZzFXM (v2.0.1) | (C) Keith Clark | MIT | https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM
zzfxM=(f,n,o,t=125)=&gt;{let z,e,l,r,g,h,x,a,u,c,d,i,m,p,G,M,R=[],b=[],j=[],k=0,q=1,s={},v=zzfxR/t*60&gt;&gt;2;for(;q;k++)R=[q=a=d=m=0],o.map((t,d)=&gt;{for(x=n[t][k]||[0,0,0],q|=!!n[t][k],G=m+(n[t][0].length-2-!a)*v,e=2,r=m;e&lt;x.length+(d==o.length-1);a=++e){for(g=x[e],u=c!=(x[0]||0)|g|0,l=0;l&lt;v&amp;&amp;a;l++&gt;v-99&amp;&amp;u?i+=(i&lt;1)/99:0)h=(1-i)*R[p++]/2||0,b[r]=(b[r]||0)+h*M-h,j[r]=(j[r++]||0)+h*M+h;g&amp;&amp;(i=g%1,M=x[1]||0,(g|=0)&amp;&amp;(R=s[[c=x[p=0]||0,g]]=s[[c,g]]||(z=[...f[c]],z[2]*=2**((g-12)/12),zzfxG(...z))))}m=G});return[b,j]}</code></pre><figcaption>The ZzFXM song generator function — 418 bytes (gzip)</figcaption></figure>   <p>ZzfxM was developed to create music for size-limited productions (i.e. js13k Games). The song format is loosely based on the tracker MOD format, using sequences of repeating patterns to create long songs from small chunks of music data.
  Songs are <em>highly</em> compressible. Once gzipped they're tiny — typically, a few hundred bytes.</p>


  <h2>Playing a song</h2>
  <p>Audio samples are compiled by passing instrument, pattern and sequence data to <code>zzfxM()</code>. The function returns a pair of arrays containing sample data for the left and right stereo channels.
  To play the rendered song, call <code>zzfxP()</code> using the generated sample data. The <code>zzfxM</code> function returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode">AudioBufferSourceNode</a>, which you can use to control the song (stop it, looping etc.).</p>

  <figure><pre><code>const songData = [
  [/* zzfx instruments */],
  [/* patterns */],
  [/* sequence */],
  /* speed (BPM) */
];

const buffer = zzfxM(...songData);    // Generate the sample data
const node = zzfxP(...buffer);        // Play the song
</code></pre><figcaption>Example code</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
    <li id="note-code-1">[1] The modifications allow ZzFX to create an array of audio data without immediately playing it.</li>

<p>Just what exactly <em>is</em> a type?</p>

<p>A common perspective is that types are <em>restrictions</em>. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t <em>really</em> predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.</p>

<p>But that is not the <em>only</em> perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves <em>you.</em></p>

<p>…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.</p>

<p>Let’s talk a little about TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a <em>gradually-typed</em> language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to <em>gradually</em> add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.</p>

<p>Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as constraints. A function with no explicit type declarations<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> can accept <em>any</em> JavaScript value, so adding a type annotation fundamentally restricts the set of legal values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, languages like TypeScript tend to have subtyping. This makes it easy to classify certain types as “more restrictive” than others. For example, a type like <code>string | number</code> clearly includes more values than just <code>number</code>, so <code>number</code> is a more restrictive type—a <em>subtype</em>.</p>

<p>An exceptionally concrete way to illustrate this “types are restrictions” mentality is to write a function with an unnecessarily specific type. Here’s a TypeScript function that returns the first element in an array of numbers:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>getFirst</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span>: <span>number</span><span>[])</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arr</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function would work perfectly well given a list of strings, but if you write <code>getFirst(["hello", "world"])</code>, the typechecker will complain. Of course, in this example the restriction is thoroughly self-imposed—it would be easy to give this function a generic type—but sometimes it’s not quite so easy. For example, suppose we write a function where the return type depends upon the type of the argument:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>emptyLike</span><span>(</span><span>val</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>val</span> <span>===</span> <span>"number"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Now if we write <code>emptyLike(42) * 10</code>, the typechecker will once again complain, claiming the result could be a string—it can’t “figure out” that when we pass a number, we always get a number back.</p>

<p>When type systems are approached from this perspective, the result is often frustration. The programmer knows that the equivalent untyped JavaScript is perfectly well-behaved, so the typechecker comes off as being the highly unfortunate combination of stubborn yet dim-witted. What’s more, the programmer likely has little mental model of the typechecker’s internal operation, so when types like the above are inferred (not explicitly written), it can be unclear what solutions exist to make the error go away.</p>

<p>At this point, the programmer may give up. “Stupid typechecker,” they grumble, changing the return type of <code>emptyLike</code> to <code>any</code>. “If it can’t even figure this out, can it <em>really</em> be all that useful?”</p>

<p>Sadly, this relationship with the typechecker is all too common, and gradually-typed languages in particular tend to create a vicious cycle of frustration:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Gradual type systems are intentionally designed to “just work” on idiomatic code as much as possible, so programmers may not think much about the types except when they get type errors.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, many programmers using gradually-typed languages are already adept at programming in the underlying dynamically-typed language, so they have working mental models of program operation in terms of the dynamic semantics alone. They are much less likely to develop a rich mental model of the static semantics of the type system because they are used to reasoning without one.</p></li>

  <p>Gradually typed languages must support idioms from their dynamically-typed heritage, so they often include ad-hoc special cases (such as, for example, special treatment of <code>typeof</code> checks) that obscure the rules the typechecker follows and make them seem semi-magical.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Builtin types are deeply blessed in the type system, strongly encouraging programmers to embrace their full flexibility, but leaving little recourse when they run up against their limits.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>All this frustration breeds a readiness to override the typechecker using casts or <code>any</code>, which ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the typechecker rarely catches any interesting mistakes because it has been so routinely disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>The end result of all of this is a defeatist attitude that views the typechecker as a minor tooling convenience at best (i.e. a fancy autocomplete provider) or an active impediment at worst. Who can really blame them? The type system has (unintentionally of course) been designed in such a way so as to lead them into this dead end. The public perception of type systems settles into that of a strikingly literal nitpicker we endure rather than as a tool we actively leverage.</p>



<p>After everything I said above, it may be hard to imagine seeing types any other way. Indeed, through the lens of TypeScript, the “types are restrictions” mentality is incredibly natural, so much so that it seems self-evident. But let’s move away from TypeScript for a moment and focus on a different language, Haskell, which encourages a somewhat different perspective. If you aren’t familiar with Haskell, that’s alright—I’m going to try to keep the examples in this blog post as accessible as possible whether you’ve written any Haskell or not.</p>

<p>Though Haskell and TypeScript are both statically-typed—and both of their type systems are fairly sophisticated—Haskell’s type system is almost completely different philosophically:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Haskell does not have subtyping,<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup> which means that every value belongs to exactly one type.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>While JavaScript is built around a small handful of flexible builtin datatypes (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects), Haskell has essentially no blessed, built-in datatypes other than numbers. Key types such as booleans, lists, and tuples are ordinary datatypes defined in the standard library, no different from types users could define.<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup></p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In particular, Haskell is built around the idea that datatypes can be defined with multiple <em>cases</em>, and branching is done via pattern-matching (more on this shortly).</p></li></ul>

<p>Let’s look at a basic Haskell datatype declaration. Suppose we want to define a type that represents a season:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>Spring</span> <span>|</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>|</span> <span>Fall</span> <span>|</span> <span>Winter</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are familiar with TypeScript, this may look rather similar to a union type; if you’re familiar with a C-family language, this may remind you more of an enum. Both are on the right track: this defines a new type named <code>Season</code> with four possible values, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>are</em> those values?</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>In TypeScript, we’d represent this type with a union of strings, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spring"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"summer"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"fall"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"winter"</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>Season</code> is a type that can be one of those four strings, but nothing else.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In C, we’d represent this type with an enum, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>season</span> <span>{</span> <span>SPRING</span><span>,</span> <span>SUMMER</span><span>,</span> <span>FALL</span><span>,</span> <span>WINTER</span> <span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>SPRING</code>, <code>SUMMER</code>, <code>FALL</code>, and <code>WINTER</code> are essentially defined to be global aliases for the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and the type <code>enum season</code> is essentially an alias for <code>int</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>So in TypeScript, the values are strings, and in C, the values are numbers. What are they in Haskell? Well… they simply <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Haskell declaration invents four completely new constants out of thin air, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>. They aren’t aliases for numbers, nor are they symbols or strings. The compiler doesn’t expose anything about how it chooses to represent these values at runtime; that’s an implementation detail. In Haskell, <code>Spring</code> is now a value <em>distinct from all other values</em>, even if someone in a different module were to also use the name <code>Spring</code>. Haskell type declarations let us play god, creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>Since these values are totally unique, abstract constants, what can we actually do with them? The answer is one thing and <em>exactly</em> one thing: we can branch on them. For example, we can write a function that takes a <code>Season</code> as an argument and returns whether or not Christmas occurs during it:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>containsChristmas</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>containsChristmas</span> <span>season</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Spring</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Summer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- southern hemisphere</span>
  <span>Fall</span>   <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Winter</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- northern hemisphere</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><code>case</code> expressions are, to a first approximation, a lot like C-style <code>switch</code> statements (though they can do a lot more than this simple example suggests). Using <code>case</code>, we can also define conversions from our totally unique <code>Season</code> constants to other types, if we want:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>seasonToString</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>S…</span></pre></div></div></article></div></section></div>

installed, check that you have <code>GOPATH</code> set correctly, and it will end
up in <code>$GOPATH/bin</code>. And make sure that its in your path by checking

<h2 id="using-an-old-blackberry-as-a-portable-ssh-or-telnet-terminal">Using an old BlackBerry as a portable SSH (or Telnet) terminal</h2>
<p>You used to see BlackBerries everywhere. Sites such as CrackBerry detailed sightings of celebrities using them constantly. Nowadays, not so much. However, I believe they still have some usecases today. One of these is as a portable terminal. Here's why one might want to use one of these devices as a terminal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice built-in physical keyboard</li>
<li>Long standby battery life
<ul>
<li>Easily swappable batteries (see my Altoids tin filled with batteries below!)</li>
<li>The 7290 I'm using reportedly has a 216 hour standby battery life, and unlike modern phones this number seems to hold up relatively well even with network enabled</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affordable
<ul>
<li>You can easily find these devices for ~$20 on eBay</li>
<li>You can get a 100 MB data plan from US Mobile for $2/mo. not including fees (closer to $5/mo. with fees)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extremely portable
<ul>
<li>Much smaller than other devices one might use for this kind of thing
<ul>
<li>OpenPandora</li>
<li>GPD Pocket</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Much shorter than most modern phones</li>
<li>Cellular connection means you don't need a wireless router around</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decently rugged
<ul>
<li>Not nearly as prone to failure after drops as modern smartphones (in my experience)
<ul>
<li>The screen is recessed, so it doesn't take the brunt of falls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Easy to setup
<ul>
<li>You can simply browse to <a href="http://xk72.com/wap">http://xk72.com/wap</a> on the phone itself to install an SSH client (MidpSSH) over the air</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I've been using a BlackBerry 7290 on the US Mobile network, which still supports GSM for now. It's notable that the SSH negotiation is decently slow (~30-45 seconds), but is decently usable after connected (things are still a little sluggish however). Furthermore, I had to reenable the weak DSA public key algorithm as well. This doesn't bother me so much as I basically have a middleman server that allows this weak standard that I talk to everything else through rather than enabling it on every server.</p>
<p>To make things easier on myself, I wrote an <a href="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/postlogin.txt">interactive script</a> that is sourced by <code>.bashrc</code> upon logging in that asks what I actually want to connect to and then does so for me.</p>
<p>In the future, I might move to a BlackBerry 8700(c/g) as they support EDGE (much faster network speed), have much faster CPUs, and a higher standby time. I am not sure what I am going to do in the long run, as 2G networks in the US will probably all be shut down by the end of the year with 3G soon to follow. I guess I can just enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Here are the lines I added to my <code>sshd</code> config for the BlackBerry to be able to connect:</p>
<pre><code>HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-dss
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss
KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
Ciphers +3des-cbc
</code></pre>
<p>And here are some pictures!</p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/connected.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Connected and at the interactive prompt</em></p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/top.jpg"></p>
<p><em><code>top</code> output from one server</em></p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Some thoughts on Mozilla for people who don’t know Mozilla.</em></p>

<p>By now everyone in the tech world has heard of the major layoffs at
the Mozilla Corporation, the organization that creates and distributes
the Firefox web browser. (For those who haven’t heard, about 250
people were laid off, about a quarter of the work force.) Lots of
people in the tech world have spoken their piece about the
significance of this event and what it means for the future of
Mozilla, the web, and so on.</p>

<p>Rather than write something of and for the tech world, I wanted to
briefly explain what’s going on for those of my readers who don’t know
HTML from XML, and who are more familar with the worlds of nonprofits
and regular old businesses. I used to work for Mozilla, and have more
knowledge of it and (I hope) insight into it than most people, but
I’ve been gone from Mozilla for ten years now. Thus what I write below
is based on observing it from a distance, like seeing an old friend
whose life has long since diverged from mine.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for a tech company, and I don’t usually write about
other tech companies. So I will strongly emphasize that what I write
here are my personal opinions only, and do not represent the positions
of my present employer or past employers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mozilla">What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>Mozilla is actually two things, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation, which are often confused and conflated in public
discourse. (There’s actually at least one other piece, but these two
are the main ones.) The Mozilla Foundation, founded in 2003 to take
over development of the source code for the Netscape web browser, is a
501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, with a staff of 80 people
and a budget of about $27 million in 2018, the last year for which
figures are available. The Mozilla Corporation, founded in 2005, is a
for-profit business, wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation, with a
staff of about a thousand and revenue of about $440 million, again
from the 2018 financials.</p>

<p>This organizational structure was designed to allow the Mozilla
Corporation to engage in business activities which would be
incompatible with 501(c)(3) status, with a portion of the revenues
from those activities directed to the Mozilla Foundation to help fund
its activities. Having a nonprofit parent also means that the
management and employees of the Mozilla Corporation can help serve the
public benefit goals of the Mozilla Foundation, while still having
interesting jobs, being paid reasonably well, and feeling themselves
to be part of the overall Silicon Valley high-tech milieu.</p>

<p>Second: The customers of the Mozilla Corporation are not the users of
Firefox (among whom you may count yourself). The Mozilla Corporation’s
customers are large corporations like Google that pay for things that
will help them make money, most notably having their Internet search
service be the default in the Firefox browser. And to complete the old
saying, “If you’re not the customer…”, then the 200+ million Firefox
users are the product, potential viewers of ads served up by Google or
others.</p>

<p>(The existence of the Firefox browser as a competitor to Google’s
Chrome browser also supposedly helps Google avoid unwelcome antitrust
attention, especially now that Microsoft has abandoned its own browser
development efforts to base its own browser on the Chrome code. But
it’s unclear how important this consideration actually is to Google
senior management.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the Mozilla Corporation these search engine
relationships proved extremely lucrative, jumping from less than $5
million in 2004 to over $50 million in 2005, the first year in which
the Mozilla Corporation reported financial results, and eventually
growing to a high of about $540 million in 2017.</p>

<p>But as the number of Firefox users decreases (due to the growing
market dominance of the Chrome browser), and those users click on
fewer online ads (for example, because they’re spending less during
the COVID-19 pandemic), the willingness of Google and other customers
to pay the Mozilla Corporation for those users decreases
accordingly. Thus the Mozilla Corporation cutting a quarter of its
workforce.</p>

<p>(In contrast, to my knowledge the Mozilla Foundation itself is not
laying off anyone, at least at this time. It gets its funding from a
combination of royalties from the Mozilla Corporation for use of the
Firefox and Mozilla trademarks, government and foundation grants, and
individual donations. For 2018 the royalties accounted for about half
of the Mozilla Foundation’s budget, with grants and individual donations
each accounting for about a quarter of the budget.)</p>

<p>So, if you’re an avid user of the Firefox browser and want to chip in
a few dollars to help support its development, there’s actually no way
for you to do so, at least not at present. Your donations will go to
the Mozilla Foundation, which will use them to help fund its outreach
and advocacy initiatives, of which it has several. The Mozilla
Foundation itself does not develop Firefox—or any other software, to
my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="whence-mozilla">Whence Mozilla?</h2>

<p>How has Mozilla (or, more correctly, the Mozilla Corporation) come
to its present pass? The best way I can explain it is that the Mozilla
Corporation is not really a business in the way we’d normally think of
a business, profit-focused and subject to market discipline.</p>

<p>Instead you can think of the Mozilla Corporation as being analogous to
the Bell Labs or Xerox PARC of yore, R&amp;D organizations funded by a
seemingly-unending stream of profits earned by other businesses that
enjoyed dominant positions in their respective markets. In this sense
Google is to Mozilla as AT&amp;T was to Bell Labs, or Xerox to Xerox
PARC.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation provided a home
for some of the smartest software developers around. Like those
organizations, the Mozila Corporation has initiated a myriad of
projects ranging from the mundane and useful (like the Firefox
browser) to the esoteric and speculative. Like those organizations,
the Mozilla Corporation has given away much of what it has produced in
the form of public goods available to everyone at no charge.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation has indulged a
taste for “build it yourself” vertical integration, and in particular
for creating its own bespoke development tools and software stack. For
example, like those organizations the Mozilla Corporation has created
its own operating system (FirefoxOS), its own programming language
(Rust), and (of course) its own graphical user environment in the form
of the Firefox browser (not to mention yet another web browser, this
one more research-oriented, and various experiments in software for
virtual reality environments).</p>

<p>And finally, the Mozilla Corporation is engaged in the same struggle
that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC found themselves in: trying to convert a
research-oriented organization into an actual business, and capture
for itself more of the value that it has been providing to the world
(and to its past, present, and future competitors) for free.</p>

<h2 id="whither-mozilla">Whither Mozilla?</h2>

<p>What will happen to Mozilla, and to the Mozilla Corporation in
particular? The basic situation is that Mozilla has tried to be at
least three things simultaneously: an advocacy organization, a
developer and distributor of mass market consumer software and related
services, and (as noted above) a research lab.</p>

<p>Being an advocacy organization is relatively inexpensive, but the
other two functions are not: software development (including
research-related activities) and branding and marketing together
consumed almost three quarters of the combined Mozilla Corporation and
Foundation expense budget of $450 million in 2018. Thus when COVID-19
hit and the Mozilla Corporation hit a brick wall in terms of search
engine revenue, its choice was apparently either to stop being a
consumer software and services company, or to stop being a research
lab.</p>

<p>In the end Mozilla Corporation senior management apparently decided to
go for being a consumer software and services company, and to ditch
any activities not related to that, including research projects.
Having done so, the Mozilla Corporation faces a number of problems:</p>

<p>First, as noted above the Mozilla ethos is arguably more like that of
an R&amp;D lab than of a business proper. Just getting Mozilla
employees to think of themselves as working in the service of a
profit-driven business, and to act in accordance with that thought
every single day, may be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Second, Mozilla is arguably becoming superfluous, at least as far as
its own largest customer, Google, is concerned. Google has its own
browser and browser development team, its own research lab, and
presumably an inclination to want to spend its R&amp;D money on things
it can control and direct itself. Google also has the ability and the
opportunity to capture the remaining base of Firefox users, at least
those that are monetizable.</p>

<p>There will always be a core of enthusiastic Firefox users, but a lot
of them switch their search engine to something other than Google, run
ad blockers, and don’t click on online ads. Thus they are for the most
part irrelevant from Google’s point of view. At some point the major
value Firefox has for Google will be as presumed insulation from
antitrust enforcement efforts targeting Chrome, but such insurance,
even if it’s of value to Google, doesn’t necessarily require a large
Firefox user base.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s …</p></section></div>

<section>

<a name="1:1"></a>
<a name="1:2"></a><div><a name="1:2"><h4>2. Introduction</h4></a>
<p>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to write your own virtual machine (VM) that can run assembly language programs, such as my friend's <a href="https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048">2048</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-rogue">Roguelike</a>. If you know how to program, but would like to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on inside a computer and better understand how programming languages work, then this project is for you. Writing your own VM may sound a little scary, but I promise that you will find it to be surprisingly simple and enlightening.
</p>
<p>The final code is about 250 lines of C (<a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3.c">unix</a>, <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3-win.c">windows</a>).
All you need to know is how to read basic C or C++ and how to do <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/BinaryMath/BinaryMath.html">binary arithmetic</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> This VM is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate program</a>. This means you are reading the source code right now! Each piece of code from the project will be shown and explained thoroughly, so you can be sure nothing is left out. The final code was created by <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate">"weaving"</a> the blocks of code together.
</p>

<h3> What is a virtual machine?</h3>
<p>A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it.
</p>
<p>The amount of computer hardware the VM attempts to simulate depends on its purpose. Some VMs are designed to reproduce the behavior of some particular computer, such as video game emulators. Most people don't have an NES lying around anymore, but we can still play NES games by simulating the NES hardware in a program. These emulators must <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tricky-to-emulate_games">faithfully recreate</a> every <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests">detail</a> and major hardware component of the original device.
</p>
<p>Other VMs don't act like any real computer and are entirely made up! This is primarily done to make software development easier. Imagine you wanted to create a program that ran on multiple computer architectures. A VM could offer a standard platform which provided portability for all of them. Instead of rewriting a program in different dialects of assembly for each CPU architecture, you would only need to write the small VM program in each assembly language. Each program would then be written only once in the VM's assembly language.
</p>

</p>
<p><img src="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/vm.gif" alt="vm for each architecture">
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> A compiler solves a similar problem by compiling a standard <em>high-level language</em> to several CPU architectures. A VM creates one standard <em>CPU architecture</em> which is simulated on various hardware devices. One advantage of a compiler is that it has no runtime overhead while a VM does. Even though compilers do a pretty good job, writing a new one that targets multiple platforms is very difficult, so VMs are still helpful here. In practice, VMs and compilers are mixed at various levels.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</a> is a very successful example. The JVM itself is a moderately sized program that is small enough for one programmer to understand. This has made it possible to be written for thousands of devices including phones. Once the JVM is implemented on a new device, any Java, Kotlin, or Clojure program ever written can run on it without modification. The only cost is the overhead of the VM itself and the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">further abstraction</a> from the machine. Most of the time, this is a pretty good tradeoff.
</p>
<p>A VM doesn't have to be large or pervasive to provide a similar benefit. Old <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/anotherWorld_code_review/">video games</a> often used small VMs to provide simple <a href="https://sf2platinum.wordpress.com/page/1/">scripting systems</a>.
</p>
<p>VMs are also useful for executing code in a secure or isolated way. One application of this is garbage collection. There <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/24.2.html">is no trivial way</a> to implement automatic garbage collection on top of C or C++ since a program cannot see its own stack or variables. However, a VM is “outside” the program it is running and can observe all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection">memory references</a> on the stack.
</p>
<p>Another example of this behavior is demonstrated by <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html">Ethereum smart contracts</a>. Smart contracts are small programs which are executed by each validating node in the blockchain network. This requires the node operators to run programs on their machines that have been written by complete strangers, without any opportunity to scrutinize them beforehand. To prevent a contract from doing malicious things, they are run inside a <a href="http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html#ethereum-virtual-machine">VM</a> that has no access to the file system, network, disc, etc. Ethereum is also a good application of the portability features that result when using a VM. Since Ethereum nodes can be run on many kinds of computers and operating systems, the use of a VM allows smart contracts to be written without any consideration of the many platforms they run on.

<p>Our VM will simulate a fictional computer called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3">LC-3</a>. The LC-3 is popular for teaching university students how to program in assembly language. It has a simplified instruction set <a href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html">compared to x86</a>, but contains all the main ideas used in modern CPUs.
</p>
<p>First, we need to simulate the essential hardware components of the machine. Try to understand what each component is, but don't worry right now if you are unsure of how it fits into the larger picture. Start by creating a C file. Each of the code snippets in this section should be placed in the global scope of this file.
</p>
<h3> Memory</h3>
<p>The LC-3 has 65,536 memory locations (the maximum that is addressable by a 16-bit unsigned integer <code>2^16</code>), each of which stores a 16-bit value. This means it can store a total of only 128kb, which is a lot smaller than you may be used to! In our program, this memory will be stored in a simple array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Memory Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>/* 65536 locations */
uint16_t memory[UINT16_MAX];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Registers</h3>
<p>A register is a slot for storing a single value on the CPU. Registers are like the "workbench" of the CPU. For the CPU to work with a piece of data, it has to be in one of the registers. However, since there are just a few registers, only a minimal amount of data can be loaded at any given time. Programs work around this by loading values from memory into registers, calculating values into other registers, and then storing the final results back in memory.
</p>
<p>The LC-3 has 10 total registers, each of which is 16 bits. Most of them are general purpose, but a few have designated roles.
</p>
<ul>
<li>8 general purpose registers  (<code>R0</code>-<code>R7</code>)
</li>
<li>1 program counter (<code>PC</code>) register
</li>
<li>1 condition flags (<code>COND</code>) register
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general purpose registers can be used to perform any program calculations. The program counter is an unsigned integer which is the address of the next instruction in memory to execute. The condition flags tell us information about the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Registers <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    R_R0 = 0,
    R_R1,
    R_R2,
    R_R3,
    R_R4,
    R_R5,
    R_R6,
    R_R7,
    R_PC, /* program counter */
    R_COND,
    R_COUNT
};
</pre>



</div>
<p>Just like the memory, we will store the registers in an array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Register Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>uint16_t reg[R_COUNT];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Instruction Set</h3>
<p>An instruction is a command which tells the CPU to do some fundamental task, such as add two numbers. Instructions have both an <strong>opcode</strong> which indicates the kind of task to perform and a set of <strong>parameters</strong> which provide inputs to the task being performed.
</p>
<p>Each <strong>opcode</strong> represents one task that the CPU "knows" how to do. There are just 16 opcodes in LC-3. Everything the computer can calculate is some sequence of these simple instructions. Each instruction is 16 bits long, with the left 4 bits storing the opcode. The rest of the bits are used to store the parameters.
</p>
<p>We will discuss, in detail, what each instruction does later. For now, define the following opcodes. Make sure they stay in this order so that they are assigned the proper enum value:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Opcodes <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    OP_BR = 0, /* branch */
    OP_ADD,    /* add  */
    OP_LD,     /* load */
    OP_ST,     /* store */
    OP_JSR,    /* jump register */
    OP_AND,    /* bitwise and */
    OP_LDR,    /* load register */
    OP_STR,    /* store register */
    OP_RTI,    /* unused */
    OP_NOT,    /* bitwise not */
    OP_LDI,    /* load indirect */
    OP_STI,    /* store indirect */
    OP_JMP,    /* jump */
    OP_RES,    /* reserved (unused) */
    OP_LEA,    /* load effective address */
    OP_TRAP    /* execute trap */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> The Intel x86 architecture has hundreds of instructions, while others such as ARM and LC-3 have very few. Small instruction sets are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISCs</a> while larger ones are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">CISCs</a>. Larger instruction sets typically do not provide any fundamentally new possibilities, but they <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/">often make it more convenient</a> to write assembly for. A single instruction in CISC might take the place of several in RISC. However, they tend to be more complex and expensive for engineers to design and manufacture. This and other tradeoffs cause the designs to come <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/269/why-would-anyone-want-cisc">in and out of style</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> Condition Flags</h3>
<p>The <code>R_COND</code> register stores condition flags which provide information about the most recently executed calculation. This allows programs to check logical conditions such as <code>if (x &gt; 0) { ... }</code>.
</p>
<p>Each CPU has a variety of condition flags to signal various situations. The LC-3 uses only 3 condition flags which indicate the sign of the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Condition Flags <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    FL_POS = 1 &lt;&lt; 0, /* P */
    FL_ZRO = 1 &lt;&lt; 1, /* Z */
    FL_NEG = 1 &lt;&lt; 2, /* N */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> (The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> symbol is called the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/336xbhcz.aspx">left bitshift operator</a>. <code>(n &lt;&lt; k)</code> shifts the bits of <code>n</code> to the left <code>k</code> places. Thus <code>1 &lt;&lt; 2</code> will equal <code>4</code>. Read that link if you are not familiar. It will be important.)

<p>We are finished setting up the hardware components of our VM! After adding standard includes (see reference), your file should look something like this:
</p>

<p>Now let's look at an LC-3 assembly program to get an idea of what the VM actually runs. You don't need to know how to program assembly or understand everything that is going on. Just try to get a general idea of what is going on. Here is a simple "Hello World":

<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/covid-19-u-s-fatalities-june-2020-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In June</a>, I made the prediction that it’s likely we’ll see hundreds of thousands dead by July from COVID-19.</p>
<p>According to official data, my prediction <span><em>was not entirely accurate</em></span>, being closer to the lower bound of my simulation(s) (a hundred thousand).</p>
<p>Today, we have more information about the virus and importantly improved data on death rates (via the CDC) – <strong>it appears the official death toll from COVID19 may be under reported</strong>. Perhaps more terrifying, it also appears <strong>if you are 25-85+ years old you have a 20-50% increased risk of dying in 2020 than you did in 2015-2019</strong> (given COVID19’s current penetration rate).</p>
<p>Some key takeaways from this analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official death COVID19 related deaths are likely higher than official count(s)</li>
<li>Testing capacity appears to be shrinking or not being reported</li>
<li>Age groups over 25 are seeing a 20-50% increased number of deaths in 2020 (over 2015-2019)</li>
<li>It is likely the increased fatality rate over prior years will continue as COVID19 prevalence increases</li>
<li>By year end 2020, it’s likely we will see over one million deaths in the U.S.</li>
<li>By April 2021, it’s likely we will see over two million deaths in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p>For transparency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code (&amp; Graphics): <a href="https://github.com/lettergram/covid19-analysis">Github</a></li>
<li>Data

<li>Covidtracking.com: <a href="https://covidtracking.com/api/states/daily" rel="nofollow">https://covidtracking.com/api/states/daily</a></li>

<li>CDC data is only [mostly] accurate up to the week of July 20 – 26, 2020</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, we aren’t testing enough to capture all cases. People are not being tested for various reasons: desire to work, no/minor symptoms, can’t receive a test, etc. Unfortunately, this will leave us vulnerable.</p>
<p>On a whole, the nation wide positive rate is still hovering well above lows, with around 7% tests coming back positive.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the reduction in tests are from collection errors, reduced testing capacity, issues with the data provider or some other unknown factor.</p>

<p>Overall, our accounting of deaths from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC</a> is only accurate up to the week of July 20 – 26, 2020, from week 1 to week 30 there has been 216,569 more deaths in 2020 over 2019.</p>

<p>It’s important to note, that it is not an entirely fair to compare 2019 to 2020, as each year has variance in deaths. With this in mind, I also created a simple regression model, then compared the predicted death count to the actual 2020 deaths and came to figure of <strong>178,598.40 deaths over the predicted number</strong> (remember, this is for the week of July 20, 2020):</p>

<p>Currently, in August — nearly three weeks passed the CDC numbers cut off and deaths are still increasing. At this point, it is likely we are well over 200,000+ deaths beyond the prediction. Further, it is quite possible we are now 250,000+ deaths above the 2019 figures. If true, we are likely under counting COVID related deaths by 40-60%.</p>
<p>This analysis doesn’t take into account mitigating factors (such as less car accidents) as it also doesn’t take into account confounding factors (such as more suicides).</p>
<h2><span>States Under Reporting COVID-19 Related Fatalities</span></h2>
<p>To highlight the clear under reporting of pandemic related fatalities, we can review states, where the issue becomes more pronounced.</p>
<p>Take <strong>Texas</strong>, for instance:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-203x150.png 203w"></a>The deaths one standard deviation above the norm (norm being deaths in 2015-2019) are highly correlate with the number of <em>new cases </em>of COVID19, rather than that of COVID19 related <em>deaths</em>.</p>
<p>This implies one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>COVID19 deaths are being attributed to another illness</li>
<li>Hospitals are focusing on the COVID19 patients and other critically ill patients are dying (at an alarming rate)</li>
<li>Some other catastrophe is happening</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless, as more people test positive, more people are dying and there is a high correlation between the two. If I had to guess, this really means people aren’t being tested until after they are dead or critically ill &amp; in the hospital.</p>
<h2><span>Decreased Testing</span></h2>
<p>It’s also important to bring attention to the <span>decreasing number of tests from July 9, 2020 and August 13, 2020</span>. Time will tell if the rate of fatalities will drop (or if just the COVID19 related deaths will), the decreased testing volume correlates exactly with the declining positive cases (as one would suspect).</p>
<p>This holds true for many states, including <strong>Florida</strong>:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png" alt="" width="650" height="488" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-300x225.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-768x577.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-2048x1538.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-300x225.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-768x577.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-2048x1538.png 2048w"></a>Testing capacity in Florida has dropped 40% in the past six weeks. At the same time, the death toll is rising. Frankly, I wouldn’t be surprised if reduced testing was a ploy related to opening schools.</p>
<p>There are some examples where the figures do appear to be <em>generally</em> accurate, such as <strong>New York</strong>:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-203x150.png 203w"></a>Another example is <strong>Illinois </strong>(although initially there was likely under-reporting due to lack of testing):</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-203x150.png 203w"></a>In terms of which states are more prone to under-reporting vs others, there doesn’t appear to be a clear pattern. Under-reporting appears to be a signal that there is not enough testing – aka the system is overwhelmed. This makes logical sense, as the system becomes overwhelmed, resources are diverted on saving lives over identifying community spread. There’s also a question if the test results are being reported federally and outside my dataset for some reason.</p>

<p>It is difficult mid-pandemic with a lack of testing to determine the case <a href="https://newslit.org/updates/case-fatality-rate-vs-mortality-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fatality rate (CFR) or mortality rate</a>, which is typically what is being reported. Unfortunately, we don’t know the infection rate. With that in mind, it’s probably more accurate to track the “increased risk of dying in 2020”.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<blockquote><p>How much greater are my risks of dying in 2020 over 2019?</p></blockquote>
<p>Infection rate is included as part of metric, we don’t know the extent. COVID19 penetration is <em>maybe</em> 10% across the U.S. population (studies vary wildly). Regardless, as the year progresses, we are sure this number will increase.</p>
<p>With that in mind, on average all age groups over 25, are seeing roughly 10-15% increased risk of dying in 2020 over 2019 (again, this will likely increase):<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>Focusing on <strong>New York</strong>, which appears to have kept decent records &amp; has a decent infection rate – the data looks stark:</p>

<p>In contrast, <strong>Illinois </strong>is seeing less deaths over the norm, particularly in the older age groups :<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IL-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>The difference in Illinois appears to be older populations have seen a muted increase in deaths.

<p>It should be noted, <strong>Texas</strong> on the other hand has seen a muted increase in fatalities in all age groups (less than Illinois or New York):<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="792" height="524" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TX-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>The largest increase has been in the 25-44 year old age range. It’s probably Texas hasn’t had as much of a proliferation of COVID19 yet and most of the spread has been related to young gathers. Leading to our next section…</p>
<h2><span>COVID19 Spread due to Gatherings</span></h2>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge, that as people gather Coronavirus spreads more easily. Particularly, in <strong>Texas</strong>, <strong>Florida</strong>, <strong>Illinois</strong> and others started to see a rise in fatalities (and infections) following rises in heat (pushing gatherings in doors), protests, and generally opening bars.</p>
<p>Particularly, the rise of deaths in <strong>Texas</strong> coincide directly with the protests (Starting week 22 and rising to the present):</p>

<p><strong>Florida</strong> has seen the same effect, in the exact same time range:</p>

Personally, I suspect heat is the largest factor. People gathered outside to protest or celebrate (July 4th) and ended up congregating inside, without masks. This lead to an increase in spread and fatalities, as moving indoors confines people together, in air conditioning, with minimal mask protection or UV to kill the virus.</p>

<p>Finally, in prior discussions I’ve made predictions. Largely, these predictions came from running simulations (both on my own and available to me). As it stands, I continue to stand by my prior prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 million COVID-19 deaths in the United States is likely (April 1, 2021)</li>
<li>25% [true] unemployment in the United States is likely</li>
<li>15% reduction in GDP is within reason</li>
</ul>
<p>Rerunning prior simulation(s) with some minor adjustments to account for new information (such as mask use) and assuming moderately widespread school reopening(s) (and assuming children spread COVID19).

<p>That’s an estimated 180k to 1.85m dead by October 14th. Personally, for the officially count, I’d err on the side of the lower values, perhaps 250k. However, I suspect deaths will be under counted due to lack of testing, I suspect the real figures will be closer to 500k-800k after analysis, this would more closely matching the findings above (which indicate we are already over 200k).</p>

<p>There are still plenty of unknowns related to COVID19. Only time will tell, but we can see most people “checking out” so to speak. It’s important to keep up to date regarding COVID19 (and politics) in general. A disaster is …</p></div></article></div>

	<p><strong>Video</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8Pb8TvYsCE">Philip reading this essay</a>.</p>
<p>The 1956 paper <em><a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/">The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus
Two</a></em> is the most widely cited paper
in the 126 year history of the journal <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Review">Psychological
Review</a></em>. The author
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller">George A. Miller</a> is
considered one of the founders in the field of cognitive science. His
historic claim is that you can only juggle <strong>between 5 and 9 things</strong> in
your brain at any one time.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, despite some
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486516/">controversy</a> over
the years, this 7 ± 2 figure has withstood the ongoing
<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">reproducibility
crisis</a>
and it appears to capture a deep truth about how our brains actually
function.</p>
<p>Many people are skeptical of the claim because seven sounds like an
absurdly small number, surely if you are doing something complex like
writing software, or planning a wedding for that matter, you are juggling
dozens to hundreds of things? As it turns out you are not. At least not at
once.</p>

<p>In 2005 <strong>Lu Chao</strong> recited <a href="https://www.livescience.com/50134-pi-day-memory-experts.html">67,890
digits</a> of
Pi, a mind-boggling demonstration of a gifted and well-trained mind. Yet
given a series of random single-digit numbers he can on average recall less
the than nine of them, to be exact he’s been measured to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span#Digit-span">digit
span</a> of 8.83 which
fits perfectly within Miller’s finding. Amazing!</p>
<p>Chao memorizes Pi the same way story tellers once memorized long tales
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>, yet he can only
juggle a handful of things at one time. I find this actually to be very
comforting, he is not a freak of nature, at least not as freaky as you
first thought.</p>
<p>The illusion we can hold many things in mind is almost identical to the
illusion that our field of view is high resolution everywhere. It’s
incredibly compelling because the instant we wonder <em>what’s over there</em> we
do a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccade</a> and are
immediately rewarded with a high resolution view of exactly <em>what’s over
there</em>. We ask the question and we get an instant answer, so it feels like
the answer was there the whole time.</p>

<p>Thinking in general works very much like vision. This is not surprising
since it’s implemented using the same brain hardware. As we rapidly flit
from idea to idea, from concept to concept, we page in the necessary
details, but at no time do we have more than about nine individual things
in the front of our minds.</p>
<p>How do we navigate a complex world with this seemingly crippling limit on
the size of our working memory? Two of the primary tools that we use are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>When we think of a car we naturally divide the car into a handful of high
level chunks like the <em>engine</em>, the <em>dashboard</em>, the <em>seats</em>, the <em>wheels</em>.
When we mentally zoom into the engine, however, it effortlessly resolves
into more parts: the <em>engine block</em>, the <em>pistons</em>, the <em>spark plugs</em>. And
we can keep zooming in, although how far we can zoom in highly depends on
how much we know about cars and the world in general.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented
Programming</a> one
of the simplest ways to tame complexity is to limit your objects to around
seven <em>attributes</em>. In some languages attributes are called <em>member
variables</em> or <em>fields</em>. Many programmers immediately balk at this
suggestion. Sure, that works for toy examples, but I’m writing serious
software and my objects sometimes need 10, 20 or 50 attributes. You must be
working on easy stuff, they will say. My problems are special, so my code
has to be different.</p>
<p>The biggest trap of software development is that it’s easy, trivial in
fact, to write software that you yourself cannot understand, and in turn no
one else can understand. Even a novice, <em>especially</em> a novice, can in a few
weeks write software that literally no one on the planet can easily think
or reason about. That’s depressing, but also kind of impressive in a way.
With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>Objects which have too many attributes are a major cause of software that’s
too complicated to understand. Some people conclude the problem is Object
Oriented Programming itself. This is not a crazy idea, there are <a href="https://tobeva.com/resources/technical/programming/functional/">other
ways</a> to program, and they do
have advantages, but in my experience most of the flaws attributed to
Object Oriented Programming stem from having done it poorly, and boy is it
easy to do poorly.</p>







<div>
	<p><img src="https://tobeva.com/articles/brain-oriented-programming/complex_hua73d922edef0eeb6c3d75f190e4c0729_39455_350x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" width="350" height="197"></p><p>
Complexity grows without bound.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>The key thing to realize is a single object with a lot of attributes is
itself <em>not</em> Object Oriented. Instead, it’s a 1970s style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Structured
Program</a> in disguise.
The attributes of the object are the <strong>global variables</strong> of the program,
and the object’s methods are the program’s <strong>functions</strong>. Every function
can freely access every global variable which is what causes many of the
problems.</p>
<p>A structured program with more than seven global variables is trouble, and
if many objects in your program are effectively messy structured programs
themselves, you are in serious trouble indeed. At a high level you are
doing Object Oriented Programming, but at a low level you are right back in
the 1970s struggling to deal with one confusing program after the next.</p>
<p>How do we save this sinking ship? We save it by actively and aggressively
keeping the number of attributes per object <strong>at or below seven</strong>. If you
fail to do this you are punting the problem <em>to your future self</em>, a
problem that by definition your future self is going to have a hard time
solving.</p>
<p>Just today I had a <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> class called
<code>PerfEvent</code> with these attributes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>start_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>start_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>end_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>end_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>process_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>process_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>thread_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s eight attributes, since eight is only one over the limit, should we
wait until the object grows bigger? No, let’s deal with it <em>now</em>. To reduce
the number of attributes we introduce two new classes or structs: <code>Span</code>
and <code>Origin</code>. Each only has two attributes, but now the original object has
been slimmed down to six attributes, all is well again:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>span</span> <span>=</span> <span>Span</span><span>(</span><span>start_ns</span><span>,</span> <span>end_ns</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>origin</span> <span>=</span> <span>Origin</span><span>(</span><span>process_id</span><span>,</span> <span>thread_id</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although it’s a minor change, compare the two versions, the improved one
simply <em>looks</em> better, even if you stand far back and squint.</p>
<p>It seems minor, but if you don’t make these types of changes as you go it
will eventually lead to <em>intractable</em> complexity, the type of complexity
that causes projects and companies to fail, the type of complexity that
seduces humans into wasting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails">billions of
dollars</a>
every year writing software that does not work.</p>
<p>The benefits of introducing sub-objects goes far beyond just reducing the
number of attributes. While accessing the attributes is slightly more
verbose, I like the sound of <code>self.span.start_ns</code> compared to just
<code>self.start_ns</code>, but more importantly we can now pass <code>Span</code>'s and
<code>Owner</code>'s to functions, slimming down and chunking <em>their</em> argument lists.</p>
<p>We’ve introduced two natural and useful concepts that will pay ongoing
dividends, but even better don’t just think of how your code is today,
think about how it’s going to grow over time. Your single monolithic object
has sprouted two buds. You can now push functionality down into these buds,
and they can grow into branches, which later can sprout buds of their own.</p>
<p>For example we can now give <code>Span</code> a <code>get_duration_ns()</code> method. Again it seems
minor, but writing <code>span.get_duration_ns()</code> is better than writing
<code>span.end_ns - span.start_ns</code> especially if you are going to do that in
many different places.</p>
<p>The real magic though is that the benefits of being disciplined will accrue
like <a href="https://youtu.be/GtaoP0skPWc">compound interest</a> as you convert your
monolithic object into an intricately structured tree which buds and
sprouts and branches organically. You will benefit from this better design
every minute you are working on the software, and the software will benefit
greatly from your improved mood and ability to sustain focus.</p>

A carefully tended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai">Bonsai</a> tree.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>Code, like most human created artifacts, can be beautiful, so there is an
aesthetic pay off here, but the real jackpot is that if you assiduously
tend and groom this tree you will create a software design that slides into
your head with minimal fuss and friction, and slides similarly into the
heads of other people.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that we find natural environments to be more soothing than
the made world, than the concrete jungle. The design of the natural world
tends to be more in harmony with how our brains think about that world.
Game recognizes game.</p>
<p>Over time, you will grow a system that you and others can <strong>understand</strong>,
<strong>maintain</strong>, <strong>debug</strong> and <strong>extend</strong>. When people look at your code years
from now, maybe even in the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">far
future</a>, they will benefit from your
diligence and hard work. And the punchline is doing all this is not hard.
In fact, it’s <em>much easier</em> to do this work than not to not do it.</p>
<p>It’s easier and more pleasant to work with something that’s well crafted
and simpatico with your thinking. It’s hard and unpleasant to constantly
wrestle with something you don’t understand. Trim, prune and shape your
objects early and often. Your brain will thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Postscript on APIs:</strong></p>
<p><em>The article discusses objects and attributes, not methods and APIs. NumPy’s</em>
<em><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html">ndarray</a> has</em>
<em>15 attributes but 50 methods. That’s totally fine, but imagine the</em>

<p><em>Attributes are global variables in the structured program that is the</em>

        <h2><a href="http://thinking.farm/research/three-gorges-dam/">To Dam or Not to Dam: Exploring the Failure Risk of the Three Gorges Dam </a></h2>
            
            <section id="single-content">
                <p><em>This research explores the risk that the Three Gorges dam will experience failure.
I believe the risk that the dam becomes structurally compromised, and requires the government to drain the reservoir to undertake repairs, is  <strong>20-25%</strong>. In the case that there is a seismic event, that likelihood would be closer to <strong>80%</strong>. I put the chance of a dam failure during this summer’s ongoing floods at <strong>5-10%</strong>, rising to <strong>30%</strong> in the case of a seismic event.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Did Wuhan commit a great crime in 2019? How else to explain the cityâ€™s bad luck in 2020, beginning with the COVID-19 world pandemic and continuing with recent worries that the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the worldâ€™s largest, might burst and flood the city? News reports about the dam have primarily been journalists repeating the opinions of various experts, with some quotes dating back to the 1990s. Predictably, this has encouraged the formation of two camps: those primed towards conspiratorial speculation that the Chinese Communist Party is lying about a looming catastrophe, and those that repeat state media lines that rumors about the dam are the work of Chinaâ€™s foreign enemies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think that clear thinking about risk can help us assess the likelihood of disaster at the TGD. The dam is subject to three types of risks:</p>
<ol>
<li>structural integrity risk, which originates in the damâ€™s construction and maintenance</li>
<li>foundation risk, which reflects the geologic stability of the damâ€™s foundation</li>
<li>shock risk, which the likelihood that an external shock occurs, like an earthquake or landslide.</li>
</ol>
<p>Structural integrity risk is hard to assess, but we can obtain relatively clear information to assess foundation and shock risk, if we make use of valuable geologic data gathered by the Three Gorges Development Corporation in the 1990s. Moreover, the changing rhetoric of press releases from the Chinese government can reveal how the authorities themselves, who have live access to the state of the dam, are mitigating these risks. The governmentâ€™s behavior can then further calibrate our sense of how large and realized these risks actually are.</p>
<p>I have been unable to come by reliable information to assess the structural integrity of the dam. The major risk to the dam comes from foundation risk. As can be ascertained from geologic data, Sections 1-5 of the left powerhouse lie on top of a low-dipping joints with high connectivity, meaning that there is elevated sliding risk. The damâ€™s recent deformation on July 21 means previously calculated safety ratios are likely inflated. Moreover, changes in government rhetoric support this suspicion. In contrast to years past, the government claims that the dam was never mean to control floods and that each region should figure out their own solution.</p>
<p>In terms of shock risk, the dam is susceptible to seismic activity, instability arising from the sheer weight of the TGD reservoir, and flood waves large enough to overwhelm the damâ€™s sluice gates. As of writing (July 26), the 3rd flood wave has officially formed in the Yangtze, and a 4th might appear in short succession. Overall, I think there is a 20-25% chance that the dam is further structurally impaired, prompting the government to continue draining the reservoir as fast as possible. There is something like a 5-10% chance that multiple flood waves overwhelm the dam and raise the reservoir level. These would weaken the dam or its foundation and cause a sliding failure. Were an earthquake to happen this month, these risks would be something more like 80% and 30%.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-dam">Anatomy of a dam</h2>
<p>There are several types of dam design: arch dams, buttress dams, embankment dams, and gravity dams.</p>
<p>Arch dams hold back the water partially through the strength of their structural shape. The Hoover Dam is an example of an arch dam. The arch is convex facing upstream, which distributes water pressure along the structure to the abutments at each end.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/hoover-dam.jpg" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>The Hoover Dam, Arizona-Nevada border</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Buttress dams consist of a face slab which angles away from the upstream, and is supported on the downstream side by buttress structures. These structures are attached to a base slab foundation. Buttress dams are built in areas with looser soil foundations.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/daniel-johnson.jpg" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>The Daniel-Johnson Buttress Dam, Canada</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Embankment dams are built up by the piling up of soil, rocks, or synthetic materials. These are usually porous on their outside but have an impervious core. Their main advantage is their low cost and flexibility, which allows them to adjust to shifts in the embankment or settlement of the foundation over time.</p>
<p>Gravity dams resist water flow through their sheer weight, which pulls them vertically down and allows them to resist the horizontal force of water pressure along their surface. This is similar to what a child does when he blocks a stream or rivulet by piling rocksâ€”they divert the water flow not through any structural design but through their weight. This is the origin of the name â€œgravity dam.â€�</p>
<p>A U.S. Department of the Interior report in 1998 explored various dam â€œeventsâ€�. These include four gravity dams in the United States and one in France<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. All five suffered damage due to sliding, and two of them failed entirely. The remaining three required additional drainage, reinforcements, and the release of reservoir waters to keep water depths low. For example, the Morris Shepherd Dam suffered sliding because the initial loading of the reservoir changed the stability of the bedrock foundation such that the safety ratio fell below 1.0. In other words, the load that the dam could support before failing had fallen below the regular load the dam was supposed to hold.</p>
<h2 id="foundation-risk-is-sliding-risk">Foundation risk is sliding risk</h2>
<p>The most important factor in sliding events is the nature of the bedrock on which a gravity dam is built. In failures of this type, the part of the foundation on which the dam rests slides downstream. We have reliable data to study this phenomenon, though media and news commentators have not put in the work.</p>
<p>In 2003 scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Yangtze River Scientific Research Institute received data and support from the Three Gorges Development Corporation, the Changjiang Water Resources Commission, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to conduct a stability assessment of the damâ€™s foundation using physical and numerical modeling.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The study incorporated a variety of techniques for the stability assessment, including conventional methods of geological mapping such as borehole drilling and shaft exploration, geophysical prospecting such as acoustic emission, remote sensing, seismic reflection and refraction, electromagnetic techniques, and physical-chemical analysis and micro-structural analysis. Most of these data are recorded in expensive studies commissioned in 1998 and 1999, when the dam was being built.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>They conclude that the â€œmajor factor influencing the foundation stability would come from the pre-existing discontinuities. However, among these discontinuities the faults mostly have steep dip angles, thin thickness, and well-cemented tectonite, so they would not play important roles in the foundation stability.â€�</p>
<h2 id="foundation-faults-and-joints">Foundation, faults, and joints</h2>
<p>The foundation is plagioclase granite which is homogenous and of high strength, and with various degrees of weathering, though the dam itself is on the moderately and lightly weathered parts.</p>
<p>The are 886 faults in the granite, most of which have steep angles (i.e. they go down more than sideways). 90% of these are shorter than 300 meters and narrower than 1 meter. Most of the faults are filled in with tectonite, a metamorphic type of rock.</p>
<p>The granite also has a very large number of joints. Joints are fractures where the two sides, unlike in a fault, lack visible or detectable movement relative to each other. 13% of joints have dip angles less than 30 degrees, 10% are between 30-60, and 77% are greater than 60 degrees.</p>
<p>The low-dipping joints have been studied more than the others because they dip downstream at an angle low enough to create sliding surfaces in the damâ€™s foundation. This was determined to be the greatest risk to foundation stability.</p>
<p>As we can see in the illustration below, the area of greatest risk is labeled â€œrelative developed regions of gently dipping joints,â€� which is where these low dipping joints are present in both long and short form, and in high densities. This area crosses the dam around the left powerhouse, which also overlaps with one of the large faults.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/rock-joint-distribution.png" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Rock joint distribution along the foundation of Three Gorges Dam (Liu et al)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another risk factor is connectivity: the percentage of joints that could form a potential sliding path. The higher the connectivity, the higher the probability that a disturbance will link the joints into a fracture that produces a sliding event.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/layout-of-tgd.png" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Layout of the TGD and the numbered left powerhouse-dam sections (Liu et al)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sections 1-5 of the left powerhouse dam are the weakest links. As can be seen below, the density of low-dipping joints is highest under Section No. 3 of the left powerhouse dam. Even more unfortunately, Section No. 3 also has the highest joint connectivityâ€”80% of the joints are in a potential sliding path!</p>

            <h4>Avg. linear density of low-dipping joints, and connectivity, for Sections No. 1-5 (Liu et al)</h4>

<p>We can appreciate the high connectivity of the joints under Section No. 3 through the geological sketches from Liu et al.</p>
