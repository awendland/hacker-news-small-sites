                                <h2>Even if greenhouse-gas emissions stop now, global warming will continue for centuries, a study shows. The solution: removing carbon from the air.</h2>
                            </p><div>
                                <ul><li>Even if the world were to stop emitting greenhouse gases right now, the Earth would keep warming for centuries, a new study shows.</li>
<li>The researchers suggest <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/how-to-stop-gobal-warming-plan-carbon-capture-2018-10">sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere</a> and storing it underground — a solution known as carbon capture and storage.</li>
<li>That's considered a type of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/geoengineering-how-to-reverse-climate-change-2019-4">geoengineering</a>. Other <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/geoengineering-how-to-reverse-climate-change-2019-4">climate-hacking</a> proposals in the same category are far riskier.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li></ul><p>Even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gas today, the Earth would continue warming for centuries. Arctic ice and permafrost are already on an irreversible path of melting.</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75481-z">That's the finding of new research</a> published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. The model suggests that even if emissions were to drop to zero this year, global temperatures would ultimately rise to be 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit higher in 2500 than they were in 1850 (that's 3 degrees Celsius).</p><p>"The tundra will continue to melt over the next 500 years — irrespective of how quickly humanity cuts its greenhouse-gas emissions," Jørgen Randers, the lead author of the new study, told Business Insider.</p><p>That's because climate change is a vicious, self-sustaining cycle: As permafrost thaws, it releases more greenhouse gases, like methane and carbon dioxide, which sustains warming over time. To stop that cycle, Randers said, we'll need to suck carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere.</p><h2>8 feet of sea-level rise</h2><p>Randers' study modeled the effect of various emissions-reductions scenarios on Earth's climate between 1850 and 2500.</p><p>The data showed that if emissions stopped for good in 2020, sea levels in 2500 would still be more than 8 feet (2.5 meters) higher than in 1850.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fac2eb9b09abb0018626059?format=jpeg" alt="FILE - In this Aug. 16, 2019, photo, large Icebergs float away as the sun rises near Kulusuk, Greenland. The Trump administration is poised to announce an expanded diplomatic presence in Greenland and a new assistance package for the vast island aimed at thwarting growing Chinese and Russian influence in the Arctic. The announcement, expected Thursday, April 23, 2020, will come less than a year after President Donald Trump drew derision for expressing an interest in buying Greenland.

</figcaption></figure><p>To prevent the projected 3-degree-Celsius temperature increase, greenhouse-gas emissions would need to have ceased entirely between 1960 and 1970, the model found. In that sense, Earth blew by a climactic point of no return 50 years ago — before much of the public understood the realities of climate change.</p><p>"Yes, that is an irony," Randers said. "But of course the scientific community knew about global warming already in the 1960s."</p><h2>We need to suck carbon out of the atmosphere</h2><p>The Paris climate agreement was created with the intention to cut greenhouse-gas emissions enough to keep the world's temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius by 2100. But even if all emissions stopped by 2100, according to Randers' model, sea levels in 2500 would be nearly 10 feet (3 meters) higher than they were in 1850.</p><p>Earth's temperatures are already on track to blow past the Paris agreement's goals. Last year was the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/projected-ranks#:~:text=The%20warmest%20years%20globally%20have,Courtesy%20of%20NOAA%20NCEI.">second warmest on record</a> for surface temperatures and <a href="https://time.com/5765489/ocean-temperatures-warmest-ever/">the hottest ever for oceans</a>. Polar melting is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sea-level-rise-3-feet-in-80-years-un-report-2019-9" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40">on track to raise seas 3 feet by 2100</a> and threatens to displace hundreds of millions of people.</p><p>What's needed, Randers said, is for companies and governments to "start developing the technologies for large-scale removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere."</p><p>In technical terms, that strategy is known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). To prevent further warming after emissions have stopped, the new study found, at least 33 gigatonnes (36.5 billion tons) of carbon dioxide would need to be sucked out of the atmosphere each year. That's roughly the total amount of carbon dioxide the global fossil-fuel industry emitted in 2018 (<a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/12/new-global-co2-emissions-numbers-are-they-re-not-good#:~:text=Record%20Carbon%20Dioxide%20Emissions%20in%202018&amp;text=This%20year's%20numbers%20confirm%20their,2017%20to%2036.2%20gigatonnes%20CO20CO2">36 gigatonnes</a>).</p><p>Power plants in the US, Canada, and Switzerland have already started utilizing CCS to lower their emissions. In 2014, the Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan became one of the first in the world to successfully use the technology.</p><p>In total, 21 commercial-scale carbon-capture projects are operating around the world, and 22 more are in development, <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/carbon-capture/">according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions</a>. These projects typically store carbon deep underground in depleted oil and gas fields or in bioreactor containers filled with algae that eats carbon dioxide.</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5fac4783b09abb001862611c?format=jpeg" alt="bioreactor" height="3744" width="4992" charset=""><figcaption>Bioreactors filled with green algae that eats carbon dioxide in Costa de la Luz, Spain.

</figcaption></figure><p>Two US carbon-capture completed in 2017 — <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/carbon-capture/">one in Illinois, one in Texas</a> — can capture 1.1 million and 1.6 million tons of carbon dioxide, respectively, per year. But the amount of CO2 that needs to be removed from the atmosphere requires far more plants than any current plans call for.</p><p>"In other words, building 33,000 big CCS plants and keep them running for ever," the study authors wrote.</p><h2>The pros and cons of geoengineering</h2><p>Carbon capture is becoming widely accepted as a safe and potentially effective form of geoengineering. This and other climate interventions are increasingly being floated <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03036-4">by scientists</a> and politicians alike; Andrew Yang, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, suggested <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-thinks-geoengineering-could-lead-to-war-2019-4">budgeting $800 million</a> for further geoengineering research in the US.</p><p>But most climate-hacking proposals would be far riskier than CCS. Take solar geoengineering, for example, which involves injecting aerosols into the sky to reflect sunlight back into space. Critics of this idea point out that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01606-0">most models predict</a> the effects of solar geoengineering wouldn't stay localized. If a country decided to independently deploy such measures, varying and unpredictable effects would likely be seen in other spots around the globe.</p><p>Aerosol injections deployed in the southern hemisphere, for instance, could impact ocean temperatures and wind speeds, leading to more hurricanes in the northern hemisphere.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://i.insider.com/5c76a74726289812e8235523?format=jpeg" alt="Clouds above earth" height="2848" width="3797" charset=""><figcaption>Subtropical stratocumulus clouds above Earth.

</figcaption></figure><p>"Solar geoengineering has geopolitical ramifications, unlike carbon capture," Juan Moreno-Cruz, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo who studies geoengineering, previously told Business Insider.</p><p>Randers said his study advocates just for carbon capture, not other more experimental forms of geoengineering.&nbsp;</p><p>"I am generally against geoengineering because of its unintended side effects. But if the world continues to delay meaningful and feasible action to phase out fossil fuels, we may have to resort to geoengineering," Randers said.&nbsp;</p><p>As an immediate priority, he added, countries should invest equally in efforts to cut emissions and build more CCS plants.</p><p>"This would be a wonderful task for a government-financed <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-2019-1">Green New Deal</a>," he said.</p>

    <p>If you followed the recent Apple events, you probably saw a picture of the A14 and M1 dies… that got me thinking about what you would see if you could pass iOS under X-Rays…</p>
<p>In my previous article about the <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/">evolution of the programming languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 14</a>, I analyzed iOS based on the number of binaries and their programming languages. As I pointed out in this past post, the size of the binaries were not taken in account. In this new article, I look at iPhone OS 1.0 and iOS 14 from a size perspective using tree maps.</p>

<p>To produce the images in this article, I extracted the root filesystem (including the dyld shared cache) of each major iOS release:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<p>I then created a tree map. You might be familiar with tree maps as they are often used to visualize a file hierarchy to give you a graphical overview of the structure. One key characteristic is that each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. The tree maps displayed in this article have been created using the awesome <a href="http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/">GrandPerspective</a> and annotated with <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a>.</p>

<p>Let's look at what you would see if you could scan iPhone OS 1.0 using X-Rays:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The diagram below highlights some of the major functional blocks:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_structures.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can already notice that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure is quite simple and has similarities to macOS</li>
<li>Frameworks are taking more than a third of the size</li>
<li>Fonts are taking more than 25% of the whole operating system</li>
</ul>
<p>We can go one level deeper and identify all the components:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From the list of components, we can clearly determine all the main features of iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>SMS</li>
<li>Weather</li>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Safari + Web</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Wallpaper</li>
<li>Ringtones</li>
<li>Office support</li>
<li>Audio player</li>
<li>Video player</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of components worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UIKit framework is taking more than 13 % of the total size</li>
<li>The wallpapers and ringtones count for 6 %</li>
<li>ICU (International Components for Unicode) takes more than 5 %</li>
<li>SpringBoard is roughly 2 %</li>
</ul>

<p>On popular demand, I added this section to provide more info about the fonts.
The huge <code>Fonts</code> block is composed of 2 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the fonts representing 2/3 of the size</li>
<li>some caches (visible at the top of the area and representing a third of the size)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the font lovers, here is the complete list of fonts in iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<pre><code>AmericanTypewriter.ttf
AmericanTypewriterBold.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensed.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensedBold.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensedLight.ttf

</code></pre>
<p>The cache contains info for all these fonts and includes the 2 extra files:</p>
<ul>
<li>HelveLTMM.ps</li>
<li>TimesLTMM.ps</li>
</ul>

<p>I won't give details about each iOS release but you can inspect the tree maps from iPhone OS 2.0 to iOS 13.1:</p>

<p>Note that the number of building blocks increased with each new iOS release and the components are becoming smaller.</p>

<p>We are now in 2020 and iOS 14 is available. Without a surprise, iOS 14 is way more complex than iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the diagram highlighting the functional blocks in iOS 14:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14_structures.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can note that the main structure is still fairly similar to the original iPhone OS 1.0 version: the fonts, frameworks, applications, library, /usr, … are still there.</p>
<p>There are however a couple of big differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 contains a lot of <code>Preinstalled Assets</code> and <code>Linguistic Data</code>. As far as I can tell, these components are used for on-device machine learning: language detector, voices, tokenizers, vocalizers, …</li>
<li>The dyld shared cache, a caching mechanism introduced in iPhone OS 3.1, causes the Frameworks and Private Frameworks to be split in several areas. The dyld shared cache has been marked with the red box in the diagram.</li>
<li>Health is clearly an important feature of iOS 14.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many components in iOS 14 that it is way more complex to identify all of them. I gave it a try nonetheless:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although it is now difficult to list all the features, there are some clear trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 is packed with on-device machine learning technologies: Face Detection, Deep Convolutional Networks, Vision frameworks, Text Recognition, Neural Network, …</li>
<li>A lot of components are related to the camera and photos: Effects, Memories, video processing, photo library, …</li>
<li>Siri and voices are clearly visible.</li>
<li>As we already mentioned, Health is an important feature.</li>
<li>We can identify a couple of features added over the years: HomeKit, Watch, CarPlay, Spotlight, Emoji 🤟, News, iWork, Wallet, Shortcuts, ARKit, …</li>
</ul>
<p>More statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts are now counting for less than 6 % of the size</li>
<li>Linguistic Data represent almost 8 % of the size</li>
<li>Although the ICU size was multiplied by more than 3 since iPhone OS 1.0, it now represents approximatively 0.5% of the total</li>
</ul>

<p>For readability the previous tree maps in this article were all displayed using the same size. If we present iPhone OS 1.0 next to iOS 14 with a proportional area, you would see that the whole iPhone OS 1.0 is basically taking the size of the iOS 14 wallpapers:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/Compare-iOS1-iOS14.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When iPhone OS 1.0 was released in 2007, it redefined the smartphone with a limited set of core features. Nowadays iOS 14 contains an incredible amount of components. By looking at them based on their size, we can determine the most important features. We thus distinctly see Apple's AI push into on-device machine learning with technologies like object detection in images and video, language analysis, sound classification and text recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Update 24.11.2020:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added fonts in the iPhone OS 1.0 tree map</li>
<li>Added fonts in the iOS 14 tree map</li>
<li>Add section with fonts info for iPhone OS 1.0</li>
</ul>

To beat the crisis, the world can't simply rely on renewable energy, governments will need to include carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) into the mix if they want to <span>hit their climate targets.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-4uch7"><span>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), CCUS could <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/transforming-industry-through-ccus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>reduce carbon emissions by almost a fifth</u></a>, but can this technology deliver on its promises or is it too good to be true?</span></p><h3 id="viewer-5vpth"><span>What is <!-- -->Carbon capture, usage and storage?</span></h3><p id="viewer-pi2c"><span>Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) refers to <!-- -->a chain of different technologies aimed at capturing waste <!-- -->carbon dioxide<!-- --> (<!-- -->CO2<!-- -->), usually from large <!-- -->point sources of pollution like power plants, <!-- -->transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere. Some could be used to help grow greenhouse plants, make plastics, or even carbonate fizzy drinks. The first step is to fit factory chimneys with solvent filters, which trap carbon emissions before they escape, then the gas can be piped to locations to be used or stored. For the moment, t<span>here are about 30 CCUS projects operating around the world, which is nowhere near enough to clean up all of our emissions. </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-fds85"><span><span>Why is CCUS needed?</span></span></h3><p id="viewer-7vj3h"><span><span>Nowadays, </span>Industrial production <span>accounts for one-quarter of CO</span>2﻿<span> emissions from energy and industrial processes.

<p><strong>Content warning</strong>: Description of a death, and photos of the cleaned site of death.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/23/death-of-sydney-uber-eats-rider-the-fourth-food-delivery-fatality-in-two-months">four cyclists were killed by car drivers in Sydney in the last 2 months</a>, a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-24/uber-eats-vows-to-improve-safety-cyclist-killed-in-inner-sydney/12913840">37-year-old man from Malaysia</a> was killed at ~6:40pm last night - on my street, 200 metres from my front door, at an intersection I cycle through 2-4 times a day. I would have gone through that intersection within 15 minutes of that time if I didn’t skip a class. If you know me, I’m usually quite outspoken about the dangers cyclists face, but this was absolutely brutal to hear.</p>
<p>They cleaned up the body, but didn’t completely clean up the UberEats meal the man was delivering. The man likely died while earning less than minimum wage - A survey conducted by the Transport Workers’ Union in September <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/23/death-of-sydney-uber-eats-rider-the-fourth-food-delivery-fatality-in-two-months">found</a> that food deliverers earned an average of just $10.42 an hour after costs. 73% said they were worried about being “seriously hurt or killed” at work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…I was driving along Cleveland st, and only had a glimpse of what happened: for those of you arguing about PPE - I think there was a helmet - and a crushed head and body, and a twisted bicycle, and, yes, one of those grey food delivery bags all in the middle of Chalmers st. I am crying tonight, because that was someone’s child, friend … a person - who is no more… .</p>

</div><div>
<h2 id="contributing-causes">Contributing causes</h2>
<p>This is a tragedy in itself, but there are also a number of contributing causes at play here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In NSW, cycling on a footpath <a href="https://bicyclensw.org.au/who-can-ride-on-a-footpath-in-nsw/">is illegal and carries a fine of $114</a> for those above 15 years of age. Footpath cycling is <a href="https://www.bykbikes.com.au/blogs/bike-riding-tips/riding-bikes-on-the-footpath-the-laws-for-kids-and-adults-in-australia">legal in</a> Queensland, Tasmania, the ACT, the Northern Territory and South Australia.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the UK in 2017, there is a cyclist/pedestrian collision every <a href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/rise-pedestrians-hit-cyclists-not-cause-leap-conclusions-396047">~9.9 million kilometres walked by a pedestrian</a>, or 531 in total. Of these 531 collisions 3 people were killed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Gig economy workers have little training and often no insurance. California recently proposed a law to force Uber and other platforms to treat their workers like employees. It narrowly failed to pass after <a href="https://jakecoppinger.blog/articles/the-last-delivery-of-an-ubereats-cyclist-2020/Uber,%20Lyft,%20and%20DoorDash%20poured%20over%20$200%20million%20into">Uber, Lyft and Doordash spent &gt; US$200m</a> campaigning against the law.</p></li>
<li><p>Dedicated infrastructure for cyclists is rare in Sydney. Not only are separated bicycle lanes hard to come by, a state government <a href="https://concreteplayground.com/sydney/design-style/sustainability/state-goverment-moves-to-rip-up-college-street-cycleway">actively removed</a> a cycleway in 2015 (which <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/central-sydney/college-st-syclists-four-times-as-likely-to-be-involved-in-a-crash-since-cycleway-removed/news-story/98ebe30e5c649407e45fd1aa7f023049">increased accidents by 400%</a>) <a href="https://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/newsroom/2019/03/12/planned-removal-of-alexandra-canal-cycleway/">and in 2019</a>. Walking and cycling infrastructure typically receives <a href="https://theconversation.com/cycling-and-walking-can-help-drive-australias-recovery-but-not-with-less-than-2-of-transport-budgets-142176">0.1-2% of transport budgets</a>. Clover Moore is pushing hard on adding new dedicated cycle infrastructure in the City of Sydney - <a href="https://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/building-new-infrastructure/creating-pop-up-cycleways-in-sydney">Six pop-up cycleways</a> have been added, which may remain if their is popular support.</p></li>
<li><p>Australian car drivers have a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/mythbusting-the-reasons-why-people-hate-cyclists/8689058">unique hatred of cyclists</a>. Cyclists <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/youre-a-cyclist-so-its-your-fault-20140205-321np.html">attract a level of vitriol</a>, if not outright malice, reserved for few subjects in the laid back Aussie’s mind. Even Tour de France winner Cadel Evans, a self described “car guy” who has a number of classic and sports cars, said <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/even-tour-de-france-winner-cadel-evans-finds-cycling-in-sydney-too-intimidating-20161118-gss316.html">he doesn’t cycle in Sydney</a> due to the culture. Cyclists want to be on the road even less than car drivers want them there, but as stated earlier it is illegal to cycle on the footpath.</p></li>

<h2 id="reasons-for-change">Reasons for change</h2>
<h3 id="public-safety">Public safety</h3>
<p>Car crashes are one of the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/lifestyle/the-most-dangerous-activity-driving/">leading causes of death in western countries</a>, and air pollution due to cars killed <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/road-death-toll-should-include-victims-of-vehicle-emissions-report-20190628-p522a8.html">two times</a> as many people as <a href="https://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/statistics/index.html">crashes do</a> in NSW each year - and they didn’t even have a choice. <a href="http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC89231/jrc89231-online%20final%20version%202.pdf">Half of PM10 particle emissions come from tire wear, suspended road dust and brake wear</a>- electric cars (even with regen braking) won’t fix this. In the US, drivers of cars <a href="http://vpc.org/regulating-the-gun-industry/gun-deaths-compared-to-motor-vehicle-deaths/">kill more people</a> than guns each year.</p>
<p>NSW has a program called <a href="https://towardszero.nsw.gov.au/">Towards Zero</a>, with the aim of reducing road fatalities to zero. One of the few cities to achieve this goal is Oslo, which <a href="https://twitter.com/andershartmann/status/1212465415743512576">reduced pedestrian and cyclist deaths in 2019 to 0</a> by making the <em>city centre</em> <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90294948/what-happened-when-oslo-decided-to-make-its-downtown-basically-car-free">effectively car free</a>, replacing more than 700 parking spots with bike lanes, plants, parks and benches, increasing business.</p>

<h3 id="cars-are-heavily-subsidised-in-australia">Cars are heavily subsidised in Australia</h3>
<p>By the most generous measure, drivers only contribute <a href="https://www.ptua.org.au/myths/petroltax/">two-thirds of the cost of the road system</a> through rego and petrol taxes. The damage to a road is proportional to the <em>fourth power</em> of axle weight. Many cyclists also own a car and already pay rego. Contrary to popular belief, cyclists are likely subsidising car users.</p>
<h3 id="investing-in-cycle-infrastructurereducing-car-usage-makes-economic-sense">Investing in cycle infrastructure/reducing car usage makes economic sense</h3>
<p>In one study, for each dollar of investment in cycle focused infrastructure, the best practice policy returns 24 dollars in health, congestion, and air and noise pollution related benefits (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/378na1_en.pdf">Macmillan, A., Connor, J., Witten, K., et al.&nbsp;(2014). The Societal Costs and Benefits of Commuter Bicycling: Simulating the Effects of Specific Policies Using System Dynamics Modeling</a>)</p>
<p>A paper submitted to Infrastructure Australia estimated the value of commuter cycling in Australian capital cities as worth approximately <a href="https://www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-06/Cycling_Infrastructure_Background_Paper_16Mar09_WEB.pdf">$0.76 per kilometre travelled</a>, equating to $2,667 for each regular commuter. Another paper <a href="https://www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-06/Cycling_Infrastructure_Background_Paper_16Mar09_WEB.pdf">estimated</a> that converting drivers to cycling in Sydney &amp; Brisbane is worth $0.74 per kilometre, $1,920 per person annually in inner Sydney.</p>
<p>Banning cars on a street in Rome led to <a href="https://jakecoppinger.blog/articles/the-last-delivery-of-an-ubereats-cyclist-2020/www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/mar/13/pedestrianisation-rome-italy-car-parking-ban">30% increase</a> in retail spending in that street.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://cityobservatory.org/ten-things-more-inequitable-that-road-pricing/">a lot of things</a> in our current system more inequitable than road pricing in urban areas.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Up to now, I have used vi as an example for modal text editor, mostly because
I expect most programmers have at least heard of it. However, I don’t believe
vi and clones are the best modal text editor out there.</p>
<p>I have been working, for the last 5 years, on a new modal editor called
Kakoune. It first started as a reimplementation of Vim (the most popular vi
clone) whose source code is quite dated. But, I soon realized that we could
improve a lot on vi editing model.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_improving_on_the_editing_model">Improving on the editing model</h3>
<p>vi basic grammar is <strong>verb</strong> followed by <strong>object</strong>; it’s nice because it matches
well with the order we use in English, "delete word". On the other hand,
it does not match well with the nature of what we express: There is only
a handful of <strong>verbs</strong> in text editing (<strong>d</strong>elete, <strong>y</strong>ank, <strong>p</strong>aste,
<strong>i</strong>nsert…​), and they don’t compose, contrarily to <strong>objects</strong> which can be
arbitrarily complex, and difficult to express. That means that errors are
not handled well. If you express your object wrongly with a delete verb,
the wrong text will get deleted, you will need to undo, and try again.</p>
<p>Kakoune’s grammar is <strong>object</strong> followed by <strong>verb</strong>, combined with instantaneous
feedback, that means you always see the current object (In Kakoune we call
that the selection) before you apply your change, which allows you to correct
errors on the go.</p>
<p>Kakoune tries hard to fix one of the big problems with the vi model: its
lack of interactivity. Because of the <strong>verb</strong> followed by <strong>object</strong> grammar,
vi changes are made in the dark, we don’t see their effect until the whole
editing <strong>sentence</strong> is finished. <code>5dw</code> will delete to next five words, if
you then realize that was one word too many, you need to undo, go back to
your initial position, and try again with <code>4dw</code>. In Kakoune, you would do
<code>5W</code>, see immediately that one more word than expected was selected, type
<code>BH</code> to remove that word from the selection, then <code>d</code> to delete.  At each
step you get visual feedback, and have the opportunity to correct it.</p>
<p>At the lower level, the problem is that vi treats moving around and selecting
an object as two different things. Kakoune unifies that, moving <strong>is</strong> selecting.
<code>w</code> does not just go to the next word, it selects from current position to
the next word. By convention, capital commands tend to expand the selection,
so <code>W</code> would expand the current selection to the next word.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_multiple_selections">Multiple selections</h3>
<p>Another particular feature of Kakoune is its support for, and emphasis
towards the use of multiple selections. Multiple selections in Kakoune
are not just one additional feature, it is the central way of interacting
with your text. For example there is no such thing as a "global replace" in
Kakoune. What you would do is select the whole buffer with the <code>%</code> command,
then select all matches for a regex in the current selections (that is the
whole buffer here) with the <code>s</code> command, which prompts for a regex. You would
end up with one selection for each match of your regex and use the insert
mode to do your change. Globally replacing foo with bar would be done with
<code>%sfoo&lt;ret&gt;cbar&lt;esc&gt;</code> which is just the combination of basic building blocks.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Multiple selections provides us with a very powerful to express structural
selection: we can subselect matches inside the current selections, keep
selections containing/not containing a match, split selections on a regex,
swap selections contents…​</p>
<p>For example, convert from <code>snake_case_style</code> to <code>camelCaseStyle</code> can be done
by selecting the word (with <code>w</code> for example) then subselecting underscores
in the word with <code>s_&lt;ret&gt;</code>, deleting these with <code>d</code>, then upper casing the
selected characters with <code>~</code>. The inverse operation could be done by selecting
the word, then subselecting the upper case characters with <code>s[A-Z]&lt;ret&gt;</code>
lower casing them with ` and then inserting an underscore before them with
<code>i_&lt;esc&gt;</code> This operation could be put in a macro, and would be reusable
easily to convert any identifier.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Another example would be parameter swapping, if you had <code>func(arg2, arg1);</code>
you could select the contents of the parenthesis with <code>&lt;a-i&gt;(</code>, split the
selection on comma with <code>S, &lt;ret&gt;</code>, and swap selection contents with <code>&lt;a-)&gt;</code>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>It is as well easy to use multiple selections for alignment, as the <code>&amp;</code>
command will align all selection cursors by inserting blanks before
selection start</p>

<p>Or to use multiple selections as a way to gather some text from different
places and regroup it in another place, thanks to a special form of pasting

<div>
<h3 id="_interactive_predictable_and_fast">Interactive, predictable and fast</h3>
<p>A design goal of Kakoune is to beat vim at its own game, while providing a
cleaner editing model. The combination of multiple selections and cleaned up
grammar shows that it’s possible to have text edition that is interactive,
predictable, and fast at the same time.</p>
<p>Interactivity comes from providing feedback on every command, made possible by
the inverted <strong>object</strong> then <strong>verb</strong> grammar. Every selection modification
has direct visual feedback; regex-based selections incrementally show what
will get selected, including when the regular expression is invalid; and even
yanking some text displays a message notifying how many selections were yanked.</p>
<p>Predictability comes from the simple effect of most commands. Each command is
conceptually simple, doing one single thing. <code>d</code> deletes whatever is selected,
nothing more. <code>%</code> selects the whole buffer. <code>s</code> prompts for a regex and
selects matches in the previous selection. It is the combination of these
building blocks that allows for complex, but predictable, actions on the text.</p>
<p>Being fast, as in requiring fewer keystrokes, is provided by carefully designing
the set of editing commands so that they interact well together, and by sometimes
sacrificing beauty for useability. For example, <code>&lt;a-s&gt;</code> is equivalent to
<code>S^&lt;ret&gt;</code>: they both split on new lines, but this is such a common use case that
it deserves to have its own key shortcut. As shown in <a href="http://github.com/mawww/golf">http://github.com/mawww/golf</a>,
Kakoune manages to beat Vim at the keystroke count game in most cases,
using much more idiomatic commands.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_discoverability">Discoverability</h3>
<p>Keyboard oriented programs tend to be at a disadvantage compared to GUI
applications because they are less discoverable; there is no menu bar on
which to click to see the available options, no tooltip appearing when you
hover above a button explaining what it does.</p>
<p>Kakoune solves this problem through the use of two mechanisms: extensive
completion support, and auto-information display.</p>
<p>When a command is written in a prompt, Kakoune will automatically open a menu
providing you with the available completions for the current parameter. It
will know if the parameter is supposed to be a word against a fixed set
of word, the name of a buffer, a filename, etc…​ Actually, as soon as <code>:</code>
is typed, entering command prompt mode, the list of existing commands will
be displayed in the completion menu.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kakoune will display an information box, describing what the
command does, what optional switches it can take, what they do…​</p>
<div>
<p>Command discoverability</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/discoverability.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">

</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>That information box gets displayed in other cases, for example if the <code>g</code>
key is hit, which then waits for another key (<code>g</code> is the <strong>goto</strong> commands
prefix), an information box will display all the recognized keys, informing
the user that Kakoune is waiting on a keystroke, and listing the available
options.</p>
<p>To go even further in discoverability, the auto information system can
be set to display an information box after each normal mode keystroke,
explaining what the key pressed just did.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_extensive_completion_support">Extensive completion support</h3>
<p>Keyboard oriented programs are much easier to work with when they provide
extensive completion support. For a long time, completion has been prefix
based, and that has been working very well.</p>
<p>More recently, we started to see more and more programs using the so called
fuzzy completion. Fuzzy completion tends to be subsequence based, instead
of prefix based, which means the typed query needs to be a subsequence of
a candidate to be considered matching, instead of a prefix. That will generate
more candidates (all prefix matches are also subsequence matches), so it
needs a good ranking algorithm to sort the matches and put the best ones first.</p>
<p>Kakoune embraces fuzzy matching for its completion support, which kicks in both
during insert mode, and prompt mode.</p>
<div>
<p>Word completion support</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/completion.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>Insert mode completion provides completion suggestions while inserting in the
buffer, it can complete words from the buffer, or from all buffers, lines,
filenames, or get completion candidates from an external source, making it
possible to implement intelligent code completion.</p>
<div>
<p>Language specific completion support</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/cpp-completion.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>Prompt completion is displayed whenever we enter command mode, and provides
completion candidates that are adapted to the command being entered, and to
the current argument being edited.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_a_better_unix_citizen">A better unix citizen</h3>
<p>Easily making programs cooperate with each others is one of the main strength
of the Unix environment. Kakoune is designed to integrate nicely with a POSIX
system: various text editing commands give direct access to the power of POSIX
tools, like <code>|</code>, which prompts for a shell command and pipe selections through
it, replacing their contents with the command output, or <code>$</code> that prompts for
a command, and keeps selections for which the command returned success.</p>
<div>
<p>Using external commands as filters</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/filters.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I love ED on CP/M.  It's often derided but I think it's just misunderstood and with a little practise its true value can shine through.  It's elegant, easy to learn and only has about 25 commands but these can be combined.  Once you get used to it most editing tasks are pretty quick.  If I'm editing text that is made up of separate lines, ideally not more than the width of the terminal, I find it excellent.  It does have a line limit of 128 characters so for continuous prose I will switch to something like Wordstar, but for editing source code and config files on CP/M, it's my first choice.</p>
<p>ED came as standard with CP/M and is only 7k for CP/M 2.2 and 10k for CP/M Plus.  One advantage of ED is that it will work both with teleprinters and video terminals without having to be configured for each device.  It is also good at manipulating large files even when the system is short of memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/cpm_ed_copy_paste.png" title="Copying and Pasting with ED"></p><p>Like many early editors, ED is a modal editor which you start in command mode and while in this mode you can view existing text, move between lines and points in the line.  It allows you to do standard operations such as copy and paste, inserting text from other files, searching for and replacing text, etc.  When we want to enter input mode, we can use the 'I' command.  This is much like VI, except that you can only enter text in the non-command mode but not edit it.  To exit data input mode and return to command mode you use ^Z (CTRL-Z).  These commands can be combined together and one of the most powerful facilities that ED has is the 'M' Macro command to repeat sequences of commands.</p>
<p>Upon executing ED it creates a temporary output file and as you write out from ED it goes to this temporary file.  When editing a file we append text from it into the memory buffer and save to the temporary output file as we go or at the end.</p>
<p>ED keeps track of a number of values such as where it is in the source file,  the line number in the memory buffer and the character pointer (CP) on the line.  These are altered as you move around the file and memory buffer.</p>
<p>I'm not going to give a fuller explanation of how to use ED here because the CP/M 2.2 Operating Manual has a good section on the <a href="http://www.gaby.de/cpm/manuals/archive/cpm22htm/ch2.htm">CP/M Editor</a>.  I do, however, want to show it being used properly in the video below.  Further down in this article I have highlighted some useful command sequences.</p>
<h2>An Example Macro</h2>
<p>ED has a macro facility which allows you to repeat a sequence of commands as many times as you like.  This makes it a good example of the power of ED and the following is a typical macro which searches through the memory buffer and displays any occurrences of the text 'CPM', pauses in case you want to stop the macro and then replaces it with 'CP/M'.</p>
<pre><code>MFCPM^Z0TT6Z-3CSCPM^ZCP/M^Z
</code></pre>
<p>The 'M' command will run the sequences of commands that follows it until an error is raised, such as end of file.  If we wanted to we could prepend 'M' with a number to indicate the number of times we want it to run.  I'll break down each command in the sequence below:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><td><code>M</code></td><td>Run the following command sequence until an error</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>FCPM^Z</code></td><td>Find 'CPM' and leave Character Pointer (CP) after it</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>0T</code></td><td>Display the line up to CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>T</code></td><td>Display the rest of the line from CP to end </td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>6Z</code></td><td>Pause</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>-3C</code></td><td>Move CP back 3 characters</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>SCPM^ZCP/M^</code></td><td>Substitute 'CPM' for 'CP/M'</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><code>^Z</code> in the above is CTRL-Z and indicates the end of an argument for a command.</p>
<p>The above macro could also be written:</p>
<pre><code>MFCPM^Z0TT6Z-3DICP/M^Z
</code></pre>
<p>In which case:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><td><code>-3D</code></td><td>Delete the 3 previous characters</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>ICPM^Z</code></td><td>Insert the text 'CP/M'</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The video below shows ED being used properly and some of the things that make it great, including searching and replacing text, copying and pasting, macros and handling files bigger than the available memory.</p>
<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7pqaj050X7g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<h2>Common Command Sequences</h2>
<p>Below are some useful command command sequences which may be overlooked when reading the manual for ED.</p>
<div><table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Sequence</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
  <tr><td>#A</td><td>Load whole file into buffer</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0A</td><td>Load enough of the file to fill half the buffer.  This is great for large files</td></tr>
  <tr><td>#W0A</td><td>Save entire buffer and load more of the source file, enough to fill half of the buffer.  Useful to move through large files.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0W</td><td>Write half of the buffer to the new file.  Useful to make room of the buffer is full.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>-B</td><td>Move to end of the last line in the buffer</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0L</td><td>Move CP to beginning of line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>L-2C</td><td>Move to end of line before the &lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt; sequence</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0P</td><td>Display page from CP without moving CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0LT</td><td>Move CP to beginning of line and display line (Should this be +/-n ??)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0T</td><td>Type line up to but not including CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0TT</td><td>Type whole line without moving CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0T&lt;cr&gt;T</td><td>Type whole line without moving CP.  Display up to CP on first list and from CP on next line.  This is useful to see where CP is on line.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>B#T</td><td>Display the whole buffer</td></tr>
  <tr><td>KI</td><td>Replace a line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0K</td><td>Delete up to CP on current line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>S^L^Z</td><td>Join current line with next</td></tr>
  <tr><td>I^L^Z</td><td>To split a line at CP</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0V</td><td>Print free/total memory buffer stats</td></tr>
  <tr><td>0X</td><td>Empties the temporary default exchange file: X$$$$$$$.LIB, used by the <em>X</em> command</td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<p>In the table above the following holds true:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>#</dt><dd>Represents the highest value for n</dd>
  <dt>^L</dt><dd>CTRL-L - Stands for carriage return sequence &lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;</dd>
  <dt>^Z</dt><dd>CTRL-Z - Indicates the end of a command's argument</dd>
  <dt>&lt;cr&gt;</dt><dd>Carriage Return - Actually pressing the <em>Return</em> key</dd>
</dl>
<br>
<h2>Do You Like ED Too?</h2>
<p>I know that I'm in the minority, but I'm sure there must be other people who also like ED.  I'd love to hear if I'm not alone in this.  You can leave comments via the links below or via the YouTube video above.</p>

<p>The Intel NUC <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/76978/">D34010WYK</a> has a LAN port with two integrated LEDs. Both are permanently on when a connection is established, with one LED blinking on network activity. This can be rather distracting, particularly at night. So I went on to figure out how to disable the LEDs. It's a general solution that should work with every OS, every NUC, and every somewhat recent Intel NIC (Network Interface Card). Perhaps most devices with an Intel Ethernet controller.</p>
<p>The most obvious and low-tech solution is to tape the LEDs. I haven't tried as an observation led me on a different path. I noticed that a few seconds into booting Ubuntu, the LEDs are briefly switched off. I concluded this must be done through software somehow. This didn't turn out to be entirely correct or useful, as the driver (kernel module) merely resets the controller when it loads, but made me curious enough to proceed.</p>
<p>First, a step back to know the controller used in the NUC.</p>
<p>$ lspci | grep Ethernet
00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection I218-V (rev 04)</p>
<p>Intel ARK has <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/71305/">more information</a>, including a very detailed 262-pages datasheet, which will prove essential.</p>
<h2>Kernel</h2>
<p>I wondered if the option to disable LEDs is perhaps provided through a kernel module parameter. I already knew the  module name for recent Intel Ethernet devices: <i>e1000e</i>. If I hadn't, <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/search?keyword=I218">searching</a> the Intel Download Center for <i>I218</i> and filtering for <i>Linux</i> tells the same. And sure enough, the module is loaded.</p>
<p>$ lsmod | grep e1000e
e1000e                226396  0
ptp                    19395  1 e1000e</p>
<p>Many parameters, but none to change the behavior of LEDs. As confirmed by the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/e1000e.txt">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>$ modinfo -p e1000e
debug:Debug level (0=none,...,16=all) (int)
copybreak:Maximum size of packet that is copied to a new buffer on receive (uint)

WriteProtectNVM:Write-protect NVM [WARNING: disabling this can lead to corrupted NVM] (array of int)
CrcStripping:Enable CRC Stripping, disable if your BMC needs the CRC (array of int)</p>
<p>It turns out such a parameter was <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/e1000/feature-requests/2/">requested</a> years ago, but denied by Intel with the following explanation.</p>
<p><span></span><span>I'm sorry, but this feature request was evaluated and denied because the majority of our customers require the LEDs to function as-is, and module parameters of this type are unacceptable.</span><span></span></p>
<p>So I downloaded the kernel model <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/15817">source</a>, hoping to modify it, and eventually noticed a promising function.</p>
<p>
static s32 e1000_led_off_pchlan(struct e1000_hw *hw)
{
    u16 data = (u16)hw-&gt;mac.ledctl_mode1;
    u32 i, led;

    
    if (!(er32(STATUS) &amp; E1000_STATUS_LU)) {
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
            led = (data &gt;&gt; (i * 5)) &amp; E1000_PHY_LED0_MASK; 
            if ((led &amp; E1000_PHY_LED0_MODE_MASK) !=
                E1000_LEDCTL_MODE_LINK_UP)
                continue;
            if (led &amp; E1000_PHY_LED0_IVRT)
                data &amp;= ~(E1000_PHY_LED0_IVRT &lt;&lt; (i * 5));
            else
                data |= (E1000_PHY_LED0_IVRT &lt;&lt; (i * 5));
        }
    }

    return e1e_wphy(hw, HV_LED_CONFIG, data);
}</p><p>Perhaps more complex than you'd expect such a simple task to be. Many constants and bit operations. Lots more in related functions. I figured this must be documented, presumably in the <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/i218-ethernet-connection-datasheet.pdf">datasheet</a>. Browsing it cut my plans to modify the kernel module short, as it spells out a better alternative: NVM (Non-Volatile Memory).</p>
<p><span></span><span>The PHY has three LED outputs that can be configured via the NVM. The default values for the PHY (based on the LED NVM word 0x18 of the LAN region) are listed in the table below.</span><span></span></p>

<p>If you're wondering why the table mentions 3 LEDs when the LAN port only has 2: the second LED is bi-colored and can switch state to either green (LED2) or amber (LED1).</p>
<p>As a closing note on the kernel module: the code does not do what it appears to. Its only purpose is to provide an interface for blinking a single LED on request, in order to identify a NIC or LAN port. It's unrelated to LEDs blinking on network activity or otherwise, which is done in hardware.</p>
<h2>NVM</h2>
<p>Writeable flash memory, which holds configuration, like the MAC address or power management settings, detailed in the table below. The LED configuration is stored in the previously mentioned word <span>0x18</span>.</p>

<p>A minor detour first to explain the term <i>word</i>. It refers to a 2-byte (16-bit) value in little-endian order, meaning in reverse byte order. So value <span>0x1c10</span> is written <span>0x101c</span> to NVM. Very simple to do manually, by just swapping bytes, but can be done programmatically too. (These will be useful later.)</p>
<p>
def swap(value):
    return hex(value &gt;&gt; 8 | (value &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 8)

&gt;&gt;&gt; swap(0x1c10)
'0x101c'</p>
<p>
function swap(value) {
    return '0x' + ((value &gt;&gt; 8 | (value &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 8)).toString(16);
};

&gt; swap(0x1c10)
"0x101c"</p>
<p>Word <span>0x18</span> is encoded as follows.</p>

<p>It's a bit sequence with 5 bits each per LED. The first 3 bits on each LED set the mode, detailed in the second table. The remaining 2 bits invert and blink the LED. Below is a visual explanation on how to read this, using the default values.</p>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.pwmon.org/1900/f418.x1.png?201706071858" srcset="https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.pwmon.org/1900/f418.x2.png?201706071858 2x"></p><p>Such a sequence can be used directly with the <span>swap</span> function defined earlier, with <span>0b</span> prefix to indicate bits.</p>
<p>&gt; swap(0b0001100011110100)
"0xf418"</p>
<p>Now to construct a bit sequence to turn LEDs off permanently. As you notice, there is no mode to just flat disable an LED. It's still possible to get effectively the same result. There are two solutions.</p>
<p><span>1</span><span>Set the mode of each LED to <span>010</span>, so LEDs are on on any connection, and set the invert bit on each LED. Ergo, LEDs are off on any connection. With a minor side effect: in case of no connection, LEDs are on. (When the network cable is pulled, or when the opposite side is off.)</span></p>

<p>&gt; swap(0b0010100101001010)
"0x4a29"</p>
<p><span>2</span><span>Set the mode of each LED to <span>101</span>, so LEDs are on <b>only</b> on a 10Mbps connection. Ergo, LEDs are off for either a 100Mbps or 1Gbps connection. Without side effect, as LEDs stay off in case of no connection.</span></p>

<p>&gt; swap(0b0001010010100101)
"0xa514"</p>
<p>There are two additional variants to the second solution, which exclude the other link speed combinations each. I'll leave constructing the bit sequence for both as an exercise to the reader. Of both solutions I prefer the second due to lack of side effect when a link speed can be excluded. Usually either 10Mbps or 1Gbps definitely can be. A way to get the negotiated link speed is to use <i>dmesg</i>.</p>
<p>$ dmesg -t | grep e1000e
...
e1000e: eth0 NIC Link is Up 100 Mbps Full Duplex, Flow Control: Rx/Tx</p>
<p>So <span>0xa514</span> it is. Ready to write to NVM. The datasheet tells how.</p>
<p><span></span><span>Intel has an MS-DOS* software utility called EEupdate that is used to program the SPI Flash images in development or production line environments. A copy of this program can be obtained through your Intel Field Service representative.</span><span></span></p>
<p>That's no good. <i>EEupdate</i> is not publicly available. A bit of research reveals another Intel tool named <i>LANConf</i>, available for DOS, Linux, and Windows, which can also write to NVM, but can only be obtained by applying for a <a href="https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/my-intel/design-center-privileged-access-required.html">privileged account</a> and signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement. Fortunately, <i><a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/">ethtool</a></i> can handle NVM too.</p>
<p>To read from NVM, use as follows. (EEPROM and NVM are used interchangeably from here on.)</p>
<p>% ethtool -e|--eeprom-dump devname [raw on|off] [offset N] [length N]</p>
<p>As per the NVM Address Map, word <span>0x18</span> is at NVM byte offset <span>0x30</span>.</p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -e eth0 offset 0x30 length 2
Offset      Values
------      ------
0x0030:     f4 18</p>
<p>It matches the default value constructed earlier. Now to the important part: writing to NVM.</p>
<p>% ethtool -E|--change-eeprom devname [magic N] [offset N] [length N] [value N]</p>
<p>So <i>offset</i>, <i>length</i>, and <i>value</i> are obvious, but what does <i>magic</i> refer to? The manual knows.</p>
<p><span></span><span>Because of the persistent nature of writing to the EEPROM, a device-specific magic key must be specified to prevent the accidental writing to the EEPROM.</span><span></span></p>
<p>Where the device-specific magic key can be obtained from isn't documented anywhere. It appears to be kept somewhat secret on purpose. Only the file <i>ethtool.c</i> in the kernel module source code explains it.</p>
<p>eeprom-&gt;magic = adapter-&gt;pdev-&gt;vendor | (adapter-&gt;pdev-&gt;device &lt;&lt; 16);</p>
<p>Here <i>vendor</i> and <i>device</i> refer to <a href="https://pcisig.com/membership">PCI IDs</a>. There are numerous ways to get them, with the easiest perhaps being <i>lspci</i>.</p>
<p>$ lspci -nnq | grep Ethernet
00:19.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection I218-V [<b>8086</b>:<b>1559</b>] (rev 04)</p>
<p>The bold numbers are the <i>vendor</i> and <i>device</i> ID respectively, in hex. So this should give the magic key.</p>
<p>
&gt; '0x' + (0x8086 | (0x1559 &lt;&lt; 16)).toString(16)
"0x15598086"</p>
<p>Very simple. Alright, commence writing.</p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x30 length 2 value 0xa514
ethtool: bad command line argument(s)</p>
<p>The value of <i>value</i> can only be a single byte. The <i>length</i> parameter repeats that byte. (This isn't documented.) Both bytes must hence be written separately. </p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x30 value 0xa5
Cannot set EEPROM data: Invalid argument</p>
<p>This rather non-descriptive error took me quite a while to figure out. The <i>e1000e</i> kernel module included with the default kernel of Ubuntu 14.04.2 does not support writing to NVM, in this case at least. Intel has <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/network-and-i-o/ethernet-products/000005480.html">instructions</a> for compiling and installing the latest kernel module from source. Now it should work.</p>
<p>$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x30 value 0xa5
$ sudo ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x15598086 offset 0x31 value 0x14</p>
<p>And it does. Note: the LEDs remain unchanged until either the NUC is reset or the kernel module is reloaded.</p>

<p>I have not verified, but modifying NVM should also work for other OSes, unless the …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Quantization refers to techniques for performing computations and storing tensors at lower bitwidths than floating point precision. A quantized model executes some or all of the operations on tensors with integers rather than floating point values. This allows for a more compact model representation and the use of high performance vectorized operations on many hardware platforms. This technique is in particular useful at the inference time since it saves a lot of inference computation cost without sacrificing too much inference accuracies.</p>



<p>So far, major deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, have supported quantization natively. The users have been using the built-in quantization modules successfully without knowing how it works exactly. In this article, I would like to elucidate the mathematics of quantization for neural networks so that the developers would have some ideas about the quantization mechanisms.</p>

<h3 id="quantization">Quantization</h3>

<h4 id="quantization-mapping">Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>Quantization maps a floating point value $x \in [\alpha, \beta]$ to a $b$-bit integer $x_q \in [\alpha_q, \beta_q]$.</p>



<p>Mathematically, the de-quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x = c (x_q + d)\]

</p><p>and the quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{c} x - d\big)\]

</p><p>where $c$ and $d$ are variables.</p>



<p>In order to derive $c$ and $d$, we have to make sure that $\alpha$ maps to $\alpha_q$ and $\beta$ maps to $\beta_q$. So we would just have to solve the linear system</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\beta &amp;= c (\beta_q + d) \\
\alpha &amp;= c (\alpha_q + d) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The solutions is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
c &amp;= \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta_q - \alpha_q} \\
d &amp;= \frac{\alpha \beta_q - \beta \alpha_q}{\beta - \alpha} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>In practice, we would have to ensure that $0$ in floating point is represented exactly with no error after quantization.</p>



<p>Mathematically, we need to ensure</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
x_q &amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{c} 0 - d\big) \\
&amp;= \text{round}(- d) \\
&amp;= - \text{round}(d) \\
&amp;= - d \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
d &amp;= \text{round}(d) \\
&amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{\alpha \beta_q - \beta \alpha_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>By convention, we denote $c$ as the scale $s$ and $-d$ as the zero point $z$.</p>



<p>To summarize, the de-quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x = s (x_q - z)\]

</p><p>and the quantization process is defined as</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big)\]

</p><p>The value of scale $s$ and zero point $z$ are</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
s &amp;= \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta_q - \alpha_q} \\
z &amp;= \text{round}\big(\frac{\beta \alpha_q - \alpha \beta_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $z$ is an integer and $s$ is a <em>positive</em> floating point number.</p>

<h4 id="value-clipping">Value Clipping</h4>

<p>In practice, the quantization process will have chance to have $x$ that is outside the range of $[\alpha, \beta]$, thus the quantized value $x_q$ will also be outside the range of $[\alpha_q, \beta_q]$. If the integer type is signed <code>INTb</code> and $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (-2^{b-1}, 2^{b-1}-1)$, or unsigned <code>UINTb</code> and $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (0, 2^{b}-1)$, programming languages that have fixed type-precisions will clip the values that are outside the range.</p>



<p>More concretely, the quantization process will have an additional clip step.</p><p>

\[x_q = \text{clip}\Big( \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big), \alpha_q, \beta_q \Big)\]

</p><p>where $\text{clip}(x, l, u)$ function is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\text{clip}(x, l, u) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      l &amp; \text{if $x &lt; l$}\\
      x &amp; \text{if $l \leq x \leq u$}\\
      u &amp; \text{if $x &gt; u$}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="affine-quantization-mapping">Affine Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>The quantization mapping we discussed above is also called affine quantization mapping.</p>

<h4 id="scale-quantization-mapping">Scale Quantization Mapping</h4>

<p>If the integer type is signed <code>INTb</code>, $(\alpha_q, \beta_q) = (-2^{b-1} + 1, 2^{b-1}-1)$ and we force $z = 0$.</p>



<p>Mathematically, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{gather}
\alpha_q = -\beta_q \\
\text{round}\big(\frac{\beta \alpha_q - \alpha \beta_q}{\beta - \alpha}\big) = 0 \\
\end{gather}\]

</p><p>This results in $\alpha = -\beta$. Therefore, we are mapping between the floating point range $[\alpha, -\alpha]$ and the integer range $[\alpha_q, -\alpha_q]$. Because it is exactly symmetric around $0$, we also call it symmetric quantization mapping.</p>



<p>Note that scale quantization mapping is just a special case of the affine quantization mapping, and we have an unused bit in the integer range.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>The quantization function is defined as</p><p>

\[f_q(x, s, z) = \text{clip}\Big( \text{round}\big(\frac{1}{s} x + z\big), \alpha_q, \beta_q \Big)\]

</p><p>and the de-quantization function is defined as</p><p>

\[f_d(x_q, s, z) = s (x_q - z)\]

</p><h3 id="quantized-matrix-multiplication">Quantized Matrix Multiplication</h3>

<h4 id="quantized-matrix-multiplication-mathematics">Quantized Matrix Multiplication Mathematics</h4>

<p>Suppose we have to perform the matrix multiplication $Y = XW + b$, where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times p}$, $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$, and $b \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ resulting in $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
Y_{i, j} = b_j + \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{i,k} W_{k,j}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We would need to do $p$ floating number multiplications and $p$ floating number additions to compute one single entry in $Y$. To complete the full matrix multiplication, given there are $mn$ entries in $Y$, we would need to do $mpn$ floating number multiplications and $mpn$ floating number additions.</p>



<p>Depending on the floating number precision, such the speed of such floating point matrix multiplication might not be favored. So the question becomes can we complete the same matrix multiplication using quantized values.</p>



<p>Here we apply the de-quantization equation.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
Y_{i, j} &amp;= b_j + \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{i,k} W_{k,j} \\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + \sum_{k=1}^{p} s_X(X_{q,i,k} - z_X) s_W(W_{q, k,j} - z_W)\\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + s_X s_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} (X_{q,i,k} - z_X) (W_{q, k,j} - z_W)\\
&amp;= s_b (b_{q, j} - z_b) + s_X s_W \Bigg[ \bigg( \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) - \bigg( z_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} \bigg) - \bigg( z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) + p z_X z_W\Bigg]\\
&amp;= s_Y(Y_{q,i,j} - z_Y)\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $X_q$, $W_q$, $b_q$ and $Y_q$ are the quantized matrix for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively, $s_X$, $s_W$, $s_b$, and $s_Y$ are the scales for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively, and $z_X$, $z_W$, $z_b$ and $z_Y$ are the zero points for $X$, $W$, $b$ and $Y$, respectively.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[Y_{q,i,j} = z_Y + \frac{s_b}{s_Y} (b_{q, j} - z_b) + \frac{s_X s_W}{s_Y} \Bigg[ \bigg( \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) - \bigg( z_W \sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} \bigg) - \bigg( z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j} \bigg) + p z_X z_W\Bigg]\]

</p><p>Note that in the above equation the following terms are constants during inference and therefore could be computed offline before inference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>$z_Y$</li>
  <li>$\frac{s_b}{s_Y} (b_{q, j} - z_b)$</li>
  <li>$z_X \sum_{k=1}^{p} W_{q, k,j}$</li>
  <li>$p z_X z_W$</li>
</ul>

<p>Term $\sum_{k=1}^{p} X_{q,i,k} W_{q, k,j}$ suggests that we could just do the integer matrix multiplication for $X_q$ and $W_q$. Such integer matrix multiplication could employ special hardware and algorithms, such as <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensor-cores/">NVIDIA Tensor Core</a> and <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/ampere-tuning-guide/index.html#tensor-operations">Tensor Core IMMA operations</a>, and runs much faster than conventional integer matrix multiplication.</p>

    <figcaption>NVIDIA Tensor Core Operations</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>One additional thing to note is that $s_X$, $s_W$, $s_Y$, $z_X$, $z_W$, and $z_Y$ are floating point and integer constants, instead of variables. So there could be some special compile-time optimizations for those multiplications.</p>



<p>This could be retrieved from the resulting integer matrix from $X_q$ and $W_q$ multiplication, which is much faster than the floating number matrix multiplication for the same sizes.</p>



<p>The significance of such quantized matrix multiplication is that the product integer matrix could be converted back to floating point matrix using the scale and the zero point of the product integer matrix and it is almost numerically equivalent. If we have to do a sequence of matrix multiplications whose inputs and outputs are floating point numbers, for example</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
X_1 &amp;= X_0 W_0 + b_0\\
X_2 &amp;= X_1 W_1 + b_1\\
&amp;\vdots \\
X_n &amp;= X_n W_n + b_n\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We could convert the math to the followings using quantized matrices.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
X_{0, q} &amp;= f_q(X_0, s_{X_0}, z_{X_0})\\
X_{1, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{0, q}, W_{0, q}, b_{0, q}, s_{X_0}, z_{X_0}, s_{W_0}, z_{W_0}, s_{b_0}, z_{b_0}, s_{X_1}, z_{X_1}) \\
X_{2, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{1, q}, W_{1, q}, b_{1, q}, s_{X_1}, z_{X_1}, s_{W_1}, z_{W_1}, s_{b_1}, z_{b_1}, s_{X_2}, z_{X_2}) \\
&amp;\vdots \\
X_{n, q} &amp;= f_m(X_{n-1, q}, W_{n-1, q}, b_{n-1, q}, s_{X_{n-1}}, z_{X_{n-1}}, s_{W_{n-1}}, z_{W_{n-1}}, s_{b_{n-1}}, z_{b_{n-1}}, s_{X_n}, z_{X_n}) \\
X_n &amp;= f_d(X_{n, q}, s_{X_n}, z_{X_n})
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $f_q$ is the quantization function, $f_m$ is the quantized matrix multiplication function, and $f_d$ is the de-quantization function.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>

<p>In the following example, we simulated the quantization matrix multiplication of $Y = XW + b$ using random matrix $X$, $W$ and $b$.</p>

      <li>needs only <b>200 KB</b>, <b>32 KB RAM</b>, <b>40 MHz CPU</b>!</li>
      <li><b>suckless</b>, pure C, <b>no dependencies</b>, no FPU, GPU or file I/O needed</li>

      <li>completely <b>gratis</b>, without ads, DRM or similar bullshit</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This isn't a 90s style retro shooter, this <b>is</b> a 90s shooter.
    </p>

    <p>
      This game runs everywhere and adheres to great <a href="https://suckless.org/">simplicity</a>.
      It is much more efficient and portable than Doom and has completely
      <b>no dependencies</b>. Not even floating point is used, in case your
      computer doesn't have the HW unit. The game can fit into <b>200 KB</b>
      (including assets!) and can run with just <b>32 KB RAM</b>. No build system,
      library, internet connection or package manager is inherently required for
      compilation as the whole game is written in pure C language.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an experiment and art that categorically rejects capitalist
      technology.

    <span>MORE THAN A GAME</span>

    <p>
      This is not a mere entertainment or toy meant for killing time or pursuing
      low goals such as making profit or something to put on portfolio, this is
      much more. Anarch is completely <b>gratis and free as in freedom</b> and
      besides entertainment can also be used for education, research, hacking, media
      creation, as a benchmark, as a test, as an environment, as an engine, as
      a basis for something greater. You are not limited by anything, there are
      no conditions to agree to. Nothing is hidden, everything is allowed, no
      burdens are imposed. The best motivation for creating anything is only
      the <b>pure love of creation for its own sake</b>, unburdened by any other
      goal than creating something truly useful.

    <span>NO ONE OWNS THIS</span>

    <p>
      Not even I, the creator, own any part of this game.
      I&nbsp;have purposefully created everything myself from scratch,
      including the engine, graphics, sounds, music, even the font and palette,
      so that I could eventually give up all my rights and
      dedicate this game fully and <b>completely to the public domain</b>,
      to you, my dear fellow human being. No one should be allowed to own
      information and art.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've done my best to ensure this is 100% free as in freedom software and
      culture, well understandable and documented. This isn't made for any
      profit. This is made out of <b>love</b>, for you and for the greater good.

<p>I haven't written straight JavaScript in years. I use <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> for everything, including DOM manipulation, integrating with audio libraries and TensorFlow models, and using graphics libraries like <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>.

</p><p>This page explains how.

</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Go for web programming</h2>

<p>The good: Go is a great glue language, and most web programming is gluing things together. Even though Go doesn't have a complicated type system, most code I write works the first time. Go compiles to every architecture and platform that I've ever cared about, including web browsers, so I can usually reuse my packages regardless of where the code runs.

</p><p>On the other hand, the syscall/js syntax is annoyingly verbose, particularly when it comes to callbacks, and particularly when those callbacks are used with Promises. I mitigate these issues by isolating usage of syscall/js in shared packages, <a href="https://research.swtch.com/deps#abstract_the_dependency">as you might for any other dependency</a>.

</p><p>The <em>motivation</em> for me to write this article is that I feel very productive writing web sites with Go and I want to share that secret superpower with you. However, the <em>point</em> of writing this article is to make writing Go on the web easy by showing you the hard parts up front. Since I try to illustrate every roadblock with as little code as possible, it might look like Go web development is all roadblocks, but that's not true. Please don't be discouraged! It gets easier as your code base scales.

</p><h2>Scaffolding</h2>



<p>There's one entry point for the server, and one for the code that runs in the browser. It just takes these four files to get off the ground:

</p><ul>
<li>project/server/main.go
</li><li>project/server/public/index.html
</li><li>project/browser/main.go
</li><li>project/browser/generate.go (only needed for convenience)
</li></ul>

<p>Inititalize the project by running <tt>go mod init yourproject</tt> in the project/ directory. <a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">This is good Go hygeine these days</a>; it creates a file in your project directory that tracks version numbers and hashes of all your dependencies.

</p><hr>

<h3>project/server/main.go</h3>



<p>Until you add more server-side features, project/server/main.go just serves the static files in the public/ directory:

</p><pre><code>package main

import (
	"flag"
	"net/http"
)

var httpAddress = flag.String("http_address", "localhost:8080", "Address for serving HTTP")

func main() {
	http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("public")))
	http.ListenAndServe(*httpAddress, nil)
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>project/server/public/index.html</h3>



<p>index.html just needs to invoke the compiled Go code:

</p><pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;yourproject&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;script src="wasm_exec.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
if (!WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming) {
	// Polyfill, required for Safari.
	WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming = async (resp, importObject) =&gt; {
		const source = await (await resp).arrayBuffer();
		return await WebAssembly.instantiate(source, importObject);
	};
}

const go = new Go();
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("main.wasm"), go.importObject).then((result) =&gt; {
	go.run(result.instance);
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The section below about generate.go explains where wasm_exec.js and main.wasm come from.

</p><hr>

<h3>project/browser/main.go</h3>

<p>This is the entry-point for the Go code that runs in the browser, including some examples of how to access global JavaScript objects (which is the same for <tt>document.body</tt> and the rest of the DOM):

</p><pre><code>// +build js,wasm

package main

import (
	"syscall/js"
)

func main() {
	js.Global().Get("console").Call("log", "Hello, World!")

	var cb js.Func
	cb = js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
		js.Global().Call("alert", "Hello, World!")
		cb.Release()
		return nil
	})
	js.Global().Call("setTimeout", cb, 2000)

	&lt;-(make(chan bool))
}</code></pre>

<p>I told you the syscall/js syntax was awful.

</p><p>I end with <tt>&lt;-(make(chan bool))</tt> because otherwise, the Go program exits, and any DOM callbacks you've registered (click handlers, timers, etc) that call into Go code will fail.

</p><hr>

<h3>project/browser/generate.go</h3>

<p>index.html refers to two files that you don't write by hand: wasm_exec.js ships with Go, and main.wasm is compiled from project/browser/main.go.

</p>

<p>I put <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generate">go:generate</a> directives in generate.go, which allows you to run <tt>go generate</tt> to put both files into the public/ directory:

</p><pre><code>package main

//go:generate cp $GOROOT/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js ../server/public/
//go:generate env GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o ../server/public/main.wasm</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Start the server in one terminal:

</p><pre><code>$ cd project/server/
$ go run main.go</code></pre>



<p>Re-compile the code that runs in the browser whenever you make a change:

</p><pre><code>$ cd project/browser/
$ go generate</code></pre>

<p>View your new, fancy web site by visiting <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/</a>

</p><h2>Miscellaneous notes</h2>

<h3><tt>foo == null</tt></h3>

<p>When I wrote JavaScript, I avoided having to care about the difference between JavaScript's <tt>null</tt> and <tt>undefined</tt> by always coercing them to the same value with <tt>==</tt>. For example, <tt>foo == null</tt> is true regardless of whether foo is <tt>null</tt> or <tt>undefined</tt>.

</p><p>That option isn't available with Go's <tt>js.Null()</tt> and <tt>js.Undefined()</tt>, so be prepared to care about the difference, or write a helper.

</p><h3>Promises and async functions</h3>

<p>As you saw above, Go functions that are used as JavaScript callbacks are not automatically garbage-collected and have elaborate syntax. That makes Promises and <tt>async</tt> functions hard to deal with.

</p>

<p>So I use this helper to convert Promises to idiomatic Go return values:

</p><pre><code>func UnwrapPromise(promise js.Value) (js.Value, error) {
	retc := make(chan js.Value)
	errc := make(chan error)

	var release func()
	success := js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
		retc &lt;- args[0]
		release()
		return nil
	})
	failure := js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
		errc &lt;- fmt.Errorf("%v", args[0])
		release()
		return nil
	})
	release = func() {
		success.Release()
		failure.Release()
	}

	promise.Call("then", success).Call("catch", failure)
	select {
	case ret := &lt;-retc:
		return ret, nil
	case err := &lt;-errc:
		return js.Undefined(), err
	}
}</code></pre>

									<p><span>Founders and co-founders alike are the foundation of any startup.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“You can always change the idea you are working on, but it’s much harder to get rid of a cofounder. So you want to choose cofounders very carefully.” — Jessica Livingston</span></p>
<p><span>This person should be someone you know. You’ve already worked with this person. You know they are effective, reliable, and share similar ambitions/moral outlooks as you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Jessica suggests that these 3 qualities should make up the founding team as a whole:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b><i>Determination</i></b><span>: “Startups are really hard and take a really long time. There has to be at least one founder who’s just a tower of strength. Part of being determined is being able to withstand rejection. People will think your idea is lame, customers won’t be interested, investors will say no, reporters won’t care. And they might not be polite about it either. But you can’t let rejection discourage you.” — Jessica Livingston</span></li>
<li><b><i>Domain expertise</i></b><span>: “At least one of the founders should be an expert in what you’re working on” — Jessica Livingston</span></li>
<li><b><i>Ability/willingness to sell</i></b><span>: “Someone has to be the face of the company—to sell the product to customers, and sell the company itself to investors, the press, and potential hires. At least one of you is going to have to sell.” — Jessica Livingston</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>If you know you want to start a startup one day, but you’re not ready now, start working on smaller projects with friends or potential future co-founders. You’ll be able to filter out who fits the criteria above vs. who doesn’t.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“A good way to ensure that you make something people want is to make something you yourself want. But remember that making something for yourself is just a heuristic to guide you in finding an idea. In the actual execution, you need to focus on users. You need to understand what they want, and be fanatically dedicated to making them happy. One very important piece of advice we give startups is to ‘do things that don’t scale.’ That means to do so much for your early users that you couldn’t possibly keep doing that much if you were bigger.” — Jessica Livingston</span></p>
<p><span>All in all, Jessica finishes with “if you can make something people want, if you can focus on delighting users, and you measure how much you delight them in revenue, then you can start a startup. That’s the standard to hold yourself to, not the stock character founder you see in the press.”</span></p>

								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: A thing that I’ve somewhat figured out is that there’s no secret playbook for building a company. There are obviously certain things you need to know (that I’m still figuring out), but it seems to essentially boil down to Jessica’s final quote above. </span></p>

                                <p>Loblaw Companies Ltd. plans to roll out its first autonomous delivery service in January, as Canada's largest retailer explores new ways of shipping goods to customers amid a broad increase in online shopping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loblaw partnered with Palo Alto, Calif.-based software startup Gatik AI for the delivery service. Gatik, which also has offices in Toronto, was founded in 2017 and focuses on the "middle mile" of logistics where it hauls goods over short distances for retailers and distributors. The company raised $4.5 million in seed funding in 2018 and counts Walmart Inc. as a customer in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loblaw said the new service includes five Ford Transit 350 box trucks outfitted with Gatik's self-driving system, which will drive on five fixed routes across the Toronto area for seven days a week, 12 hours a day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vehicles will provide a contactless delivery solution for transporting goods from Loblawâ€™s automated picking facility to retail locations, the retailer said.</p>

<p>"As more Canadians are turning to online grocery shopping, we need to continue to identify new ways to make our supply chain more efficient," said Lauren Steinberg, senior vice president of Loblaw Digital, in a phone interview. "And 'middle mile' autonomous delivery is a great example of one way we think we can achieve that."</p>

<p>While the number of autonomous trucks remains small in the U.S. and Canada, they have the potential to radically disrupt how merchandise is moved. A 2018 report by McKinsey &amp; Co. found that if trucking companies shifted entirely to autonomous vehicles, it would help cut operating costs by 45 per cent, saving the industry as much as US$125 billion a year.</p>

<p>Loblaw said earlier this month its e-commerce sales climbed 175 per cent in the third quarter, driven by shoppers turning to online shopping to avoid physical bricks-and-mortar stores during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To abide by Canadian regulations, all of Loblaw's self-driving trucks will have a safety driver as a co-pilot. It marks the first autonomous delivery fleet in commercial operation in Canada, according to Gatik.</p>

<p>Steinberg said Loblaw began talks with Gatik for about a year before launching the service, which is expected to handle about 1,000 orders a day. The pilot program will operate for two years, after which Loblaw will determine whether it will expand the service.</p>

<p>"To move these orders autonomously helps us get them there faster, more frequently, and keep up with the increase in demand that we're seeing in the online grocery space generally," Steinberg said.</p>

<p>Oshoma Momoh, chief technical advisor at MaRS Discovery District, said that it should take another seven to 10 years for vehicles to operate fully autonomously and without the need for a safety pilot on Canadian roads. But until then, any driverless cars on the road will be able to collect valuable data on a variety of weather and traffic conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The way all of this works is that companies build up more common use cases or examples of how driving works in real life, and train their software to become more self-sufficient," Momoh said in a phone interview.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Editor's Note: A previous version of this story&nbsp;included incorrect information about when&nbsp;the service would begin. BNN Bloomberg regrets this error.&nbsp;</em></p>

<![CDATA[Guide to OOMKill Alerting in Kubernetes Clusters]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <span>Monday 23 Nov 2020, 18:30</span> <h2>Intro</h2> <p>RAM is most likely the scarcest resource that is first exhausted on your servers. If you’re serious about running software under Linux/Unix, you’re certainly aware of what an OOMKill is.</p> <p>Short refresher: when a program requests a new memory page from the kernel two things can happen.</p> <ul><li>There is a free memory page: The kernel page assigns the page to the process and everything is great.</li> <li>The system is Out Of Memory (OOM): The kernel chooses a process based on its ‘badness’ (mainly by how much ram it uses). It sends a SIGKILL to the process. This forces the receiving process to exit with exit code <code>137</code>. All the memory pages belonging to that process are free and now the kernel can fulfill the memory request.</li></ul> <p>Lately, I had a task to add alerting to a sizeable Kubernetes cluster. The cluster has ~100 active Deployments with autoscaling of nodes up to ~50 nodes at peak times. The cluster is well maintained and has a robust autoscaling strategy. All deployments have resource limits defined. Sometimes, some of the deployed pods would breach the memory limits. In those cases, it would be nice to find out when that happens and investigate the cause of it.</p> <p>Prometheus and Alertmanager were already deployed. So I’ve thought that alerting on OOMKills will be as easy. I just had to find the right metric(s) indicating that OOMKill has happened and write an alerting rule for it. Given the length of this post, you could imagine how wrong I was!</p> <h2>First Attempt</h2> <p>A brief Google search has led me to the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/master/docs/pod-metrics.md" rel="nofollow">kube pod state metric</a>. It turns out it has a metric called <code>kube_pod_container_status_last_terminated_reason</code>. The value of the metric is <code>1</code> when a container in a pod has terminated with an error. Based on the exit code, the <code>reason</code> label will be set to <code>OOMKilled</code> if the exit code was <code>137</code>. That sounded promising! So I’ve created an alert for that.</p> <p>As usual, things are rarely straightforward. As soon as the container restarts, the value of this metric will be <code>1</code>. For alerting purposes, one has to combine it with another metric that will change when a pod restarts. <code>kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total</code> does that. Combine the two - and Bingo! It Worked!</p> <h2>“Invisible” OOMKills</h2> <p>For a brief moment, I’ve thought that I was done. I was about to declare victory over OOMKills in production! But then a puzzle came my way: One of our software developers has come forward. He claimed that one of his pods was running out of memory and he couldn’t see any alerts for it.</p> <p>At first, I wasn’t inclined to believe that his diagnosis of running out of memory was correct. Mainly because his Pod didn’t even restart! But then I looked at the graph of the memory use of the Pod. It did show the usual pattern: Memory usage would grow, reach its peak at the memory limit, and then suddenly drop.</p> <p>I’ve asked the developer for the gory details of the implementation. It turned out that the init process in the container would start a child process and wait for the result of it. If the child process would exit with an error, it would return an error to the requester and not terminate (because - why should it?).</p> <p>That is when it dawned to me - my alerting is effective only if container exits. This is usually the case when the init process of the container is OOMKilled. But there is no guarantee this will happen if a child of the init is OOMKilled. In the case where the container’s init tries to handle OOMKill by itself, my alerting is not triggering!</p> <h2>Trying the Existing Solutions</h2> <p>Given that OOMKills are as old as Unix, I thought: surely someone will have a solution for this already.</p> <p>I’ve ensued onto a frantic search for some kind of metric exporter for this. I just needed the number of OOMKill events in a pod, or at least in a Docker container. Here is what I’ve found:</p> <h3>cAdvisor</h3> <p>My first stop was cAdvisor itself. It turns out that cAdvisor is <a href="https://github.com/google/cadvisor/issues/1837" rel="nofollow">getting the OOMKill events, but not exporting them as a Prometheus metric and no one really seems to care.</a> So that was a dead-end.</p> <h3>kubernetes-oomkill-exporter</h3> <p>My second stop was <a href="https://github.com/sapcc/kubernetes-oomkill-exporter" rel="nofollow">kubernetes-oomkill-exporter</a>. A very promising-sounding project with two huge disadvantages:</p> <ul><li>There is really no documentation for it, literally anywhere.</li> <li>It does not work.</li></ul> <p>I’ve tried the latest version of <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/sapcc/kubernetes-oomkill-exporter/0.3.0/images/sha256-b80875b903635f0336ea0b122b332e086da51ec5cd797de5d682dd14c3910b9f?context=explore" rel="nofollow">the Docker image</a>, but once started it crashes and burns with:</p> <pre><code>standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"</code></pre> <p>Going <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/sapcc/kubernetes-oomkill-exporter/0.2.0/images/sha256-5e1b57f4ac0b57406ef067da3e83f743d70ff89aa1db717d41af2c699dc12f3a?context=explore" rel="nofollow">back one minor version</a> one gets the following output:</p> <pre><code>F1120 22:04:21.571246       1 main.go:73] Could not create log watcher
I1120 22:04:21.572066       1 main.go:64] Starting prometheus metrics</code></pre> <p>As it seems no one has committed any code to in over a year. It has a low number of stars (14). All that meant that I was back to square one.</p> <h2>Rolling my Own: <code>missing-container-metrics</code></h2> <p>Having a hard time finding an existing solution meant only one thing: I will have to write my own.</p> <p>A cursory look at <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/" rel="nofollow">Docker’s events</a> delivered everything I needed. There is an event called <code>oom</code>. Docker emits this event every time the OOMKiller process gets active in the container. Now I was only missing a piece of code that will listen to those events and export them as Prometheus metrics.</p> <p>This is how <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics" rel="nofollow">missing-container-metrics</a> was born. What it does is to connect to a local Docker instance (via <code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>). It lists all existing containers as a starting point. And then it listens to Docker events. Using those events, it keeps track of the currently running containers. It also gathers the basic stats of each container it knows about:</p> <ul><li>Number of restarts</li> <li>Last exit code</li> <li>Number of OOMKills</li></ul> <p>By design, it is not Kubernetes specific. This means it can be used with a plain Docker. But it also has a couple of very convenient Kubernetes specific features.</p> <p>Whenever it finds a container label for the pod name or namespace, it adds them as a label to the exported metrics. Also, label naming is compatible with <code>kube-state-metrics</code>.</p> <p>This keeps things simple for metric joins in PromQL.</p> <h2>Running it in the Cluster</h2> <p>In a Kubernetes cluster, <code>missing-container-metrics</code> needs to run on every node. The simplest way to achieve this is to use a daemon-set. The source code comes with an example <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics#kubernetes" rel="nofollow">daemon set</a> deployment.</p> <h2>An Interesting Find Using <code>missing-container-metrics</code></h2> <p>The most interesting issue I’ve found was where I’ve least expected it: Fluentd!</p> <p>Fluentd log forwarder for node/pod/kubelet logs to the log aggregator. When the volume of logs was very high, Fluentd is OOMKilled.</p> <p>Looking at the details of how Fluentd works, it becomes clear what is going on.</p> <p>Fluentd has one main process (that ends up being init process in the container). This main process forks a worker process that forwards the logs. When the worker process dies for some reason (for example OOMKill), the main process starts a new one. This leads to an endless loop of spawn/OOMKill.</p> <p>The fact that Fluentd is the log forwarder is very unfortunate. OOMKill loop would stop the log forwarding, so you could not ‘see’ what is going on by inspecting the logs.</p> <h2>Epilogue</h2> <p>If you want to make sure that your Kubernetes cluster is healthy, it is essential to alert on OOMKills. This enables you to know when processes hit their memory limits. Be it because of memory leaks or wrongly configured memory limits.</p> <p>It turns out that monitoring for OOMKills in Kubernetes is not as an easy task as one might think. Using <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics" rel="nofollow">missing-container-metrics</a> makes it much easier though.</p> <p>So go ahead, deploy <a href="https://github.com/draganm/missing-container-metrics" rel="nofollow">missing-container-metrics</a> to your cluster. You might be surprised how many of OOMKills you have not been noticing.</p> <p>I hope that it will be useful to you, and will save you the time that I’ve spent searching for the solution.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>Thermodynamics is really weird. Most people have probably encountered a bad explanation of the basics at some point in school, but probably don’t remember more than</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy is conserved</li>
<li>Entropy increases</li>
<li>There’s something called the ideal gas law/ideal gas equation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy conservation is not very mysterious. Apart from some weirdness around defining energy in general, it’s just a thing you can prove from whatever laws of motion you’re using.</p>
<p>But <em>entropy</em> is very weird. You’ve heard that it measures “disorder” in some vague sense.
Maybe you’ve heard that it’s connected to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy%5F(information%5Ftheory)">Shannon entropy</a> of a probability distribution \(H(p) = \sum_x - p(x)\ln p(x)\).
Probably the weirdest thing about it is the law it obeys: It’s not conserved, but rather it <em>increases</em> with time.
This is more or less the only law like that in physics.</p>
<p>It gets even weirder when you consider that at least classical Newtonian physics is <em>time-symmetric</em>.
Roughly speaking, this means if you have a movie of things interacting under the laws of Newton, and you play it backwards, they’re still obeying the laws of Newton. An orbiting moon just looks like it’s orbiting in the other direction, which is perfectly consistent. A stone which is falling towards earth and accelerating looks like it’s flying away from earth and decelerating - exactly as gravity is supposed to do.</p>
<p>But if there’s some “entropy” quality out there that only increases, then that’s obviously impossible! When you played the movie backwards, you’d be able to tell that entropy was decreasing, and if entropy always increases, some law is being violated.
So what, is entropy some artefact of quantum mechanics? No, as it turns out. Entropy is an artefact of the fact that you can’t measure all the particles in the universe at once. And the fact that it seems to always increase is a consequence of the fact that matter is stable at large scales.</p>
<p>The points in this post are largely from E.T. Jaynes' <a href="https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/macroscopic.prediction.pdf">Macroscopic Prediction</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-proof-that-entropy-doesn-t-always-increase">A proof that entropy doesn’t always increase</h2>
<p>Let \(X\) be the set of states of some physical system. Here I will assume that there is a finite number of states and time advances in discrete steps - there is some function \(T: X \to X\) which steps time forward one step. We assume that these dynamics are time-reversible in the weak sense that \(T\) is a bijection - every state is the future of exactly one “past” state.
Let \(S: X \to \mathbb{R}\) be some function. Assume \(S(x) \leq S(Tx)\) - in other words, \(S\) can never decrease.
Then \(S\) is constant, i.e \(S(x) = S(Tx)\).</p>
<p>Proof: Assume for contradiction \(S(x) &lt; S(Tx)\) for some \(x\). Since \(X\) is finite, let \(\sum_x S(x)\) be the sum of \(S\) over all states. Then clearly \(\sum_x S(x) = \sum_x S(Tx)\), since \(Tx\) just ranges over all the \(x\)s.
But on the other hand, we have \(S(x) \leq S(Tx)\) for all \(x\), and \(S(x) &lt; S(Tx)\) in at least one case. So we must have \(\sum_x S(x) &lt; \sum_x S(Tx)\) - contradiction.</p>
<p>This proof can be generalized to the continuous time and space case without too much trouble, for the types of dynamics that actually show up in physics (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s%5Ftheorem%5F(Hamiltonian)">Liouville’s Theorem</a>). The proof above still requires a <em>bounded</em> phase volume (corresponding to the finiteness of \(X\)). To generalize to other situations we need some more assumptions - the easiest thing is to assume that the dynamics are time-reversible in a stronger sense, and that this is compatible with the entropy in some way.</p>
<p>(You can find easy counterexamples in general, e.g. if \(X=\mathbb{Z}\) and the dynamics are \(T(x) = x+1\), then obviously we really do have that \(S(x) =x\) is increasing. Nothing to do about that.)</p>
<p>Anyways the bounded/finite versions of the theorems do hold for a toy thermodynamic system like particles in a (finite) box - here the phase volume really is bounded.</p>
<h2 id="the-true-meaning-of-entropy">The true meaning of entropy</h2>
<p>Okay, so what the hell is going on? Did your high school physics textbook lie to you about this?
Well, yes. But you’re probably never going to observe entropy going down in your life, so you can maybe rest easy.</p>
<p>Let \(X\) be the physical system under consideration again. But suppose now that we can’t observe \(x \in X\), but only some “high-level description \(p(x) \in Y\). Maybe \(x\) is the total microscopic state of every particle in a cloud of gas - their position and momentum - while \(p(x)\) is just the average energy of the particles (roughly corresponding to the temperature).
\(x\) is called a <em>microstate</em> and \(y = p(x)\) is called a <em>macrostate</em>.
Then the <em>entropy</em> of \(y \in Y\) is \(S(y) = \ln (p^{-1}(\{y\})\) - the logarithm of the number of microstates \(x\) where \(p(x) = y\). We say these are the microstates that <em>realize</em> the macrostate \(y\).</p>
<p>The connection with Shannon entropy is now that this is exactly the Shannon entropy of the uniform distribution over \(p^{-1}(y)\). This is the distribution you should have over microstates if you know nothing except the microstate.
In other words, the entropy measures your uncertainty about the microstate given that you know nothing except the macrostate.</p>
<p>There are more sophisticated versions of this definition in general, to account for the fact that</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, your microstates are probably sets of real numbers, and there are probably infinitely many compatible with the macrostate, so we need a notion of “continuous entropy” (usually called differential entropy, I think)</li>
<li>Your measurement of the macrostate is probably not that certain (but this turns out to matter surprisingly little for thermodynamic systems),</li>
</ul>
<p>but this is the basic gist.</p>
<h2 id="why-entropy-usually-goes-up">Why entropy usually goes up</h2>
<p>Okay, so why does entropy go up?
<em>Because there are more high-entropy states than low-entropy states</em>. That’s what entropy <em>means</em>.
If you don’t know anything about what’s gonna happen to \(x\) (in reality, you usually understand the dynamics \(T\) themselves, but have absolutely no information about \(x\) except the macrostate), it’s more likely that it will transfer to a macrostate with a higher number of representatives than to one with a low number of representatives.</p>
<p>This also lets us defuse our paradox from above. In reality, entropy doesn’t go down for literally every microstate \(x\).
It’s not true that \(S(p(Tx)) &gt; S(p(x))\) for all \(x\) - I proved that impossible above.
What <em>can</em> be true is this: given a certain macrostate, it’s more probable that entropy increases than that it decreases.</p>
<p>We can consider an extreme example where we have two macrostates \(L\) and \(H\), corresponding to low and high entropy.
Clearly the number of low-entropy states that go to a high-entropy state is exactly the same as the number of high-entropy states that go to a low-entropy state. That’s combinatorics.
But the <em>fraction</em> of low-entropy states that go to high-entropy is then necessarily larger than the fraction of high-entropy states that go to low-entropy states.</p>
<p>In other words, \(P(H(x_{t+1})|L(x_t)) &gt; P(L(x_{t+1})|H(x_t))\)</p>
<h2 id="why-entropy--almost--always-goes-up">Why entropy (almost) always goes up</h2>
<p>Okay, but that’s a lot weaker than “entropy always increases”! How do we get from here to there?
I could say some handwavy stuff here about how the properties of thermodynamic systems mean that the differences in the number of representatives between high-entropy and low-entropy states are massive - and that means the right-hand probability above can’t possibly be non-neglible. And that in general this works out so that entropy is almost guaranteed to increase.</p>
<p>But that’s very unsatisfying. It just happened to work out that way? I have a much more satisfying answer: entropy almost always increases because matter is stable at large scales.</p>
<p>Wait, what? What does that mean?</p>
<p>By “matter is stable at large scales”, I mean that the macroscopic behaviour of matter is predictable only from macroscopic observations. When a bricklayer builds a house, they don’t first go over them with a microscope to make sure the microstate of the brick isn’t going to surprise us later. And as long as we know the temperature and pressure of a gas, we can pretty much predict what will happen if we compress it with a piston.</p>
<p>What this means is that, if \(p(x) = p(x')\), then <em>with extremely high probability</em>, \(p(Tx) = p(Tx')\). It might not be literally certain, but it’s sure enough.</p>
<p>Now, let’s say we’re in the macrostate \(y\). Then there is some macrostate \(y'\) which is <em>extremely likely</em> to be the next one. For very nearly all \(x\) so that \(p(x) = y\), we have \(p(Tx) = y'\).
But this means that \(y'\) must have at least that many microstates representing it, since \(T\) is a bijection.
So the entropy of \(y'\) can at most be a <em>tiny</em> bit smaller than the entropy of \(y\) - this difference would be as tiny as the fraction of \(x\) with \(p(Tx) \neq y'\), so we can ignore it.</p>
<p>So unless something super unlikely happens and \(p(Tx) \neq y'\), entropy goes up.</p>
<p>By the way, this also explains what goes wrong with time-reversibility, and why in reality, you can easily tell that a video is going backwards. The “highly probably dynamics” \(Y \to Y\), which takes each macrostate the the most probable next state, don’t have to be time-reversible. For instance, let’s return to the two-macrostate system above.
Suppose that with 100% certainty, low-entropy states become high-entropy.
Let there be \(N_L\) low-entropy states and \(N_H\) high-entropy states.
Then, just because \(T\) is a bijection, there must be \(N_L\) high-entropy states that become low-entropy.
Now if \(N_H \gg N_L\), then practically all high-entropy states go to other high-entropy states.
So \(L \mapsto H\) but \(H \mapsto H\).</p>
<p>Of course in reality, if you start with a low-entropy state and watch this unfold for a <em>really</em> long time, you’ll eventually see it become a low-entropy state again. It’s just extremely unlikely to happen in a short amount of time.</p>
<h2 id="entropy-is-not-exactly-your-uncertainty-about-the-microstate">Entropy is not exactly your uncertainty about the microstate</h2>
<p>The entropy of a given macrostate is the uncertainty …</p></main></div></div>

                    <h2 id="ux-behavioral-economics">UX &amp; Behavioral Economics</h2><p>No matter how mature your digital platform is, there's always space for improvement. We've talked plenty about UX on this blog, understanding it as designing based on your users' insights. However, it's important to <strong>complement UX with behavioral science.</strong> This is a series of insights about human behavior that are <strong>true of all users.</strong> In the following blog posts, I'll reveal some behavioral insights that might help boost your conversions... <strong>Let's start with the first one: scarcity.</strong></p><h2 id="scarcity-motivates-conversions">Scarcity Motivates Conversions</h2><figure><img src="https://lightit.io/blog/content/images/2020/11/image.png" alt="Scarcity example booking"></figure><p>Have you ever booked a hotel on Booking? If you did, it would probably be easy for you to understand the scarcity heuristic.</p><p>Scarcity is<strong> </strong>the event where a product/service is perceived as more attractive because it's presented as limited in availability. Limitation gives people a sense of quality, exclusivity and even gives them the famous FOMO (fear of missing out) on a great product or discount. <strong>The scarcity heuristic can be used to pressure people into taking action</strong></p><p>Booking's example is pretty straightforward. While you're making your reservation, Booking tells you <strong>how many rooms are still available</strong> and even the <strong>number of people that are looking at the hotel simultaneously</strong> as you (and might steal the room you wish!) This last one isn't only a scarcity strategy, but also a social norm we'll look into in the next blog post. This information pressures people into reserving quickly before the other people book the last room.</p><p>I'm not saying Booking's strategy is effective (personally, I believe it's a little exaggerated to the point it looks fake). Still, it's a clear example of using scarcity to <strong>rush customers to make their decision</strong>. </p><p>Another famous example is from a grocery store in Iowa that did an exciting experiment with the discount they offered for Campbell's soups. They always provided the same discount, though some days, they hanged a sign next to the cans that read "Limit 12 Per Person", while other days they didn't have a limit. Take a look at these impressive results.<strong> Customers bought 7 cans on average when the limit was imposed, compared to an average of 3 cans on days with no limit.</strong></p><h3 id="so-how-can-i-take-this-to-my-digital-platform"><br>So... how can I take this to my digital platform?</h3><p>There are several strategies you might try; the key is on<strong> trying different alternatives and tracking down the metrics</strong> so that you figure out which one works. <strong>Remember not to over-do it</strong>; no one trusts sites with discounts and deals that last forever. The typical "subscribe now and get 20% off on your first order" isn't that attractive if it has no time limit. Though, if it has, it might motivate people to make up their minds faster. Benefits must be perceived "here and now" to be more valuable.</p><figure><img src="https://lightit.io/blog/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png" alt="Amazon scarcity example"></figure><p>Bear in mind these strategies aren't only useful for e-commerces, they can be used for other business models too. For example on social networks or communities, creating <strong>waiting lists, deadlines, asking for qualifications to join or limiting invites </strong>can really boost interest by giving a sense of &nbsp;<strong>exclusivity</strong> and FOMO. It's no news that exclusive things are more attractive... but have you ever wondered what came first? Attractiveness or exclusivity?</p><hr><p><strong>Stay tuned for the next post of this collection, </strong>Insights on Behavioral Economics to Improve Your Platform's Results. <strong>Part 2: Social Norms. </strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Subscribe to our newsletter &amp; follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/lightit//" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>.</p>

                    <p>For the last 60 years, we’ve seen consistently low productivity growth rates in the US and across the Western world. Meanwhile, recent scientific discoveries seem to be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">less fundamental</a> to our understanding of the world than previous breakthroughs have been. While the growth of digital technology has been tremendous since the 1990s, it’s the only significant part of our world that seems to have been changing. To look up from our smartphones is to see a physical environment that looks basically the same as it did in 1970. Innovation has been constrained to the world of bits and left the world of atoms mostly untouched.</p><p>This might finally be changing. Last month, the economist Tyler Cowen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-05/how-much-worse-can-things-get-that-question-may-be-a-good-sign">speculated</a> that we may be seeing signs that this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-eSpecial-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Great Stagnation</a> is ending. Since his article was published, we’ve already seen almost a dozen announcements that have only driven home the point further. There seem to be cracks in the Great Stagnation and light is peaking through on the other end. </p><p><strong>Innovation in the physical world</strong><br>Most obviously, the recent announcement of the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/">successful development of several vaccines</a> to the novel coronavirus are a sign that America (with some help from Germany) is still capable of achieving Big Things when we are pushed to it. Despite consistent failings of the US regulatory state in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/14/a-failure-but-not-of-prediction/">delaying the adoption</a> of face masks and in <a href="https://thedispatch.com/p/timeline-the-regulationsand-regulatorsthat">slowing the rollout</a> of mass testing, the US essentially bet the farm that our strong biotech clusters would be able to create a vaccine to a new disease in record time, and it looks like we’re going to be able to do it in under a year! </p><p>It’s worth highlighting just how speedy this development timeline is when compared to the vaccines for diseases like polio and measles. </p><figure><img src="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1000w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination</figcaption></figure><p>And not only did we develop a new vaccine, we developed a new *type* of vaccine. mRNA vaccines have long been speculated to work, but this is the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-showing-potential-success-of-mrna-platform-a-first/">first instance</a> of a successful vaccine application in humans using this technique. </p><p>In transportation, the promise of driverless cars has long been a centerpiece for a tech-optimistic vision of safer roads, better-designed cities, and eliminating the drudgery of a morning commute through traffic. But the technical delays of the last few years (when compared to the most optimistic timelines) have become a rallying cry for the <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/05/28/ai-winter-is-well-on-its-way/">tech-skeptic</a> as well. </p><p>It seems like they may finally be getting here. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/waymo-finally-launches-an-actual-public-driverless-taxi-service/">Waymo announced</a> that their long-running pilot program in Arizona is going to be open to the public <a href="https://twitter.com/jjricks_/status/1316318196375330816">without any safety driver</a> in the front seat. Days later, Elon Musk and Tesla rolled out a new self-driving beta program. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These two guys used a drone to make a video of Tesla's new "full self-driving" software in action.

</figure><p>This is a remarkable engineering feat, especially on Waymo’s end. It shows the company can successfully lead product development in an industry that relies on more stringent safety-critical engineering instead of the release-and-iterate model that its parent company grew up with. Waymo is evidence that Silicon Valley can “move at a moderate pace and not break things” when it needs to.</p><p>Granted, it’s unclear how long until and at what pace deployment of AVs to the rest of the country and the world will happen. If the Waymo model looks to be successful, it will be a steady, resource-intensive process of region-by-region expansion as the cars learn to handle new operational design domains and are rigorously validated in each city before the keys are turned over to the AI. In other words, expansion could look more like a cell phone coverage map than a software update that is instantaneously available everywhere. </p><p>But still, this is a significant, tangible mile marker that the industry has passed. AVs are operating in the wild now. We get to talk about *when* we reach the driverless future, not *if*. </p><p>In addition to the almost ho-hum daily progress in solar, wind, and battery technology where prices have fallen <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what">90</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=491f10ec2c84">70</a>, and <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-fall-as-market-ramps-up-with-market-average-at-156-kwh-in-2019">87</a> percent over the last ten years, we’ve also started to hear very promising reports about the development of more fundamental breakthroughs. The NYT reports that a compact nuclear fusion reactor is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/climate/nuclear-fusion-reactor.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Very Likely to Work</a>” after a major theoretical advancement. There was also a fantastic David Robert’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">deep dive into geothermal energy</a> and the promise of advanced geothermal (whereby water pumped into the ground through a closed loop reaches a high enough temperature that it becomes “supercritical” and can carry 10x more energy per unit mass), in particular. Either technology, if perfected, would provide abundant, zero-carbon, baseload energy that is available anywhere around the world. </p><p>Cowen mentions briefly the huge market growth we’ve seen in lab-grown meat and plant-based alternatives. A few weeks ago it was announced that Impossible Foods, one of the largest actors in the industry is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/20/impossible-foods-will-double-rd-to-eliminate-animal-farming/">doubling their R&amp;D team</a> as they seek to take on plant-based milk, steak, and fish as well as improve the supply chains for plant proteins. In tandem, McDonald’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/11/10/mcdonalds-mcplant-sandwich/">just announced</a> that in 2021 they are going to be testing out a new McPlant menu.</p><p><strong>Digital innovation continues apace</strong></p><p>Not to be left out, in the digital world we’ve been seeing impressive progress as well. AI techniques like deepfakes which have been heralded as the <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/deepfakes-destroy-democracy">death knell for democracy</a> are now being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/nvidia-used-neural-networks-to-improve-video-calling-bandwidth-by-10x/">deployed by NVIDIA</a> to increase video fidelity while cutting bandwidth transmission for video calls by a factor of 10. In general, techniques to reduce bandwidth use are greatly underrated, and it’s going to be exciting to see the ways in which smarter compression can perhaps bring similar efficiency gains across the board. </p><p>And now factor in the steady rollout of 5G network technologies which promise to increase the raw bandwidth available to all mobile devices. With the combination of smarter compression and vastly increased bandwidth we could be looking at a baseline 50x increase in network capacity over the next decade. It’s hard to predict ahead of time what new applications will be enabled by all this new capacity, but in retrospect it could look like another example of <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/how-bubbles-and-megaprojects-parallelize">parallel innovation</a> that both enables and is driven by the growth of VR/AR, driverless vehicles, and telehealth.*</p><p><em>*For those who are skeptical that increased capacity will generate new applications because a few cities have tried gigabit broadband<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/faster-internet-not-worth-it/"> without much effect</a>, I would argue that both hardware and app developers are optimizing for the baseline user experience and we won’t see a ton of investment in new applications until we’ve changed the baseline capacity that developers can expect a sizeable user base to have. </em></p><p>Equally as impressive, Apple’s new M1 chip that was launched on November 10th seems to have taken the world by storm. As John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs">summarizes</a>: “To acknowledge how good they are — and I am here to tell you they are astonishingly good — you must acknowledge that certain longstanding assumptions about how computers should be designed, about what makes a better computer better, about what good computers need, are wrong.” Just as interesting is <a href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/what-is-the-apple-m1-chip-613935ea0903">how they did it</a>. By miniaturizing the whole system architecture and integrating it onto a single chip (no discrete RAM, graphics card, etc.) Apple has managed to pump out massive efficiency gains both in processing power and in battery life. (There’s perhaps a metaphor here for the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/breaking-up-big-tech-is-hard-to-do-1532290123">value of integration</a> for large tech firms as well…)</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tXP4ZnW93TIsJ_dJe3NVmevfz5eMUnNC6CS40Dz_S0568BDiQKr8K8LqT5Ja-kLnXUKnS1UkDQf_6WYzBhfGa4c99lQDfqudhQaDF-XCYBEkxNoP3Vo3FlGtLl3sGFQcdtHBlGbv" alt=""><figcaption>https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the virtual reality space has seen its most impressive entrant in years with the arrival of the Quest 2 from Facebook on October 13th. There is no VR headset that matches it on a performance/cost basis, and the relative simplicity and elegance of the system makes it an ideal entry point. The deliberately low entry barrier of $299 is meant to entice a large enough user base that it kickstarts the virtuous cycle of having a significant enough market for dedicated VR developers to make significant investments in new applications, which then drives new user growth. Facebook believes we finally have a minimum viable product for VR that means this kind of two-sided market is possible, and it is betting billions of dollars to make it happen. Early signs seem to show that it is working as intended with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541535/oculus-quest-2-preorders-sales-developers-zuckerberg">pre-orders reportedly 5x</a> larger than the original Quest, popular applications like Beat Saber seeing record growth, and all this with the upcoming holiday rush and a massive advertising blitz to come. </p><p>Notably, all of these announcements/developments I’ve outlined have occurred in just the last few months. This is by no means a comprehensive look at the exciting progress being made in many other fields. But the sheer scope and pace of tangible changes to our physical and digital words is something to be excited about.</p><p><strong>A few caveats </strong></p><p>Some of these innovations will boost productivity in the traditional ways that show up in economic growth statistics. We should strive for and celebrate those achievements. But some of these innovations won’t necessarily, instead they make human civilization more durable and sustainable in a variety of ways. In response, we should start to think of increased sustainability as a type of productivity. </p><p>A vaccine to the COVID pandemic is the most obvious example. While economic statistics won’t show a boost in productivity compared to the pre-COVID economy because of the vaccine, the ability to return to trend is itself incredibly valuable. In fact, measured labor productivity from the vaccine will likely fall as lower-wage …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<article>
    <p>You know the feeling of watching your post quickly drowning in the Newest section of Hacker News, right?
It seems like pure, chaotic luck. Or is it?</p>
<p>I tried to crack the code of successful submissions.</p>
<p>I built a tool that parses Hacker News every two minutes and logs the state into the
database. The program has been working for <strong>14 days</strong> so far.</p>
<p>For the latest two weeks, there were <strong>13846</strong> stories, and only <strong>1403</strong> of them reached the first
page of Hacker News.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>10.1329</strong> percents. It doesn’t sound too bad, does it? It turns out <strong>every tenth story
hits the first page</strong>.</p>
<p><em>All time values are in UTC.</em></p>
<h2 id="stories-and-chances-to-hit-the-first-page">Stories and chances to hit the first page</h2>

<p>It seems like Saturday and Sunday are the least active days when it comes to new stories.
But it means you have the biggest chance to hit the first page during these days.</p>
<h2 id="total-number-of-stories-and-chances-by-hour">Total number of stories and chances by hour</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look what about best hours to publish then.</p>

<ul>
<li>I wouldn’t post at 15:00 - 16:00 since it’s the lowest chance to hit the first page. Too many
submissions during these hours.</li>
<li>11:00 - 12:00 looks like a good spot, everyone is getting awake and your post is already waiting
them on the first page.</li>
</ul>

November 23, 2020 | https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/11/install-the-xfce-desktop-on-your-raspberry-pi/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/11/install-the-xfce-desktop-on-your-raspberry-pi/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In this article you’ll learn how to install the XFCE desktop on your Raspberry PI. We’ll take a minimal install of the Raspberry PI operating system as a starting point. The XFCE installation on your Raspberry PI includes setting up all necessary building blocks, such as: display server, display manager, session manager, window manager and desktop environment.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>When you install the default Raspberry PI operating system, it presents you with the PIXEL desktop. The Raspberry PI foundation developed and maintains the PIXEL desktop. It offers a user-friendly desktop, with all basic features and applications included. For example: an application menu, a file manager, a text editor, etc. PIXEL is lightweight, meaning that it doesn’t consume a lot of RAM and CPU resources. This makes it run smoothly, even on a Raspberry PI Zero with only 512 MB of RAM.</p>
<p>So why would you want to switch to another desktop, such as XFCE? I can think of a few reasons:</p>
<ul><li>As a Linux desktop user, you probably did your fair share of desktop environment hopping. You might have settled on the XFCE desktop. Consequently, you prefer to run the XFCE desktop also on your Raspberry PI.</li><li>Your Raspberry PI serves as a Linux learning platform. You would like to find out what it takes to install a desktop environment from scratch.</li></ul>
<h3>The new Raspberry PI 400</h3>
<p>Over the years the Raspberry PI has gotten ever more powerful. It’s no longer just an embedded Linux board. Especially the Raspberry PI 4 packs enough CPU power and RAM for usage as you daily desktop computer. The Raspberry PI foundation thinks so too. Just look at the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/">Raspberry PI 400</a> model they recently released. They market it as a “complete personal computer, built into a compact keyboard”:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="900" height="365" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400.png" alt="Image of the Raspberry PI 400. It's a Raspberry PI 4 build into a keyboard. Marketed as a complete personal computer, built into a compact keyboard." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400.png 900w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400-300x122.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/raspi400-768x311.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>
<p>You no longer need to restrict yourself to the PIXEL desktop. The Raspberry PI 4 comes a quad-core 64-bit CPU and 2, 4 or 8 GB RAM. More than sufficient to run a ‘real’ Linux desktop such as XFCE, KDE or Gnome.</p>
<h3>Why the XFCE desktop</h3>
<p>So why did I select the XFCE desktop for this article? In my opinion the XFCE desktop sits nicely between the PIXEL desktop and the more resource intensive desktops such as Gnome and KDE. It offers a full desktop experience, while still being lightweight and with snappy responsiveness. The XFCE desktop is stable, well maintained and available in all major Linux distributions. It’s the desktop environment I personally select, when installing a Linux desktop on older hardware or in a virtual machine.</p>
<h2>What do you need</h2>
<p>To complete the steps in this article and install the XFCE desktop on your Raspberry PI, you need the following:</p>
<ul><li>Any Raspberry PI 4 board, including the new Raspberry PI 400.</li><li>A power supply for the Raspberry PI board.</li><li>A micro-SD card of 8 GB or more in size.</li><li>A USB mouse</li><li>A USB keyboard (not needed for the Raspberry PI 400).</li><li>A computer monitor or TV.</li><li>A cable for connecting the HDMI output to your monitor or TV.</li></ul>
<p>Throughout this article, I assume you already installed the Raspberry PI operating system. I recommend the <em>Lite</em> edition. The <em>Lite</em> edition of the Raspberry PI operating system does not include a graphical desktop environment. That way you start with a clean slate.</p>
<p>I’ll be using my Raspberry PI 4 with 4 GB RAM to install the XFCE desktop. I already installed the <em>Lite</em> edition of the Raspberry PI operating system on it. Furthermore, I added a new user account for user <code>pragmalin</code> and removed the default <code>pi</code> user account, for security purposes. Although not necessary, I recommend that you start with the same foundation. Refer to the previously published tutorial on how to <a href="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/11/perform-a-minimal-install-on-your-raspberry-pi/">perform a minimal install on your Raspberry PI</a> for step-by-step instructions.</p>
<h2>Graphical desktop components</h2>
<p>Before diving right into the installation of XFCE on your Raspberry PI, I would like to present a brief overview of all the components that go into a Linux graphical desktop. This theoretical background information is optional. Feel free to skip to the next section to continue with the hands-on XFCE installation part on your Raspberry PI.</p>
<p>Refer to the following illustration for an overview of all components:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="410" height="269" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/component_layers.png" alt="Illustration showing all the components that go into a graphical desktop on Linux. To install the XFCE desktop on a Raspberry PI we need these components: Xorg, lightdm, xfce4-session, xfwm4 and xfce4." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/component_layers.png 410w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/component_layers-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px"></figure>
<p>Note the added text after the arrow in the illustration. These are the specific components we’ll install for our XFCE desktop. For a Linux graphical desktop, the specific components can differ. For example, a Gnome desktop environment typically uses the <em>gdm</em> display manager instead of <em>lightdm</em>.</p>
<h3>Display server</h3>
<p>In order to do anything graphically, as opposed to just the basic command line, you need a display server. It provides the foundation needed by all the other components. It handles outputting pixels on the display and detecting input events from the mouse and keyboard.</p>
<h3>Display manager</h3>
<p>Think of the display manager as the login screen. It is the first thing that gets started if the operating system supports a graphical desktop. On this screen you enter your username and password to login. Furthermore, it offers you a choice of the desktop session to start.</p>
<h3>Session manager</h3>
<p>After logging in, the display manager hands control over to the session manager. Simply put, the session manager manages the state of the desktop of the logged in user(s). So which applications are running and what their window state and position is. Furthermore, the session manager makes it possible to save your desktop when you logout. Upon the next login it can automatically restore your desktop for you.</p>
<h3>Window manager</h3>
<p>The window manager controls the placement, movement and look of all windows and their controls (button, check box, etc). Its the one that draws the border around each window and adds the title bar. Additionally, the window manager enables you to tile, stack and move windows around.</p>
<h3>Desktop environment</h3>
<p>To have a fully functional graphical desktop you still need a bit more. For example an application menu, a task-bar panel showing running applications and notification icons. And then your basic suite of applications such as a file manager, terminal program, text editor, etc. The desktop environment combines all these parts. Its goal is to provide you with a cohesive and productive graphical user experience.</p>
<h2>Install the XFCE desktop components</h2>
<p>At this point you have a good understanding of what components you need, to install the XFCE desktop on your Raspberry PI. Time to get our hands dirty. We’ll install all the XFCE desktop components in one go on your Raspberry PI. This includes:</p>
<ul><li><em>Xorg</em> display server</li><li><em>lightdm</em> display manager</li><li><em>xfce4-session</em> session manager</li><li><em>xfwm4</em> window manager</li><li><em>xfce4</em> desktop environment</li></ul>
<p>Power up your Raspberry PI and login with your username and password at the console. Next, run the following command to install the XFCE desktop components on your Raspberry PI:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install -y xserver-xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="769" height="569" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apt_xfce_install.png" alt="Terminal screenshot of installing the XFCE desktop related packages on the Raspberry PI. The following command is used: sudo apt install -y xserver-xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apt_xfce_install.png 769w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apt_xfce_install-300x222.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px"></figure>
<p>As you can see in the last line of the screenshot, all XFCE desktop components consume about 1 GB of disk space. With all the XFCE desktop components installed on your Raspberry PI, we continue with setting them up.</p>
<h2>Setup the XFCE desktop components</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we installed all XFCE desktop components on your Raspberry PI. As a next step we make sure the right desktop components are selected. If you started with a minimal install of the Raspberry PI operating system, this will most likely be the case already. However, if you previously installed a different desktop environment, we need to double-check this selection, to make sure it works for an XFCE desktop.</p>
<h3>Select the display server</h3>
<p>You probably only have one display server installed (<em>Xorg</em>), so you do not have to explicitly select one. However, it could be that you didn’t have a display sever installed before. In this case we need to verify that the display server gets started during boot.</p>
<p>Systemd should handle this for us. Without the presence of a display server, Systemd’s default boot target is the multi user shell. Also called <code>multi-user.target</code>. When installing a display server, Systemd’s default boot target should change to a graphical multi user shell. This one is called <code>graphical.target</code>.</p>
<p>To determine Systemd’s default boot target, run this command:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl get-default</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="713" height="33" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows the output of running the &quot;sudo systemctl get-default&quot; command. It should output &quot;&quot;graphical.target&quot;." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default.png 713w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default-300x14.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/systemd_get_default-700x33.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px"></figure>
<p>It should output <code>graphical.target</code>. If it doesn’t, then you can set it manually by running the command:</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target</code>.</p>
<h3>Select the display manager</h3>
<p>The following component to select is the display manager. We want to select <em>lightdm</em> as the display manager. Easily achieved by running the following command:</p>
<p><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="416" height="23" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_display_manager.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows what command to run for selecting the lightdm display manager." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_display_manager.png 416w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_display_manager-300x17.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px"></figure>
<h3>Select the session manager</h3>
<p>Next we’ll go ahead and select the session manager. Type this command in the terminal:</p>
<p><code>sudo update-alternatives --config x-session-manager</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="764" height="153" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_session_manager.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows how to select the session manager, with the help of the update-alternatives command. Make sure to select startxfce4 here and not xfce4-session." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_session_manager.png 764w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/select_session_manager-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px"></figure>
<p>On this screen we need to make sure <em>startxfce4</em> is selected as the session manager. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> if startxfce4 is already selected, otherwise enter the number of the <em>startxfce4</em> session.</p>
<p>A bit odd, right? In an earlier section I mentioned that we want the <em>xfce4-session</em> session manager. The selection menu lists <em>xfce4-session</em>, so why not pick it? The <em>startxfce4</em> file consists of a script that initializes the XFCE session and under the hood calls the <em>xfce4-session</em> executable for us. This makes <em>startxfce4</em> the better option here.</p>
<h3>Select the window manager</h3>
<p>Continue with the selection of the window manager. Run the following command:</p>
<p><code>sudo update-alternatives --config x-window-manager</code></p>

<p>On my Raspberry PI, <em>xfwm4</em> is the only available window manager. Therefore no additional configuration is needed.</p>
<h3>Select the desktop environment</h3>
<p>You select the desktop environment on the login screen. So now would be the right time to reboot our Raspberry PI and wait for the login screen to show up. On the top right corner of the screen, there is a little icon you can click. Select <em>Xfce Session</em> from the drop-down menu:</p>

<h2>Configure the XFCE desktop</h2>
<p>At this point we completed installing and selecting the right components for the XFCE desktop on our Raspberry PI. In this section we’ll make some final configurations for our XFCE desktop. If you …</p></div></div>

	<p>Back in spring 2019, I was a student working as an intern at the Intel Open
Source Graphics Center in Finland. I was mainly focused on improving
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/igt-gpu-tools/">igt-gpu-tools</a>, the test suite that runs each time a patch is submitted for
the i915 kernel driver. I really liked the work I was doing there, and enjoyed
interacting with all of the people on site. While I was there, I had an
opportunity to say “no” to an assigned task that I considered unethical.</p>
<p>Naturally, lots of Intel kernel developers were working on fixing bugs and
implementing new features. When a developer wants to add a new feature to their
kernel driver, they also need to provide a patch for a user-space program to
exercise the feature in a real-world scenario and prove that the new user-space
API is sensible<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. For instance, when adding HDR support to i915, the kernel
developers worked with the Kodi team.</p>
<p>At that time, I had just been nominated as release manager for the Wayland and
Weston projects. Additionally, some Intel engineers were working on upstreaming
Weston patches to add a new feature to their driver. In fact, the kernel
patches were ready to be merged and only blocked by the user-space
requirements. Some deadlines were set too, so it was important to get the
patches merged in a timely manner. My manager asked me to help with the
upstreaming process. That was a pretty good idea – because my experience could
help Intel developers to learn how to contribute to Weston, and because I like
mentoring people. So what was the catch?</p>
<p>It turned out the feature being developed was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection">HDCP</a>. It’s a form of <abbr title="Digital Restrictions Management">DRM</abbr> that encrypts the video
stream between the GPU and the screen. I’m personally not okay with DRM in
general, and I find DRM to be unethical. I’m not going to start to argue why I
feel this way, because it doesn’t really matter in the context of this article.
Feel free to replace DRM with whatever you find unethical.</p>
<p>So, I started participating in meetings and discussing how to get the
HDCP patches merged. I wasn’t very comfortable with the whole situation, and
tried to stay away from it when possible. I considered saying “no”, but I was
scared. I was only working at Intel for a few weeks, I was still a student, I
didn’t know my teammates and managers too well, and I was interested in
eventually getting a job offer. I just continued as if nothing was wrong.</p>
<p>At some point, after asking advice and discussing with some friends, I realized
that I ought to speak up. If I didn’t say “no” this time, it would get a lot
more difficult to say “no” the next time. So I ignored the anxiety and clumsily
explained to my manager that I’d like to stop working on HDCP.</p>
<p>To my surprise, my manager just said that it was fine, that there was no
problem. After this event, absolutely nothing else changed, and at some point I
even got an employment offer. When I recall it now, I can only tell myself that
it was a lot of fuss for nothing. In hindsight, I should’ve been less scared
and said no earlier, but in these situations it’s easy to imagine nightmare
scenarios in your head!</p>

<p>Few years ago I did some <a href="https://hforsten.com/homemade-synthetic-aperture-radar.html">simple synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imaging
experiments</a> with the second version of my homemade
FMCW radar. Since then I made a much improved <a href="https://hforsten.com/third-version-of-homemade-6-ghz-fmcw-radar.html">third version of the
radar</a> but didn't do any SAR measurements due to the
amount of effort it would have required. I did have plans to do some SAR
experiments afterwards but it took until now to have enough time and
motivation.</p>
<p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is a way to synthesize very large antenna
array by moving single antenna on a known path. If there are no moving targets
in the scene then one radar taking many measurements along a path gives the same
result as one ridiculously large radar that is as long as the movement path.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/fmcw3-sar/xsar_imaging.png.pagespeed.ic.MP13OL2L7B.png" width="40%/"></p><p>SAR imaging of a single target. As the radar
    moves the measured distance follows a parabola.</p>
</div>

<p>If we move on a straight path while radar pointing 90 degrees from the direction
of the path measures a distance to the single target, we will find that the
measured distance follows a parabola. This follows directly from the Pythagorean
theorem. The SAR imaging problem is finding out the target position from the
measured distance data. Of course in a real scene we have multiple targets and
the solution isn't as simple as looking where the closest approach is as could
be done in the picture above.</p>

<p>There are few different algorithms for solving this problem, but the one I'm
going to use is called Omega-k algorithm. It is a fast imaging algorithm
utilizing FFT which also makes it efficient to calculate on GPU. The derivation
mostly follows <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7878107">a paper by Guo and
Dong</a>.</p>
<p>The radar I have is a frequency modulated constant wave (FMCW) radar. It
transmits a short frequency sweep. The transmitted waveform can be modeled as: </p>
<p>$$ s_t(\tau) = \exp(j 2 \pi f_c \tau + \pi \gamma \tau^2),\quad -T_s/2 &lt; \tau &lt; T_s/2 $$</p>
<p>, where <span>\(j&nbsp;= \sqrt{-1}\)</span>, <span>\(f_c =\)</span> RF carrier frequency, <span>\(\tau =\)</span> time variable,
<span>\(\gamma = B/T_s =\)</span> sweep bandwidth / sweep length <span>\(=\)</span> sweep rate.</p>
<p>The transmitted wave reflects off a target at some distance and is received after
time <span>\(t_d\)</span>. Ignoring the amplitude, the received wave is a time-delayed copy
of the transmitted signal: <span>\(s_r(\tau) = s_t(\tau - t_d)\)</span>. Signals from multiple
targets are summed.</p>
<p>The receiver mixes the received signal with the transmitted signal. This mixing
is called dechirping and it removes the high frequency RF component. The result
is a low frequency signal, usually some few kHz to MHz and is easy to digitize
with low-cost ADC. With the complex signals we take complex conjugate of the
transmitted signal to get the low-pass product and the resulting mixing product is:</p>
<p>$$ s_{\text{IF}}(\tau) = s_t(\tau - t_d) s_t^*(\tau) = \exp(-j 2 \pi f_c t_d
- j 2 \pi \gamma t_d \tau + j \pi \gamma \tau^2) $$</p>
<p>During SAR measurement the radar repeats this measurement while moving on
a straight path with a constant speed. The position of the radar on the path is:
<span>\(x = v \tau + x_n\)</span>, where <span>\(v\)</span> is speed of the radar platform and <span>\(x_n
= v n T_p\)</span>. <span>\(n\)</span> is the index for measurements and <span>\(T_p\)</span> is the transmit
repetition interval.</p>
<p>If the radar target is at position <span>\((x_0, y_0)\)</span> the distance to the target can
be written as:</p>
<p>$$ R(x) = \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_0 - x)^2}&nbsp;$$</p>
<p>We set the y-coordinate of the path to be 0 and x position is limited to <span>\(-L/2
&lt; x &lt; L/2\)</span>, where <span>\(L\)</span> is length of the path.</p>
<p>Since electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light and radar signal needs
to travel to the target and back to the radar, we get expression
for received signal time delay <span>\(t_d = 2R(x)/c\)</span>, where <span>\(c\)</span> is the speed of light.</p>
<p>The recorded signal can be written as:</p>
<p>$$ s_{\text{IF}}(\tau, x) = \exp\left(-j \frac{4 \pi}{c} (f_c + \gamma \tau) R(x)\right)
\exp\left(j \frac{4 \pi \gamma^2}{c^2} R^2(x)\right) $$</p>
<p>The last term in the above expression is called residual video phase term and
it's an undesirable by-product from dechirping operation. It should be removed
before further processing by multiplying by <span>\(\exp(-j \frac{4 \pi \gamma^2}{c^2}
R^2(x))\)</span>.  However this form is inconvenient because it depends on <span>\(R(x)\)</span>. Using
the fact that <span>\(R(x) = c t_d / 2\)</span> and that <span>\(t_d\)</span> can be expressed in terms of
frequency of the IF signal: <span>\(f = -2 \gamma R(x) / c = -\gamma t_d \Rightarrow
t_d = -\frac{f}{\gamma}\)</span> we can write the correction term as <span>\(\exp(-j \pi f^2
/ \gamma)\)</span>. This form can be applied easily to the Fourier transformed signal.</p>
<p>With RVP term removed the signal is:</p>
<p>$$ s(\tau, x_n) = \exp\left(-j \frac{4 \pi}{c} (f_c + \gamma \tau) \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_n - x_0 + v \tau)^2}\right) $$</p>
<p>Ideally we would like to have the signal in form <span>\(\exp(-j 2 \pi f_y y_0)\exp(-j
2\pi f_x x_0)\)</span>, then we could apply two dimensional inverse Fourier transform to
get a delta function centered at <span>\((x_0, y_0)\)</span> focusing the image. Currently the
signal <span>\(s(\tau, x_n)\)</span> is not in this form and inverse Fourier transform doesn't
give anything interesting. We need to find some processing steps to apply to the
signal to get it to the required form so that inverse Fourier transform can be
applied. The reason to look specifically for this kind of form is that FFT can
be performed very efficiently.</p>
<p>As a first step, note that <span>\(\gamma\)</span> has units of Hz/s and <span>\(\tau\)</span> has units of s.
The product <span>\(\gamma \tau\)</span> has units of Hz so it's a frequency. This product is actually
instantenous modulation frequency of the sweep. We do substitution <span>\(\gamma
\tau \rightarrow f_\tau\)</span> to get rid of the time variable. <span>\(\tau\)</span> range was <span>\(-T/2
\ldots T/2\)</span> and the new range for <span>\(f_\tau\)</span> is <span>\(-B/2 \ldots B/2\)</span>.</p>
<p>$$ S(f_\tau, x_n) = \exp\left(-j \frac{4 \pi}{c} (f_c + f_\tau) \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_n - x_0 + \frac{v f_\tau}{\gamma} )^2}\right) $$</p>
<p>Also instead of using frequency the math is cleaner and the implementation of
the algorithm is easier when using wavenumbers instead. We define range
wavenumber <span>\(K_r = K_{rc} + \Delta K_r\)</span>. <span>\(K_{rc} = \frac{4\pi f_c}{c}\)</span>, <span>\(\Delta
K_r = \frac{4\pi f_\tau}{c} = -\frac{2\pi B}{c} \ldots \frac{2\pi B}{c}\)</span>.</p>
<p>$$ S(K_r, x_n) = \exp\left(-j K_r \sqrt{y_0^2 + (x_n - x_0 + \frac{v c \Delta K_r}{4 \pi \gamma} )^2}\right) $$</p>
<p>Next step is to do Fourier transform in azimuth direction (direction of the
movement) to move also the <span>\(x_n\)</span> variable to frequency domain.</p>
<p>$$ S(K_r, K_x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty S(K_r, x_n) \exp(-j K_x x_n)\, dx_n  = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp(j\Phi(x_n))\, dx_n $$</p>
<p><span>\(K_x = 2\pi f_x\)</span> is wavenumber in the azimuth direction. This integral doesn't have
exact solution, but there is a method to calculate quite accurate approximation
using a method called principle of stationary phase (PSOP). Phase of the
function being integrated can be written as:</p>
<p>$$ \Phi(x_n) = -K_r \sqrt{y_0^2 + \left(x_n - x_0 + \frac{v c \Delta K_r}{4 \pi \gamma} \right)^2} - K_x x_n $$</p>
<p>If we plot the phase <span>\(\Phi(x_n)\)</span> for some realistic values we get a plot that
looks something like below:</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/fmcw3-sar/xphi_plot.png.pagespeed.ic.0z1VF8YpRH.png" width="40%/"></p><p>Phase and real part of the function being
    integrated.</p>
</div>

<p>There is one point where derivative of the phase is zero (stationary point) and
the function varies slowly, but away from that point the function is highly
oscillatory. As we integrate the function the oscillations far away from the
stationary point cancel out and mainly the area around the stationary point
contributes to the result of the integral.</p>
<p>We can expand the function around the stationary point <span>\(\frac{d}{dx_n}\Phi(x_n) \rvert_{x_n=x_n^\star} = 0\)</span>, as
<span>\(\Phi(x_n) = \Phi(x_n^\star) + 0 + \frac{1}{2}\Phi^{''}(x_n - x_n^\star)^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Plugging the Taylor expansion in to the integral we get:</p>
<p>$$ \begin{aligned}S(K_r, K_x) &amp;\approx \exp(j\Phi(x_n^\star)) \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left(j\frac{1}{2}\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)(x_n-x_n^\star)^2\right)\, d x_n \\
&amp;= \exp(j\Phi(x_n^\star)) \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\left(j\frac{1}{2}\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)s^2\right)\, d s \\
&amp;= \exp(j\Phi(x_n^\star)) \sqrt{\frac{2\pi j}{\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)}} \end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Since <span>\(\Phi(x_n)\)</span> is purely real function, if <span>\(\mu\)</span> is sign of the
<span>\(\Phi(x_n^\star)\)</span>, then the square root term can be written as
<span>\(\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{|\Phi^{''}(x_n^\star)|}} exp(j\pi \mu/4)\)</span>. The second
derivative contributes amplitude term and constant phase term, neither of them
which is important for focusing image which mainly depends on aligning the
phases. We have ignored the amplitude since beginning and it ends up being slowly
varying function so we will just approximate it away.</p>
<p>The stationary point of the function <span>\(\frac{d}{dx_n}\Phi(x_n)
\rvert_{x_n=x_n^\star} = 0\)</span> can be solved to be:</p>
<p>$$ x_n^\star = x_0 - \frac{K_x y_0}{\sqrt{K_r^2 - K_x^2}} - \frac{c \Delta K_r
v}{4\pi\gamma} $$</p>
<p>Plugging in the stationary point to the <span>\(S(K_r, K_x)\)</span> equation above we get the
solution of the integral:</p>
<p>$$ S(K_r, K_x) \approx \exp\left(j(-y_0 \sqrt{K_r^2 - K_x^2} - K_x x_0 + \frac{c \Delta K_r K_x
v}{4\pi\gamma})\right) $$</p>
<p>The last term is phase offset caused by the movement of the radar during the
sweep. It can be removed by multiplying with exponential in the opposite phase.</p>
<p><span>\(x_0\)</span> term is already in the correct form as it is multiplied only by <span>\(K_x\)</span>, but
<span>\(y_0\)</span> term depends on both <span>\(K_r\)</span> and <span>\(K_x\)</span>. <span>\(K_r, K_x\)</span> dependence can be fixed
by making a substitution <span>\(\sqrt{K_r^2 - K_x^2} \rightarrow K_y\)</span>. This step is
called Stolt interpolation as it is implemented by interpolating the data to
a new grid.</p>
<p>After the Stolt interpolation the signal is in form:</p>
<p>$$ S(K_y, K_x) = \exp(j(-K_y y_0 - K_x x_0)) $$</p>
<p>Taking 2D inverse Fourier transform gives the focused image with delta function
centered at <span>\((x_0, y_0)\)</span>.</p>

<p>The Omega-k algorithm is mainly large FFTs and interpolation. Both can be
implemented well on GPU which requires large parallelism from the program. Well
written GPU implementation should be several times faster than CPU
implementation. For convenience I'll implement the algorithm using Tensorflow
library. Although it's …</p></div></article></section></div></div></div></div>

            <p>Securing containers is a complex task.  The problem space is broad, vendors are on fire, there are tons of checklists and best practices and it’s hard to prioritize solutions. So if you had to <strong>implement a container security strategy</strong> where would you start?</p>

<p>I suggest to start from the basics: understanding <strong>what container security is about</strong> and build a model to navigate risks.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-devops-life-cycle">Follow the DevOps Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Every security initiative is eventually constrained by where security controls can be implemented, so I find practical to just follow the standard DevOps life cycle to <em>surface patterns™</em> and <em>unlock synergies™</em>.</p>

<p>The DevOps Lifecycle is an infinite iteration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Operate</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cloudberry.engineering/devops-lifecycle.jpg" alt="DevOps Lifecycle - source: ryadel.com"></p>

<p>Containers are included in the application in the form of a Dockerfiles but are not really part of it. As such they don’t interest the planning and coding phase.</p>

<p><em>(no, writing Dockerfiles is not coding.)</em></p>

<p>Every other step is in scope from a security point of view, and I would group them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build Time</strong>: build, test and release.</li>
<li><strong>Container Infrastructure</strong>: deploy and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Every security strategy is only effective if it can be implemented. And every step in each group share a common facility where security controls can be injected without adding much friction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Time: The CI/CD infrastructure, the container registry</li>
<li>Container Infrastructure: the container orchestrator</li>
<li>Runtime: the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have three macro areas we can use as a starting point to do our risk assessments.</p>

<h2 id="security-at-build-time">Security at Build Time</h2>

<p>At build time we have in input a bunch of source files and a Dockerfile, and we get as output a Docker image.</p>

<p>This is where most vendors tend to cluster while trying to sell you the narrative of the importance of scanning container images and calling it a day.  Container security scanning is important, yes, but it’s not enough.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="container-images-hygiene">Container Images Hygiene</h3>

<p>First, decide how your images should look like, with a focus on how software dependencies are introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>what base images are developers allowed to use?</li>
<li>are software dependencies pinned? From where are they pulled?</li>
<li>are there any labels that are needed to simplify governance and compliance?</li>
<li>lint the Dockerfile</li>
<li>follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/dockerfile-security-best-practices/">Docker security best practices</a> when writing Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these checks are static and can be implemented for cheap as a step in the build pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="container-images-scanning">Container Images Scanning</h3>

<p>Then we can move into scanning the container image.</p>

<p><strong>Do not scan the image as a step in the build pipeline</strong>, instead setup continuous scanning in the container registry.</p>

<p>Why? Vulnerabilities are continuously discovered while your services are not necessarily continuously built. Secondly, builds are additive: every build will generate a new image. So, assuming  your container orchestrator trust your registry, every tag you publish can always be deployed and need to be assessed.</p>

<p><em>(It’s also very slow to scan at build time)</em></p>

<p>This is where you start thinking about defining <strong>patch management</strong> and <strong>shelf life</strong> processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch management: results from the scanning will feed a patching process that will result in a new version of the image</li>
<li>shelf life: unpatched/old/unsafe images are deleted from the registry</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(next article will be about how to choose a container scanning solution, if you are facing the dilemma right now feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@clouberry.engineering">ping me</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="container-infrastructure-security">Container Infrastructure Security</h2>

<p>The container infrastructure is comprised of all the moving parts that are in charge of pulling your images from the registry and run them as containers in production.</p>

<p>It’s mostly going to be the container orchestrator – <em>*cough* kubernetes *cough*</em>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid platform misconfigurations with security implications</li>
<li>Minimize the <strong>breadth</strong> of an attack from a compromised container</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="security-of-the-infrastructure-misconfigurations">Security OF the Infrastructure: Misconfigurations</h3>

<p>Container orchestrators are complex, Kubernetes in particular. As of now they fail the promise of DevOps and I think we are still an abstraction layer (or two) away from being a mainstream solution without too much operational overhead.</p>

<p>Every complex platforms is prone to be misconfigured, and this is the part you want to focus on.</p>

<p>You have to threat model your infrastructure to <strong>ensure it can’t be abused</strong>.
This particular thread model should focus on every actor but a compromised container (we will cover that next).</p>

<p>I can’t go into details here, because it really depends on what you are running. For Kubernetes a good starting point for threat modelling is <a href="https://www.marcolancini.it/2020/blog-kubernetes-threat-modelling/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are not doing it yet, this is also a <strong>good argument in favour of using a managed platform</strong>: the complexity is reduced if you can leverage a shared responsibility model with your (trusted) provider.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-the-infrastructure-lateral-movements">Security IN the infrastructure: Lateral Movements</h3>

<p>Next we can talk about what happens when a container is compromised.</p>

<p>You want to minimize the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">attacker’s ability to move laterally</a>, focusing on these two layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network layer</li>
<li>The Identity and Access management (IAM) layer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network should not be flat</strong>. You can start by brutally segment everything into subnetworks and work your way up to a full fledge service meshes.</p>

<p>On the IAM layer work your way toward having a <strong>single identity for each container</strong> in order to fine tune the authorization grants. This is particularly important in multi tenant platforms: without granular identities it’s impossible to achieve least privilege.</p>

<p><em>(Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has a nifty feature for this called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a>)</em></p>

<p>Finally, since they are supposed to be immutable, a wonderful strategy would be to <strong>reduce the amount of time containers can run</strong>: the window of opportunity for attackers to move laterally and gain persistence is as long as the container running lifetime. Continously shut down and spin up your containers.</p>

<p>And this final consideration allow me to smoothly move into the next area.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-security">Runtime Security</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the security of your running workloads.
At this point most of the hardening is done and here is when we move into the realm of reactive security controls, the grim land of <strong>post-fail</strong>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to minimize the <strong>impact</strong> of an attack from a compromised container.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="detection-and-incident-response">Detection and Incident Response</h3>

<p>The best way to control the impact of an attack is to minimize the time between the breach to when the security team is alerted.</p>

<p>Detecting an ongoing breach is another area where vendors are scrambling to find a silver bullet. There are many approaches, most of them will require side cars and/or daemon sets actively monitoring pod’s traffic and system calls.</p>

<p>Most solutions will provide some value but my advice is to start simple and iterate: use your existing SIEM, ingest your platform, application and audit logs.</p>

<p><strong>Incidents will happen</strong>, and it’s fine: have an incident response process.</p>

<p>The first bullet point of every post-mortem should be: <em>“how can we detect this quicker next time?”</em> answering will allow you to identify your blind spots, which you can then use to understand what signals you are missing and what makes sense to buy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Container security is a broad problem and it is not just about scanning images.</p>

<p>This is the model I built and used to reason about container risks and solutions. It’s very high level and of course, as with every model, <strong>it’s not necessarily the right one</strong>.</p>

<p>We all know that in reality each infrastructure is a snowflake: so start with your own threat model and use this one <strong>as an inspiration</strong>.</p>

	<h4>A Walmart-exclusive Wi-Fi router, and others sold on Amazon &amp; eBay contain hidden backdoors to control devices <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/walmart-exclusive-routers-others-made-in-china-contain-backdoors-to-control-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports CyberNews</a>.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Researchers discovered that many low cost, Chinese-made Wi-Fi routers contain a hidden backdoor which is being actively exploited to create botnet attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>CyberNews researchers discovered suspicious backdoors in a Chinese made router sold under the name ‘Jetstream’. This router is part of Walmart’s new line of affordable Wi-Fi routers.</p>
<blockquote><p>This backdoor would allow an attacker the ability to remotely control not only the routers, but also any devices connected to that network.</p></blockquote>

<p>The researchers contacted Walmart to get a statement, and a Walmart spokesperson had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are looking into the issue to learn more. The item in question is currently out of stock and we do not have plans to replenish it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>CyberNews researchers also discovered that ‘Wavlink’ branded routers, often sold on Amazon or eBay, <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/walmart-exclusive-routers-others-made-in-china-contain-backdoors-to-control-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contain similar backdoors</a>.</p>
<p>Worryingly, they also discovered that these <strong>backdoors are being actively exploited</strong>, and there have been attempts to add the routers to a botnet with malware that allows them to be used in large scale DDoS attacks, which have <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/walmart-exclusive-routers-others-made-in-china-contain-backdoors-to-control-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the past taken down major websites</a> such as Reddit, Netflix, CNN, GitHub, Twitter, AirBnb and more.</p>

According to the <a href="https://www.venafi.com/blog/why-venafi-acquisition-good-jetstack-community">Venafi</a>:</p><blockquote>The combination of speed and security creates an interesting dilemma. How do you build software quick enough to compete, without the risk of being exploited? This is the challenge that Jetstack and Venafi will solve.</blockquote><p>Back to cert-manager, Jetstack recently announced the release of the v1 API for this tool, which made the technology more mature and powerful. This release allows developers to have greater visibility and control over their certificates.</p><p>Currently, the Venafi+Jetsack team has been working towards integrating Google's new Certificate Authority Service (CAS) with cert-manager. This will offer developers private CA keys as a service, using HSMs, which are validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 3.</p></div></section><section><section><div><blockquote>
                Itâ€™s exciting to see cert-manager join the CNCF Sandbox. Itâ€™s been several years in the making to get to 1.0, and weâ€™re hugely thankful to a community of over 250 contributors, and many end-users, to get it to where it is today. This is a foundational add-on to many Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters, and the project will benefit from being part of the CNCF and its ecosystem. We look forward to attracting a diverse contributor base and extending our partnership and cooperation with many other projects to further enhance the developer and operator experience.

Ask a manager</h4><p>Approval is loose and informal. PMs and EMs briefly mention it to their managers over email or their regular check-in.</p><p>Managers won’t require much justification for approval. Why? Its an immaterial amount of money and they trust their employees’ judgment.</p><h4>2. Find a credit card</h4><p>With very few exceptions, PMs and EMs (at the levels I’m targeting) don’t have company credit cards. So how do they pay after getting approval?</p><h5>Pay with personal credit card</h5><p>This is a common practice for team meals, social events, and one-off software purchases. A senior team member will pay with a personal card and file an expense report.</p><p>But people are more hesitant to pay for a <em><strong>recurring</strong></em> team subscription with a personal card.</p><h5>Find a company credit card</h5><p>This varies from company to company, but the most common places people go are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Finance</strong> (manages budgets)</p></li><li><p><strong>IT</strong> (manages access to company subscriptions)</p></li><li><p><strong>Lowest person above them in the org chart with a company card</strong> (usually a Director or VP, depending on company size)</p></li></ol><h2>😁 Why my strategy will work</h2><h5>✅  Loose approval process</h5><p>I mentioned this before, but it’s worth restating. <strong>This means that the PM or EM using <a href="https://www.hellohailey.io/">HelloHailey</a> is the primary decision maker.</strong></p><p>No bureaucracy. No long, complex sales cycles.</p><p><strong>I just need to build a great product.</strong></p><h5>✅  Fits into an existing budget</h5><p>It’s my hypothesis that teams will pay for HelloHailey using their team “social” budgets. These budgets cover expenses like meals, games, or team events.</p><h5>✅  Takes a small percentage of that budget</h5><p>Team social budgets range from $10-$100 / person / month, with a median somewhere in the middle.</p><p>With a price of $2-$3 / person / month, HelloHailey would eat up only 5% of that budget on average.</p><h5>✅  Social budgets have been underutilized with sudden shift to remote work</h5><p>Half the people I talked to haven’t used their social budgets at all since being forced into remote work.</p><p>Most of the other half has used it sparingly for virtual team events.</p><h2>😢 Why it might not work</h2><p>Until companies <em>actually</em> start paying me, my strategy will be full of uncertainty.</p><p>Here are some ways it might fail:</p><h5>💩  Doesn’t fit into an existing budget</h5><p>Maybe companies don’t think it’s appropriate to pull from team social budgets for this kind of purchase.</p><p>If it doesn’t fit nicely into <em>any</em> existing category, it’ll be much harder for companies to buy it.</p><h5>💩  Hard to budget for a product with expanding price</h5><p><a href="https://www.hellohailey.io/">HelloHailey</a> will get more expensive as more users and teams are added within a company. </p><h5>💩  <strong>What happens when a product purchased with Team A’s social budget adds users from Team B and gets more expensive? </strong></h5><p>I don’t know 🤷‍♂️ (<em>Do you? <a href="https://twitter.com/AnotherTimJones">Share your wisdom and help me out</a> </em>🙂 ).</p><p>But I’m not the first person to face this problem. There are precedents in place and I’m confident I’ll figure it out.</p><h5>💩  Approval process is more difficult than expected</h5><p>The people I interviewed could be outliers. Maybe a typical manager requires more convincing to approve this kind of purchase.</p><h2>What about expanding?</h2><p>I now feel confident about landing. <strong>So how will I expand?</strong></p><p>I have some ideas for how I can build growth mechanisms into a product like this.</p><p>But if I’m being honest, I’m not sure yet 🤷‍♂️. And I’m OK with that.</p><p><strong>With a successful “land” strategy, and low to moderate expansion revenue, I can build a great business.</strong></p><p>Intra-company virality would be a must if I wanted to become a VC-backed rocket ship.</p><p><strong>But that’s not my goal.</strong></p><p><strong>I want to build a small, profitable company that solves a problem I’m passionate about.</strong></p><p>I can sell to unicorns. But I don’t want to <em>become</em> one.</p><h2>What did I get wrong?</h2><p>I learned a lot this week, but I’ve never done this before. </p><p><strong>Do you have SaaS sales experience?</strong></p><p>Don’t pull your punches! Help me out on my Twitter thread:</p><p>Don’t have any tips for me? <strong>Maybe you could help me out with a like or a retweet.</strong></p><p><strong>As a solopreneur with no funding or income, I’ll take all the help I can get 😁</strong></p><h2>🤔 Reducing uncertainty one week at a time</h2><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac3da08-e921-4064-b421-eebf46ef563b_920x248.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac3da08-e921-4064-b421-eebf46ef563b_920x248.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cac3da08-e921-4064-b421-eebf46ef563b_920x248.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:248,&quot;width&quot;:920,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:490,&quot;bytes&quot;:29061,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00e39b8-5136-450c-b442-675c0cd2fd7f_478x184.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00e39b8-5136-450c-b442-675c0cd2fd7f_478x184.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d00e39b8-5136-450c-b442-675c0cd2fd7f_478x184.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:184,&quot;width&quot;:478,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:23531,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I’m finally feeling confident about my go-to-market strategy.

<p>Here we go again. Just when you figured out what all these weird abbreviations (DKIM, SPF, DMARC) are, one more pops up on the horizon. Weren’t you safe enough already? Weren’t the spoofers, seeing your robust DNS records, quietly running away? Not all of them. The bad news is that you need to become familiar with the new kids on the block –&nbsp; BIMI records. Good news – we’ve got them covered for you. Read on!<br></p>



<h2><span id="What_is_a_BIMI_Record">What is a BIMI Record?</span></h2>



<p>BIMI stands for <strong>Brand Indicator for Message Identification</strong>. It’s a new approach that aims to prevent spoofing attempts but also increases the credibility of email senders. When fully implemented, hackers will have a very hard time trying to impersonate brands in emails, and maybe in a lot of other places too.<br></p>



<p><strong>A BIMI record is a DNS TXT record indicating what a brand’s logo is</strong>. When properly certified and authenticated, brands will be able to display their logo next to each message in an inbox, just like in the example below.<br></p>

They’ll also learn to recognize the brand they know and like, coming with obvious benefits for the companies. We will cover more about that later.<br></p>



<p>BIMI email authentication is developed as an open standard and it is possible that not only email clients will adopt it. Among the most likely candidates, messaging and social media apps are mentioned. Companies present there could also benefit from additional security. The platforms will probably be eager to get verified accounts on board. BIMI records could make a lot of difference.<br></p>



<p>We’ll see how it all plays out. At the time of writing (Dec. 2019), BIMI is in a pilot stage with Verizon Media Group (Yahoo!, AOL). Google recently also <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-joins-authindicators-working-group-and-commits-to-bimi-pilot-300890074.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">announced that they will be trialing BIMI in 2020.</a> If everything works out as expected, we can see BIMI records being adopted more in the coming years.<br></p>



<h2><span id="What_are_the_requirements_to_join_the_BIMI_club">What are the requirements to join the BIMI club?</span></h2>



<p>For BIMI to work, several conditions need to be met:</p>



<ul><li>The sender’s domain needs to be DMARC-authenticated, with either ‘reject’ or ‘quarantine’ policy set up</li><li>The domain’s owner needs to obtain the right certification</li><li>A good sending history needs to be built</li></ul><p>Let’s discuss these conditions one-by-one.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Be_DMARC-certified">Be DMARC-certified</span></h3>



<p>We already discussed DMARC on our blog, but if you wish to read more about it, check out our <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dmarc-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">DMARC Explained</a> article, along with our tips on <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dmarc-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">how to set up DMARC record</a>.<br></p>



<p>Long story short, DMARC is an authentication method that works on top of SPF and/or DKIM.<br></p>



<p><a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/spf-records-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SPF</a> is used to specify which IP addresses are allowed to send emails on behalf of a given domain. <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dkim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">DKIM</a>, on the other hand, allows incoming servers to verify the headers and body of a message, so that they look just like they did when they were leaving the sender’s inbox.</p>



<p>DMARC runs either check (or both) and performs a separate domain alignment test for the methods used. Finally, a policy assigned with DMARC can suggest an incoming server if emails that fail a test should be:</p>



<ul><li>Reject -&gt; discarded and not delivered to the recipient’s inbox</li><li>Quarantine -&gt; sent to the spam folder</li><li>None -&gt; treated as though no check was made (good for testing)</li></ul><p>As we mentioned earlier, to qualify for BIMI, the policy needs to be set to either ‘quarantine’ or ‘reject’. Of course, the DMARC record needs to be properly configured.<br></p>



<p>DMARC doesn’t require both DKIM and SPF to be set up (though it’s a smart thing to do). For the BIMI record to have any effect, either of these methods should be in place, along with DMARC, of course. A check will be performed every time a message is due to be delivered, so it’s worth triple-checking if everything is intact.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Obtain_a_certification">Obtain a certification</span></h3>



<p>To add an additional layer of security, bodies governing BIMI, referred to as Mark Verifying Authorities (MVA), will ask for additional proof of domain ownership.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>To get in, you’ll need to obtain an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">EV (Extended Validation) certificate</a> and meet several additional requirements:</p>



<ul><li>Prove the ownership or the right to use a registered trademark</li><li>Have this trademark registered in a competent jurisdiction</li><li>Make sure the logo from the BIMI record matches the trademark</li><li>Assure the owner of a trademark is also a registrant of a given domain name (alternative, those using a trademark under a license must be registered as licensees of a domain)</li></ul><p>Only if all of these conditions are met, the MVA will proceed to issue a respective certification.<br></p>



<p>Keep in mind that these rules may change at any point. CNN was the first company to obtain a certificate from MVA and <a href="https://martechtoday.com/cnn-com-receives-first-verified-mark-certificate-in-preparation-for-bimi-email-standard-236255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">it happened only in October 2019</a>. Before the program is rolled out to the public, the rules will likely be re-evaluated a number of times and some tweaks might be introduced. We’ll do our best to update this article if any of these happen.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Maintain_a_good_sending_history">Maintain a good sending history</span></h3>



<p>The last requirement is rather vague, but is important to keep in mind. In order to qualify for BIMI, you’ll need to have a good sending reputation, both for your domain and IP address.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This means having a healthy, engaged list of subscribers. Of course, you should avoid <a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/soft-vs-hard-bounce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">email bounces</a> and spam reports, but the fact that your emails are regularly opened by the recipients will also play a significant role.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>You also will need to have a track record of sending a significant volume of emails. Smaller senders may also be granted access to BIMI at some point but for now, only bigger brands will have a shot.</p>

Unsubscribe anytime.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>



<h2><span id="How_to_implement_BIMI_records">How to implement BIMI records?</span></h2>



<p>Once you meet all the requirements and obtain respective certifications, you can go on and add a proper record to your Domain Name System (DNS).<br></p>



<p>Then, you’ll need to upload your logo, necessarily in SVG format to a public HTTPS address. It’s recommended that it’s square-shaped and transparent. You may also want to avoid any unnecessary text as the logo displayed will be really small, making reading nearly impossible.<br></p>



<p>Finally, you will add a TXT record for <em>default._bimi.DomainAddress</em> in the following format: </p>



<pre><code>v=BIMI1; l=logoURL;</code></pre>



<p>For example, for Mailtrap it could be:</p>



<pre><code>v=BIMI1; l=https://www.mailtrap.io/logo123.svg;</code></pre>



<p>(it’s not really a valid address but if you wish to use our logo, let us know!)<br></p>



<p>That’s all. If you’re approved into the program and everything was configured properly, you should see the first effects within a few days.<br></p>



<h2><span id="Where_can_BIMI_authentication_make_a_difference">Where can BIMI authentication make a difference?</span></h2>



<p>When talking about BIMI authentication and its impact, the first thing that comes up is email security. After all, that’s precisely what BIMI record was introduced for. We also can’t underestimate the marketing impact it can have on brands. Let’s talk about these two aspects.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Security_impact">Security impact</span></h3>



<p>While DKIM and SPF help prevent spoofing, skillful fraudsters can bypass these measures, especially if only one of them is set up. DMARC is much more difficult, as domain alignment is also checked. Chances are someone will pass through.<br></p>



<p>That’s when BIMI comes very handy. Most users don’t check email addresses of the senders and email clients don’t display them right away. Instead, all users see is the display name of a sender, sometimes with company initials.<br></p>



<p>This can be easily spoofed. <strong>When a BIMI record is in place, a brand’s missing logo may raise a yellow flag </strong>for those used to seeing the branding displayed for each email.<br></p>



<p>Popularizing BIMI will also directly <strong>impact the adoption rate of DMARC</strong>. Even after several years since the release, most companies still don’t use this technology and, according to <a href="https://www.agari.com/insights/ebooks/2018-q4-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Agari’s research</a>, only 8% of Fortune 500 companies have ‘reject’ or ‘quarantine’ policies in place. All the others are vulnerable to attacks, most of which can be easily prevented with the more sophisticated tools.<br></p>



<p>It’s in the best interest of both users and email service providers to drive the adoption of DMARC. BIMI has a chance to finally move the numbers in the right direction.<br></p>



<h3><span id="Marketing_impact">Marketing impact</span></h3>



<p>BIMI implementation can have a major impact on marketing efforts. Since BIMI is and will be free to participate in, brands will get <strong>free exposure with almost no effort</strong>. Users will learn to recognize their logos right on the spot.<br></p>



<p>Emails signed with logos will also <strong>build users’ trust</strong>, especially if the content that follows is valuable. They will certainly feel safer opening emails from familiar sources.<br></p>



<p>BIMI will likely expand at some point to other forms of online communication. Those that participate will be able to continuously develop brand awareness and quickly gain recognition.<br></p>



<p>Since the BIMI logo for an email is fetched from a DNS every time a message is delivered, <strong>rebranding will also run smoother than it usually does</strong>. All it will take is updating an SVG file in the domain’s DNS and changes will be applied with the next email delivered.<br></p>



<h2><span id="Wrapping_up">Wrapping up</span></h2>



<p>All of this sounds really exciting and we’ll be watching closely how this all evolves. Many companies will surely take advantage of this opportunity and once the pilots wrap up, many more will follow their steps.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Chances are that a few years from now, we’ll be looking suspiciously at emails coming in without company logos. Or who knows, maybe a completely different approach will take over by then and change the way we think about email authentication.<br></p>



<p>Whether you’re eligible for the program or not, you likely have a vital interest in making your emails better, and rightly so.

<p>Hell, you'd be surprised at how many people buy games with a moderate length and never finish them. On PC over 50 percent of the people who bought the latest Wolfenstein, a game you can beat in under 15 hours, never earned the achievement for finishing the story. Only 31 percent of Dishonored players on the PC beat the game. People think game length is mandatory, but even shorter games aren't finished by the majority of players.

<p>Especially if you're starting out, try to do small projects and don't worry too much about polishing them, don't worry about shipping the perfect game, embrace the messiness of getting into games for the first time, embrace not knowing what you're doing exactly yet.

<p>Small-scale works are often derided for feeling embryonic or unfinished, throwaway motifs or fledgling ideas that the artist failed to integrate into a sufficiently ambitious whole. Game designer Jake Elliott, who drew the title of his Ruins from Schumann’s appraisal of Chopin’s preludes, defended their proportion in an interview: “Maybe [Chopin] felt like they were complete objects, but there wasn’t a vocabulary for talking about pieces of music that were short at the time. Their length is what drew me … there is a lot that’s unspoken.” Having conventionally privileged length, magnitude, and formal unity, games too have left critics bereft of a clear rubric for evaluating intentionally abbreviated, serialized, even disorderly exercises in interactive design.<br><strong>— Peter Lido: Undertale, one year later</strong><br><a href="https://killscreen.com/articles/undertale-one-year-later/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://killscreen.com/articles/undertale-one-year-later/</a></p>

<p>The final idea that we brought over as gamers, the final idea that we had to let go of, was that a longer game makes a better game. We felt that the sense of completion and catharsis that you get when you watch our ending was so critical to the experience, that we decided that we had to help as many people as possible to complete Monument Valley. And that was more important than making the game longer or more difficult.<br><strong>— Ken Wong: Games Without Gamers (#DICE2014 Europe)</strong><br><a href="http://youtu.be/YdSClYHDow0?t=13m37s" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/YdSClYHDow0?t=13m37s</a></p>

<p>Small games must be protected from their own defenders!! They must be defended against a rhetoric of convenience, as if fitting helpfully into the meagre free time allotted us by rentiers was something to be proud of rather than something to grind against - they must be defended against the meagre virtues of "minimalism", parsimony, elegance, the values of those with enough cultural cachet that they can afford to speak softly, and which hold the same relation to an actual human economy of wants and needs as does a millionaire who doesn't tip.<br><strong>— thecathamites: Small Game Manifesto (part of&nbsp;Buttertown, 10 manifestos for groups of no people)</strong><br><a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/buttertown">https://thecatamites.itch.io/buttertown</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2><p>Traditionally services were deployed on bare metal and in the last decades we have seen the rise of virtualisation (running additional operating systems in a operating system process) and lately containerisation (running an operating system process in a separate security context from the rest of processes on the same host). Virtualisation and containerisation offers different levels of isolation by moving some operating system functionality to the guest systems.</p><p>The following chart illustrates that pretty well:</p><p><img src="https://dev.l1x.be/img/isolation.png" alt="OS functionality location"></p><p>Source: <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/vee20_blending.pdf">https://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/vee20_blending.pdf</a></p><p>In this article, I perform a deep dive into Firecracker and how it can be used for deploying services on Raspberry Pi (4B).</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>There are few paths to take here. First I am going to try the easy one, using Ubuntu. Later on we can investigate the use of Alpine Linux which is much more lightweight than Ubuntu, ideal for devices like RPI.</p><h3 id="installing-the-image-on-a-microsd-card">Installing the image on a microSD card</h3><p>We need a 64 bit Ubuntu image and a microsd card. For the imaging I use <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Balena Etcher</a> that makes the imaging process super easy.</p><p>Getting the pre-installed image:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/20.04/release/<span>\
</span><span></span>ubuntu-20.04.1-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz
</code></pre></div><p>Preinstalled means that we get a fully working operating system and there is no need for additional installation steps after booting up. With Balena Etcher it is super easy to write the compressed image file to the sd card and boot the system up once ready. SSHD starts up after the installation and we can log in via ssh if we know the IP address that the DHCP server issues to our device (assuming DHCP server is present in our LAN).</p><p>There are few mildly annoying things with Ubuntu (snaps, unattended-upgrades) that I usually remove. I also prefer to use Chrony over the systemd equivalent.

November 23, 2020 | https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this post I’ll show you how to use a Raspberry Pi and some soldering skills to automate old Somfy blinds via the MQTT protocol exposed to Home Assistant and Google Home.</p><p>We’ve moved to a new apartment and one of its features are external blinds (a.k.a. covers) that are controlled through a dedicated remote of the Somfy brand. However, just like with a TV, finding the remote is often tricky, so I decided to try and automate the external blind movements through Home Assistant and further voice commands of Google Home.</p><p>The system in place is a Somfy’s Telis 4 RTS Pure remote, with two remotes, each being able to program 5 channels (4 individual ones and combined). The system uses a legacy, proprietary radio protocol called <a href="https://service.somfy.com/downloads/nam_v4/rts_pocket_guide_dec_2017.pdf">RTS</a>, which only Somfy and Telis use.</p><p>Somfy offers a RTS bridge called <a href="https://www.somfysystems.com/en-us/products/1811403/mylink">Somfy MyLink</a> for a wooping ~300CHF, which is a little steep for something that is not necessary and just scratching an itch. Also, there’s not much fun in that.</p><p>Turns out, <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/">Nickduino</a> had a similar itch to scratch. Using 3-4 CHF-worth of hardware components, it is quite easy to build a software radio that will immitate a Somfy Telis remote and control the blinds.</p><p>There’s an bare-bones <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Somfy_Remote/blob/master/Somfy_Remote.ino">Somfy Remote Arduino sketch</a> that shows how the protocol works. I originally wanted make the blind controller as small as possible and base it on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32">ESP32</a>, taking that sketch and controlling it via <a href="https://github.com/256dpi/arduino-mqtt">arduino-mqtt</a>.</p><p>Turns out there is a full MQTT/web interface script <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Pi-Somfy">Nickduino/Pi-Somfy</a> that also only goes into the details of how to solder things, and connect things onto a Raspberry Pi. Laziness won the day, especially as I wanted to use my spare Pi for something anyway.</p><h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2><p>Usually for 433MHz signals you could easily use a ready-made module such us <a href="https://www.berrybase.ch/raspberry-pi-co/raspberry-pi/module-sensoren/433mhz-sender-empf-228-nger-superregeneration-modul-fs1000a-xy-fst-xy-mk-5v">this 2CHF sender-receiver pair</a>. However, in order for Somfy to make their RTS even more proprietary than it already was, it is not using the typical <code>433.93MHz</code> frequency but <code>433.42MHz</code> 🤦‍♂️. This means one will need to do some soldering.</p><p>The PiSomfy <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Pi-Somfy#2-hardware">hardware guide</a> is excellent in telling you what you need. I got:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/5x-433Mhz-RF-transmitter-and-receiver-kit-Module-Arduino-ARM-WL-MCU-Raspberry-Fc-/254607185239?hash=item3b47c55557">5 ready <code>433.93MHz</code> sender circuits</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/10pcs-433-42m-433-42mhz-r433-f433-saw-resonator-crystals-to-39-/331637441887?hash=item4d3721c55f">10 pieces of the <code>433.42MHz</code> oscilator</a> - because my soldering is terrible</li><li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/40PCS-20cm-2-54MM-FF-FM-MM-Dupont-wire-jumper-cables-male-to-female-For-Arduino/312724733910?hash=item48cfd8bfd6:g:05sAAOSwlbZdSZ6E">male-male jumper cables</a> - to avoid soldering 😉</li><li>(already had it) a solid copper cable to use as an antenna</li></ul><p>After 4 weeks, all the eBay items were in place, and I could start soldering. Turns out de-soldering things off is much harder than soldering things on. I managed to peel away the original oscillator with by applying leverage underneath it using a swiss army knife and heating its connectors one by one. Soldering the new one was quite easy in comparison.</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/soldering.jpg" alt="It&amp;rsquo;s not pretty but it worked." width="600"><figcaption><p>It’s not pretty but it worked.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I then took a 17cm piece of solid copper cable, and wrapped it into a small coil. Turns out soldering a think 1mm cable to a tiny connector was the trickiest bit, but with the right amount of patience, things will stick eventually.</p><p>Eventually, the fully connected sender fits nicely into a Raspberry Pi enclosure after connecting everything to the GPIO 4 pin:</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/final_side_by_side.jpg" alt="All fits nicely into a standard Pi enclosure. The remote we&amp;rsquo;ll be replacing are on the left." width="700"><figcaption><p>All fits nicely into a standard Pi enclosure. The remote we’ll be replacing are on the left.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="programming">Programming</h2><p>Installing Pi-Somfy is super easy, just follow <a href="https://github.com/Nickduino/Pi-Somfy#3-software">these steps</a>. It assume you install it under the default <code>pi</code> user in <code>/home/pi</code>, and comes with a handy <code>systemctl</code> service for auto-starting the system.</p><p>By default it will come up on port <code>:80</code> of your Pi. Programming the blinds takes a little bit of time. The procedure is as follows:</p><ul><li>Set the right channel (individual blind, or all) on the remote you’re programming from.</li><li>Measure the time in seconds it takes for each blind to come fully down.</li><li>Click <em>Add new</em> to put in the name (this will be your MQTT name by the way) and add in the time.</li><li>Using a pen, press the “hole” on the other side of the remote. This sends the signal to the blind to accept programming a new remote.</li><li>Press <em>Save</em> and follow the instructions. The blind should “wiggle” once programmed.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: The system relies on time to figure out where the blind is percentage-wise. It can often get things wrong (e.g. if you stopped it mid-through), or on the all-channel if blinds have different lengths (e.g. balcony). But in practice it works remarkably well.</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/pi_remote.png" alt="Fully programmed blinds." width="700"><figcaption><p>Fully programmed blinds.</p></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">MQTT</a> is a standard protocol for message brokers, and finds a lot of use in home IoT. For most use cases, it has a simple publish-subscribe mechanic based on topics.</p><h2 id="installing-mosquitto">Installing Mosquitto</h2><p>Home Assistant has an embedded MQTT broker, but it is <em>highly advised</em> to use an external one, such as Mosquitto. You should install it on the same machine that runs Home Assistant, as it will act as a hub for other MQTT-connected services. To do that on Ubuntu:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
</code></pre></div><p>Now let’s set up a password file in <code>/etc/mosquitto/passwd</code> with a user for <code>homeassistant</code> and <code>pisomfy</code>.</p><pre><code>sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd homeassistant
Password: YourHomeAssistantPassword
sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd pisomfy
Password: YourPiSomfyPassword
</code></pre><p>Then, enforce use of passwords in mosquitto by editing <code>/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/default.conf</code> and changing it to:</p><pre><code>allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
</code></pre><p>For debugging purposes, open a separate tab on the same machine and subscribe to all messages under the <code>home-assistant/#</code> topic via:</p><pre><code>mosquitto_sub -u homeassistant -P YourHomeAssistantPassword -p 1883 -h 127.0.0.1 -v -t "home-assistant/#"
</code></pre><p>This will come in handy to check things are working.</p><h2 id="configuring-home-assistant">Configuring Home Assistant</h2><p>Update your <code>/etc/homeassistant/configuration.yaml</code> to add:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>mqtt</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>broker</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>127.0.0.1</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>username</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>homeassistant</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>password</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"YourHomeAssistantPassword"</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>discovery</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Restart Home Assistant</p><pre><code>sudo systemctl restart homeassistant
</code></pre><h3 id="configure-pisomfy">Configure PiSomfy</h3><p>On your Pi machine, open <code>/home/pi/operateShutters.conf</code> and edit the `[MQTT] section to look as follows</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span>[MQTT]</span>
<span># Location (IP Address of DNS Name) of the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_Server</span> <span>=</span> <span>myHAmachine # or hostname of your home assistant machine</span>
<span># Port of the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_Port</span> <span>=</span> <span>1883</span>
<span># Username for the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_User</span> <span>=</span> <span>pisomfy</span>
<span># Password of the MQTT Server</span>
<span>MQTT_Password</span> <span>=</span> <span>YourPiSomfyPassword</span>
<span># Enable auto discovery</span>
<span>EnableDiscovery</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And restart the service:</p><pre><code>sudo systemctl restart shutters.conf`
</code></pre><p>At this point the tab with the subscriptions should be full of messages. These are auto-discovery messages over MQTT for each of the programmed covers. This will cause Home Assistant to automatically add the entities.</p><p>They should show up with the same names as in PiSomfy.</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/home_assistant_entities.png" alt="Home Assistant Entities auto discovered via MQTT." width="800"><figcaption><p>Home Assistant Entities auto discovered via MQTT.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Adding them to a dashboard is relatively trivial, for example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>type</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>entities</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>entities</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>entity</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>cover.lr_all</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Living Room Covers</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>In order to simplify things, I wanted to only expose the <code>_all</code> blinds (a.k.a. covers) to Google Home/Assistant. For that I added an explicit section in the <code>/etc/homeassistant/configuration.yaml</code> section of <code>google_assistant</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>google_assistant</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span># ...</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>exposed_domains</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>fan</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>entity_config</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>cover.br_all</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>      </span><span>expose</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>

</span><span>      </span><span>aliases</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>        </span>- <span>"Living Room Covers"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>After restarting Home Assistant, and uttering the magical <em>Ok Google, Sync All Devices</em>, the covers will show up in your Home App:</p><figure><img src="https://mwitkow.me/posts/2020-11-08_somfy/google_home.jpg" alt="Looks like a blind, acts as a blind." width="300"><figcaption><p>Looks like a blind, acts as a blind.</p></figcaption></figure><p>This means you can controll it using keywords:</p><ul><li><em>Ok Google, close Bedroom covers</em></li><li><em>Ok Google, open Bedroom covers</em></li><li><em>Ok Google, set Bedroom covers to 50%</em></li></ul><p>The killer feature is setting this up as a routine to open/close the blind as you wake up, go to sleep.</p><p>Happy hacking :)</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>This article – the first in a series – will walk you through the basics of Portapack MAYHEM firmware, installation and some hands-on testing of RF spoofing, DoS and Replay Attacks.</p><p>The <a href="https://bit.ly/2UUKgRG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PortaPack is a HackRF software defined radio plus screen/keypad under $200</a> which allows you to go portable with the HackRF and a battery pack. It features a small touchscreen LCD and an iPod like control wheel that is used to control custom HackRF firmware which includes an audio receiver, several built in digital decoders and transmitters too. With the PortaPack no PC is required to receive or transmit with the HackRF.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/7edf36e9aaecaea695b6914190d5ec2ad2cb49d7c4d8bb94ae8535996ba0931f.jpeg"></p><p>The functionality of your portapack depends on the software you run on it. There are several options but running the MAYHEM firmware will then give you some a really amazing amount of cool features. While listening to transmissions from ships, planes or emergency services is hardly news to police scanner owners using the Portapack is as easy as entering the correct frequency. </p><p>Channel information for almost any Police/Fire Deparment Radio could be found on RadioReference Wiki, sample <a href="https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/New_York_Times_Square_New_Year's_Eve_ball_drop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Scanner frequencies for the annual Times Square New Years Celebration</a>.</p><p>But where the MAYHEM firmware stands out is in the ability to receive and transmit data from digital messaging systems, remote controls, smart car sensors and others. It can even spoof critical beacon signals as those from aircraft transponders or GPS satellites. </p><p>As of the time of this post the currently available decoders and transmit options can be seen in the screenshots below.  Note that for the transmitter options, there are some there that could really land you in trouble with the law so be very careful to exercise caution and only transmit what you are legally allowed to.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/37de762b5b6f97bb464fdd6179ce9f37cdd05785731fee0b8d461eb55bf0f84c.png"></p><p>The PortaPack add-on hardware to the HackRF was released several years ago  but the firmware was not developed very far beyond listening to audio and implementing a few transmitters. For a time this interesting device was forgotten compared to its brother HackRF. After some years the third party 'Havoc' firmware by 'furrtek' greatly expanded the list of  decoders and transmit options. Unfortunately the havok firmware is no longer maintained so we're now looking at the open-source <a href="https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MAYHEM firmware</a> by ’eried’, an active fork with even more features.</p><p>Another reason why the Portapack is becoming more popular is because of its dropping price. Both the Portapack and the HackRF are open source hardware, anyone can produce their own device based on the code and available designs. Therefore a "clone" of Portapack is just as good as an original one. With open source code hardware there is no such thing as genuine hardware. For this reason, right now it is possible to find a complete <a href="https://bit.ly/2UUKgRG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HackRF and Portapack kits offers from China</a>, for half the $500 which is what it initially cost when it was released years ago.</p><p><strong>Installation</strong></p><p>There are two versions of the portapack: the Portapack H1 and the Portapack H2, the only difference is the screen size. Both are fully compatible with MAYHEM, in my case I choose the H1 because is cheaper.</p><p>Installing the firmware is really easy. One of the characteristics of the HackRF along with the Portapack is that it is practically impossible to brick, so there is no need to worry about this process. It is always recommended to update the firmware with the latest realease of the project, since although some vendors even include the old Havoc or even the new Mayhem firmware, they are rarely the latest version since it is a project that adds constant improvements.</p><p>Download last release from <a href="https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/eried/portapack-mayhem/releases</a></p><h4>Windows</h4><ol><li>Connect the device via USB</li><li>Switch to HackRF mode via the on-screen option (in the PortaPack)</li><li>Double click <code>flash_portapack_mayhem.bat</code> and follow the instructions</li><li>Reboot the device</li></ol><h4>Linux</h4><ol><li>Connect the device via USB</li><li>Switch to HackRF mode via the on-screen option (in the PortaPack)</li><li>Upload the firmware with <code>hackrf_spiflash -w new_firmware_file.bin</code></li><li>Reboot the device</li></ol><h2><strong>Hands-on Testing</strong></h2><p>The list of supported radio protocols on MAYHEM is impressive: Police Scanner, IQ file replay,  Microphone FM transmit with CTCSS, CTCSS decoder, Frequency manager (save &amp; load from SD card, with categories and notes), "Soundboard" wave file player from  files in SD card , ADS-B receiver with map view, ADS-B transmitter (aircraft spoof), SSTV transmitter, Fully configurable jammer, POCSAG transmitter, POCSAG receiver/decoder, Morse transmitter (FM tone and CW), OOK transmitter for common remote encoders (PT2262, doorbells, remote outlets, some garage doors, ...), RDS (Radio Data System) PSN, RadioText and Time groups transmitter, Meteorological ballon radiosonde receiver (M10, M2K2, ...) , AFSK receiver, AFSK transmitter (Bell202, ...) , Nuoptix DTMF sync transmitter, French LCR (Language de Commande Routier) message generator,  Street lighting control transmitter (CCIR tones), Fully configurable RF signal generator, car TPMS decoder, car keyfoob spoofer (Subaru), Nordic NRF decoder, APRS decoder and transmitter, RSSI audio output as pitch (for direction finding), BurgerPager Spoofer, and more. </p><p>For audio RX/TX you need a TRRS (3 ring) jack plug with the Left-Right-Mic-Ground arrangement.

Quadrature signals, also called IQ signals, IQ data or IQ samples, are often used in RF applications. They form the basis of complex RF signal modulation and demodulation, both in hardware and in software, as well as in complex signal analysis. </p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/e1e529faea7da42ebc0d3c7482281688438d438bd58d75248778ff1c9ffa95d7.png"></p><p>For simplicity, you can consider that an IQ capture is a raw capture without any type of demodulation applied and that holds enough information to later be able to analyze its content and decode. Conversely, if we encode a RF signal in IQ format, it will be very easy to send it to the air.</p><p>Black Hills Infosec has a great introduction to RF Replay attacks over their blog. <a href="https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/how-to-replay-rf-signals-using-sdr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/how-to-replay-rf-signals-using-sdr/</a></p><p>The best thing about the Portapack is that you do not need practically any RF knowledge or work to launch this attack, therefore it is very easy to check whether a system is vulnerable or not, before taking the time to analyzing the protocol in more depth.</p><p><strong>REMOTE CONTROLS</strong></p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/9622d19919fe2d8c3271835fea7fb2ccf707994339c8d3d0b433f910ca416ee7.jpeg"></p><p>Many of the remote-control systems we use today still use insecure protocols without any encryption or spread spectrum. Furthermore, systems based on fixed codes are still extensively used. That make basic wireless remote control rather easy to implement, but also utterly insecure. They are commonly used in inexpensive wireless devices to control garage doors, fans, toys and even some alarm systems.</p><p>Our Portapack supports sending command through various remote-control protocols. Among them the PT2262/PT2272. These ICs utilize fixed address codes and no inherent encryption so they are not high security devices.</p><p>PT2272 presents 4 bits of data and uses 8 bits address. Keep in mind that these are tri-state bits, so they can have low, float and high states. Capturing these codes from the air is incredibly easy with an SDR and software like rtl_433.  Addressing is often implemented with solder pads but, occasionally with jumpers and rarely with tri-state dip switches.  And a special note, as we have said the floating value (without any soldering) is totally valid and would work fine. Therefore in the world there are possibly thousands or tens of thousands  PT2272 devices installed by default where no code was configured so are working using the FFFFFF address.</p><p><strong>POCSAG</strong></p><p>A pager (also known as a beeper) is a wireless telecommunications device that receives and displays alphanumeric or voice messages. Pagers became widely used by the 1980s. In the 21st century, the widespread availability of cellphones and smartphones has greatly diminished the pager industry. Nevertheless, pagers continue to be used by some emergency services and public safety personnel, because pager systems reliability in some cases, including during natural and man-made disasters. This resilience has led public safety agencies to still adopt pagers over cellular and other commercial services for critical messaging.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/36d41b79f69415348d802e12e78e7ccc8d4922b4a522414a135a3823baa01405.png"></p><p>Although there are several protocols for Pagers the most common is POCSAG. This protocol dates from the 80s and although there are more modern alternatives, it has become the de facto standard in the industry. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/nhs-pagers-medical-health-data/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACZR9IHPYbq7SUYuzrM7Fs-IXdOi6U2iEmmte1ckW9sdBkKjXuwog8HTVBNTPTJd0gxyb-Xr68nClGiopHSYFVhgBXZbrgWOd0L88OyPaGncTCA77v55GXcwGY99gQHiwhq3H2t4vLRPViqJVlY9aoKlTfO89v6SBfTo8hNXaf9W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Pagers have been under the scrutiny of information security experts for some time now as it is common for hospital pagers to spew out unencrypted patient data into the air for anyone with a radio and computer to decode</a>.

We only need to know the Freq, RIC address and the speed expected by the destination pager. All of this information could be easly be sniffed using the POCSAG sniffer or with  HackRF running software like <a href="https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimon-ng" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Multimon-ng</a>.

<p><em>Why do we only grow certain crops in certain areas?</em></p>



<p>One observation of agriculture production is the difference in species adaptation of various places around the world: bananas grown Central America, nuts and vegetables in California, citrus fruits in Florida, apples in Washington or New York, peanuts from the Southeast, etc. The is mostly a product of economic realities and efficiency: It is easier and cheaper to manage production (of whatever) when things are located physically near each other. This isn’t unique to agriculture, as many supply chains coalesce around centralized regions (electronic device productions, automobiles, etc.). Agriculture and food production supply chain occupy a different place on humanities priority list however, and despite applying a similar ethos to essential and luxury items, there have been few catastrophic consequences from these decisions. Agriculture and the food supply chain has mostly <em>found a way</em> over the past ~100 years. It may be time to rethink or start planning for a different strategy. One possible strategy to overcome disease and pest issues that currently reduce or harm our food production systems is to <em>decentralize</em> the areas we produce many of these crops. This would potentially alleviate several problems: 1) if a pest or pathogen infests one area, the entire crop is not lost 2) transportation costs can be reduced to the consumer resulting in 3) faster delivery from harvest to consumer (thereby increasing quality and taste).</p>



<p>To be clear, decentralization is catching on in various industries (e.g. finance technology platforms), but the concept has always been baked into agriculture without much fanfare. Residents of the United States that have travelled to Hawaii may remember <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/" target="_blank">USDA APHIS</a> having an interest in certain plant species you may may brought along (or are trying to remove). All of that paperwork and questionnaire’s are to mitigate unintended introductions of invasive species or pathogens. One of the most economically devastating pests to harm soybean production (in the United States) is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disandpath/nematode/pdlessons/Pages/SoyCystNema.aspx" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disandpath/nematode/pdlessons/Pages/SoyCystNema.aspx" target="_blank">soybean cyst nematode</a>. This pathogen was not native to the United States and was <em>introduced</em> ~75 years ago. Any mitigations to prevent its spread were ineffective due to its pathogenicity and the sheer scale of soybean production in the United States. Major rows crops such as maize, soybean, wheat, and cotton reside in a different tier regarding scale of production compared to ‘specialty’ crops (namely fruits, vegetables, nuts, spices, etc.) and are not candidates for decentralizing strategies.</p>



<p>There are several high level strategies for optimizing production and profitability of the food we eat. For example, over the past ~125 years we have been optimizing maize production for the Midwest region of the United States via technological (tractors, chemical) and scientific (adapted hybrids) means. We have been successful doing this because maize was already able to be grown in Midwest thanks to the thousands of years of gradual adaptation to the United States from a plant native to Mexico (that plant being: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2009/03/23/corn-domesticated-from-mexican-wild-grass-8700-years-ago/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2009/03/23/corn-domesticated-from-mexican-wild-grass-8700-years-ago/" target="_blank">teosinte</a>). For as ubiquitous as maize is to the Midwest region of the United States, mother nature did not produce that outcome, man did. It took a long time, but humans successfully shifted the areas of adaptation of maize and indeed many other crops to what we currently see today. Tomatoes are another good example of humans bending plants to our will: Italy <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/italy-italian-processed-tomato-overview-2018#:~:text=Italy%20is%20a%20world%20leading,more%20than%20%E2%82%AC3.1%20billion.&amp;text=Italy%20is%20both%20a%20leading%20exporter%20and%20importer%20of%20tomato%20products." data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/italy-italian-processed-tomato-overview-2018#:~:text=Italy%20is%20a%20world%20leading,more%20than%20%E2%82%AC3.1%20billion.&amp;text=Italy%20is%20both%20a%20leading%20exporter%20and%20importer%20of%20tomato%20products." target="_blank">produces around 50% of European and ~15% processed tomatoes</a> despite tomatoes not being introduced until the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery" target="_blank">Age of Discovery</a>. Bending or manipulating useful plants to grow in non-native areas is as old as farming (~10,000 BCE). Better yet, all of this adaptation was accomplished using <em>existing, </em>or native, genetic variation within their own species.</p>



<p>The theme of these examples is: ‘<em>It is possible</em>‘. With modern genomic information, we now have the tooling to do this for innumerable species. We need to start doing the same for more high value crops–namely species that are grown in geographically concentrated areas (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/graphics/orgmap.png" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/graphics/orgmap.png" target="_blank">citrus</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/rssiws/al/crop_production_maps/us/USA_Peanut_Total_Lev2_Prod.png" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/rssiws/al/crop_production_maps/us/USA_Peanut_Total_Lev2_Prod.png" target="_blank">nuts</a>, vegetables, etc.). Modern tools (genome editing, genomic sequence data, phylogeny trees, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189332/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189332/" target="_blank">mutagenesis</a>) could allow us to make these species adapted to more diverse growing regions via photoperiod sensitivity changes, cold tolerance, heat tolerance, altitude sensitivity, flowering time and length, growth habitat, and many more traits that define ‘adaptation’ to a given geographical unit. Many scientific studies focus on utilizing natural diversity to make production greater in <em>existing</em> areas of adaptation. This makes sense (despite being short-sighted on rare occasions): growing crops is a for-profit industry so it makes sense to harness the species that are already well-adapted to the region maximize those efficiencies. But again, food production cannot be exclusively dominated by this myopic view; after all many government would deem food supply and production as a national security topic. Clearly, the United States government acts as if they believe this to some degree as well, with heavily subsidies buoying maize, soybean, cotton, and wheat production (along with several other meat and dairy industries).</p>



<p>There are other reasons to look into decentralizing production of key species though. If we had citrus that was adapted to Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Michigan, these growing regions could avoid the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/citrus-greening/citrus-greening-hp" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/citrus-greening/citrus-greening-hp" target="_blank">citrus greening problems</a> of the Southeast United States by sheer physical isolation. To be clear this problem does not have an all or none solution. We need strategies to circumvent disease and pathogens <em>in</em> their current areas of production and even if production of most fruits, vegetables <em>could</em> be done in dozens of decentralized regions it adds overhead to research and development programs as they might have to tackle 5 small problems versus 1 big problem. These are known problems in centralized structures versus decentralized structures. Since food production has unique value to humans, it worth exploring whether the costs outweigh the benefits. Fruit species in particular are extremely perishable, so while the consumers values taste and quality, the producer and supplier values transportability and storage. If we remove the logistics of long distance transport via increasing production centers, scientists could focus on improving taste and quality.</p>



<p>An obvious argument against pursuing a decentralized strategy in specialty crops is the potential rise of indoor/vertical (and de-facto isolated) farms. This is an interesting proposition but I maintain the scale of production for many species of interest is simply too large to be handled in a cost effective manner in a indoor operation. Remember, outdoor grown crops have free energy in the sun and free nutrients from the soil. Indoor agriculture has to supply these somehow (and they are not free). That’s not to dismiss indoor agriculture as a supplementary component as it already is for several crops, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=92604" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=92604" target="_blank">as about ~25% of tomatoes non-outdoor origins</a>. I continue to maintain indoor agriculture production systems can only even be sustainable for extremely high-value, low utilization specialty crops that cannot harness outdoor production systems (think spices, niche vegetables). It should be an active goal to get fruit, vegetables, and nut production decentralized in an outdoor setting that can harness soil and sunlight that are already prevalent.</p>



<p>High level movements like this are needed in agriculture to secure the food supply and add some shock absorbers to any potential pest or pathogen disruption. There is to much technology at our fingertips to not get something going. It simply appears the marker is ignoring this segment while most of the focus remains on <em>current</em> production regions.</p>

<p>So day one went fairly smooth. Nothing too difficult to implement, as you can
expect from a first challenge. Since I’ve done some of the challenges last year
(implemented them in Go), I know that there will be a rapid ramp-up in
difficulty and that a number of challenges build “on top of each other”.
Perfect opportunities to start exploring how to write reuseable Haskell code.</p>
<p>But we’ll tackle that when the opportunity actually presents itself and not
make things more difficult than needed.</p>

<p>I will not describe the entire problem again, Advent of Code is way better at
that. But to make things simple: read numbers from a file, start at the first
number, execute an action based on the number and write the result of the
action somewhere.</p>
<p>In the first “note” (I wouldn’t call these ramblings articles) I started out
with some boilerplate by setting up the required files for Cabal, but lets not
do that this time, since I realised we don’t really need it (just yet).</p>
<p>I’ll just create a directory, create a Main.hs file and run stuff from GHCi to
get things working. In the end I’ll try to modify the program to take the input
program (intcode program) from the standard input, just as a challenge.</p>

<p>Lets get our environment setup.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19$ cd day2
jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19/day2$ touch Main.hs
jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19/day2$ ghci
GHCi, version 8.6.5: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? <span>for</span> help
Prelude&gt; :load Main.hs
<span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Great, that worked. The <code>Main.hs</code> file is still empty, but it works, no Cabal
or Stack needed to get something done. Now to open the editor from GHCi (with
<code>:edit</code> or <code>:e</code>) and start implementing this intcode machine.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">*Main&gt; :e
editor not set, use :set editor
*Main&gt; :set editor vim
*Main&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Oops, let make a mental note to actually set <code>$EDITOR</code> in my environment, guess
I don’t use it as often as thought.</p>
<p>So filling the Main.hs file with the same boilerplate as last time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>
				        print raw
</code></pre></div><p>Running the <code>main</code> function in GHCi does exactly as expected, it outputs the contents of the <code>input.txt</code> file. No big deal.</p>
<p>So after stubbing out the general outline of the program this is what I came up with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>module</span> Main <span>where</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> ()
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
        raw <span>&lt;-</span> readFile <span>"input.txt"</span>
        <span>-- split the input up into instructions (split on ,)</span>
        <span>let</span> input <span>=</span> parseInput raw
        <span>-- run the program</span>
        <span>let</span> output <span>=</span> runProgram input
        <span>-- get the value from first position in memory</span>
        <span>let</span> solution <span>=</span> output <span>!!</span> <span>0</span>
        print solution

<span>-- parseInput takes a string as input and outputs</span>
<span>-- an array of integers</span>
<span>parseInput</span> <span>=</span> id

<span>-- runProgram takes a piece of memory and returns</span>
<span>-- the state of memory after the program has completed</span>
<span>runProgram</span> <span>=</span> id
</code></pre></div><p>So we have two high level functions to define, sounds doable.</p>
<p>First challenge is to find a way to split the input string on the comma’s
separating the individual memory values. I heard “real Haskell programmers” use
<a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/">Hoogle</a> to find the functions they are looking for
based on the type signature they think “should get the job done”.</p>
<p>Since we’re looking to split a string based on a different string, the required
type signature should look something like <code>String -&gt; String -&gt; [String]</code>. But
after <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=String+-%3E+String+-%3E+%5BString%5D&amp;scope=set%3Ahaskell-platform">searching Hoogle for
it</a> I couldn’t find anything that looks like it might do the job. Of course I could
have just searched for a function called split, or some variation of it, but I wanted
to do it “the real way"TM. Luckily, after reading an article on <a href="https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2017/5/15/untangling-haskells-strings">Monday Morning Haskell</a>
I remembered that Haskell also has a <code>Text</code> type, offering some additional string handling
abilities.</p>

<div>
	<p>
    💡 I remain blisfully unaware of other benefits of using the `Text` type, please enlighten me if you want to.
  </p>
</div>
<p>Re-running the search with <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=Text+-%3E+Text+-%3E+%5BText%5D&amp;scope=set%3Ahaskell-platform"><code>Text -&gt; Text -&gt; [Text]</code></a> yielded exactly the result I was looking for: <code>splitOn</code>. So feeding the <code>raw</code> data into <code>splitOn</code> and splitting on <code>,</code> gives us a <code>[String]</code> which we only need to convert into a <code>[Int]</code>. The <code>splitOn</code> function is included in the <code>Data.Text</code> package, so we’ll have to import that as well. But then, the <code>readFile</code> we use to load the data gives us a <code>String</code>, so we’ll have to import <code>Data.Text.IO</code> as well to be able to utilize the <code>readFile</code> function from that (all found by using Hoogle).</p>
<p>At this point, let’s reconsider our solution of using the <code>splitOn</code> function as provided by <code>Data.Text</code> and research Hoogle for a different <code>splitOn</code> function. Turns out, there is a <code>splitOn</code> variant in <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/split-0.2.3.4/docs/Data-List-Split.html#v:splitOn"><code>Data.List.Split</code></a> that is generic (i.e. it accepts anything of the type <code>Eq a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]]</code>) so will probably accept a <code>String</code> as well. Let’s try it out in GHCi.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">GHCi, version 8.6.5: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? <span>for</span> help
Prelude&gt; :m + Data.List.Split
Prelude Data.List.Split&gt; splitOn <span>","</span> <span>"1,2,3,4,5"</span>
<span>[</span><span>"1"</span>,<span>"2"</span>,<span>"3"</span>,<span>"4"</span>,<span>"5"</span><span>]</span>
Prelude Data.List.Split&gt; :t splitOn <span>","</span> <span>"1,2,3,4,5"</span>
splitOn <span>","</span> <span>"1,2,3,4,5"</span> :: <span>[[</span>Char<span>]]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Awesome, we get something back that looks like a <code>[String]</code> (since a <code>String</code> is a <code>[Char]</code>). So we’ll be good to go to use this.</p>
<p>So let’s write a simple function to do this, iterate (<code>map</code>) over all the individual items and <code>read</code> them into a <code>[Int]</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- parseInput takes a string as input and outputs</span>
<span>-- an array of integers</span>
<span>-- parseInput :: String -&gt; [Int]</span>
<span>parseInput</span> <span>::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>parseInput</span> x <span>=</span> map read <span>$</span> splitOn <span>","</span> x
</code></pre></div><p>That takes care of getting our input ready. The second step involves a small nuance in the challenge:</p>
<pre><code>    Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity
    assist program (your puzzle input) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had
    just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the
    program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with the
    value 2. What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?
</code></pre>
<p>So we have to set the first value of the program to 12, and the second value to 2. This calls for a function
to replace a certain index in a <code>List</code>. At this point we could choose to replace the usage of <code>List</code> with <code>Data.Vector</code> which
offers this functionality by default. But for simplicity sake, let’s stay with our current solution and create a <code>replace</code> function
that takes an <code>Int</code> (the index), another <code>Int</code> (the new value) and a <code>List</code>, and returns a <code>List</code>. To build this function we use the <code>splitAt</code> function
provided by <code>Data.List.Split</code>, which we imported in the previous step anyway.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>replace</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>replace</span> i v xs <span>=</span> <span>let</span> (hxs, <span>_</span><span>:</span>txs) <span>=</span> splitAt i xs <span>in</span>
								   hxs <span>++</span> v <span>:</span> txs
</code></pre></div><p>which, when tested in GHCi, yields exactly what we want:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt; replace <span>2</span> <span>99</span> <span>[</span>1,2,3,4,5<span>]</span>
<span>[</span>1,2,99,4,5<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So we can construct our actual program with <code>replace 1 12 $ replace 2 2 input</code>, store it in a variable and use that to run the actual program.</p>

<div>
	<p>
    💡 Turns out, `Data.List.Index` has a function called `setAt` which does EXACTLY the same as our `replace` function. Unfortunately, this is only available as an external library, so I choose not to use it.
  </p>
</div>

<p>We have a list of numbers, which somehow translates to instructions to be executed by a virtual computer, mutating memory. Sounds easy right?</p>
<p>IMO, this is actually the easy part, it involves us creating a function that takes 4 numbers from the list, applying a certain mutation to memory based on the values in those four numbers, taking the next four numbers, etc. Untill we find the number 99.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>runProgramAt</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>runProgramAt</span> pc m <span>=</span> <span>let</span> opcode <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> pc
												left <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> (m <span>!!</span> (pc <span>+</span> <span>1</span>))
												right <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> (m <span>!!</span> (pc <span>+</span> <span>2</span>))
												result <span>=</span> m <span>!!</span> (pc <span>+</span> <span>3</span>)
												next <span>=</span> pc <span>+</span> <span>4</span> <span>in</span>
										<span>case</span> opcode <span>of</span>
												<span>-- 99 signals the end of the program, just return</span>
												<span>-- the entire memory</span>
												<span>99</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m
												<span>-- 1 indicates addition (left + right -&gt; result), continue</span>
												<span>-- with the next operation at pc + 4</span>
												<span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> runProgramAt next <span>$</span> replace result (left <span>+</span> right) m
												<span>-- 2 indicates multiplication (left * right -&gt; result), continue</span>
												<span>-- with the next operation at pc + 4</span>
												<span>2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> runProgramAt next <span>$</span> replace result (left <span>*</span> right) m
												<span>-- and to satisfy the compiler, give it a fallback case</span>
												<span>-- which just returns the entire memory and stops</span>
												otherwise <span>-&gt;</span> m
</code></pre></div><p>Now when I change my <code>runProgram</code> function to use this function to run the program starting at position 0 by changing it into
<code>runProgram = runProgramAt 0</code>, and running this from GHCi I get my correct answer:</p>

<p>Really typical, part 2 of the challenge involves us finding a set of input that yields a certain output. This reeks like a standard brute-force search. These can be done really efficiently in Haskell by using <a href="https://dev.to/awwsmm/relearn-you-a-haskell-part-2-list-comprehensions-tuples-and-types-g29">list comprehensions</a>. So probably we’ll end up with something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>findSolution</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>findSolution</span> s m <span>=</span> head [noun <span>*</span> <span>100</span> <span>+</span> verb <span>|</span> 
                    noun <span>&lt;-</span> [<span>0</span><span>..</span><span>99</span>], 
                    verb <span>&lt;-</span> [<span>0</span><span>..</span><span>99</span>], 
                    runProgram (replace <span>1</span> noun <span>$</span> replace <span>2</span> verb m) <span>!!</span> <span>0</span> <span>==</span> s]

</code></pre></div><p>When calling this function with the input supplied by the challenge:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- get the required input to complete part 2</span>
<span>let</span> nounverb <span>=</span> findSolution <span>19690720</span> input
<span>print</span> nounverb
</code></pre></div><p>it yields the correct solution, right away:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, interpreted <span>)</span>
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main&gt; main
<span>3101844</span>
<span>8478</span>
</code></pre></div><p>where the second answer is the answer for part 2. Given that I ran this in GHCi I expected it to be a bit slower, so let’s see if that’s the case:</p>
<pre><code>*Main&gt; :set +s
*Main&gt; main
3101844
8478
(1.04 secs, 3,337,885,928 bytes)
*Main&gt;
</code></pre><p>That seems about right, let’s try compiling and timing this as a standalone binary:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19/day2$ ghc Main.hs
<span>[</span><span>1</span> of 1<span>]</span> Compiling Main             <span>(</span> Main.hs, Main.o <span>)</span>
Linking Main ...
jeroen@DESKTOP:~/taoc19/day2$ time ./Main
<span>3101844</span>
<span>8478</span>

real    0m0.567s
user    …</code></pre></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Do the work.</p><p>That's all the productivity advice you need, and the only <em>useful</em> productivity advice you're ever going to get. You can direct your attention to a million optimizations— email, meetings, notes, calendar, time tracking, goals, todo lists, time estimates, prioritization frameworks, quantified self sensors, analytics, apps, documents, journaling. But don't. Ignore all this, and do the work. When you do the work, everything else optimizes itself.</p><p>If the only thing you must do is the work, why is there so much productivity advice? Blog posts, courses, seminars, software? Because when there is demand, there is supply. Work is hard. People will latch onto anything to avoid doing it. The market is happy to oblige.</p><p>Work means sitting down, getting through that calculus chapter, and doing the exercises. No amount of productivity hacking will make that easier. You don't need pomodoro alarms, bullet journals, time tracking apps, animated explainer videos, or different color highlighters. Everyone doesn't learn differently. Everyone learns calculus in the same way— by doing the work. You need Rudin's book, a pen, paper, and time. More tools give you negative utility. They won't make the work go faster. But they will consume as much time as you are willing to waste.</p><p>Building a new startup? Same thing. Talk to users all day. Then sit down and write the code. Get others to join you. Repeat. People do new founders a disservice by constantly proselytizing how complex startups are. In one sense they are. But in another sense they're surprisingly simple. For a long time you're doing the same three things over and over. Sell. Code. Recruit. Then do it all over again tomorrow. Startups don't get built by watching startup advice videos on YouTube. They get built by doing the work. All you need is a laptop and a metrocard.</p><p>I read a lot of biographies. People who have biographies written about them have two things in common. First, they are obsessed. Second, they never stray from doing the work. John Carmack was obsessed with game engines. Orville and Wilbur Wright were obsessed with manned flight. Leonardo da Vinci was obsessed with the structure of things. So they would code, construct, and paint. That's not to say they did no meta thinking. Carmack published plan files, the Wright brothers maintained extensive correspondence detailing their experiments, and Leonardo da Vinci is known for his magnificent notebooks. But you'd be hard pressed to find them writing letters about writing letters. They were busy doing the work.</p><p>An important ingredient for doing the work is boredom. That's how I got into programming. School was boring. We had three channels of television, and they were almost always boring. I had computer games, but I sucked at gaming and games quickly got frustrating. I read all the books that we had laying around. The only thing left was BASIC. So I started there and never stopped. The simple reason is that programming computers was the most interesting activity around.</p><p>If boredom is a necessary ingredient, then portable internet is a disaster for doing the work. How are you supposed to get excited about anything if you're never bored? I don't know if I ever would have learned to program if I had modern internet. Why would I, if something more interesting was always a click away? This is true to this day. I can't get anything done when I'm online. There is always something on the internet that's locally more interesting or more important than writing the next paragraph, or threading a flag through a series of function calls, or reading a book. The only way I can get anything done is to turn the internet off.</p><p>So I do. I have a work computer, and a router with parental controls that blocks every possible internet distraction on it. No Twitter, no Hacker News, no YouTube. Router administration is set up so I can't make changes over WiFi. If I want to unblock something, I have to physically get to the router and plug in a cable to change the settings. I power off every other device. No silent mode, no do not disturb, no hibernation. Power off. Recently a reader suggested putting my phone in a <a href="https://amzn.to/3fmBx4n">kSafe</a> (thanks Robert!) It works great, and now I’m doing that too. All this constructs enough physical barriers between me and temptation that the internet loses and my laziness wins.</p><p>Then I get properly bored. And then I do the work.</p></div></div>]]>

November 23, 2020 | https://panelbear.com/blog/tech-stack/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://panelbear.com/blog/tech-stack/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Being an engineer at heart, each time I see a company write about their tech stack, I brew a fresh cup of coffee, sit back and enjoy reading the newfound little treat.</p><p>There’s just something fascinating about getting to know what’s under the hood of other people’s businesses. It’s like gossip, but about software.</p><p>A couple of months ago I started working on <a href="https://panelbear.com/blog/why-panelbear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yet another private analytics service</a>, a project which has gone through numerous iterations, and I feel lucky that 400+ websites have already integrated with it, even though it's still in the early stages.</p><p>That’s why, in the same spirit as Jake Lazaroff’s <a href="https://jake.nyc/words/tools-and-services-i-use-to-run-my-saas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tools and Services I Use to Run My SaaS</a>, I thought it’s now my turn to do a short write up of the technologies I’m using to run this new service.</p><h2>Languages</h2><p>Over the years I have added many programming languages to my toolbelt, but for solo projects I have converged to two in particular that strike a good balance of productivity and reliability.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a>: Most of the backend code is in Python. Which has enabled me to ship features incredibly fast. Additionally, I use <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mypy</a> for optional type hints, which helps keep the codebase manageable.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typescript</a>: I used to avoid working on the frontend as much as I could. That is until I discovered Typescript about 4 years ago. It just makes the whole experience a lot better, and I now use it for all my projects together with React.</p></li></ul><h2>Frameworks and libraries</h2><p>This list could have been huge, as I stand on the shoulders of giants who have published the vast amount of open-source code which I rely on. But I'd like to highlight only a handful due to their major role in the stack:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Django</a>: It's like a superpower for solo developers. The longer you work in this industry, the more you appreciate not having to reinvent the wheel for the 100th time. A monolithic framework can get you <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/web-service-efficiency-at-instagram-with-python-4976d078e366" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really</a>, <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really</a> <a href="https://djangostars.com/blog/10-popular-sites-made-on-django/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far</a>. To me, it's about predictable software that's fast in every way that matters. In case you're interested, I talk more about this topic on <a href="https://panelbear.com/blog/boring-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose Boring Technology</a>.</li><li><a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a>: The web app for the dashboards is built using React + Webpack. After using Angular for a long time, I switched to React because it's just a pluggable view layer that doesn't get in the way. I use the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/Frojd/django-react-templatetags" target="_blank" rel="noopener">django-react-templatetags</a> to embed the React components in my Django templates.</li><li><a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextJS</a>: I use it for the landing pages, documentation and the blog which you are currently reading. It enables me to re-use various React components, and still reap the performance and SEO benefits of a statically generated site.</li><li><a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celery</a>: I use it for any kind of background/scheduled tasks. It does have a learning curve for more advanced use-cases, but it's quite reliable once you understand how it works, and more importantly when it fails.</li><li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootstrap 4</a>: I built a custom theme on top of Bootstrap. It has saved me a lot of time, and there's lots of documentation around it. That's why I picked it.</li></ul><h2>Databases</h2><p>I originally stored all data in a single SQLite database, doing backups meant making a copy of this file to an object storage like S3. At the time, it was more than enough for the small sites I tested Panelbear with. But as I added more features and websites, I needed more specialized software to support those features:</p><ul><li><a href="https://clickhouse.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clickhouse</a>: I believe this is one of those technologies that over time will become ubiquitous. It's honestly a fantastic piece of software that enabled me to build features that initially seemed impossible on low-cost hardware. I do intend to write a future blog post on some lessons learned from running Clickhouse on Kubernetes. So stay tuned!</li><li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL</a>: My go-to relational database. Sane defaults, battle-tested, and deeply integrated with Django. For Panelbear, I use it for all application data that is not analytics related. For the analytics data, I instead wrote a simple interface for querying Clickhouse within Django.</li><li><a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redis</a>: I use it for many things: caching, rate-limiting, as a task queue, and as a key/value store with TTL for various features. Rock-solid, and great documentation.</li></ul><h2>Deployment</h2><p>I treat my infrastructure as <a href="https://joachim8675309.medium.com/devops-concepts-pets-vs-cattle-2380b5aab313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cattle instead of pets</a>, things like servers and clusters are meant to come and go. So if one server gets "sick", I just replace it with another one. That means everything is described as code in a git repo, and I do not change things by SSH'ing into the servers. You can think of it like a template to clone my entire infrastructure with one command into any AWS region/environment.</p><p>This also helps me in case of disaster recovery. I just run a few commands, and some minutes later my stack has been re-created. This was particularly useful when I moved from DigitalOcean, to Linode, and recently to AWS. Everything is described in code, so it's easy to keep track of what components I own, even years later (all companies have some AWS IAM policy or VPC subnet lurking around which was created via clicky-clicky on the UI, and now everyone depends on it).</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform</a>: I manage most of my cloud infrastructure with Terraform. Things like EKS clusters, S3 buckets, roles, and RDS instances are declared in my Terraform manifests. The state is synced to an encrypted S3 bucket to avoid getting in trouble in case something happens to my development laptop.</li><li><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker</a>: I build everything as Docker images. Even stateful components like Clickhouse or Redis are packaged and shipped as Docker containers to my cluster. It also makes my stack very portable, as I can run it anywhere I can run Docker.</li><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a>: Allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously. However, I wouldn’t bindly recommend it to everyone, as I already felt comfortable working with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. I also rely on managed offerings, which helps reduce the burden too.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Actions</a>: Normally I’d use <a href="https://circleci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CircleCI</a> in the past (which is also great), but for this project I prefer to use GitHub Actions as it removes yet another service which needs to have access to my repositories, and deployment secrets. However, CircleCI has plenty of good features, and I still recommend it.</li></ul><h2>Infrastructure</h2><p>I started in a single $5/mo instance in DigitalOcean, then moved to the managed Kubernetes offering as I was reinventing the wheel for a lot of things Kubernetes already gives me out of the box (service discovery, TLS certs, load balancing, log rotation, rollout, scaling, fault-tolerance, among others).</p><p>Unfortunately, I had <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/kubernetes-unable-to-connect-to-the-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliability issues</a> with DigitalOcean's Kubernetes offering, even on larger instances. The cluster API would often go down randomly and no longer recover, this disrupted a lot of cluster services including the load balancer, which translated into downtime for me. I had to create a new cluster each time this happened, and while Terraform made it trivial, this was not something that inspired a lot of confidence about their managed service. I suspect their control plane was underprovisioned, which would be kind of understandable given the price tag.</p><p>Unfortunately I was not able to resolve the issue after several weeks. That's why I decided to move to <a href="https://www.linode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linode</a>, and had exactly 0 problems during the 1.5 month-long honeymoon that followed.</p><p>However, I recently moved once again, this time to AWS due to a pretty good deal I received. It also enabled me to use managed services like RDS to offload managing PostgreSQL, which is a big plus. What made all these migrations relatively easy, was that all my infrastructure was described via Terraform and Kubernetes manifests. The migrations essentially consisted of an evening, some tea, and patience. But that's for another post.</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS</a>: Predictable, and lots of managed services. However, I use it at my full-time job, so I didn't have to spend too much time figuring things out. The main services I use are EKS, ELB, S3, RDS, IAM and private VPCs. I might also add Cloudfront and Kinesis in the future.</li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a>: I mainly use it for DDoS protection, serving DNS, and offloading edge caching of various static assets (currently shaves off 80% of the egress charges from AWS - their bandwidth pricing is insane!).</li><li><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Encrypt</a>: Free SSL certificate authority. I use cert-manager in my Kubernetes cluster to automatically issue and renew certificates based on my ingress rules.</li><li><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Namecheap</a>: My domain name registrar of choice. Allows MFA for login which is an important security feature. Unlike other registrars, they haven't surprised me with an expensive renewal every few years. I like them.</li></ul><h2>Kubernetes components</h2><p>The following components automate most of the devops work for me. I use several others too, but some of the main ones I use are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ingress-nginx</a>: Rock-solid ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy, and load balancer. Sits behind the NLB which controls ingress to the cluster nodes.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cert-manager</a>: Automatically issue/renew TLS certs as defined in my ingress rules.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">external-dns</a>: Synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers (such as Cloudflare).</li><li><a href="https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prometheus-operator</a>: Automatically monitors most of my services, and exposes dashboards via Grafana.</li><li><a href="https://fluxcd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flux</a>: GitOps way to do continuous delivery in Kubernetes. Basically pulls and deploys new Docker images when I release them.</li></ul><h2>CLI tools</h2><p>There’s plenty here, but frequently used include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kubectl</a>: To interact with the Kubernetes cluster to watch logs, pods and services, SSH into a running container, and so on.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/wercker/stern" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stern</a>: Multi pod log tailing for Kubernetes. Really handy.</li><li><a href="https://htop.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">htop</a>: Interactive system process viewer. Better than “top” if you ask me.</li><li><a href="https://curl.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cURL</a>: Issue HTTP requests locally, inspect headers.</li><li><a href="https://httpie.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTPie</a>: Like cURL, but simpler for JSON APIs.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/rakyll/hey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hey</a>: Load testing HTTP endpoints. Gives a nice latency distribution summary.</li></ul><h2>Monitoring</h2><ul><li><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prometheus</a>: Efficient storage of time series data for monitoring. Tracks all the cluster and app metrics. It was a lot cheaper than using Cloudwatch for app metrics.</li><li><a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grafana</a>: Nice dashboards for the Prometheus monitoring data. All dashboards are described in JSON files and versioned in the …</li></ul></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jamstack is a new architectural approach with the core principle of pre-rendering aiming to make web applications to:</p>
<ul>
<li>run faster,</li>
<li>be more secure,</li>
<li>be easier to scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that achieved with the use of many modern tools to bring productivity to the maximum. Sounds interesting right? This approach is gaining a lot of popularity which makes a market for new tooling supporting the Jamstack approach. RedwoodsJS is one of the new shining stars, its team believes that JAMstack is a huge leap forward in web development and they are doing their best to make it even more pleasant to work with.</p>
<h2>RedwoodJS</h2>
<p>Redwood is an open-source project initiated by <strong>Tom Preston-Werner, the co-founder of GitHub &amp; creator of Jekyll</strong> - one of the first static site generators. So what is Redwood?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Imagine a React frontend, statically delivered by CDN, that talks via GraphQL to your backend running on AWS Lambdas around the world, all deployable with just a git push—that’s Redwood.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>RedwoodJS is a highly opinionated, full-stack, serverless web application framework that aims to make building and deploying JAMstack apps as easy as possible. </p>
<h2>The stack</h2>
<p>RedwoodJS uses some of the most popular cutting-edge technologies and by giving up the freedom of choosing your tech stack, you are gaining a significant reduction of the level of complexity of setting up all services to make your infrastructure work as intended:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frontend</strong> - this part is covered by React supported by Apollo and it has a lot of code generators involved which let you create everything i.e. routes, pages, cells (even with already pre-configured tests) out of the box.</li>
<li><strong>Backend</strong> - it’s becoming difficult to talk about cutting-edge technologies without putting GraphQL into the equation. Redwood uses Prisma for its GraphQL backend, enabling quick creation of backends with graphical interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong> - Redwood’s development team has support for several deployment targets on their roadmap with a top-priority to make deployment strategies in a way that makes it easy for additional targets to be added, as well as to make it easy to adjust to user’s own deployment strategy. Right now it offers out of the box deployment to Netlify and Vercel, with AWS and Google Cloud Run high on their road map.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Concepts &amp; features</h2>
<p>Redwood features a lot of new interesting concepts as well as brings a breath of fresh air to well-known ones. One of the most interesting ones are definitely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cells</strong> - they are one of the signature modes of abstraction in Redwood. Cells represent a declarative approach to data fetching which creates space (by providing conventions around data fetching) in between the request and the response which Redwood can utilize to perform its optimizations. All of this without writing a line of imperative code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not a 1.0 version</h2>
<p>RedwoodJS software has not reached a stable version 1.0 yet.
Its team put Redwood in the later stages of the “make it work” phase in the “make it work; make it right; make it fast” paradigm. Although this makes it not suitable for production use, Redwood is a concept that is definitely worth following.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

As you can see I have this blog: <a href="https://paulie.dev/">https://paulie.dev</a> and a commercial portfolio: <a href="https://www.pauliescanlon.io/">https://www.pauliescanlon.io</a></p><p>Both sites are built on top of my Gatsby theme: <a href="https://gatsby-theme-terminal.netlify.app/">gatsby-theme-terminal</a> which is Open source and can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-theme-terminal">GitHub</a></p><p>Using a Gatsby Theme solves one of my issues as I'm able to have two sites that look and work pretty much the same way and any changes I make to the theme are inherited by both my sites. It's kind of like managing your own multi brand design system, but just for yourself.</p><p>There was one other problem though. 🤔</p><p>I wanted both sites to have the same "intro" section, but every time I made a change to one I had to make the same change to the other site to ensure they were both displaying the same intro text.</p><p>This might be fine if I weren't a developer but doing something twice is one time too many IMO.</p><p>It was also a little frustrating because I also wanted my Twitter profile description to be in sync with both the sites so, again another place to remember to update my personal blurb.</p><p>One option I considered would have been to hook up a Content Management System, and this would have been fine and it would have kept both my sites in sync but it wouldn't have been able to update my Twitter profile blurb...</p><p>So, I've decided to reverse engineer the Twitter API and use that as a CMS to populate both my sites. The idea is quite simple. I'll use the Twitter profile description as though it were a field from a CMS. Naturally any changes I make to this will appear on my Twitter profile and below is how I pull that same info into both of my sites.</p><h2>Demo</h2><p>Here's what I'll be showing you how to build:</p><ul><li>App / API <a href="https://gatsby-netlify-twitter.netlify.app/">https://gatsby-netlify-twitter.netlify.app</a></li><li>GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-twitter">https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-netlify-twitter</a></li></ul><p>... but the actual API I use for my blog and site is here: <a href="https://paulie-api.netlify.app/">https://paulie-api.netlify.app</a></p><h2>Tech</h2><h3>Netlify Functions</h3><p>"Power your site without managing servers" is how Netlify describe Functions and for all intents and purposes thats exactly what they are. Similar to how you might create an <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> app and deploy it somewhere but without the hassle of having to setup server side environments and more crucially any really dweeby server uptime monitoring.</p><h3>Twitter API v2</h3><p>A set of endpoints that can be used to get data from Twitter. Any Twitter requests must be done server side and use a set of keys and tokens. You can't unfortunately hit the Twitter API from the browser so we need a "server" or as mentioned above, a Netlify Function</p><p>Using both of the above i've made my own API endpoint which goes off and hits the Twitter API and returns my Profile information which I can then display in the intro section of my blog and site. I've deployed this API to Netlify and it's completely de-coupled from either of my sites but will return data which can be fetched from client side "fetch" request from within my site and blog. That url again is here: <a href="https://paulie-api.netlify.app/">https://paulie-api.netlify.app</a></p><h2>Before we start</h2><p>Before we get started there's a couple of things you'll need to have in place.</p><h3>Twitter API v2</h3><p>Apply for access to the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api">Twitter API</a>.

                    <p>Game design is such a wide and varied discipline that job titles in the field have become increasingly granular over the years – and ever since we started working on our debut title Lacuna, I've become more and more convinced that "detective game designer" merits its own denomination as well. Detective gameplay (or "investigation gameplay") poses a number of unique challenges centered around two main problems: the <strong>struggle between story and puzzles</strong> (or "cases") as well as <strong>communication between the player and the game</strong>.</p>
<p>Since some of the explanations will be using our own game as an example, let me give you a quick rundown: Lacuna is a story-driven adventure with platformer controls and investigation elements. Its four fundamental gameplay types are dialogs (with choices), moving around, examining objects, and solving puzzles. All of them are staples of the point &amp; click genre, but their execution is quite unique; I don't want to go into more detail here because it's not pertinent to the topic, but you can <a href="http://lacuna.game/">check out the game on Steam</a> if you want to know more.</p>
<p><img alt="Gameplay" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/gameplay-movement.gif"><br>
<em>This is what the game looks like</em></p>
<h2>Story vs. puzzles</h2>
<p>A handful of abstract game design principles lie at Lacuna's core. For instance, "no takebacks" dictates that the player only get one shot at every decision, dialog, and puzzle. The game auto-saves and doesn't allow you to go back if you performed poorly or regret an earlier decision. There's also "limited feedback", which means that the player often isn't told immediately whether a solution was correct and what the consequences of their actions and decisions will be.</p>
<p>However, there's one in particular I want to highlight here because it concerns the above mentioned divide between story and puzzling in detective games: <strong>No getting stuck.</strong></p>
<p>The thought process behind it was simple: In games with both a story and puzzles (e.g. most P&amp;C games), story progress is almost always tied directly to puzzle progress. Until you solve the puzzle at hand, you don't get to see the next part of the story. For some players, especially those most interested in the story, this can become a problem. If they're stuck for too long, there's a chance they'll just drop out and never pick the game up again. Even if that doesn't happen, hard puzzles always run the risk of messing up the story's pacing and interrupting your immersion in the game – because you're becoming frustrated or, even worse, because you decide to tab out and Google the solution. To avoid people getting stuck, we considered a number of solutions:</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1: Make the puzzles very easy?</strong><br>
This isn't our favorite since it somewhat defeats the purpose of puzzles. They'd still play a role as a change of pace now and then, but if puzzles aren't a little hard, nobody will feel like a detective solving them. Some early puzzles in Lacuna are easy, but most aren't.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2: Provide hints?</strong><br>
Hint systems can be found in many adventures featuring puzzles. Unfortunately, they often take the player out of the experience in one of three ways: In some cases, the hint is provided by extradiegetic UI (e.g. in the pause menu) and therefore seems to come out of nowhere in the game world. In other cases, the player character is the one giving the hint, disconnecting the player from their avatar’s perspective. The third option of NPCs providing hints is a little better; however, it is often hard to justify <em>why</em> an NPC would be able to point the player in the right direction without possessing the rest of the solution to the ongoing puzzle (and why they didn't volunteer it in the first place). The two types of (sort-of) hint systems we went with in Lacuna are <em>Highlight Mode</em>, which displays optional outlines around objects and NPCs that hold new information, and <em>redundant information</em>, meaning that sometimes the player is given two ways of obtaining an important clue.</p>
<p><img alt="Hints" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-hints.png"><br>
<em>"YOU ARE PLAYING A GAME RIGHT NOW"</em></p>
<p><strong>Solution 3: Decouple story progress from puzzle progress?</strong><br>
Why not simply make a story-driven game throughout which the player can solve the occasional puzzle if they feel like it? Well, because it would require that puzzles be somewhat detached from the story. As a result, they run the risk of feeling meaningless since solving them is not rewarding and failing is not punishing. However, this <em>can</em> work quite well when combined with...</p>
<p><strong>Solution 4: Make branching content for different solutions?</strong><br>
Instead of impeding the player’s progress, wrong or missing puzzle solutions could lead to a less desirable continuation and/or outcome of the story. Unfortunately, creating a new story branch for each and every wrong solution to a puzzle is hardly feasible. However, there are less extreme ways of realizing this. For instance, the game could account for the player’s <em>overall</em> puzzling performance at certain points in the game, e.g. trigger the “good” finale to an act if they got more than x% of the puzzles right, and the “bad” one if not. There could also be cascading consequences of sorts, e.g. solving one case correctly may give the player an edge in a later one. These approaches have similar downsides as optional puzzles do, but to a lesser degree; puzzle success no longer being required for progress makes them feel more detached from the story and removes immediate feedback. Regardless, we have found this to be the best solution, which is why we employ it quite a bit in Lacuna (while trying to avoid all the pitfalls). By the way, if all of this is becoming too abstract for you, bear with us! The second half of this post is all about a real example from the game.</p>
<p><img alt="Detroit: Become Human" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-branching-content.jpg"><br>
<em>Detroit: Become Human offers an astonishing number of different outcomes depending on player action, but not everybody has that kind of money to burn</em></p>
<p>Despite all of these measures being taken to make sure that the player won't get stuck, Lacuna can still be called a hard game. While it's not difficult to get <em>to</em> the end, it's pretty difficult to get a <em>good</em> ending and not mess things up on your way there. In other words, rushing through the whole story is possible if you don't mind bringing it to a terrible conclusion.</p>
<h2>Communicating with the game</h2>
<p>While the previous chapter only concerns detective games that also prominently feature a story, this next one is relevant to pretty much every detective game every made. It addresses the topic of communication between the player and the game, and especially how the player can express their thoughts to it. Several principles have proven to make for a good experience across countless approaches to this problem over the years:</p>
<p><strong>Principle 1: Many channels out, few channels back in.</strong><br>
If the game conveys information to the player on many different channels and in many different ways, the process of piecing the solution together tends to feel more interesting and rewarding. In Lacuna, the player picks up clues from dialogs, objects, environments, the news, and e-mails (with all sorts of attachments). At the same time, the channels via which the player communicates that solution back to the game are kept to a minimum, namely cloze texts we like to call "Case Sheets" and (to a lesser degree) dialog choices. Having one or two central mechanics for player input makes the experience more coherent and transparent and facilitates designing the mysteries around it.</p>

<em>Return of the Obra Dinn by Lucas Pope provides a bunch of different sources of information, but just one central mechanic for the player to communicate back to the game</em></p>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Have the player communicate only the solution.</strong><br>
It is near impossible to create a system through which the player communicates to the game <em>how</em> they arrived at a solution. Luckily, this is not necessary. A well-designed puzzle provides all the information, then moves the entire solution process solely <em>into the player’s head</em>, and finally prompts the player to input only their answer. The player’s objective should be stated clearly, but in a very general way at the start of a case (e.g. “find the culprit”).</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3: Give the player maximum freedom in communicating the solution.</strong><br>
The way in which the player communicates the answer to the game is the most crucial part to get right. One aspect is to give the player many choices (or a large combination of choices) to pick from. Two things should be avoided: 1. Giving the player a high probability to succeed by picking a random answer. 2. Making it easy for the player to guess correctly because only one or a few of the available answers appear plausible. An example for a bad solution like this would be to give the player three dialog choices to solve the puzzle; even worse would be if one of them obviously made the most sense. A better approach would be to give the player a cloze text with a bunch of plausible options for each gap. Another possibility is to have the solution be an unguessable string of characters that the player needs to enter manually. Both ideas utilize combinatorial explosion to make guessing and brute-forcing nearly impossible.</p>

<em>Good luck brute-forcing your way through Detective Grimoire's cloze texts</em></p>
<h2>Puzzle example</h2>
<p>Hopefullly all this will become crystal clear when put to concrete use! The following is an early level in Lacuna. It doesn't contain some of the difficulties added later (like a large number of channels communicating potential evidence). In harder cases, the player will need to have paid attention to testimonies, news articles etc. from earlier levels to arrive at the correct conclusion, and some cases span multiple levels. Not this one, though; all the information required to solve it is directly contained in the clues and dialogs of the one level where it starts and ends.</p>
<p>This chapter won't reveal much of importance about the story, but it will spoil the solution to this one puzzle, so consider yourself warned.</p>

<p>Exactly-once is a desirable (if not critical) message delivery guarantee and a remarkably complex engineering challenge to solve. In this blog post, we will look at what exactly-once means in the context of distributed pub/sub systems, and the exactly-once guarantees that the <a href="https://www.ably.io/">Ably</a> realtime pub/sub messaging platform provides. Ably often acts as the broker in data streaming pipelines: publishers send messages to our platform, and we deliver these messages to subscribers. As a broker, Ably provides regional &amp; global fault tolerance, which ensures message availability and survivability. We also offer a set of capabilities via SDKs that enable clients to use idempotent publishing, and recover in the event of a failure while resuming precisely where they left off, with no lost or duplicate messages.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/11/4-pillars-exactly-once-semantics-cover.png"></figure><h2 id="exactly-once-delivery-is-one-of-the-hardest-engineering-challenges">Exactly-once delivery is one of the hardest engineering challenges<br>
</h2>
<p>In the context of distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems, exactly-once is a popular concept and a desirable, if not critical, system property. It also leads to confusion and diverging opinions within the development community. On the one hand, some argue that <a href="https://bravenewgeek.com/you-cannot-have-exactly-once-delivery/">exactly-once is simply unachievable.</a> On the other hand, there are systems such as <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics">Kafka that claim to support exactly-once semantics</a>. </p>
<p>We believe that a lot of the confusion around the concept has to do with the fact that there's no clear definition of what exactly-once actually means. It's arguably impossible to come up with a definition to satisfy everyone and every use case. That's because exactly-once can mean different things for different systems and different use cases. Regardless of how you look at it, though, exactly-once is, without a doubt, a distinctively complex engineering challenge. </p>
<p>Let’s now define what exactly-once means for Ably in particular. In our case, exactly-once is a guarantee that once acknowledged, a message published to Ably is <strong>delivered</strong> to a consumer precisely once, even in the context of individual system components failing. Note that most often, Ably is used to deliver messages in real time directly to end-user devices.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to mention that exactly-once is a system-wide property, and you only achieve it if all the constituent components play their part. This doesn’t mean that all the components must display exactly-once characteristics. For example, in our case, you can have a publisher that displays at-least-once behaviour. However, Ably provides an idempotent interface, which cancels out the fact that the producer may occasionally publish messages more than once. As long as at the other end of the pub/sub pipeline each message is delivered to subscribers precisely once, exactly-once behaviour is achieved as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-messaging-semantics">Types of messaging semantics<br>
</h3>
<p>Before we dive deeper into exactly-once delivery, let’s review the main types of messaging semantics. When a system is fully operational and working as intended, exactly-once delivery is the behaviour you generally expect. However, we must also consider how faults in the pub/sub system or, indeed, clients affect this behaviour. While most components fail independently in a distributed pub/sub system, without directly impacting other components, the overall quality of service can be affected. Depending on how the system behaves when failures do occur, you get several different types of messaging semantics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>At-most-once semantics</strong>. The easiest type of semantics to achieve, from an engineering complexity perspective, since it can be done in a fire-and-forget way. There's rarely any need for the components of the system to be stateful. While it's the easiest to achieve, at-most-once is also the least desirable type of messaging semantics. It provides no absolute message delivery guarantees since each message is delivered once (best case scenario) or not at all.</li>
<li>
<strong>At-least-once semantics. </strong>This is an improvement on at-most-once semantics. There might be multiple attempts at delivering a message, so at least one attempt is successful. In other words, there's a chance messages may be duplicated, but they can't be lost. While not ideal as a system-wide characteristic, at-least-once semantics are good enough for use cases where duplication of data is of little concern, or scenarios where deduplication is possible on the consumer side.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exactly-once semantics</strong>. The ultimate message delivery guarantee and the optimal choice in terms of data integrity. As its name suggests, exactly-once semantics means that each message is delivered precisely once. The message can neither be lost nor delivered twice (or more times). Exactly-once is by far the most dependable message delivery guarantee. It’s also the hardest to achieve.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/11/exactly-once-semantics-messaging-semantics-overview.gif" alt="Overview of message delivery semantics: at-most-once delivery, at-least-once delivery, exactly-once delivery."><figcaption>High-level overview of message delivery semantics</figcaption></figure><p>What most distributed pub/sub systems can genuinely guarantee is <strong>mostly-once </strong>delivery. This means that when the system is functioning as intended, messages are delivered exactly once. However, when failures are involved, there’s always a chance some messages will be delivered either at-most-once or at-least-once.</p>
<h3 id="failures-that-prevent-exactly-once-delivery">Failures that prevent exactly-once delivery<br>
</h3>
<p>To demonstrate just how hard it is for distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems to achieve exactly-once semantics, we must talk about failures—specifically, components that can fail and how these failures can be mitigated.<br></p>
<p><strong>Publisher failure</strong></p>
<p>When a publisher fails, some sort of recovery process takes place. Depending on its design, after recovery, the publisher may reattempt to publish a message that has already been sent to and acknowledged by the broker. In such an event, the publisher failure causes at-least-once behaviour. Another scenario is that the publisher’s recovery procedure fails to realise that the publish attempt failed, which leads to at-most-once behaviour. </p>
<p>A strategy often used after a publish failure is to retry publishing the same message a fixed number of times. This is a pragmatic approach, but unsatisfactory in the context of exactly-once. Imagine that the publisher recovers and unsuccessfully tries to republish the same message five times, and then gives up. Practically none of the three semantics is achieved. To mitigate publisher failures Ably supports <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/idempotency">idempotent publishing</a>, which ensures that regardless of how many times the same message is published to Ably, it will be delivered to subscribers exactly-once. <br></p>
<p><strong>Broker failure</strong></p>
<p>A broker failure has the potential to lead to all sorts of issues, including data loss. That’s why it’s recommended to design your system around the idea of mitigating or preventing loss of data. From a producer perspective, this could mean having the ability to publish messages at-least-once, so they can be resent to the broker if needed. </p>
<p>From a broker perspective (Ably included), let’s start by reviewing what a message ACK means. Obviously, it’s an acknowledgment that a published message has been received. Additionally, it should also imply that no subsequent failure will result in that message not being delivered to subscribers. In other words, it should be an acknowledgment that the broker provides sufficient redundancy to ensure continuity of service and onwards processing, even in the context of multiple infrastructure failures. Of course, nothing can be done to prevent or mitigate certain types of critical failures. When that happens, the sensible thing for the broker to do is to respond with a failure response (with HTTP, this is typically a 5xx status code), indicating clearly to the producer that the publish attempt was unsuccessful. </p>
<p><strong>Subscriber failure</strong></p>
<p>The most common subscriber failure that prevents exactly-once delivery involves short disconnections. For example, a client app on a mobile device will disconnect and quickly reconnect when the user switches from a mobile data network to a Wi-Fi network or goes through a tunnel. To counter this scenario and ensure exactly-once behaviour, the stream of messages must resume precisely where it left off when the subscriber recovers. For this to be possible, the connection state must be persisted and resynced when the subscriber reconnects.</p>
<p>If the broker is the one keeping track of the last message sent, you are unlikely to provide exactly-once semantics. That’s because a broker might send a message, and the subscriber might successfully receive it and then disconnect before sending an ACK to the broker. In such a case, once the subscriber reconnects, the broker will resend the respective message (at-least-once semantics) since it has no way of knowing that the subscriber had received it before disconnecting.</p>
<p>To ensure exactly-once behaviour, the responsibility of keeping track of the last message received should sit with the subscriber - something we also do at Ably, via serial numbers. This way, when the subscriber reconnects, it notifies the broker of the last message it has received so that the stream can be accurately resumed from a point in time.</p>

<p>In the world of distributed pub/sub systems, exactly-once semantics has been and continues to be extremely hard to achieve. Equally, almost everywhere you look in software development, exactly-once is a highly desirable system-wide property, if not an essential one. For example, exactly-once is crucial for most transactional messaging use cases. At its core, a transactional message is triggered by a consumer action, and it usually includes necessary or high-priority info, e.g., a bank balance inquiry or an order confirmation. </p>
<p>Ordered operations represent another use case where exactly-once is fundamental. Let’s say you want to use <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/message-delta-compression/">delta compression</a> to only stream changes from the previous message to subscribers each time there’s an update. To achieve this, you need to use a transport that ensures data integrity through guaranteed message ordering and exactly-once semantics.</p>
<p>If not crucial, exactly-once is at least highly desirable, because it improves overall system predictability and provides better experiences to users in general. For example, …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>Halbert W. Hall Speaker’s Series on Science Fiction and Fantasy,&nbsp;Texas A&amp;M University</p>
<p>February 2, 2018</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vZQXkxJ9FVwCmhHZTBGkuxMHGF8hoWK_">Full Audio</a></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Thank you so much to Texas A&amp;M for hosting me, and especially to the Science Fiction Archivist, Jeremy Brett, who invited me and orchestrated everything. He’s been a supporter of my work for years, and I’m so delighted to finally meet him, and to have the chance to address all of you. I’d also like to thank TAMU Libraries, the Glasscock Center for Humanities Research and its Science Fiction Studies Working Group, the Department of English, the Department of International Studies, and the Department of Visualization. I’m so honored by such an intersectional effort to bring me here. So thank you.</p>
<p>As Jeremy said, I write a lot of things, but when people ask me what I am, the first thing I say is that I’m a science fiction writer. I gave Jeremy a name for this talk before I wrote any of it, because I was still finishing my next novel. It’s called <em>The Actual Star. </em>It’s taken me six years to write. My agent is reading it as we speak. It jumps back and forth from the distant past, during the collapse of ancient Maya civilization; to the present, specifically the year 2012; to the far future, when a new global religion has brought lasting peace to humankind. So I spent a lot of the past year in the year 3012, in my head, imagining what the world will look like a thousand years from now. I want to talk to you about it because, like all science fiction, even though it’s set in the future, it’s a response to our present moment. My talk is called “Instructions for the Age of Emergency,” which is the time period we’re living in right now. In the far future, there are entire fields of study devoted to it, and to the people who lived in it, and what we must have been thinking.</p>
<p>During the last year, I locked myself out of social media for months at a time. I had to concentrate on work and, to be honest, protect my mental health after the election. I only read <em>The Washington Post</em> on my phone in bed in the morning—I still do—and that was enough. Everything I read, I asked myself, “How did we get here? What are the root causes? How can things be different?” And then I would try to answer those questions in the day’s writing.</p>
<p>The possibility I wanted to explore is that things didn’t start going astray after 9/11, or because of Nixon, or with the Industrial Revolution, or even with the invention of race that enabled the Native American genocide and the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. I wanted to explore the possibility that humanity lost its way in the Neolithic Era. We regard the Neolithic as the beginning of history, and if we mean written history, maybe. But humans lived for two hundred thousand years before that—before the fall of Troy, before permanent settlements, before the invention of surplus and property and money and agriculture. All of that is only about twelve thousand years old, or, 6% of our history. The fact that we don’t have newspapers from the other 94% of our history doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. It also doesn’t make it any less important when thinking about the range of human possibility, and the range of possible human futures.</p>
<p>Much of science fiction deals with imagining dystopia. I’ll talk about why that is later, but I strongly believe that, at this moment in time, we need to remember that one of the highest callings of science fiction is imagining utopia. I don’t mean starry-eyed visions of a fairyland that drops out of the sky. I also don’t mean a static society built on some fundamental irony like panopticon or the suppression of free will. I mean honest, earnest engagement with the question of what a better world looks like.</p>
<p>In the <em>Earthseed </em>trilogy, Octavia Butler’s characters go through hell in their struggle to establish a utopian community. In the <em>Mars </em>trilogy, Kim Stanley Robinson’s characters go through several revolutions and constitutions in building a better world than the one they came from (Earth). Ursula K. Le Guin—who died while I was composing this talk—is the leader of us all in this regard. Her work engages the idea of realistic utopia over and over again—through Hain, Anarres, Gethen, Earthsea, and of course, Omelas.</p>
<p>My novel <em>The Actual Star </em>is an attempt to work in that same tradition. The distant past—the collapse of Maya civilization—takes place amid the failure of monarchy. The present—our age, the “Age of Emergency”—takes place amid the failure of capitalism. So, what does the year 3012 look like? I’ll first describe it, and then describe how I got there, extrapolating from this moment in time.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>In 3012, the world operates by the twin philosophy of accumulation and dispersion. Put as simply as possible, The Law of Accumulation states that accumulation of any human property ultimately leads to human suffering. For example, accumulation of capital leads to inequality. Accumulation of family ties leads to feuds. Accumulation of feuds leads to war. Accumulation of population leads to disease. Accumulation of territory and power leads to war. Not necessarily at first, or even for centuries—but eventually, always.</p>
<p>The antidote is the Law of Dispersion. Put as simply as possible, it states that lasting peace can only result from the constant temporal and spatial dispersion of all human properties. In other words, we build a society that flows with, not against, the entropic nature of the universe.</p>
<p>In 3012, there are no borders. There are no nations. There are no families, aside from the human family. We call every other person “carnala,” a Mexican Spanish term meaning “a blood relation.” The average life expectancy is 130 years. The world population is steady at one billion. We roam the earth as permanent nomads, and, by common agreement, only own as much as we can carry—this is why the system is called Laviaja, a feminized form of “El Viaje,” Spanish for “the journey.” Those of us who cannot move or walk are accommodated so radically by mutual aid, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality that the very concept of disability no longer exists. In fact, many of us <em>choose </em>to have what we think of as disabilities, and call them “gifts,” because they are ways of creating community.</p>
<p>We eat primarily by foraging, a practice now aided by advanced artificial intelligence and augmented reality. No one eats animals, since we began learning their languages. Where there isn’t much to be foraged, our photosynthetic skin takes over. When we want home-cooked food, we go to a wayhouse. Wayhouses are places where we can rest for up to a period of nine days, in exchange for a few hours of work a day. We gather for two daily meals plus, in many areas of the world, teatime. Agribots—farming robots—do the majority of farming and gardening, strictly on a subsistence basis, near wayhouses. In other words, no one goes hungry. Food security is simply not an issue. This is because, at a certain point, around the 23<sup>rd</sup> century, all technology was built to serve humankind, not profit.</p>
<p>None of us stay in the same place for more than nine days. None of us even stay with the same people for more than nine days. But whomever we lose, we regain. With whomever we meet on the road, we fall into any number of familiar roles—sister and sister, lover and lover, mother and child, aunt and niece, elder and youth—and one of the greatest joys of life is that dance of discovery, of what each new person is to the other. If we give birth, we gladly give up our baby within nine days; assured that our child will come back to us again and again in the form of other children, throughout our lives.</p>
<p>There is no space travel, since space programs were dependent on capitalism. There are aliens, but they’re so far away that we have to wait a few hundred years every time we want to say anything, so it doesn’t affect our lives very much. There are no weapons; the very idea is strange. Crime is very rare; when it does happen, in the worst cases, the crime is made public and the perpetrator is marked for others to see and avoid if they wish, but the criminal is still allowed free movement in the world. Their exile is social.</p>
<p>There’s no currency or system of money; there’s a worldwide, perpetual gift exchange. Objects have no value beyond their practical use; a plastic bowl is as good as a porcelain bowl. There’s no manufacturing because there’s no need for material goods. Everything is used on a recycled basis.</p>
<p>There are approximately fifteen hundred genders. Anyone who wants to bear a child can do so. No pregnancy is unplanned. There’s no correlation between genitalia and gender. Some of the genders are in fact the descendants of nationalist and ethnic identities, as there have long ceased to be nations or ethnic groups in any meaningful way, given the Law of Dispersion. Identity is completely voluntary and mutable.</p>
<p>The system of government, such as it is, is a worldwide sortition democracy, which is actually a very old form of democracy. A legislature is randomly selected from a pool of all available citizens, from the age of seven years old. This legislature is in session twenty-four hours a day, its members refreshed every hour, on the hour, mostly just to re-ratify a basic Bill of Rights, but also to take up whatever special questions apply on the global scale. As a citizen, you’re called to serve for about one hour every year or two. For local matters, moving clusters of people are governed by algorithms called “umbrellas” that take into account each person’s needs and preferences. An umbrella may govern a single wayhouse, or an area of a hundred square kilometers, depending on the number of people present, which is always changing.</p>
<p>A person can opt out of this system. They aren’t punished. They aren’t banned. They’re never refused food or shelter, care or companionship, wherever they go. The highest law is the rule of the road, which is radical …</p></div></div>

	<h3>Facebook is facing a new wave of criticism for providing a platform for a white supremacist network with over 80,000 online followers.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Facebook only removed these pages after being contacted by large media organisation the <em>Observer</em>. The Center for Countering Digital Hate claim they were made aware of this two years ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Guardian reports this Neo-Nazi network also has ties to the UK far right, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/22/facebook-condemned-for-hosting-neo-nazi-network-with-uk-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including a student facing terrorism charges</a>. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;“Facebook’s leadership endangered public safety by letting Neo-Nazis finance their activities through Facebook and Instagram. Facebook was first told about this problem two years ago and failed to act.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the <em>Observer</em> contacted Facebook, they began taking down the material with a Facebook spokesperson stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have removed the content which violates our policies prohibiting dangerous organisations. We regularly work to improve our technology to find and remove this content faster, and, while there is more work to do, we are making progress. We’ve banned over 250 white supremacist organisations from Facebook and Instagram.”</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>On our first set of data structures, we get into the definition and scope of non-primitive structures. Have a look at the previous read on  <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/the-power-of-data-structures">The Power of Data structures</a> in case you feel a little lost. Right off the batt, we define what it means to be a non-primitive set, and how this can be further broken down.</p>
<p>Let's get right into it. A non-primitive structure is what happens when you combine two or more primitives. What we mean is simple. A <code>char</code> and  <code>int</code> , for instance,  are primitives. The simplest representations of data. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, linear non-primitives can be grouped further as below:</p>
<h2 id="linear-non-primitives">Linear non-primitives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stacks</li>
<li>Queues</li>
<li>LInked lists</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, as stated before, data is sequential - one after another. Some of these structures might <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/memory-management-deep-and-shallow-copying">ring a bell</a>, stackify, is that you?. </p>
<h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>
<p>These are what we call stores of homogenous (meaning similar) data. So one might have an array like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>my_array</span> = [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>5</span>,<span>6</span>,<span>7</span>,<span>8</span>,<span>9</span>] 

<span>vowels</span> = [<span>' a'</span>, <span>'e'</span>, <span>'i'</span> , <span>'o'</span>, <span>'u'</span> ] 
</code></pre><p>Note how <code>my_array</code> has only integers while <em>vowels</em> has <em>char</em>. In both instances, our array has a collection of primitives - <strong>one type of primitive per array</strong>. </p>
<p>Arrays are of a fixed size. Once declared, the computer knows the amount of memory reserved for items to be stored there.  You might ask:</p>
<p><em>"But what if the type of data I have changes in size greater than the array?" </em></p>
<p>Well, you might need to consider a different type of structure to store this data. 
Use arrays, for instance, to store months of the year. We will not be changing this count anytime.</p>
<p>Above declared, the sizes of the arrays are inferred. Meaning the types, since not defined per se, are  'figured out' based on the values and how we use them.</p>
<p>We might as well have this:</p>
<p>For python.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>import</span> array

count_down = array.array(<span>'i'</span>, [<span>5</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>1</span>])


</code></pre>
<p>Types may go on as:</p>
<p><code>c</code> for <em>char</em>
<code>f</code> for <em>float</em>
<code>d</code> for <em>double</em>
<code>u</code> for <em>unicode</em> and so forth.</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html?highlight=arrays">documentation</a> for more insight into this. AS well, take note that the <code>array module</code> has different functions to enable array manipulation.</p>
<p>Rust:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> count_down: [<span>i32</span>; <span>5</span>] = [<span>5</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>1</span>];


</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Important pointer:
    Python lists and arrays are not the same!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Operations on an array will be based on the <code>index</code> of the array element, with indexing starting from <em>0</em>. Hence, the first item, in either case, would be:</p>
<pre><code><span>count_down</span><span>[0]</span>
</code></pre><p>The result from the above is 5 (the semi-colon has been left out for brevity but should be used based on the language you are using).</p>
<p>Let's take a look at another structure that looks similar, but is not the same - <strong>Linked lists</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="linked-lists">Linked lists</h3>
<p>Unlike arrays, linked lists store data in a non-contiguous form. This implies one piece of data is not placed side by side to the other as: <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code>, rather it is stored in form of nodes with pointers to the next as so:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>[data1, pointer_to_data2]</span> ...  <span>[data1, pointer_to_data3]</span> ... <span>and</span> <span>so</span> <span>on</span>
</code></pre><p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605257211148/M0hJg9a9v.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="linked_list.png"></p>
<p>The last item in our linked list, since there is no pointer to the next, would have <code>null</code>. </p>
<p>As well, linked lists are dynamic-  their size is not fixed at initialization. </p>
<p>Linked lists will be further broken to:</p>
<p>a) Singular linked lists (used in the elaboration of linked lists above)</p>
<p>b) Circular linked lists</p>
<p>c) Doubly linked lists</p>
<h4 id="circular-linked-lists">Circular linked lists</h4>
<p>These have three items in a node: the previous data, the data, and finally, the next data in the sequence.</p>
<pre><code><span>[null, data1, pointer_to_data2]</span> ...  <span>[pointer_to_data_1 ,data1, pointer_to_data3]</span>
</code></pre><p>The first item (the head), has a <code>null</code> as the previous pointer while the last node has <code>null</code> on the next pointer.</p>
<h4 id="doubly-linked-lists">Doubly linked lists</h4>
<p>Similar to circular linked lists, these have two pointers as well. The only difference would be the last node, instead of a <code>null</code>, has a pointer back to the first item in the list. 1 + 1 = circular.</p>
<p>In most of what we implement through code, we have implementations of linked lists. You will hardly get yourself doing this manually, but understanding that some of the things we call 'mutable arrays ' are actually implementations or wrappers around more complex structures.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
If navigating through my directory, my computer needs to know where I am, where I'm from, and possibly have the correct link/structure to the nested directory I'm navigating to. So to the top-level directory, I cannot go any higher, no previous node. Likewise to the last directory or file, there is no 'next' option.</p>
<p>Till now, we have come to understand the importance of data structures, the groups they have been placed into, and we have an idea of what some of the linear data structures involved. We could go on and on on the details of each, but that is a tale for another day. A breather for us both at this point.  Go read something non-algorithm-like for a moment. We'll still meet here, same time,  same drive. </p>

	<div>
		<p>This is a piece about the loss of skills — even ones that are marks of great beauty and mastery — due to a change in environment.</p>
<p>It’s an extreme example but a fun one to think through: who would play a Stradivarius violin in interstellar space?</p>
<p>As a way to think through an extreme environmental (not meaning climate here) change, I make the assumption that in coming centuries, whether one, five, or 10, humans will become an interstellar or extrasolar species. That is, some part of humanity will cease living in this solar system, and will instead live on other planets, space ships, or other artificial homes. <strong>I count that assumption as the less interesting part of this post and instead focus on the unintended consequences caused by a dramatic change in environment.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s think through what happens to a specific type of human mastery (and by extension, a framework to apply to many others) as humans make extreme choices (like leaving earth).</p>
<p><em>Q: Who will play the Stradivarius in interstellar space or on extrasolar planets? A: No one. Longer answer below.</em> <span id="more-947"></span></p>
<p>Today, on earth, many people achieve mastery in some skill.</p>
<p>We can include “common” skills such as learning your native language to fluency and skills that are innate, like learning to walk. The rarer skills I consider here require more concerted effort to acquire.</p>
<p>Types of skills in demand are plentiful but change over time. Some skills used to be mainstream but are now niche or largely lost except in small isolated groups, such as navigation by stars, foraging, or making clothing from scratch. Bringing those skills back to an <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/acquiring-ignorance/">ignorant</a> larger population would not make sense today. Some skills are preserved by small niches of people within families or initiates (such as Chinese <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfGdJIzYZs">“face changing” or bian lian</a>). Some are preserved widely by those who opt in by putting in the work, such as chess, forms of painting and ceramics, and musical performance.</p>
<p><strong>For some of the skills with modern masters, leaving earth will mean that future humans will neither preserve those skills, nor be able to acquire them even if they wanted to.</strong></p>
<p>I chose music because it is an enduring human behavior, unlikely to disappear. I chose Stradivarius violins because they represent mastery in physical instrument construction and rarity.</p>
<p>With only 650 instruments remaining (around 500 violins) and <a href="http://www.stradivarius.org/price/">often sold</a> for prices in the millions, I make the assumption that people who typically play a Stradivarius violin are violin masters whether or not they own the instrument themselves.</p>
<p>Here are examples related to the acquisition and maintenance of skill mastery, as demonstrated on a Stradivarius. In interstellar space.</p>

<p>Acquiring mastery in an uncommon skill takes uncommon effort.</p>
<p>It takes so much effort that acquiring an uncommon skill often also requires family and economic support. A small percentage of those who play the violin will pursue the instrument for over a decade of focused study and practice to have a chance to attain a level of mastery.</p>
<p>Those future interstellar humans’ new environment may not allow for them to put in that uncommon effort. Or, just as dangerous, where today there is a community of masters to practice and play with, in the future interstellar state, there may be so few masters that a string quartet is never possible. Less humans to practice and play with is probably assured.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/The_Dark_Forest">ravine-like</a> global crash that eliminates all violin players, teachers, and even knowledge of classical music is a possibility. What happens when there is no place to which the players can escape, survive, and continue until the situation improves? The ravine impacts violinists regardless of location.</p>
<p>Without a continual string of teachers and students, mastery becomes mystery and impossible to acquire. With effort put on making humans interstellar, will there be energy left for mastery of the violin?</p>

<p>Life in interstellar environments may not allow people to maintain an extreme practice regimen or to build excellent finger dexterity. There’s just no excess capacity to do so. They could in theory acquire the skills but never have time or physical capability.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease">Baumol’s Cost Disease</a> explains why certain types of work become more expensive over time. “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151936/http://publishing.eur.nl/ir/repub/asset/782/TOWSE%20EBOOK_pages0103-0113.pdf">It takes four musicians as much playing time to perform a Beethoven string quartet today as it did in 1800</a>.” That’s without considering the amount of time to acquire mastery in playing the instruments.</p>
<p>In an interstellar society, while people may have excess free time, learning to play with mastery excludes people from other, more productive activities. Spending years to become a violinist has an opportunity cost that could be more extreme than today. Longer lifespans might shift that somewhat.</p>

<p>It’s possible that skill acquisition advances beyond current imagination make it possible for novices to become masters overnight. If that happens and future humans value violin mastery, then perhaps it is more likely to see violin masters in the future, whether in interstellar environments or earth.</p>

<p>It will certainly be possible to build a robot with equal or better manual dexterity to a human. So in the future, even if there is a ravine, perhaps the robots will be preferred as violinists and will play every Strad. Why risk the instruments in human hands?</p>

<p>Why listen to live performances if, at least for classical music, there are no masters around to play live or they are worse than high-quality immersive recordings (or robots)?</p>
<p>It’s possible that future violinists play mostly for themselves.</p>

<p>Music has a shelf life. It’s long for some genres and pieces and short for others. The status quo of the classical repertoire can only be preserved for so long.</p>

<p>Consider what happened to music in the 20th century. The development of good quality microphones and electronic effects led to many new forms of music including the broad types of rock, disco, and rap. Those musical genres were created in part when musicians learned how to apply new technology. The same thing will happen again, as musicians (human or otherwise) apply music technology in new ways.</p>
<p>It’s possible that classical music will no longer be all that good in comparison to future music. Classical music’s popularity has been falling for the past 100 years since the genre stopped being pop music.</p>

<p>It’s worth considering that the original Stradivarius violins will eventually be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/stradivarius-sound-bank-recording-cremona.html">too fragile to play</a>. Cremona, Italy (where Stradivari worked) has been recording at high-quality the sound of each potential note of its Stradivarius violins in order to preserve that sound for posterity. Can anyone really expect to play a 1,000 year old violin?</p>

<p>Future humans may prevent Stradivarius violins and many other other examples of earth’s artistic mastery from leaving earth. Then again, future humans may want a certain number of Strads to leave as a hedge against future destruction.</p>

<p>Humans are not objective in their appraisal of violins. A double-blind <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/21/5395">study of violinists</a> (they wore goggles) playing modern and Stradivarius violins challenges the belief that Stradivarius is the best. The Strads are often valued in the millions because of their history, and most would claim, their sound. But the overwhelming majority of the violinists in the experiment preferred the modern violins. This is not to say that humans should just accept a forced preference in violin. An argument for why Strads sound (or seem to sound) better has been made from a <a href="http://www.brandstoryonline.com/stradivarius-violins-better/">brand perspective</a>, of all things. It’s the same argument made for fine (expensive) art: that part of the value, maybe most of the value, comes from things that are not objective. Story and history have a big impact on value.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some skills will become impossible to acquire when humans make a large environmental change. These skills are not transferable across vastly different environments and are lost.</li>
<li>Skill loss happens all the time in human history, though certain events speed it up.</li>
<li>Some events make skill loss impossible to undo.</li>
<li>Future humans will deal with different unintended consequences if they build an interstellar society.</li>
<li>Can we build a set of rules to help us assess unintended consequences from dramatic environmental changes?</li>
</ul>

<p>When a company with millions of consumers such as DoorDash builds machine learning (ML) models, the amount of feature data can grow to billions of records with millions actively retrieved during model inference under low latency constraints. These challenges warrant a deeper look into selection and design of a feature store — the system responsible for storing and serving feature data. The decisions made here can prevent overrunning cost budgets, compromising runtime performance during model inference, and curbing model deployment velocity.</p>



<p>Features are the input variables fed to an ML model for inference. A feature store, simply put, is a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/key-value/">key-value store</a> that makes this feature data available to models in production. At DoorDash, our existing feature store was built on top of <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>, but had a lot of inefficiencies and came close to running out of capacity. We ran a full-fledged benchmark evaluation on five different key-value stores to compare their cost and performance metrics. Our benchmarking results indicated that Redis was the best option, so we decided to optimize our feature storage mechanism, tripling our cost reduction. Additionally, we also saw a 38% decrease in Redis latencies, helping to improve the runtime performance of serving models.</p>



<p>Below, we will explain the challenges posed in the task of operating a large scale feature store. Then, we will review how we were able to quickly identify Redis as the right key-value store for this task. We will then dive into the optimizations we did on Redis to triple its capacity, while also uplifting read performance by choosing a custom serialization scheme around strings, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/google/snappy">Snappy</a> compression algorithm.</p>



<h2>Requirements of a gigascale feature store</h2>



<p>The challenges of supporting a feature store that needs a large storage capacity and high read/write throughput are similar to the challenges of supporting any high-volume key-value store. Let’s elaborate upon the requirements before we discuss the challenges faced when meeting these requirements specifically with respect to a feature store.</p>



<h3>Persistent scalable storage: support billions of records</h3>



<p>The number of records in a feature store depends upon the number of entities involved and the number of ML use cases employed on these entities. At DoorDash, our ML practitioners work with millions of entities such as consumers, merchants, and food items. These entities are associated with features and used in many dozens of ML use cases such as <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/10/01/integrating-a-scoring-framework-into-a-prediction-service/">store ranking</a> and cart item recommendations. Even though there is an overlap in features used across these use cases, the total number of <em>feature-value</em> pairs exceeds billions.</p>



<p>Additionally, since feature data is used in model serving, it needs to be backed up to disk to enable recovery in the event of a storage system failure.</p>



<h3>High read throughput: serve millions of feature lookups per second</h3>



<p>A hit rate of millions of requests per second is a staggering requirement for any data storage system. The request rates on a feature store are directly driven by the number of predictions served by the corresponding system. At DoorDash, one of our high volume use cases, <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/10/01/integrating-a-scoring-framework-into-a-prediction-service/">store ranking</a>, makes more than one million predictions per second and uses dozens of features per prediction. Thus, our feature store needs to support tens of millions of reads per second.</p>



<h3>Fast batch writes: enable full data refresh in a nightly run</h3>



<p>Features need to be periodically refreshed to make use of the latest real world data. These writes can typically be done in batches to exploit batch write optimizations of a key-value store. At DoorDash, almost all of the features get updated every day, while real time features, such as “average delivery time for orders from a store in the past 20 minutes”, get updated uniformly throughout the day.</p>



<h2>Specific design challenges in building a feature store</h2>



<p>When designing a feature store to meet the scale expectations described above, we have to deal with complexities that are specific to a feature store. These complexities involve issues such as supporting batch random reads, storing multiple kinds of data types, and enabling low-latency serving.</p>



<h3>Batch random reads per request add to read complexity</h3>



<p>Feature stores need to offer batch lookup operations because a single prediction needs multiple features. All key-value stores support unit lookup operations such as Redis’s <a href="https://redis.io/commands/get">GET command</a>. However, batch lookups are not a standard especially when keys are in no particular sequence. For example, <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Apache Cassandra</a> doesn’t support batch random lookups.</p>



<h3>Heterogeneous data types require non-standardized optimizations</h3>



<p>Features can either be simple data types such as integers, floats, and strings, or compound types such as <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2018/04/02/personalized-store-feed-with-vector-embeddings/">vector embeddings</a> or lists. We use integers or strings for categorical features such as <em>order protocol,</em> for whether an order was received by merchants via email, text, or iPad. We use lists for features such as a <em>list of cuisines chosen by a customer in the past 4 weeks.</em> Each one of these data types needs to be individually treated for optimizing storage and performance efficiency.</p>



<h3>Low read latency but loose expectations on write latency</h3>



<p>A feature store needs to guarantee low-latency reads. Latency on feature stores is a part of model serving, and model serving latencies tend to be in the low milliseconds range. Thus, read latency has to be proportionately lower. Also, typically, writes and updates happen in the background and are much less frequent than reads. For DoorDash, when not doing the batch refresh, writes are only 0.1% of reads. Low-latency requirements on reads and loose expectations with writes gives a direction for building towards a read-heavy key-value store but one that is fast enough for large batch writes.</p>



<h2>Identifying the right key-value store by benchmarking key performance metrics&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The choice for an appropriate storage technology helps greatly in increasing the performance and reducing the costs of a feature store. Using Yahoo’s cloud serving benchmark tool, <a href="https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB">YCSB</a>, we were able to identify Redis as a key-value store option that best fit our needs.</p>



<h3>What we need from a benchmarking platform</h3>



<p>Before we lay out our benchmarking setup, it is worthwhile to emphasize key requirements of a benchmarking platform. The four major required capabilities of a benchmarking setup are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Data generation using preset distributions</li></ul>



<p>Using data generation is a faster and more robust approach to benchmarking than ingesting real data because it accounts for possible values that a system’s random variables can take and doesn’t require moving data around to seed a target database.</p>



<ul><li>Ability to simulate characteristic workloads</li></ul>



<p>The workload on a database can be defined by the rate of requests, nature of operations, and proportions of these operations. As long as we can guarantee the same fixed request rate across tests, we can enable a fair comparison between the different databases.</p>



<ul><li>Fine-grained performance reporting</li></ul>



<p>The suite should be able to capture performance with appropriate statistical measures such as averages, 95th percentile, and 99th percentiles.</p>



<ul><li>Reproduction of results on demand</li></ul>



<p>Without reproducibility, there is no benchmark, it’s merely a random simulated event. For this reason, any benchmark platform needs to be able to provide a consistent environment where the results can be reproduced when running the same test over and over.</p>



<h3>Using YCSB to do a rapid comparison of key-value stores</h3>



<p>YCSB is one of the best benchmarking tools out there for analysing key-value stores. So much so that it not only meets all of the needs we described above but also provides sample code to benchmark a vast number of key-value stores. This setup ensures we have a flexible playground for rapid comparisons. Below, we describe our approach of using YCSB to validate our selection of Redis as the best choice for a feature store. We will first describe our experiment setup and then report the results with our analysis.</p>



<h2>Experiment setup</h2>



<p>When setting up the benchmarking experiment, we need to start with the set of key-value stores that we believe can meet the large scale expectations reliably and have a good industry presence. Also, our experiment design is centered around Docker and aims to optimize the speed of iterations when benchmarking by removing infrastructure setup overheads.</p>



<h3>Candidate set of key-value stores</h3>



<p>The key-value stores that we experimented on in this article are listed in Table 1, below. <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">CockroachDB</a>, and <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> have a presence in the DoorDash infrastructure, while we selected <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDB</a> and <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/">YugabyteDB</a> based on market reports and our team’s prior experience with these databases. The intention was to compare Redis as an in-memory store with other disk-based key-value stores for our requirements.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Database name</strong></td><td><strong>Version</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cassandra</td><td>3.11.4</td></tr><tr><td>CockroachDB</td><td>20.1.5</td></tr><tr><td>Redis</td><td>3.2.10</td></tr><tr><td>ScyllaDB</td><td>4.1.7</td></tr><tr><td>YugabyteDB</td><td>2.3.1.0-b15</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption><em>Table 1.</em> We considered five<em> data stores for benchmarking, three that were in current use at DoorDash and two others that showed promise in external market reports.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Data schema</h3>



<p>For data storage, we chose following patterns:</p>



<ul><li>SQL/Cassandra</li></ul>



<pre><code lang="sql">CREATE TABLE table (key varchar primary key, value varchar)</code></pre>



<ul><li>Redis</li></ul>



<pre><code lang="bash">SET key-value
GET key</code></pre>

<p>Today I’m going to see if I can use a PC water cooling kit to make a water cooled Raspberry Pi 4. I’ve seen a couple of people try this on older model Pi’s, using reducers and adapters to get to a small cooling block onto the CPU, but I’m going to try and make an adapter to fit a larger 30mm cooling block onto a Pi 4.</p>



<p><span data-ez-name="the_diy_life_com-box-3"></span>Just to be clear, this is totally unnecessary and is more of a let’s do it because we can, not because we should type of project.  But we’ll have fun building it anyway, and hopefully it works well in the end!</p>



<p>Here’s a video of the build and the test, read on for the write-up:</p>

<p>I bought a kit that included a 120mm fan and a radiator, a 12V pump, a reservoir and some tubing. These kits are commonly available online for significantly less than the name brand components sold for high-end PCs, but it’s still quite expensive just to mess around with.</p>

<p>The kit also included a full size CPU cooling block. It looks quite cool (excuse the pun) but is way too big to try and fit onto the Pi, so I’m going to be using one of these smaller 30 x 30mm blocks which can accommodate a half-inch or 12mm tubing.</p>

<h2>Building The Water Cooled Raspberry Pi 4</h2>



<h3>Mounting The Cooling Block To The Pi</h3>



<p>I’m going to start out by making a bracket to hold the cooling block in place on the Pi over the CPU. </p>

<p>We’ll need a square section to locate the block and hold it down onto the CPU and then some legs off to the four mounting holes to hold it in place. I’ve tried to avoid covering the GPIO pins and the major components, the bracket will be quite high up, so won’t interfere with any of the surface mount components.</p>

<p>The cooling block can’t be mounted straight onto the CPU as the display connector is too high. We’ll need to put a spacer in between the CPU and cooling block to lift it above the display connector, with enough room for the tubes. </p>

<h2>Making The Cooling Circuit Stand</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve got our cooling block mounted onto our Pi, we can start working on mounting the rest of the cooling circuit. </p>

<p>Rather than just connecting all of the components together on a desk, I decided to design a stand to mount the water cooling components and Raspberry Pi, so that it looks more complete.</p>



<p>I’m going to use clear acrylic for the stand with some fluorescent green legs to match the cooling block bracket. The water cooling components should just bolt straight onto this sheet once it’s been cut out.</p>

<p>Again, I cut this stand out on my laser cutter from 3mm acrylic, this time clear.</p>



<p>Now that we’ve got our stand components made, lets start putting them together. </p>

<p>Next, I need to glue the Raspberry Pi stand components onto the main cooling water stand. I clamped the components in place and allowed the cement to cure for a couple of hours before trying to mount the Pi.</p>

<p>Once the glued had properly cured, I put two lengths of tubing onto the heat sink so that I didn’t have to try push them on in the tight space between the Pi and the pump, and then mounted the Pi onto the stand using four nylon M3 nuts on the bottom of the standoffs.</p>

<p>I then added the fittings and finished off the tubing.</p>



<p>One side of the cooling block goes to the pump and the other to the radiator. We also need a section of tube from the radiator to the top of the reservoir.</p>



<p>The last thing to do is to add a small acrylic block to the base of the pump to hold the weight of the pump and reservoir. The legs on the stand are not strong enough to support all of the cooling components and I didn’t want to make them bigger as I like the look of the thinner sections. You’ll also hardly notice the block under the pump if it’s clear.</p>

<p>Our water cooled Pi is now complete, we just need to fill it up with water or cooling liquid and try it out. The system took around 300ml of cooling liquid to fill.</p>



<h2>Testing The Water Cooled Raspberry Pi 4</h2>



<p>The fan and pump are actually quite quiet when running, the system is a lot quieter than some of the small case fans I’ve used on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Now let’s try and do a stress test on the water cooled Raspberry Pi to see how well this cooling system works.</p>



<h3>CPU Test At 1.5GHz</h3>



<p>With the CPU clock frequency set to the default 1.5Ghz, we start out with a temperature of around 28°C. This was in a room of around 25°C, so it was done with quite a warm ambient temperature. </p>

<p>There was a small spike initially where the temperature went up to 31°C but it stayed between 31°C and 33°C for the rest of the test and dropped off quickly when the test was stopped. </p>

<p>Here’s a graph of the CPU temperature for the duration of the test.</p>



<h3>CPU Test At 2.0GHz</h3>



<p>Now I’m going to try overclocking the Pi to test it at a higher CPU frequency. </p>

<p>Here’s a graph of the CPU temperature for the duration of the 2Ghz test.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The water cooling system on this Pi works really well at keeping the CPU cool. Even when overclocked to 2.0Ghz, the  Raspberry Pi 4’s CPU temperature never went above 40°C. I wasn’t able to test the Pi at the maximum 2.147Ghz as my Pi wouldn’t boot up at this frequency, probably due to under-voltage. I’ll try and get this fixed and do a test at the maximum frequency as well at some stage.</p>



<p>To get an idea of whether this is worthwhile, I’m going to be comparing this water cooling system to an <a href="https://www.the-diy-life.com/diy-raspberry-pi-4-desktop-case-with-oled-stats-display/">Ice Tower</a>, a standard acrylic case and fan and then just a Pi with a static heat sink on it in the next week or two. So make sure that you check back here, or subscribe to my Youtube channel and turn on notifications so that you don’t miss out on that.</p>
